An iris segmentation scheme based on bendlets,"Due to the effect of agents such as ambiance, transition channel, and other agents, images are polluted by noise during collection, transition, and compaction, leading to decrease image quality. Noise can decrease the accuracy of the next stages of image processing systems. Therefore, one of the vital stages in the novel processing systems is denoising. This article offers a novel image denoising approach using bendlets. Other multi-scale transformations (such as wavelets, curvelets, and shearlets) cannot recognize properties such as location, direction, and curvature of discontinuities well in piecewise stable images. To solve this problem, bendlets are suggested in this article. Bendlets differ from other multi-scale transformations in that an additional bending parameter is utilized for recognizing the curvature of discontinuities. Bendlets need a fewer number of coefficients to identify curvatures than other multi-scale transformations. Furthermore, they help to make the edges more obvious. The suggested approach is utilized on the UBIRIS.V2 database. It earns better accuracy and stability than other multi-scale transformations."
A sliding template-based approach for position-based whole slide microscopy image stitching for slightly unaligned stages,"The work in this study proposes to deal with microscope images with slightly misaligned stages. A sliding template-based method for position-based whole slide microscopy (WSM) image stitching is proposed to find the translational properties of the consecutive images. The mechanical stability of the stage is one of the major issues, along with flat field disturbances that make the image stitching process difficult. This calls for further research in the field of image stitching. The proposed method employs a sliding template (a small image) to find the translational offset with the adjacent images, which is fast enough to avoid the complicated feature detection and matching algorithms to measure the distances between the features of all the images. The results of the proposed work show comparably accurate stitching while being more resistant to mechanical instability as well as faster than other methods. For slightly misaligned stages, position-based WSM image stitching using a sliding template can be a viable solution."
YOLO glass: video-based smart object detection using squeeze and attention YOLO network,"Visually impairments or blindness people need guidance in order to avoid collision risks with outdoor obstacles. Recently, technology has been proving its presence in all aspects of human life, and new devices provide assistance to humans on a daily basis. However, due to real-time dynamics or a lack of specialized knowledge, object detection confronts a reliability difficulty. To overcome the challenge, YOLO Glass a Video-based Smart object detection model has been proposed for visually impaired person to navigate effectively in indoor and outdoor environments. Initially the captured video is converted into key frames and pre-processed using Correlation Fusion-based disparity approach. The pre-processed images were augmented to prevent overfitting of the trained model. The proposed method uses an obstacle detection system based on a Squeeze and Attendant Block YOLO Network model (SAB-YOLO). A proposed system assists visually impaired users in detecting multiple objects and their locations relative to their line of sight, and alerts them by providing audio messages via headphones. The system assists blind and visually impaired people in managing their daily tasks and navigating their surroundings. The experimental results show that the proposed system improves accuracy by 98.99%, proving that it can accurately identify objects. The detection accuracy of the proposed method is 5.15%, 7.15% and 9.7% better that existing YOLO v6, YOLO v5 and YOLO v3, respectively."
Oxidation and Hot Corrosion Studies of Laser Hybrid Welded IN617 and P91 Alloys,"The present investigation aimed to evaluate the effect of similar laser hybrid welds on the oxidation and hot corrosion behavior of IN 617 and P91 alloys. The oxidation studies were carried out on the base and welded IN617 and P91 alloys in air in the temperature range 600–800 °C for 100 h. At the same time, hot corrosion tests with or without synthetic coal ash coatings were conducted in a flue gas environment for 1000 h. The oxidation and hot corrosion kinetics revealed that the change in mass is lower for the base and welded IN 617 than the P91 alloys at all the exposure temperatures. The post-characterization of oxide scales formed on the surface of the base and welded alloys later to oxidation and hot corrosion, was done using XRD and SEM-EDS techniques. The oxide phase were identified as NiO and Cr2O3 on welded IN617 alloys at 600–700 °C and 800 °C, respectively, whereas as Fe2O3 and Fe2O3–Fe3O4 on welded P91 alloy at 700 °C and 800 °C, respectively. In the case of coal ash-coated samples, additional Al2O3 & SiO2 phases were identified for both base and welded IN 617 and P91 alloys. The non-protective Fe2O3 in the outer scale allowed oxygen to pass through, thus yielded into much thicker oxide scales and higher mass gains for P91 alloys, while protective NiO or Cr2O3 oxide scales yielded into low scale thicknesses and mass gains for IN617 alloys."
Metalle und Toxine,"Die Aurikulomedizin bietet mit der dynamischen Pulstastung (RAC) und ihren frequenziellen Techniken die Möglichkeit einer unspezifischen, nicht verdachtsorientierten Diagnose und kann daher Faktoren aufdecken, die sonst verborgen bleiben würden. Im Artikel soll vor allem auf Metalle und Toxine als Ursachen für Krankheiten eingegangen werden. Weiters soll gezeigt werden, wie man gefundenen Akupunkturpunkten durch die Anwendung der Zwei-Frequenz-Technik Ursachen zuordnen und dadurch gezielt schädigende Noxen ausschalten kann. Damit ist es möglich, eine optimale Therapie einzuleiten, laufend zu überwachen und anzupassen. Die beste Therapie stellt aber nach wie vor eine Prophylaxe durch Vermeidung dar, die zumindest für Lebensmittel, Medikamente und Impfungen sowie für zahnärztliche Werkstoffe durch die vorherige Testung möglich ist."
Das Resonanzprinzip Als Grundlage Der Frequenzmedizin — Ein Ausflug In Die Quantenphysik,"Resonanz ist ein Begriff, der in unserem Sprachgebrauch so häufig verwendet wird, dass er fast inflationär wirkt. Dabei steckt ein so vielschichtiges Phänomen dahinter, das es wert ist, genau „beleuchtet“ zu werden. Denn immerhin liefert es uns die Grundlage für unsere Frequenzmedizin, zu der neben der frequentiellen Akupunktur ja auch die Homöopathie und die Blütenessenzen zählen. Mit den Erklärungsmodellen der klassischen Physik lässt sich das Resonanzprinzip aber nicht vollständig erklären. Hier also ein kleiner Einblick in die Welt der Quantenphysik."

Race to Top or Race to Bottom Approach: Disaggregated Effect of Fiscal Decentralization and Its Implications for Consumption-Based Carbon Emissions,"Fiscal decentralization is a growing area of research, particularly for reducing carbon emissions and promoting environmental sustainability. However, its contribution to decreasing consumption-based carbon emissions remains relatively unexplored. Unlike previous studies, the current study explores the effect of expenditure and revenue decentralization on consumption-based carbon emission along with control variables such as exports, imports, human capital, globalization, renewable energy, and economic growth for BRICS economies from 1990 to 2020. The quantile regressions via method of moments test is employed to investigate the long-run relationship among the study variables. To enhance the robustness of the analysis this study also utilizes bootstrapped quantile regression and simple quantile regression tests. The results of quantile regressions via method of moments reveal that revenue decentralization increases consumption-based carbon emissions while expenditure decentralization reduces it. Moreover, it is worth noting that exports reduce while imports increases consumption-based carbon emissions in BRICS nations. Remarkably human capital, globalization, and renewable energy consumption have played pivotal roles in promoting environmental sustainability. However, the rapid pace of economic growth hurts the environment. This study holds substantial policy implications as it underscores the potential effectiveness of government measures aimed at improving environmental quality when these responsibilities are decentralized to the local population of the given state."
Modular geodesics and wedge domains in non-compactly causal symmetric spaces,"We continue our investigation of the interplay between causal structures on symmetric spaces and geometric aspects of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory. We adopt the perspective that the geometric implementation of the modular group is given by the flow generated by an Euler element of the Lie algebra (an element defining a 3-grading). Since any Euler element of a semisimple Lie algebra specifies a canonical non-compactly causal symmetric space \(M = G/H\), we turn in this paper to the geometry of this flow. Our main results concern the positivity region W of the flow (the corresponding wedge region): If G has trivial center, then W is connected, it coincides with the so-called observer domain, specified by a trajectory of the modular flow which at the same time is a causal geodesic. It can also be characterized in terms of a geometric KMS condition, and it has a natural structure of an equivariant fiber bundle over a Riemannian symmetric space that exhibits it as a real form of the crown domain of G/K. Among the tools that we need for these results are two observations of independent interest: a polar decomposition of the positivity domain and a convexity theorem for G-translates of open H-orbits in the minimal flag manifold specified by the 3-grading."
A non-isolated high step-up converter with TID controller for solar photovoltaic integrated with EV,"Due to environment concerns, Electric Vehicles (EV) are becoming more and more common in the automobile industry. Since rechargeable batteries of EV manage power, it is crucial to have a battery charger that is dependable, efficient, and affordable in order to provide the battery of the specific EV with the stable required output. Due to the expanding market for renewable energy combined with EV, converters have received a lot of attention recently. Because it reduces system losses and transformer winding losses, non-isolated DC/DC converters are suitable for EV applications. Other problems with the non-isolated DC/DC converter include inadequate voltage gain, a high duty cycle ratio, and the requirement for additional circuitry for better performance. To achieve reliable control of converters, a combination of an optimization technique with Tilt Integral Derivative (TID) controller is used in the Non-Isolated High Step-Up (NIHSU) DC/DC converter for Solar Photo Voltaic (SPV) integrated with EV Applications are proposed. The proposed system TID tuned by Dung Beetle Optimizer are executed in the MATLAB platform and compared with various approaches in terms of voltage regulation, efficiency. The proposed methodology improves closed-loop systems functionality and achieves significant voltage increase, greater power density and higher efficiency of 97.8%."
A combined kinodynamic motion planning method for multisegment continuum manipulators in confined spaces,"Multisegment continuum manipulators exhibit broad application prospects for complex tasks in confined spaces due to their inherent compliance and dexterity. However, the dynamic behaviors of these manipulators are highly nonlinear, bringing great challenges to their obstacle-avoidance motion planning. In this paper, a combined kinodynamic motion planning method is proposed for cable-driven multisegment continuum manipulators in confined spaces. The kinodynamic motion planning problem for these manipulators is first transformed into a nonlinear optimization problem (NOP) with both obstacle-avoidance constraints and input limitation constraints. The workspace of the continuum manipulator is then divided into a safe subspace and a warning subspace. By introducing parameters, the transformed NOP for motion planning in the safe subspace is further reformulated as a mixed complementarity problem to solve, which can rapidly generate paths while strictly satisfying system constraints. In addition, based on normal distribution and adaptive parameters, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm with great search performance is developed to address the motion planning problem in the warning subspace. The proposed path optimization framework can effectively address the highly nonlinear kinodynamic motion planning problem for multisegment continuum manipulators. Numerical simulations for obstacle-avoidance motion planning of multisegment continuum manipulators are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method."
Solving Fuzzy Nonlinear Optimization Problems Using Null Set Concept,"In the present paper, we propose a new method for minimizing the fuzzy single-objective function under fuzzy constraints. The algorithm of the method is based on the use of the null set concept. The null set concept allows us to use partial ordering for subtraction between fuzzy numbers, such as simple subtraction and the Hukuhara difference. From this, we have defined the types of solutions for a single-objective optimization problem, namely optimal solutions and H-optimal solutions. In practice, the method starts by turning the initial optimization problem into a deterministic nonlinear bi-objective optimization problem. Then, it uses Karush–Kuhn–Tucker’s optimality conditions to find the best solution of the bi-objective optimization problem. Finally, it deduces the solution to the initial problem using fuzzy algebraic operations to convert the deterministic solution into a fuzzy solution. Through some theorems, we have demonstrated that the obtained solutions by our method are optimal or H-optimal. Furthermore, the resolution of five examples of which a real-world problem has allowed us to compare our algorithm to other algorithms taken into the literature. With these results, our method can be seen as a good choice for solving a single-objective optimization problem where the objective and constraint functions are fuzzy."
Behavior of Hybrid FRP Strengthened RC Column Under Axial Compression,"Recently, there has been a growing interest in using Fiber reinforced cementitious matrix (FRCM) technology due to its ease of application and effectiveness in rehabilitating reinforced concrete (RC) elements. However, increasing the number of FRCM layers has not consistently improved strength and ductility, often resulting in premature Fiber slippage-related failures. This study examines RC circular columns strengthened with a hybrid approach combining FRCM and externally bonded FRP (EB-FRP) to overcome the limitations of FRCM alone. Two sets of each seven columns were cast, with one serving as a control and six undergoing strengthening using glass and carbon FRP materials. The main goal is to evaluate the hybrid FRCM/EB-FRP method’s effectiveness, enhance deformation characteristics, prevent Fiber slippage, and reduce the need for multiple FRCM layers. The study includes discussions on axial load-bearing capacity, load versus deformation Behavior, and failure patterns. The results reveal that Hybrid FRP-strengthened RC columns demonstrated increased capacity, improved column confinement, and enhanced ductility."
Effect on Different Anatomy Layers of Human Subject During Vibration Conditions Using FEM,"During daily activities, individuals come into contact with various intensities and durations of vibrations, which can potentially lead to health issues such as headaches, vomiting, and even heart failure. When designing components for human use, it becomes essential to assess the vibration parameters affecting the human body, allowing for necessary actions to minimize its impact. In a current study, a 76 kg mass representing the 95th percentile anthropometric Indian human male population was used and a realistic CAD model was created, incorporating different anatomical layers and defining material properties for various organs and components. To understand the effect of vibrations, modal analysis was conducted on the standing posture of the human subject. This analysis helped identify the natural frequencies (eigenvalues) and the vibration patterns (mode shapes) as well as the deformations experienced by each anatomical layer. Notably, the head and lower arms were found to experience the maximum effects of vibration across all types of anatomy layers. The natural frequency values obtained in this study were compared with experimentally obtained data available in existing literature for further validation."
The risk of concurrent malignancies in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: insights into clinical characteristics of those with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1,Summarize and analyze the characteristics of patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) who were diagnosed with malignant tumors that do not belong to MEN-1 components.
Composition of staff teams in early childhood education and care centres in nine countries,"This study draws on data from TALIS Starting Strong 2018, an international survey of early childhood education and care (ECEC) staff and leaders, to examine the staff roles (leader, teacher, assistant, specialised staff, intern, other) that are included in ECEC centres in nine countries: Chile, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Norway and Türkiye. The staffing profiles in ECEC centres are compared across countries as well as within countries, according to whether the centre was co-located with a primary school, its size in terms of the number of children enrolled, and the concentration of children with special needs and those from socio-economically disadvantaged homes. In addition, associations between the share of teachers and assistants in ECEC centres and staff reports of their time working on tasks without children, their collaboration with colleagues, their work-related stress and job satisfaction were examined. Results are discussed in terms of the different policy contexts in the participating countries and implications for building an ECEC workforce to address demands for both increased access to and better ECEC quality for children."
Examining the effects of climate change adaptation on technical efficiency of rice production,"This study examined the impact of eight climate change adaptation practices on technical efficiency (TE) among 843 rice farmers in Central China. Data were collected across ten counties in Hubei province in 2019. Given that spatial dependency is present in social and economic systems, we accounted for the spatial autocorrelation of TE. We estimated both a one-step nonspatial stochastic frontier model and a spatial stochastic frontier model. We verified that spatial spillovers were present in the TE of rice farmers, suggesting that the nonspatial stochastic frontier model underestimated TE. Results showed that adopting climate change adaptation strategies significantly affected TE. These effects, however, varied in directionality by the different adaptation measures evaluated in this study. Overall, adjusting preparation dates, improving irrigation systems, and increasing cultivated areas positively affected TE at 1%, 0.1%, and 5% significance levels. In contrast, the coefficients for both using flood-tolerant rice varieties and adjusting sowing dates were negative and significant at 5% and 10% significant levels. Interestingly, the effects of using high-yield rice varieties and adjusting fertilizer use were not significant. Finally, this study did not find any evidence that adaptation intensity affected the TE of rice production. Based on these results, we discussed implications for future climate-smart agriculture programs addressing the adverse effects of climate change on agricultural production in China."
Can green hydrogen production be used to mitigate ocean deoxygenation? A scenario from the Gulf of St. Lawrence,"Ocean deoxygenation and expansion and intensification of hypoxia in the ocean are a major, growing threat to marine ecosystems. Measures currently used to protect marine biodiversity (e.g., marine protected areas) are ineffective in countering this threat. Here, we highlight the example of the Gulf of St. Lawrence in eastern Canada, where oxygen loss is not only due to eutrophication (which can be mitigated by nutrient controls) but also is a consequence of ocean circulation change and warming. Climate-related loss of oxygen will be an increasingly widespread source of risk to marine biodiversity over this century. Again using the Gulf of St. Lawrence as an example, we show that production of oxygen by the green hydrogen industry can be comparable to the loss rate of dissolved oxygen on large spatial scales, offering new possibilities for mitigation. However, this mitigation approach has rarely been considered for marine environments to date. Given confluence of increasing risk to marine ecosystems from oxygen loss and rapid emergence, worldwide, of industrial sources of pure oxygen, which are likely to be located in coastal regions, we believe this option will be proposed increasingly in coming years, including by the private sector. We argue that it is urgent for ocean scientists, engineers, and policymakers to recognize and address this emerging potential. A coordinated research effort should be established immediately in order to harness the potential of the green hydrogen industry to mitigate major impacts of climate change on marine biodiversity, and avoid any unintended negative consequences."
Strain-Based Grid Beam Model for Predicting Punching Failure of Slab–Column Connections,"The punching shear failure that occurs in the vicinity of the slab–column connection is of utmost importance due to its brittle nature, which may lead to progressive collapse of flat-plate structures. Therefore, the development of reliable design guidelines requires accurate prediction of the punching shear resistance of the slab–column connection region. This paper introduces a new punching failure criterion for nonlinear grid beam modeling of slab–column connections based on the concrete compressive strain at the extreme compression fiber of the cross section at failure. To simulate nonlinear behavior, flexure and torsion hinges were incorporated into the grid beam elements. The proposed failure criterion was calibrated using 34 isolated slab specimens from literature, and its accuracy was validated using another set of 32 isolated slab test specimens. Additionally, the reliability of the proposed modeling strategy was examined for continuous slab systems by considering the results of numerical and experimental studies on multi-span flat-plate systems from the literature."
Aquatic plant Nymphaea mexicana as a viable feedstock for second-generation biofuel production,"Every year several thousand metric tons of macrophytic biomass is removed from water bodies and discarded without any further use. Valorizing this biomass into biofuels can be a way to help in mitigating the world’s rising energy demand. In the current study, firstly nitrate reductase (NR) activity and total chlorophyll content in six prevalent aquatic plants present in Dal Lake, Srinagar, India, were determined. The NR activity and total chlorophyll in Nymphaea mexicana were found to be 0.180 ± 0.037 µmol NO2 g−1FW h−1 and 0.973 ± 0.13 mg/g, respectively, significantly higher among all studied macrophytes. Concurrently, the area coverage of this plant in the lake was also assessed and this plant covered 3.86 km2, approximately 70% of the total area under aquatic vegetation in Dal Lake, determining its high growth rate. The high growth rate of this plant can be ascribed to its high NR activity and total chlorophyll than other studied plants. Then this plant’s potential for producing bioethanol and biodiesel was also assessed. For bioethanol production, dried biomass was hydrolyzed using different dilute sulfuric acid concentrations (1–5% v/v) at different temperatures (100–230 °C) for different time periods (1.5–4.5 h). Maximum reducing sugar yield of 410.07 ± 18.20 mg/g biomass was obtained at 3% acid concentration and 130 °C temperature after 3-h time interval. This condition was selected as the optimal condition for hydrolysis, and hydrolysate was then fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce bioethanol. Ethanol yield of 160 mg/g biomass was obtained after 96 h of fermentation. For biodiesel production, the dried biomass was Soxhlet extracted to obtain crude lipid followed by transesterification. A crude lipid yield of 34% (w/w) was obtained using a methanol and diethyl ether (2:1 ratio) solvent system. FAME analysis of trans-esterified lipid through GC-FID showed C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, and C18:3 as dominant fatty acids, commonly found in biodiesel. Therefore, based on the findings, it can be inferred that Nymphaea holds the potential to serve as a viable feedstock for biofuel production. However, delving further into the techno-economic and lifecycle analysis of these methods will play a pivotal role in facilitating the advancement of large-scale production."
Effect of Zr micro-alloying on microstructure refinement and mechanical property of CoCrNi medium-entropy alloy processed by high-pressure torsion and subsequent annealing,"Medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) have recently emerged as potential replacements for traditional alloys in high-performance applications. Among the various MEAs developed, equi-atomic CoCrNi MEA stands out for its excellent mechanical performance. Nevertheless, the yield strength of this MEA having a single-phase FCC structure is not exceptionally high. This study suggests a novel approach to strengthen the MEA by adding a small quantity of Zirconium (0.2 at.%). A (CoCrNi)99.8Zr0.2 MEA was cast and homogenized, alongside a CoCrNi MEA for comparison purposes. The alloys underwent high-pressure torsion followed by annealing in a temperature range of 700–1100 °C. In the Zr-doped MEA, annealing resulted in the recrystallization within the FCC matrix, accompanied by the precipitation of finely dispersed particles (Ni7Zr2). The concurrent precipitation hindered the grain growth, maintaining refined grain sizes (0.17 – 4 µm) over a wide range of temperatures. In contrast, the grain size in the Zr-free counterpart increased rapidly above 10 µm at elevated temperatures. The Zr doping substantially increased the yield strength with a minor negative impact on the ductility. The strength enhancement was due to grain refinement, precipitation, and dislocation locking caused by the Zr segregation at dislocation sites. These phenomena and their impacts on the Hall–Petch relationship were investigated and discussed. This study proves micro-alloying as a promising strategy for strengthening MEAs, making these alloys superior to their traditional counterparts."

A Higher-Order Spectral Problem and Associated Matrix Integrable Hierarchies,"Based on a special Lie subalgebra of the general linear algebra, a higher-order matrix spectral problem is proposed. An associated matrix integrable hierarchy, each of which consists of four submatrix equations, is constructed from the associated zero curvature equations. The corresponding Hamiltonian formulation is furnished by utilizing the trace identity, and two integrable reductions over the real and complex fields are presented by means of similarity transformations."
Geodesic vectors and flat totally geodesic subalgebras of six-dimensional filiform metric Lie algebras,A nilpotent Lie algebra \(\mathfrak {n}\) equipped with an Euclidean inner product is called nilpotent metric Lie algebra. In this paper we describe the sets of the geodesic vectors and the flat totally geodesic subalgebras of the six-dimensional filiform metric Lie algebras. In this class with the exception of the metric Lie algebras corresponding to the standard filiform Lie algebra the flat totally geodesic subalgebras of every metric Lie algebra have dimension at most two.
Feedback Stabilization of a Two-Fluid Surface Tension System Modeling the Motion of a Soap Bubble at Low Reynolds Number: The Two-Dimensional Case,"The aim of this paper is to design a feedback operator for stabilizing in infinite time horizon a system modeling the interactions between a viscous incompressible fluid and the deformation of a soap bubble. The latter is represented by an interface separating a bounded domain of \(\mathbb {R}^2\) into two connected parts filled with viscous incompressible fluids. The interface is a smooth perturbation of the 1-sphere, and the surrounding fluids satisfy the incompressible Stokes equations in time-dependent domains. The mean curvature of the surface defines a surface tension force which induces a jump of the normal trace of the Cauchy stress tensor. The response of the fluids is a velocity trace on the interface, governing the time evolution of the latter, via the equality of velocities. The data are assumed to be sufficiently small, in particular the initial perturbation, that is the initial shape of the soap bubble is close enough to a circle. The control function is a surface tension type force on the interface. We design it as the sum of two feedback operators: one is explicit, the second one is finite-dimensional. They enable us to define a control operator that stabilizes locally the soap bubble to a circle with an arbitrary exponential decay rate, up to translations, and up to non-contact with the outer boundary."
On additional symmetry and bilinearization of the q-Painlevé systems associated with the affine Weyl group of type A,"We present a description of the additional symmetry of the discrete dynamical systems proposed by Kajiwara–Noumi–Yamada, which originally possess an extended affine Weyl group symmetry \(\widetilde{W}(A_{m-1}^{(1)})\times \widetilde{W}(A_{n-1}^{(1)})\). We also propose a formulation of the systems in terms of the so-called \(\tau \)-variables."

Novel energy recovery from an integrated municipal solid waste and leachate treatment system,"Population growth, waste generation, and massive waste mismanagement have led to environmental catastrophe. Management of municipal solid waste (MSW) requires an efficient and sustainable integrated system. The integrated thermal processing of MSW is one of the best waste management techniques. In this study, energy analysis of MSW is carried out based on the material and energy balance of 2000 kg wet MSW, which contains 50% leachate. Once the leachate is removed, the dry MSW is sent for carbon content enhancement in carbonization to produce MSW-based char. Thereafter, the combustion of MSW-based char provided high heat and syngas to be used in a hydrothermal process for MSW leachate treatment. The result shows that the char fuel of MSW produces a sufficient amount of energy, 13501.29 MJ (84.55%), in the form of synthetic gas by-product, which has a big potential as an energy source. The novelty of the proposed integrated thermal system is to produce 84.55% synthetic gas by-product, which is used for electricity production, cooking, food, and heat energy for industrial purposes. The proposed applications of this paper offer insightful information for policymaking regarding novel MSW techniques, which are economical, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly. Thus, it increases the effectiveness of MSW utilization."
Response of vertical and batter piles under combined lateral and vertical loading conditions in sandy soil,"Pile foundation undergoes combination of lateral and vertical loads in various onshore and offshore structures. These loads are generally analyzed individually without considering the effect of combination of loads. The research work that includes experimental as well as numerical modeling on vertical and batter piles under the combined loading condition is rather scarce and inconclusive. The present research focused on understanding the behavior of vertical and batter piles under the effect of both lateral and vertical loads individually and in combination as well. Keeping in view all the conditions, piles, and testing chamber were modeled. The piles having varying slenderness ratios and different batter angles were considered for the study. Further, the model test results were simulated using the software PLAXIS-3D. The results show that the vertical load capacity is higher than the lateral load capacity of the pile. Under combined loading conditions where lateral loads are predominant, the load carrying capacity of the pile was found lesser than the individual vertical loading condition. However, it increases with the increase of vertical loads which tends to make the sand dense surrounding the pile. Vertical and batter piles under each loading condition shows unique trend of bending moment. The simulation of the numerical test results and model test results display a good match."
"Phenolation, amination and cross-linking of lignin: synthesis and characterization of functionalized lignin","Lignin is an inexpensive bio-adsorbent and has many applications in the adsorption of heavy metals. The structure and size of the lignin molecular chain affect its properties. Introducing of amino functional groups to the structure of lignin can improve its physical and chemical properties and increase its reactivity and adsorption power. Lignin cross-linking also improves its performance and adsorption characteristics. In the first step, lignin as a black liquor was extracted and purified from the waste of the wood factory. The lignin was then reacted with phenol to obtain lignophenol. The obtained lignophenol was then aminated via reacting with the ethylene diamine. Finally, in order to increase the strength of the adsorbent structure and prevent the dissolution of the adsorbent at low pHs (suitable for adsorption), 37% aqueous formaldehyde was added to the aminated lignin, from which aminated and cross-linked lignophenol was then obtained. Different types of lignins including lignin, lignophenol and amine-functionalized (branched or cross-linked) lignophenol were well synthesized and identified. The results of FT-IR spectrum showed that the amine functional groups were well attached to the lignophenol branches and the lignophenol was converted to the amino-containing lignophenol. Also, the results of acid–base titration and 11HNMR show that phenol was successfully bonded onto the lignin and amine functional groups were observed in lignin structure. The results of acid–base titration, elemental analysis and zeta potential tests also confirmed amination of lignophenol."
QFS-RPL: mobility and energy aware multi path routing protocol for the internet of mobile things data transfer infrastructures,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of various interconnected objects capable of collecting and exchanging data without human interaction. These objects have limited processing power, storage space, memory, bandwidth and energy. Therefore, due to these limitations, data transmission and routing are challenging issues where data collection and analysis methods are essential. The Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is one of the best alternatives to ensure routing in LoWPAN6 networks. However, RPL lacks scalability and basically designed for non-dynamic devices. Another drawback of the RPL protocol is the lack of load balancing support, leading to unfair distribution of traffic in the network that may decrease network efficiency. This study proposes a novel RPL-based routing protocol, QFS-RPL, using Q-learning algorithm policy and ideation from the Fisheye State Routing protocol. We have developed an algorithm for ease of data transfer in the IoT, which provides better performance than existing protocols, especially when dealing with a mobile network. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the Contiki operating system and Cooja simulator have been used in scenarios with mobile and stationary nodes and random network topologies. The results have been compared with RPL and mRPL. We have developed an algorithm for ease of data transfer in the IoT, which provides better performance than existing protocols, especially when dealing with a mobile network. The simulation outputs revealed that our scheme performs more efficiently in load balancing, number of table entries, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), End-to-End (E2E) latency, network throughput, convergence speed, control packet overhead and Remaining Useful Lifetime in designed scenarios compared to other methods. Moreover, the simulation results show an out-performance of rival schemes in terms of remaining energy and network lifetime."
A novel catalyst-free method for the synthesis of mono-N-substituted thioureas in water,Mono substituted thioureas are valuable chemical building blocks for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant molecules in both academia and the industry. We report here a catalyst-free preparation of mono substituted thioureas under very mild reaction condition. Condensation reactions of amines with carbon disulfide in ammonia solution gave mono substituted thioureas in good to excellent yield under catalyst-free condition.
Molecular characterization and antibiotic resistance of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from patients with diarrhea in Korea between the years 2007 and 2022,"To investigate the molecular characteristics and antibiotic resistance of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from patients with diarrhea in Korea, 327 S. aureus strains were collected between 2007 and 2022. The presence of staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) genes in S. aureus isolates was determined by PCR. The highest expression of the TSST-1 gene was found in the GIMNO type (43.1% of GIMNO type). GIMNO type (Type I) refers to each staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) gene gene (initials of genes): G = seg; I = sei; M = selm; N = seln; O = selo. Moreover, Type I isolates showed a significantly higher resistance to most antibiotics. A total of 195 GIMNO-type S. aureus strains were analyzed using multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and 18 unique sequence types (STs) were identified. The most frequent sequence type was ST72 (36.9%), followed by ST5 (22.1%) and ST30 (16.9%). Interestingly, ST72 strains showed a higher prevalence of MRSA than the other STs. In conclusion, our results were the first reported for S. aureus strains in Korea, which significantly expanded S. aureus genotype information for the surveillance of pathogenic S. aureus and may provide important epidemiological information to resolve several infectious diseases caused by S. aureus."
Clinical significance of antinuclear antibody as prognostic marker for first-line pembrolizumab in advanced non-small cell lung cancer,"The relationship between antinuclear antibody (ANA) and the efficacy of programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade remains controversial. Here, we investigated the prognostic significance of ANA titer in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy as the first-line treatment, compared with that of platinum-based chemotherapy with PD-1 blockade."
Antiretroviral action of Rosemary oil-based atazanavir formulation and the role of self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system in the management of HIV-1 infection,"Atazanavir or ATV is an FDA-approved, HIV-1 protease inhibitor that belongs to the azapeptide group. Over time, it has been observed that ATV can cause multiple adverse side effects in the form of liver diseases including elevations in serum aminotransferase, indirect hyper-bilirubinemia, and idiosyncratic acute liver injury aggravating the underlying chronic viral hepatitis. Hence, there is an incessant need to explore the safe and efficacious method of delivering ATV in a controlled manner that may reduce the proportion of its idiosyncratic reactions in patients who are on antiretroviral therapy for years. In this study, we assessed ATV formulation along with Rosemary oil to enhance the anti-HIV-1 activity and its controlled delivery through self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system or SNEDDS to enhance its oral bioavailability. While the designing, development, and characterization of ATV-SNEDDS were addressed through various evaluation parameters and pharmacokinetic-based studies, in vitro cell-based experiments assured the safety and efficacy of the designed ATV formulation. The study discovered the potential of ATV-SNEDDS to inhibit HIV-1 infection at a lower concentration as compared to its pure counterpart. Simultaneously, we could also demonstrate the ATV and Rosemary oil providing leads for designing and developing such formulations for the management of HIV-1 infections with the alleviation in the risk of adverse reactions."
LINC00460 promotes neuroblastoma tumorigenesis and cisplatin resistance by targeting miR-149-5p/DLL1 axis and activating Notch pathway in vitro and in vivo,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to participate in neuroblastoma cisplatin resistance and tumorigenesis. LncRNA LINC00460 was previously reported to play a critical regulatory role in many cancer development. Nevertheless, its role in modulating neuroblastoma cisplatin resistance has not been explored till now. Cisplatin-resistant neuroblastoma cell lines were established by exposing neuroblastoma cell lines to progressively increasing concentrations of cisplatin for 6 months. LINC00460, microRNA (miR)-149-5p, and delta-like ligand 1 (DLL1) mRNA expression was measured through RT-qPCR. The protein levels of DLL1, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, and the Notch signaling-related molecules were measured via western blotting. The IC50 value for cisplatin, cell growth, metastasis and apoptosis were analyzed in cisplatin-resistant neuroblastoma cells. The binding between LINC00460 (or DLL1) and miR-149-5p was validated through dual-luciferase reporter assay. The murine xenograft model was established to perform in vivo assays. LINC00460 and DLL1 levels were elevated, while miR-149-5p level was reduced in cisplatin-resistant neuroblastoma cells. LINC00460 depletion attenuated IC50 values for cisplatin, weakened cell growth, metastasis, and EMT, and enhanced apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant neuroblastoma cells. Mechanically, LINC00460 sponged miR-338-3p to increase DLL1 level, thereby activating Notch signaling pathway. DLL1 overexpression antagonized LINC00460 silencing-induced suppression on neuroblastoma cell cisplatin resistance and malignant behaviors, while such effects were further reversed by treatment with DAPT, the inhibitor of Notch pathway. Additionally, LINC00460 knockdown further augmented cisplatin-induced impairment on tumor growth in vivo. LINC00460 contributes to neuroblastoma cisplatin resistance and tumorigenesis through miR-149-5p/DLL1/Notch pathway, providing new directions to improve the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy drugs applied in patients with neuroblastoma."
Efficiency of PGK1 proteins delivered to the brain via a liposomal system through intranasal route administration for the treatment of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3,"A patient-friendly and efficient treatment method for patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) was provided through a nose-to-brain liposomal system. Initially, PGK1 was overexpressed in HEK 293-84Q-GFP diseased cells (HEK 293-84Q-GFP-PGK1 cells) to confirm its effect on the diseased protein polyQ. A decrease in polyQ expression was demonstrated in HEK 293-84Q-GFP-PGK1 cells compared to HEK 293-84Q-GFP parental cells. Subsequently, PGK1 was encapsulated in a liposomal system to evaluate its therapeutic efficiency in SCA3. The optimized liposomes exhibited a significantly enhanced positive charge, facilitating efficient intracellular protein delivery to the cells. The proteins were encapsulated within the liposomes using an optimized method involving a combination of heat shock and sonication. The liposomal system was further demonstrated to be deliverable to the brain via intranasal administration. PGK1/liposomes were intranasally delivered to SCA3 mice, which subsequently exhibited an amelioration of motor impairment, as assessed via the accelerated rotarod test. Additionally, fewer shrunken morphology Purkinje cells and a reduction in polyQ expression were observed in SCA3 mice that received PGK1/liposomes but not in the untreated, liposome-only, or PGK1-only groups. This study provides a non-invasive route for protein delivery and greater delivery efficiency via the liposomal system for treating neurodegenerative diseases."
Arabidopsis nucleoporin NUP96 mediates plant salt tolerance by modulating the transcription of salt-responsive genes,"Physiological and molecular tests show that NUP96 plays an important role in the plant response to salt stress, resulting from the reprogramming of transcriptomic profiles, which are likely to be mediated by the influence on the nuclear/cytosol shuttling of the key regulators of salt tolerance."
How the central-western equatorial Pacific easterly wind in early 2022 affects the third-year La Niña occurrence,"After consecutive two years with the La Niña phenomenon in 2020–2021, cold sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the central-eastern equatorial Pacific persisted in 2022, known as a “triple-dip” La Niña event. These conditions have had a profound impact on global weather and climate. Understanding the underlying processes and mechanisms is crucial for improving ENSO prediction and has significant socioeconomic implications. In this study, we investigate the processes responsible for the evolution of the third-year La Niña event in 2022 based on related observations and an intermediate coupled model (ICM). The results show that two factors are essential for the development of the third-year La Niña event: surface easterly wind anomalies over the central-western equatorial Pacific in early 2022 and the induced cold SST anomalies by the former. In the first half of 2022, mainly due to the off-equatorial downwelling Rossby wave reflection at the western boundary, the equatorial downwelling Kelvin waves continuously induce warming effect in the upper ocean, acting to weaken the cold SST anomalies in the central-eastern Pacific. However, the easterly wind anomalies over the central-western equatorial Pacific during February–March 2022 induce upwelling Kelvin waves, whose cooling effect reverses the warming SST tendency. Afterward, despite the pronounced warming effect induced by the reflected downwelling Kelvin waves, the wind-induced cold SST anomalies persist on the equator during the equatorial cold season, which are further intensified by the Bjerknes feedback. Sensitivity experiments based on the ICM further confirm these outcomes. When the cooling effect induced by the easterly wind anomalies is included in ocean initial conditions, the ICM can accurately capture the reappearance of the La Niña phenomenon. These results highlight the importance of anomalous easterlies in the central-western equatorial Pacific during the decaying phase of the La Niña event."
Dynamic simulation of GEH-IES with distributed parameter characteristics for hydrogen-blending transportation,"For the purpose of environment protecting and energy saving, renewable energy has been distributed into the power grid in a considerable scale. However, the consuming capacity of the power grid for renewable energy is relatively limited. As an effective way to absorb the excessive renewable energy, the power to gas (P2G) technology is able to convert excessive renewable energy into hydrogen. Hydrogen-blending natural gas pipeline is an efficient approach for hydrogen transportation. However, hydrogen-blending natural gas complicates the whole integrated energy system (IES), making it more problematic to cope with the equipment failure, demand response and dynamic optimization. Nevertheless, dynamic simulation of distribution parameters of gas–electricity–hydrogen (GEH) energy system, especially for hydrogen concentration, still remains a challenge. The dynamics of hydrogen-blending IES is undiscovered. To tackle the issue, an iterative solving framework of the GEH-IES and a cell segment-based method for hydrogen mixing ratio distribution are proposed in this paper. Two typical numerical cases studying the conditions under which renewables fluctuate and generators fail are conducted on a real-word system. The results show that hydrogen blending timely and spatially influences the flow parameters, of which the hydrogen mixing ratio and gas pressure loss along the gas pipeline are negatively correlated and the response to hydrogen mixing ratio is time-delayed. Moreover, the hydrogen-blending amount and position also have a significant impact on the performance of the compressor."
Investigating the use of biosurfactants produced by lactobacillus to increase the shelf life of minced ostrich meat,"Ostrich meat has a very high nutritional value, and improving the shelf life of raw ground meat is highest importance for the meat industry. The present study aims to improve the quality of minced ostrich meat using biosurfactants produced by Lactobacillus strains. For this purpose, biosurfactants were first derived from probiotic bacteria including Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pentosus, and Lactobacillus casei. Then, the antioxidant activity of biosurfactant was evaluated in vitro using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl free radicals, and antimicrobial activities studied using the diffusion method in agar wells against pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus). Next, biosurfactants (with a concentration of 0.05 g/ml) were evaluated as biological preservatives to improve the microbiological (TVC, PTC, E. coli, S. aureus, and mold and yeast) and physicochemical (PV, TBA, TVB-N, pH, hardness and color index) quality of minced ostrich meat during 16 days of storage at 4 °C. The data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software. The results showed that the scavenging activity of DPPH and hydroxyl of biosurfactants at a concentration of 0.05 g/ml was 81.99–78.51% and 71.56–69.56%, respectively, and all biosurfactants had high antimicrobial activities. The results related to the shelf life of ostrich showed that the use of biosurfactants resulted in better color stability and firmer texture of the samples during the storage period. It was also the cause of delaying the chemical and microbial spoilage of the samples during the storage period. The samples containing biosurfactants had chemical, microbial, and sensory limits until the end of the storage period. Based on the results, biosurfactants can reduce all the indicators mentioned as natural antioxidants and antimicrobials, thus increasing the she lf life of minced ostrich meat. In addition, they can provide the necessary background for the practical use of these compounds in all kinds of meats and their products."
Exploration of interaction existing between methyl chavicol and bovine serum albumin using spectroscopic and molecular modelling techniques,"Methyl chavicol (MC), also known as 1-methoxy-4-prop-2-enylbenzene, estragole or p-allylanisole, is a specific metabolite that can be found in the essential oils of both culinary and medicinal plants. It has antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and insecticidal properties. In order to determine the binding mechanism and conformational changes of the in vitro interaction of MC with bovine serum albumin (BSA), several biophysical techniques as well as molecular modelling methods have been used. The fluorescence emission from BSA in the presence of MC at three distinctive temperatures was measured using 290 nm excitation wavelength. BSA's intrinsic fluorescence has been quenched by MC via a static process. The absorption peak shifts as a result of the development of the MC–BSA complex. Binding of MC with BSA caused conformational alterations, as seen by the fluorescence, UV–Vis absorption, circular dichroism and FTIR data. The values of the binding constants get increased as the temperature rises, indicating a stable complex formation under these conditions. Further, Site II, of BSA, has been discovered to have the strongest MC-binding affinity and hydrophobic interactions have been hypothesized to be the dominant interaction type in the BSA–MC complex because of the positive levels of enthalpy and entropy changes."
Analyse didactique d’une reprise d’étude de la multiplication de deux nombres entiers dans un suivi orthophonique en France,"In France, when a student has persistent and recurring difficulties in mathematics, he or she may be cared for by a healthcare professional, a speech-therapist, outside of school. The social security reimbursed this support. Our research aims to objectify the effects of such monitoring on school learning. This article presents seven sessions on the theme of multiplying two integers of a speech therapy follow-up for a 10 to 11-year-old child. The didactic analysis of this sequence, based on a naturalistic observation, without intervention of researchers, is carried out to answer the question: what is the mathematical knowledge worked? Our study highlights a networking of different types of tasks, potentially due to a work of reversibility (Apostel et al. in Logique et équilibre, Presses Universitaires de Francein, 1957) and the epistemic role of the material, omnipresent during the sessions."
Defining the Biology of Estrogen Receptor-Low-Positive Breast Cancer,We sought to better define estrogen receptor-low-positive (ER-low+) breast cancer biology and determine the utility of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score® (RS) assay in this population.
Detecting and diagnosing prior and likelihood sensitivity with power-scaling,"Determining the sensitivity of the posterior to perturbations of the prior and likelihood is an important part of the Bayesian workflow. We introduce a practical and computationally efficient sensitivity analysis approach using importance sampling to estimate properties of posteriors resulting from power-scaling the prior or likelihood. On this basis, we suggest a diagnostic that can indicate the presence of prior-data conflict or likelihood noninformativity and discuss limitations to this power-scaling approach. The approach can be easily included in Bayesian workflows with minimal effort by the model builder and we present an implementation in our new R package priorsense. We further demonstrate the workflow on case studies of real data using models varying in complexity from simple linear models to Gaussian process models."
Efficient quality assurance for isocentric stability in stereotactic body radiation therapy using machine learning,"This study aims to predict isocentric stability for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatments using machine learning (ML), covers the challenges of manual assessment and computational time for quality assurance (QA), and supports medical physicists to enhance accuracy. The isocentric parameters for collimator (C), gantry (G), and table (T) tests were conducted with the RUBY phantom during QA using TrueBeam linac for SBRT. This analysis combined statistical features from the IsoCheck EPID software. Five ML models, including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), naive Bayes (NB), and support vector machines (SVM), were used to predict the outcome of the QA procedure. 247 Winston–Lutz (WL) tests were collected from 2020 to 2022. In our study, both DT and RF achieved the highest score on test accuracy (Acc. test) ranging from 93.5% to 99.4%, and area under curve (AUC) values from 90 to 100% on three modes (C, G, and T). The precision, recall, and F1 scores indicate the DT model consistently outperforms other ML models in predicting isocenter stability deviation in QA. The QA assessment using ML models can assist error prediction early to avoid potential harm during SBRT and ensure safe and effective patient treatments."
De rol van de huisarts bij genderincongruentie,"De toenemende zichtbaarheid van genderincongruentie in de samenleving vraagt om aanpassing van kennis, attitude en vaardigheden van de huisarts. Omdat trans personen verschillende zorgbehoeften hebben is zorg op maat op zijn plaats. Bij de zorg aan trans personen gelden de huisartsgeneeskundige principes: laagdrempelig en inclusief toegankelijk, empathische communicatie, het beantwoorden van de hulpvraag vanuit een biopsychosociaal perspectief, het bieden van eenvoudige interventies op basis van basale kennis en gezamenlijke besluitvorming, en zo nodig adequaat verwijzen."
Geeft een DOAC minder risico op een intracerebrale bloeding na een val op het hoofd bij ouderen?,"Ouderen vallen geregeld. Valincidenten kunnen, onder andere bij gebruik van orale antico­agulantia, gepaard gaan met bloedingen. Informatie over bloedingscomplicaties na een val bij kwetsbare ouderen is echter schaars. Daarom onderzochten wij of er minder intracraniële bloedingen zijn bij het gebruik van een DOAC vergeleken met het gebruik van een VKA bij ouderen na een val op het hoofd."

"Corporate Power, Environmental Devastation and Children's Literature: Insights from Dr. Seuss's The Lorax and Bill Peet's The Wump World","Corporate power has an intimidating impact on the environment. It causes environmental degradation and threatens the ecological balance and sustainability of the planet. This article analyses the representation of corporate power and its effects on the environment in two classic children’s books: Dr. Seuss’s (The Lorax, Random House Books for Young Readers, 1971) and Bill Peet’s (The Wump World, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1970). It examines how these two classic children’s books depict the environmental damage caused by corporate power in the 21st century and how they can educate and motivate young readers to care about environmental issues and their root causes. Using a critical discourse analysis approach based on Fairclough’s model, the article studies how language is used in both texts to construct and maintain dominant ideologies, manipulate and marginalize alternative voices and exploit natural resources and vulnerable communities. The findings reveal that the discourse of Once-ler and Pollutians reflects a capitalist and consumerist ideology that legitimizes their environmental destruction and silences environmental concerns. However, language can also be a tool of resistance and change that can challenge and expose the dominant ideology, as shown by the voices of the Lorax and the Wumps in the same texts. The article suggests that by reading and analyzing these two classic children’s books, young readers can learn to critically examine the language used by different actors and to use the language themselves to create a more just and sustainable society."
"Stress and Faulting Pattern in the Bam Region, SE Iran, Detected by Fault Instability Criterion and Fry Method","In this study, we determine the stress release from the 2003 Bam earthquake (Mw 6.6) by applying the stress inversion technique to focal mechanisms of 199 aftershocks. There is no evidence of significant surface faulting that can be used to study the faulting pattern of the Bam fault zone. Therefore, we applied two independent methods for identifying the faulting pattern in this zone: the instability criterion based on the analysis of orientations of nodal planes of focal mechanisms with respect to the regional stress, and the Fry method based on the analysis of spatial clustering of aftershock foci. The results show that the fault associated with the 2003 Bam earthquake is well oriented for shearing under the present-day regional stress. We identified four sets of faults with a close angular relation to the maximum horizontal compression (SHmax) that have been (re)activated. These faults include strike-slip (right lateral and left lateral), thrust, and normal faults that are oriented approximately oblique, perpendicular, and parallel relative to the SHmax, respectively. The direction of the SHmax is N31° E. Based on the results, we propose to apply the instability criterion and the Fry method to seismic data as two valuable and independent techniques in order to constrain the kinematic and active faulting in the area."
Assessment of the CORDEX Regional Climate Models Performance in Simulating the Climate Conditions of Arsi Zone Southeastern Ethiopia,"Evaluation of climate model skills in reproducing local-scale climate conditions is an important aspect of climate studies. This study aimed to assess the performance of five Regional Climate Models (RCMs) available in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). The assessment was based on how well the RCMs replicated rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures, interannual and seasonal variations over southeastern Ethiopia during the simulation period of 1980–2005. The results indicated that the Regional Climate Models (RCMs) exhibited substantial bias in simulating annual rainfall cycles, particularly in higher elevation areas of the study region. The Regional Model (REMO2009) simulated the maximum temperature, while the Regional Atmosphere Climate Model (RACMO22T) better simulated the minimum temperature compared to other models. However, the ensemble of models performed better than the individual RCMs in simulating the annual cycle of temperature. The variation in rainfall was greater than the variation in temperature, both seasonally and interannually. RACMO22T and Climate Limited Area Modeling (CCLM4-8) showed better performance in capturing the cumulative distribution of rainfall events and return period. The Regional Atmospheric Model (RCA) was characterized by a significant overestimation of cumulative distribution and return period. The disparity in performance among the Regional Climate Models indicates their sensitivity to location and topography. Therefore, the selection of a suitable RCM for a specific location is essential for any climate-related and other definite articles study or local climate projections."
Pitting Corrosion of S13Cr Tubing in a Gas Field: A Failure Case and Corrosion Mechanism Analysis,"This work investigated the pitting failure mechanism of S13Cr tubing in a gas well resulting from multiple gas lifts. The causes of pitting corrosion through the use of numerical simulations (CFD) were determined. Electrochemical noise technique was used to explore the process of pitting corrosion. Results show that the chemical elements, inclusions, metallographic structures, and strength of S13Cr tubing meet standard requirements. Scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to analyze the compositions of corrosion products, which mainly consist of FeCO3, Fe2O3, FeOOH, Cr2O3, and Cr(OH)3. Numerical simulations show that a liquid film is formed in the local well section of the inner wall during gas lift. Electrochemical noise revealed a linear decrease in potential noise and a linear increase in current noise, indicating that the adsorption of Cl- on the electrode surface erodes the passivation film. Current and potential transient peaks began to appear and increase, indicating the development of pitting erosion toward a steady state. In the actual production process, S13Cr tubes lead to crack initiation and expansion due to the coupling of mechanical–chemical effects of Cl−, CO2, and O2."
Experimental Study on Brittle Fracture Mechanism and Mechanical Properties of HRB400E Rebar Cross-Spot Welding,"HTW-50 solid wire CO2 gas-shielded arc spot welding and resistance spot welding techniques were utilized to fabricate multiple sets of HRB400E hot-rolled ribbed seismic reinforcement cross-spot welded test specimens. These specimens were subjected to unidirectional tensile testing to investigate the impact of cross-spot welding on the mechanical properties of the steel bars. Chemical composition analysis and hardness testing were conducted on the brittle fracture test specimens using a metallurgical microscope, scanning electron microscope, and Rockwell hardness tester, among other related equipment. The brittle fracture mechanism of the cross-welded test specimens was subsequently examined from both macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. The results indicate that cross-spot welding of large-diameter rebars does not affect their strength. However, 80% of the test specimens exhibited brittle fractures that occurred at the weld point. Moreover, the elongation of the brittle fracture specimens was lower than the standard value, indicating a need for improved toughness. In comparison to CO2 gas-shielded arc spot welding, resistance spot welding had a lesser impact on the elongation of the steel bars and demonstrated greater stability. The test specimens exhibited fractures primarily at the welded area, where only a minimal amount of toughness was observed. Disintegration steps and river-like patterns were also observed at the weld, suggesting a mechanism of disintegration fracture. Additionally, tempered martensite was detected in the heat-affected zone, rendering the bars brittle, and making them prone to fracture at the weld."
Anisotropy state variable based on phase transformation for generalized plasticity constitutive model,"This study presents a novel formulation for incorporating anisotropy into the generalized plasticity constitutive model. Generalized plasticity is a hierarchical framework allowing for extensibility, in order to encompass new phenomena and improve its predictive capabilities. Anisotropy formulation is based experimentally on the phase transformation state and considers explicitly the direction of the maximum principal stress and the magnitude of the intermediate principal stress, through an anisotropy state variable that contributes to the state parameter. Additionally, the model incorporates the fabric using an evolving fabric variable that reflects initial fabric due to sample preparation method for granular soils. The formulation is simple and introduces three constitutive parameters, allowing for straightforward implementation into the constitutive model and direct application in finite element analysis. The model is validated with undrained triaxial tests conducted on Toyoura sand, covering a wide range of initial conditions with a unique set of constitutive parameters, and yielding overall satisfactory results despite some limitations."
Convergence of Dirichlet Energy Minimization for Spherical Conformal Parameterizations,"In this paper, we first derive a theoretical basis for spherical conformal parameterizations between a simply connected closed surface \(\mathcal {S}\) and a unit sphere \(\mathbb {S}^2\) by minimizing the Dirichlet energy on \(\overline{\mathbb {C}}\) with stereographic projection. The Dirichlet energy can be rewritten as the sum of the energies associated with the southern and northern hemispheres and can be decreased under an equivalence relation by alternatingly solving the corresponding Laplacian equations. Based on this theoretical foundation, we develop a modified Dirichlet energy minimization with nonequivalence deflation for the computation of the spherical conformal parameterization between \(\mathcal {S}\) and \(\mathbb {S}^2\). In addition, under some mild conditions, we verify the asymptotically R-linear convergence of the proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments on various benchmarks confirm that the assumptions for convergence always hold and demonstrate the efficiency, reliability and robustness of the developed modified Dirichlet energy minimization."
Medical providers’ supply curve in a universal healthcare system with global budgeting,"This paper investigates medical providers’ supply curve under universal healthcare system with global budgeting, which theory predicts to be either positive or negative sloping. Using the population data of medical providers’ services and exogenous shifted budgets in Taiwan, empirical evidence shows that the dentists and Chinese herb practitioners maintained positive sloping supply curves. Hospitals and clinics that practice Western medicine were found to have negative sloping supply curves. The latter results indicate medical providers have incentives to provide excessive services under global budgeting, even when this drives down the price of their services provided."
Fusing global features and local information for COVID-19 detection with X-ray images,"COVID-19 is a modern virus that has spread all over the world and is affecting billions of people. Timely and accurate detection is of great significance to slow down the spread of the virus and treat infected people effectively. Deep learning methods have been shown promising in COVID-19 detection due to their accurate feature extraction ability, which can enhance the classification ability of the detection model with high accuracy. Existing studies mostly focus on information compression and feature extraction, which inevitably leads to original information loss. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end COVID-19 classification model called MSCGRU, which is based on the fusion of multi-faceted global features with local information of original images. Firstly, multi-scale CNN is used to extract multi-scale global features from multiple channels, and these features are fused with local information to obtain comprehensive features. Secondly, GRU is adopted to extract deep abstract features from comprehensive features. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MSCGRU greatly strengthens the learning ability and achieves better prediction performance compared with other methods. The accuracy of multi-classification is 98.2%, and the accuracy of binary classification is 100%."
Evaluation of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 vegetation indices to predict soil organic carbon using machine learning models,"Soil organic carbon (SOC) stands out as a crucial indicator for assessing soil properties due to its direct impact on soil productivity. To delve into this, we collected 350 soil samples from depths ranging from 0 to 30 cm in the northwest region of Iran, measuring SOC levels. Concurrently, we obtained vegetation indices from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images. Subsequently, we employed machine learning techniques, specifically artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) models, to estimate the spatial distribution of SOC. In the subsequent phase, we classified the land units of the region based on physiography, vegetation, erosion, flooding, soil type, and depth for a more accurate comparison of estimation models. We then compared the average values of measured and predicted SOC within these land units. The evaluation of ANN and RF models, utilizing vegetation indices from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellites, revealed that the RF method, particularly when using vegetation indices from the Sentinel-2 satellite, exhibited superior accuracy in predicting SOC (R2 = 0.8, RMSE = 0.19, and ρc = 0.81). Moreover, when comparing the estimated and predicted average values of SOC in different land units, we observed no significant difference between the measured and predicted averages using the RF method. This underscores the robustness of the RF model in accurately predicting SOC by leveraging vegetation indices extracted from Sentinel-2 satellite data. Consequently, the RF model emerges as a reliable tool for SOC evaluation, offering precise forecasts and contributing to cost and time savings by minimizing the need for extensive soil sampling and laboratory analysis."
Mixed sequential type pantograph fractional integro-differential equations with non-local boundary conditions,"In this paper, we investigate the existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions to the mixed sequential pantograph fractional integro-differential equations with non-local boundary conditions. The solution of the problem is obtained and the existence and uniqueness of the solution is tested by means of Krasnosel’skii’s fixed point theorem and the Banach contraction principle respectively. Moreover, the Ulam–Hyers and Ulam–Hyers–Rassias stability of the solution is determined. An example emphasising our findings is provided."
Kluvánek–Lewis–Henstock integral in Banach spaces,"In this article, we extend Kluvánek–Lewis–Henstock thegral theory in associate with X-valued measure of [4]. We investigate some properties and convergence theorem of Kluvánek–Lewis–Henstock \(\mu \)-integral for \(\mu \)-measurable functions in associated with X-valued vector measure m. We provide an m-a.e. convergence version of Dominated (resp. Bounded) Convergence Theorem for Kluvánek–Lewis–Henstock integrable functions. We also introduce Kluvánek–Lewis–Henstock integrable of scalar-valued functions with respect to a set valued measure in a Banach space. Finally, we introduce (KL)-type Dominated Convergence Theorem for the set-valued Kluvánek–Lewis–Henstock integral."
Optical solitons in cascaded systems using the \(\varPhi ^{6}\)-model expansion algorithm,"The ongoing research centers its attention on the Kerr nonlinear cascaded system, but this time in (2+1) dimensions. In this study, we employ the \(\varPhi ^{6}\)-model expansion approach to investigate the generation of bright, dark, and singular solitons in the cascaded system. Optical solitons are self-sustaining wave packets that can maintain their shape and propagate without dispersion. The cascaded system, governed by coupled NLSE, has wide-ranging applications in various fields such as waveguide dynamics, optical communications, nonlinear optics, ultrafast optics, nonlinear imaging, and photonic devices. After evaluating limitations of the modulus of ellipticity, Jacobi’s elliptic function yields soliton solutions."
"Establishment genomics of the Indo-Pacific damselfish Neopomacentrus cyanomos, in the Greater Caribbean","The Regal Demoiselle, Neopomacentrus cyanomos is only the second Indo-Pacific reef fish (after the lionfish) to become well established in the Greater Caribbean (GC). It was first discovered, after it already was common, in the southwest Gulf of Mexico (SGM) in 2013. In 2019, an isolated second population was found at Trinidad, 3300 km away. The initial occurrence of this species only at two distant offshore oilfields supports the hypothesis that it was transported via an oil platform in water from its native range into the Atlantic. From there, populations spilled over to nearby reefs. In both its native range and the SGM, N. cyanomos lives in the relatively stable marine environment of coral reefs. In contrast, the Trinidad population lives on rocky reefs in a large, murky, brackish estuary with strong seasonal variation in salinity mostly due to inflow from the Orinoco River in Venezuela. Its capacity to successfully breed in that estuary indicates that N. cyanomos is a highly adaptable species. The existence of two distant, isolated populations of this non-native species in such very different environments presents a unique opportunity for the study of the biology of recently established non-native reef fishes. A previous study showed that both the SGM and Trinidad populations derive from the same two of four, largely allopatric, native-range mitochondrial DNA lineages. Here we analyzed native populations from the area of those two lineages in the Pacific and Indian oceans, and the two non-native populations in the GC using thousands of genomic markers (RAD sequences) to evaluate patterns of genetic differentiation, population structure and the potential role of natural selection to affect establishment success. Based on RAD sequences we show that native and non-native populations have very similar levels of genetic diversity (no evidence of bottleneck or founder effects). In addition, data showed that native Indian and Pacific Ocean individuals partition in separate genetic clusters and that non-native Atlantic individuals are prevalently of Pacific genetic origin (~ 95% of their genetic material belong to the Pacific Ocean cluster). Finally, we found that 32 loci were potentially under selection, and 12 of them corresponded to protein coding genes. Additional work will be necessary to determine the potential role of natural selection in the successful establishment of non-native species in the Caribbean."
On the impact of hardware-related events on the execution of real-time programs,"Estimating safe upper bounds on execution times of programs is required in the design of predictable real-time systems. When multi-core, instruction pipeline, branch prediction, or cache memory are in place, due to the considerable complexity traditional static timing analysis faces, measurement-based timing analysis (MBTA) is a more tractable option. MBTA estimates upper bounds on execution times using data measured under the execution of representative execution scenarios. In this context, understanding how hardware-related events affect the executing program under analysis brings about useful information for MBTA. This paper contributes to this need by modeling the execution behavior of programs in function of hardware-related events. More specifically, for a program under analysis, we show that the number of cycles per executed instruction can be correlated to hardware-related event occurrences. We apply our modeling methodology to two architectures, ARMv7 Cortex-M4 and Cortex-A53. While all hardware events can be monitored at once in the former, the latter allows simultaneous monitoring of up to 6 out of 59 events. We then describe a method to select the most relevant hardware events that affect the execution of a program under analysis. These events are then used to model the program behavior via machine learning techniques under different execution scenarios. The effectiveness of this method is evaluated by extensive experiments. Obtained results revealed prediction errors below 20%, showing that the chosen events can largely explain the execution behavior of programs."
Development of a yeast cell based method for efficient screening of high yield tacrolimus production strain,"Tacrolimus (FK506) is a widely used and clinically important immunosuppressant drug that can be produced by fermentation of Streptomyces tsukubaensis. The industrial strains are typically obtained through multiple rounds of mutagenesis and screening, a labor-intensive process. We have established an efficient yeast cell based screening method for the evolutionary process of high-FK506-yielding strain. The S. tsukubaensis strains of different FK506 yields were tested for zone of growth inhibition of the wild type and calcineurin mutant (cnb1∆) yeast strains. We found that different FK506 yields correspond well to altered yeast growth inhibitions. Based on the combinational inhibition effects of FK506 with different antifungals that have been frequently reported, we also tested the zone of inhibition by addition of fluconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin to the medium. In the end, for the best screening performance, we systemically evaluated the strategy when different yeast strains and different antifungals were used according to the clarity, size, and divergence of the inhibition circles. Using different yeast strains and antifungals, we successfully broadened the screening spectrum. An efficient high-FK506-yield S. tsukubaensis screening method has been established and optimized."
Stammzelltherapie Mit Dem Klasse-4-Laser,"Die Stammzelltherapie mit dem Klasse-4-Laser ist ein neues Verfahren im Bereich der Lasermedizin. Ziel ist es, über die Stimulation der Tibiae beidseits, eine signifikante Erhöhung der Stammzellen im peripheren Blut zu erreichen. Während meiner Forschungsarbeiten hat es sich als Vorteil erwiesen, mit 2 verschiedenen Laserfrequenzen während einer Behandlung zu arbeiten. Die Stimulation wurde mit einer Qi-bewegenden Frequenz begonnen. Hier kommen direkt die Frequenz der Qi-Bewegung oder die neue „Stammzellfrequenz“ mit 2442 Hz zum Einsatz. Etwas bessere Stimulationsergebnisse haben sich mit der Stammzellfrequenz ergeben. Anschließend werden die Tibiae beidseits mit der Frequenz der Selbstheilung nach RAC stimuliert. Die Stammzellstimulation kann bei verschiedenen Krankheitsbildern wie z.B. Rheumatoide Arthritis, Morbus Bechterew, Post-COVID-Syndrom usw. eingesetzt werden. Sehr effektiv hat sich die Behandlung zur rein energetisch/regenerativen Stimulation des Organismus erwiesen."

The landscape of European policies in the power sector: first-mover advantages,"In order to achieve the commonly agreed emission reduction target, the European Commission called upon the member states to submit National Energy and Climate Plans to ensure increased transparency for the respective national targets and strategies. An analysis of these plans shows that some member states have declared ambitious emission reductions targets, as well as technology-specific phaseout policies in the power sector. A transformation to a climate-friendly system requires considerable investment, the question arises if there are benefits to be in the vanguard. We find that countries may have an incentive to outperform in the development of a low-carbon electricity system."
"Soliton interactions, soliton bifurcations and molecules, breather molecules, breather-to-soliton transitions, and conservation laws for a nonlinear (3+1)-dimensional shallow water wave equation","In this study, we employ the bilinear method to construct Nth-order solutions for a nonlinear (3+1)-dimensional shallow water equation. Subsequently, we delve into a comprehensive exploration of novel dynamical features within the equation, including soliton interactions, soliton bifurcations, soliton molecules, breather and soliton interactions, breather molecules, and breather-to-soliton transitions. Analytical expressions for the constraint conditions required to generate soliton bifurcations and soliton molecules are presented. Our study reveals that the newly obtained waves exhibit distinctive characteristics: they can form multi-layered step-like flat blocks, propagate with stable energies and shapes, thereby reflecting an intrinsic balance between nonlinearities and dispersions. We also verify that this equation has an infinite number of conservation laws. These intriguing findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic behaviors exhibited by solitons, breathers, and their hybrid forms within the realm of shallow water waves characterized by nonlinear motions."
Self-stabilization control on traffic flow of connected and automated vehicles under cyberattacks,"As traffic systems are becoming increasingly interconnected and automated, it is crucial to protect important systems from cyberattacks nowadays. In this study, we propose the Self-Stabilizing Cyberattack (SS-CA) model to investigate the connection between self-stabilizing control and the impact of cyberattacks on traffic flow dynamics in the context of connected vehicles. The linear stability analysis examines the stability criteria for the SS-CA model. Nonlinear analysis uses reductive perturbation methods to derive soliton solutions, providing descriptions of traffic density wave propagation. From the findings, it is evident that, as a cyberattack’s intensity increases, traffic stability decreases while increasing the self-stabilization control parameter enhances traffic stability. Furthermore, the effect of self-stabilizing control over headway is found effective in avoiding the negative impact of cyberattacks, which decreases traffic flow stability. The study validates theoretical insights through numerical simulations demonstrating the significance of self-stabilizing behavior in mitigating traffic disruptions caused by cyberattacks."
"Polarization effects on the rotational gyromagnetic ratio and magnetic dipole moments of 175,177,177mYb","The measured ground- and isomeric-state magnetic moments of 175,177Yb have been theoretically investigated for the first time using the method based on the Quasiparticle Phonon Nuclear Model (QPNM). In this method, spin-polarization is produced through interaction between the magnetic dipole (M1) excitations of the core and the odd particle. It provides a quenched spin gyromagnetic factor whose magnitude depends on the density of 1+ levels in the core. gR factors, one of the essential inputs of the magnetic moment calculations, have been computed with a newly developed approach. The predictions of theory for the magnetic moments are in excellent agreement with experimental data."
AIHTA-Studie stellt erneut keine Überlegenheit der roboterassistierten Chirurgie für Eingriffe im Brust- und Bauchbereich fest,"Das AIHTA hat die Wirksamkeit und Sicherheit roboterassistierter chirurgischer Eingriffe (RAS) bei 14 Indikationen im Thorax- und Bauchbereich untersucht. Vor dem Hintergrund der hohen Erwartungen und deutlich höheren Kosten im Vergleich zur laparoskopischen- und offenen Chirurgie stand der Zusatznutzen der RAS im Fokus der Untersuchung. Das Fazit: Für mehrere Indikationen und Endpunkte lag keine Evidenz vor, Unterschiede bei Krankenhausaufenthalten und Wiederaufnahmen waren statistisch nicht signifikant und die Evidenz zur Operationsdauer gestaltete sich widersprüchlich. In Summe konnten nur wenige der angepriesenen Vorteile der RAS nachgewiesen werden."

Esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula: two case reports,"The incidence of esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula  is 1 out of 3000–5000 live births. Its incidence in lower middle income countries is not known. The infants usually present with excessive secretions or choking while feeding and are at risk for aspiration. The outcome of these infants in lower middle income countries is not encouraging due to delays in referral, sepsis at presentation requiring preoperative stabilization, postoperative complications such as anastomosis leaks, pneumonia, and pneumothorax."
Nieuw onderzoek naar afbouwen levothyroxine bij 60-plussers,"In Nederland gebruiken bijna 250.000 65-plussers levo­thyroxine.

Psychosociale factoren voor het opstellen van een cardiovasculair risicoprofiel: aandacht voor diversiteit,"De NHG-Standaard Cardiovasculair risicomanagement (CVRM) adviseert om bij patiënten met risicofactoren voor hart- en vaatziekten, zoals obesitas, roken en een positieve familieanamnese, een cardiovasculair risicoprofiel op te stellen. In dit onderzoek onderzochten wij in een multi-etnische populatie of psychosociale factoren ook gebruikt kunnen worden als criteria voor het opstellen van een risicoprofiel, en of dit leidt tot een verbetering in de preselectie voor risicoscreening van hart- en vaatziekten (HVZ). In onze analyses hadden we expliciet oog voor diversiteit: we keken naar overeenkomsten en verschillen tussen vrouwen en mannen met diverse etnische achtergronden."

Gate Engineered Ferroelectric Junctionless BioFET for Label-Free Detection of Biomolecules,"A gate engineered ferroelectric junctionless field-effect transistor biosensor (BioFET) is proposed and investigated for label-free detection of various biomolecules. A nanocavity is created by etching a part of the gate oxide material on the top and bottom of the device, which allows biomolecules to get immobilized. The immobilization of biomolecules in the cavity causes changes in electrostatic characteristics such as surface potential, input and output characteristics, transconductance, output conductance, gate capacitance, and cutoff frequency used as sensing metrics. The biosensor is also examined at different biomolecule concentrations (−1 × 1012 cm−2, 0 cm−2, and 1 × 1012 cm−2). The transistor’s sensitivity is then understood by looking at the fluctuation in threshold voltage, subthreshold swing, and switching ratio. The performance is compared between the ferroelectric junctionless BioFET and the gate engineered ferroelectric junctionless BioFET. The results indicate that the gate engineered ferroelectric junctionless BioFET shows the maximum improvement for protein (1202.4%, 111%, and 565%) and DNA (787.5%, 117.3%, and 600%). The gate engineered ferroelectric junctionless BioFET is shown to be suitable for ultrasensitive bio-sensing applications."
X-Ray Diffraction Studies of l-Isoleucine Under Shocked Conditions,"One of the most important industrial requirements is to find the materials which have the tendency to withstand harsh environments, such as high pressure, high temperature, and radiation environments, so that they will maintain high efficiency in these conditions. Such materials are greatly required for aerospace, defense, and high-temperature molecular device fabrications. In the present context, we have chosen l-isoleucine samples to assess the crystallographic phase stability under dynamic shocked conditions. The stability result has been screened by a powder x-ray diffractometer (PXRD). Based on the observed diffraction results, it is well evidenced by the cleavage planes, such as (002) (003), (004), (005), and (006), that the applied shock waves do not induce any crystallographic phase transitions and lattice deformations even at 200 shocks. The unit cell dimensions of the l-isoleucine sample were a = 9.752 Å, b = 5.321 Å, c = 14.13 Å and V = 728 Å3 which were found to be the same under all numbers of shocked conditions. Hence, the l-isoleucine sample is strongly suggested for device fabrication, and previous static high-pressure experimental results also support this suggestion."
Selective blockade of IL-21 by myricetin impedes T follicular helper cell differentiation by negatively regulating the JAK/STAT/Bcl-6 pathway in a rheumatoid arthritis animal model,"Interleukin (IL)-21 is a major lineage-defining factor that promotes Tfh cell differentiation. The current study investigated the molecular basis of myricetin, a flavonoid that impedes IL-21-mediated differentiation of Tfh cells in RA. Through high-throughput virtual screening of natural compounds that inhibit IL-21, we found that myricetin binds to IL-21 and hampers its interaction with IL-21 receptor (IL-21R). Our in vivo studies demonstrated that myricetin treatment ameliorated the clinical manifestations in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) mice by reducing paw thickness and cellular infiltration. In addition, myricetin inhibited splenic Tfh cell differentiation and IL-21 production in AIA mice. Myricetin negatively regulates JAK/STAT signaling and the downstream Bcl-6 transcription factor at the molecular level, which arrests Tfh cell differentiation. Our current research proposal to target IL-21 with myricetin inevitably represents a new molecular approach that expedites new alternative drugs for rheumatoid arthritis therapy."
"Lead-free cesium antimony halide perovskites: halide alloying, surfaces, interfaces, and clusters","Lead-free Cs3Sb2X9 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskites have emerged as eco-friendly alternatives to traditional photovoltaic and optoelectronic materials. This research uses DFT for a comprehensive analysis, bridging knowledge gaps about halide alloying, structural changes, and surface properties on these materials. Analysis of enthalpy of formation and miscibility gap temperature pointed to which solid solutions of \({{\text{Cs}}}_{3}{{\text{Sb}}}_{2}{{\text{X}}}_{9-{\text{n}}}{\mathrm{X^{\prime}}}_{{\text{n}}}\) are more likely to be experimentally obtained. CsX-terminated low-index (1000) and (0001) surfaces present distinct electronic properties, underscoring the importance of surface control during materials preparation in fine-tuning for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications. The properties of Cs3Sb2X9 nanocrystals were estimated through cluster simulations, shedding light on the role of geometry as a possible contributor to the high photoluminescence observed in previous experimental reports on Cs3Sb2Br9 nanocrystals. The study on halide perovskite interfaces suggested Cs3Sb2Br9|Cs3Sb2I9 for photovoltaics and Cs3Sb2Br9|Cs3Sb2Cl9 for photoluminescence, based on band alignment and electronic structure. Our findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of lead-free Cs3Sb2X9 perovskites but also provide practical guidance for experimentalists in designing cesium antimony halide perovskites with tailored optical and electronic properties. This contributing supports the development of sustainable energy solutions for optoelectronic devices."
Effect of Electrochemical Hydrogen Charging on Hydrogen Embrittlement and Mechanical Properties of Quenched Tempered X100 Pipeline Steel,"In this research, the efficacy of specific heat treatment procedures in mitigating hydrogen embrittlement in X100 pipeline steels is discussed. The studied steels underwent a one-step austenitization process at temperatures of 780 °C (HT1), 830 °(HT2), and 880 °C (HT3) for 90 min, followed by oil quenching, tempering at 600 °C, and air cooling. The susceptibility of both the heat-treated and as-received (REF) specimens to HIC was assessed using an electrochemical hydrogen charging, tensile testing, micro-hardness testing, and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) techniques. The results showed that an increase in annealing temperature from 780 to 880 °C considerably decreases hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility. The hardness value at the centerline of the as-received (REF) specimen was found to be higher than that of the heat-treated specimens. Additionally, calculations of the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) index for all specimens were conducted. The results show that the REF specimen, which demonstrated the highest hardness and HE index values, has greater susceptibility to HIC. Conversely, the HT3 specimen, which was annealed at 880 °C and displayed the lowest hardness and HE index values, showed commendable resistance to HIC. The EBSD analysis revealed a decrease in Kernel average misorientation (KAM) values in heat-treated specimens, with the lowest values found in HT3. Dominant textures in all studied steels, {011} and {111}, were considered HIC-resistant and recrystallization mapping indicated a peak area of recrystallized grains in the REF specimen."
Analyzing the angular acceleration vector of a moving rigid body,"This paper presents a novel and systematic approach for obtaining the angular acceleration vector of a moving rigid body. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the particular form of writing the pose of the moving rigid body, as well as in the procedure to compute its time derivatives. The derivation process goes directly to the very foundations of rotational motion and exploits the phenomenological connection between orientation, angular velocity, angular acceleration, and spatial motion of a rigid body. Hence, as a remarkable result, a symbolic expression for the angular acceleration vector arises naturally without the need to solve the inverse acceleration problem. The novel and general expression of the angular acceleration vector involves relationships between the position, velocity, and acceleration vectors of three non-collinear points of the body, which can be easily understood and physically interpreted without particular knowledge of specialized techniques or advanced mathematical tools. Due to its vector nature, the expression for the angular acceleration vector proposed in this paper is relatively simple, as well as, it is very robust against computational singularities. Two fully detailed case studies demonstrate the robustness of the proposed angular acceleration vector compared with other expressions appearing in the literature."
Invariant set theorems for non-autonomous time-fractional systems,"Though the commonly used fractional Lyapunov stability and LaSalle theorems have been beneficial in the development of the theory and applications of fractional derivatives, their proofs hold certain flaws which can make their applicability questionable. From this point, we established new invariant set-based stability theorems for fractional order Caputo systems. As a consequence, we have obtained the fractional version of the Lyapunov stability theorem. In addition, sufficient conditions for the uniform asymptotic stability of Caputo systems are derived. Finally, two illustrative applications from population dynamics are presented to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results."
Chaetomium elatum treatment of nitrocellulose: investigation on structural and thermal properties,"Biological methods present a sustainable approach for treating various waste polymers due to green, low-cost, mild condition and simple operation. This study, a novel biological method to process nitrocellulose (NC) to obtain NC with low nitrogen via nitrate ester removal using fungal Chaetomium elatum is proposed. The N% of NC continuously declined during the course of six days, from 13.06% to 11.71%, and the intensity of its energetic groups (O-NO2, -NO2) also weakened. An examination of the thermal properties of NC revealed that the weight-loss ratio decreased after biotreatment from 86.33% (untreated NC) to 66.20% (treated NC).Furthermore, the kinetic parameters of the thermal decomposition reaction with DSC were calculated and the activation energy (Ea) of biotreated NC was higher than that of the original, indicating the thermal stability was enhanced. Hence, this structure exploration and thermal analysis provide new methods for further investigating the mechanism of the biological denitrification process and assessing the safety of biotreated NC."

Estimation of a likelihood ratio ordered family of distributions,"Consider bivariate observations \((X_1,Y_1), \ldots , (X_n,Y_n) \in {\mathbb {R}}\times {\mathbb {R}}\) with unknown conditional distributions \(Q_x\) of Y, given that \(X = x\). The goal is to estimate these distributions under the sole assumption that \(Q_x\) is isotonic in x with respect to likelihood ratio order. If the observations are identically distributed, a related goal is to estimate the joint distribution \(\mathcal {L}(X,Y)\) under the sole assumption that it is totally positive of order two. An algorithm is developed which estimates the unknown family of distributions \((Q_x)_x\) via empirical likelihood. The benefit of the stronger regularization imposed by likelihood ratio order over the usual stochastic order is evaluated in terms of estimation and predictive performances on simulated as well as real data."
Intelligent hydrogel on–off controller sensor for irrigation,"As a functional material, hydrogels hold promise in agricultural irrigation, potentially solving the problem of low utilization of irrigation water from the source. To enable more intuitive monitoring of soil moisture and achieve on-demand irrigation, a conductive hydrogel is being explored as a solenoid valve controller for intelligent irrigation. Here, intelligent hydrogel poly (acrylic acid-co–N-methylolacrylamide)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate, P(AA-co–N-MA)/PEDOT:PSS, with a dual network was synthesized under mild conditions through Na2SO3-APS (ammonium persulfate) initiation system. The structural design endows the hydrogel with excellent mechanical properties (elongation at break up to 2400%) and sensitive sensing performance (gauge factor, GF, is 8.14). The anti-fatigue properties of the hydrogel have proved that the material has good durability and good service life as a sensing material. In addition, by incorporating the relationship between moisture and conductivity, the hydrogel could be utilized as a controller for irrigation valves, enabling intelligent irrigation and effective conservation of water resources through soil moisture monitoring."
A test of loyalty,"We propose and test a model of loyalty in games. Players can mutually maintain loyalty by working towards a common goal that is pareto-superior to any Nash equilibrium without it. Loyalty imposes a psychological cost on defecting in an ongoing cooperation, which is thus sustained. We distinguish loyalty from reciprocity and explain how it complements guilt aversion with two dynamic games from a field experiment conducted in a Pakistani factory. The evidence supports the validity of loyalty, which has a stronger effect within than between groups."
Comparative study of evolutionary machine learning approaches to simulate the rheological characteristics of polybutylene succinate (PBS) utilized for fused deposition modeling (FDM),"Polymer filament fabrication and its printability are influenced significantly by rheological behavior. This influence can pose a significant obstacle when attempting to transition fused deposition modeling (FDM) from the laboratory to industrial or clinical settings. The aim of this study is to demonstrate how machine learning (ML) approaches can speed up the development of polymer filaments for FDM. Four types of ML methods: artificial neural network, support vector regression, polynomial chaos expansion (PCE), and response surface model, were used to predict the rheological behaivior of polybutylene succinate. In general, all four approaches presented significantly high correlation values with respect to the training and testing data stages. Remarkably, the PCE algorithm repeatedly provided the highest correlation for each response variable in both the training and testing stages. Noteworthy, variation differs between response variables rather than between algorithms. Taken together, these modeling approaches could be used to optimize filament extrusion processes."
Design and analysis of spider-web photonic crystal fiber in the terahertz regime,"In this paper, we have proposed a novel photonic crystal fiber (PCF) design having a spider-web (SW) cladding. The finite element method (FEM)-based COMSOL Multiphysics software has been used to investigate the guiding properties and performance of the fiber in the terahertz radiation regime. Detailed numerical analyses ensure that proposed fiber design possesses a low confinement loss (\(\sim 10^{ - 17} {\text{cm}}^{ - 1} ) \)) and low effective material loss (EML). The high core power fraction of \(99\%\) and the effective mode area of \(1.06 \times 10^{ - 5} {\text{m}}^{2} \) make this fiber an exception. V-parameter confirms the single-mode behavior of fiber over 0.1–3.0-THz frequency range. Thus, we can say that the proposed fiber can be useful in various applications of terahertz propagation such as broadband transmission, biosensors, and chemical sensors."
Analyzing the Effects of Culture Media Additives on Oxalic Acid Bioproduction for Use in Metal Bioleaching,"Oxalic acid, widely used in industries like metallurgy, was produced using A. niger in this study. Different culture media additives, including manganese ions, ethanol, carbonate ions, sodium citrate, sodium oxalate, succinic acid, ascorbic acid, and buffered medium, were investigated for their impact on oxalic acid production. The study also assessed the effectiveness of biogenerated oxalic acid for extracting metals from autocatalyst waste. Findings showed that adding 6 g/L sodium citrate, 6 g/L disodium oxalate, 0.1 g/L MnSO4·H2O, 1%(v/v) ethanol, 5 g/L CaCO3, and a buffered medium at pH 6 stimulated the highest production of oxalic acid, resulting in concentrations of 9228, 10,804, 4952, 5289, 6955, and 11,929 mg/L, respectively. Without any additives, the production of oxalic acid was measured at 4727 mg/L. Oxalic acid exhibited greater efficiency in extracting Pt and Pd from autocatalyst waste at low pH. However, CaCO3 and buffer medium, while effective for high oxalic acid production, created an unsuitable high pH environment for metal extraction. Consequently, by incorporating the combination of screened additives into the liquid fungal culture medium, higher oxalic acid production was achieved in a shorter cultivation time while maintaining a suitable pH for the metal leaching process."
Targeted co-delivery of FOXM1 aptamer and DOX by nucleolin aptamer-functionalized pH-responsive biocompatible nanodelivery system to enhance therapeutic efficacy against breast cancer: in vitro and in vivo,"Targeted nanodelivery systems offer a promising approach to cancer treatment, including the most common cancer in women, breast cancer. In this study, a targeted, pH-responsive, and biocompatible nanodelivery system based on nucleolin aptamer-functionalized biogenic titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TNP) was developed for targeted co-delivery of FOXM1 aptamer and doxorubicin (DOX) to improve breast cancer therapy. The developed targeted nanodelivery system exhibited almost spherical morphology with 124.89 ± 12.97 nm in diameter and zeta potential value of − 23.78 ± 3.66 mV. FOXM1 aptamer and DOX were loaded into the nanodelivery system with an efficiency of 100% and 97%, respectively. Moreover, the targeted nanodelivery system demonstrated excellent stability in serum and a pH-responsive sustained drug release profile over a period of 240 h following Higuchi kinetic and Fickian diffusion mechanism. The in vitro cytotoxicity experiments demonstrated that the targeted nanodelivery system provided selective internalization and strong growth inhibition effects of about 45 and 51% against nucleolin-positive 4T1 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. It is noteworthy that these phenomena were not observed in nucleolin-negative cells (CHO). The preclinical studies revealed that a single-dose intravenous injection of the targeted nanodelivery system into 4T1-bearing mice inhibited tumor growth by 1.7- and 1.4-fold more efficiently than the free drug and the non-targeted nanodelivery system, respectively. Our results suggested that the developed innovative targeted pH-responsive biocompatible nanodelivery system could serve as a prospectively potential platform to improve breast cancer treatment."
Immunostimulatory nanoparticles delivering cytokines as a novel cancer nanoadjuvant to empower glioblastoma immunotherapy,"Glioblastoma (GBM) stands as a highly aggressive and deadly malignant primary brain tumor with a median survival time of under 15 months upon disease diagnosis. While immunotherapies have shown promising results in solid cancers, brain cancers are still unresponsive to immunotherapy due to immunological dysfunction and the presence of a blood–brain barrier. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) emerges as a potent cytokine in fostering anti-tumor immunity by triggering interferon-gamma production in T and natural killer cells and changing macrophages to a tumoricidal phenotype. However, systemic administration of IL-12 toxicity in clinical trials often leads to significant toxicity, posing a critical hurdle. To overcome this major drawback, we have formulated a novel nanoadjuvant composed of immunostimulatory nanoparticles (ISN) loaded with IL-12 to decrease IL-12 toxicity and enhance the immune response by macrophages and GBM cancer cells. Our in vitro results reveal that ISN substantially increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in GBM cancer cells (e.g. 2.6 × increase in IL-8 expression compared to free IL-12) and macrophages (e.g. 2 × increase in TNF-α expression and 6 × increase in IL-6 expression compared to the free IL-12). These findings suggest a potential modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, our study demonstrates the effective intracellular delivery of IL-12 by ISN, triggering alterations in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines at both transcriptional and protein expression levels. These results highlight the promise of the nanoadjuvant as a prospective platform for resharing the GBM microenvironment and empowering immunotherapy."
Bibliometric and visualized analysis of cancer nanomedicine from 2013 to 2023,"Cancer nanomedicine has been an emerging field for drug development against malignant tumors during the past three decades. A bibliometric analysis was performed to characterize the current international trends and present visual representations of the evolution and emerging trends in the research and development of nanocarriers for cancer treatment. This study employed bibliometric analysis and visualization techniques to analyze the literature on antitumor nanocarriers published between 2013 and 2023. A total of 98,980 articles on antitumor nanocarriers were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database and analyzed using the Citespace software for specific characteristics such as publication year, countries/regions, organizations, keywords, and references. Network visualization was constructed by VOSviewer and Citespace. From 2013 to 2023, the annual global publications increased 7.39 times, from 1851 to 13,683. People’s Republic of China (2588 publications) was the most productive country. Chinese Academy of Sciences (298 publications) was the most productive organization. The top 5 high-frequency keywords were “nanoparticles,” “drug delivery,” “nanomedicine,” “cancer,” and “nanocarriers.” The keywords with the strongest citation bursts recently were “cancer immunotherapy,” “microenvironment,” “antitumor immunity,” etc., which indicated the emerging frontiers of antitumor nanomedicine. The co-occurrence cluster analysis of the keywords formed 6 clusters, and most of the top 10 publications by citation counts focused on cluster #1 (nanocarriers) and cluster #2 (cancer immunotherapy). We further provided insightful discussions into the identified subtopics to help researchers gain more details of current trends and hotspots in this field. The present study processes a macro-level literature analysis of antitumor nanocarriers and provides new perspectives and research directions for future development in cancer nanomedicine."
Numerical Analysis for Behavior of Stainless-Steel Web Cleat Connections at Elevated Temperatures,"Stainless steel offers the advantages of excellent mechanical properties and exceptional corrosion resistance, making it a commonly used material in engineering. However, occasional fire incidents in engineering pose a significant risk to the safety of stainless steel structures. Among the critical components, the stainless steel beam-to-column connections play a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of stainless steel frames. Neglecting the influence of temperature on these connections could lead to catastrophic accidents in engineering. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to observe the behavior of stainless steel web cleat connections (SSWCC) at elevated temperatures. A finite element method, which has been validated through prior experiments, is developed to predict the behavior of the SSWCC under shear at elevated temperatures. The influences of various parameters, such as the number of bolts, angle thickness, gage distance, and temperature, on the moment-rotation behavior of the SSWCC are discussed. Temperature significantly affects both the initial rigidity and moment capacity of the SSWCC. Specifically, the initial rigidity and moment capacity of specimens decrease by 75% and 85%, respectively, when the temperature increases from 300°C to 900°C. Previous models do not precisely match the moment-rotation curves of the SSWCC at elevated temperatures; consequently, more precise model for the initial rigidity of the SSWCC at elevated temperatures are proposed in this work.

Chaetomium elatum treatment of nitrocellulose: investigation on structural and thermal properties,"Biological methods present a sustainable approach for treating various waste polymers due to green, low-cost, mild condition and simple operation. This study, a novel biological method to process nitrocellulose (NC) to obtain NC with low nitrogen via nitrate ester removal using fungal Chaetomium elatum is proposed. The N% of NC continuously declined during the course of six days, from 13.06% to 11.71%, and the intensity of its energetic groups (O-NO2, -NO2) also weakened. An examination of the thermal properties of NC revealed that the weight-loss ratio decreased after biotreatment from 86.33% (untreated NC) to 66.20% (treated NC).Furthermore, the kinetic parameters of the thermal decomposition reaction with DSC were calculated and the activation energy (Ea) of biotreated NC was higher than that of the original, indicating the thermal stability was enhanced. Hence, this structure exploration and thermal analysis provide new methods for further investigating the mechanism of the biological denitrification process and assessing the safety of biotreated NC."
Selective blockade of IL-21 by myricetin impedes T follicular helper cell differentiation by negatively regulating the JAK/STAT/Bcl-6 pathway in a rheumatoid arthritis animal model,"Interleukin (IL)-21 is a major lineage-defining factor that promotes Tfh cell differentiation. The current study investigated the molecular basis of myricetin, a flavonoid that impedes IL-21-mediated differentiation of Tfh cells in RA. Through high-throughput virtual screening of natural compounds that inhibit IL-21, we found that myricetin binds to IL-21 and hampers its interaction with IL-21 receptor (IL-21R). Our in vivo studies demonstrated that myricetin treatment ameliorated the clinical manifestations in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) mice by reducing paw thickness and cellular infiltration. In addition, myricetin inhibited splenic Tfh cell differentiation and IL-21 production in AIA mice. Myricetin negatively regulates JAK/STAT signaling and the downstream Bcl-6 transcription factor at the molecular level, which arrests Tfh cell differentiation. Our current research proposal to target IL-21 with myricetin inevitably represents a new molecular approach that expedites new alternative drugs for rheumatoid arthritis therapy."

Radionuclides deposition on sea surface following hypothetical accidental releases at Korean nuclear power plant,"The scenarios of deposition on the sea surface around the Korean Peninsula following hypothetical release at Kori NPP were studied by application of the atmospheric transport model FLEXPART. The series of 1460 dispersion scenarios was calculated, covering the time period of 1 year. The total depositions on the surfaces of the East/Japan Sea (EJS), Yellow Sea (YS), East China Sea (ECS), and near-coast zone of 200-km vicinity around the Korean Peninsula, normalized on the total emission inventory were analyzed. The normalized deposition on the total area of 3 seas varied by more than 2 orders of magnitude from 0.003 to 0.59. The fraction of wet deposition in total deposition varied from 0 to 0.99. The selected most heavy deposition scenarios were divided into those dominated by dry deposition and wet deposition. The most conservative release scenarios (7 August 2020 and 2 September 2020) were dominated by wet deposition and were caused by the monsoon rainband and passage of the typhoon. In the scenario of 7 August 2020, 96% of deposition appeared in the near-coast zone. Cluster analysis of dispersion scenarios confirmed strong seasonal dependence of deposition patterns. For EJS and YS, the maximum average deposition was reached in the ‘Summer’ cluster. For ECS the maximum average normalized deposition was reached in the ‘Spring + Fall’ cluster (\(D_{r} = 0.055\)). Minimum average deposition on all seas was obtained for the ‘Winter’ cluster."

Spiritual-Cultural Needs as the Main Causative Factor of Death Anxiety in Iranian COVID-19 Patients: A Qualitative Study,"COVID-19 patients have been reported to more than likely experience a variety of difficult physical and psychological problems. This qualitative study aims to perceive psychological experiences in COVID-19 patients in Iran. The study method is qualitative, with a conventional content analysis approach adopted. Purposive sampling was applied to 20 COVID-19 patients admitted to medical wards at hospitals in Tehran, Iran. Additionally, data were collected using semi-structured interviews. All data were analyzed based on the method proposed by Lindgren et al. (Int J Nurs Stud 108:103632, 2020). Data analysis identified the main theme to be “death fear and anxiety” with five main categories. These categories included the feelings of death panic and apprehension, uncertainty and ambiguity, fear of abandonment, fear of an unknown future for the family, and fear of unmet spiritual–cultural needs. Accordingly, the patients’ experiences of COVID-19 contraction were unique. Against this backdrop, understanding COVID-19 patients’ complexities, experiences, beliefs, and attitudes about anxiety and death, can lead to an  improved awareness and understanding of the psychological consequences of COVID-19 by executive decision-makers, healthcare personnel and mental health professionals."
Invariant set theorems for non-autonomous time-fractional systems,"Though the commonly used fractional Lyapunov stability and LaSalle theorems have been beneficial in the development of the theory and applications of fractional derivatives, their proofs hold certain flaws which can make their applicability questionable. From this point, we established new invariant set-based stability theorems for fractional order Caputo systems. As a consequence, we have obtained the fractional version of the Lyapunov stability theorem. In addition, sufficient conditions for the uniform asymptotic stability of Caputo systems are derived. Finally, two illustrative applications from population dynamics are presented to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results."
One size fits all? The role of task complexity in L2 production via the audio chat,"The pervasive use of information and computer technology in second or foreign language learning has led researchers to explore the ideal tasks for technological environments to facilitate second language (L2) learning. This study intended to contribute new knowledge to this area by examining the effects of the task complexity manipulated along the variable +-few elements in Robinson’s Cognition Hypothesis on L2 production of 42 lower intermediate Chinese EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners who completed two interactive tasks (simple versus complex) in dyads via audio chat of the video-conferencing platform WeMeet in a laboratory setting. Participants were also instructed to measure the difficulty of the tasks by responding to a self-rating questionnaire immediately after they completed each task. Their L2 output in the two tasks were recorded, transcribed and coded in three dimensions namely, syntactic complexity, lexical complexity and accuracy. SPSS 26 was used for statistical analyses. The results revealed that increasing task complexity induced significantly more lexically complex language. However, it did not result in significant changes in terms of syntactic complexity or accuracy of learners’ L2 output via audio chat. These results contradicted the predictions of the Cognition Hypothesis, suggesting the inapplicability of Cognition Hypothesis in audio chat."
Moving object detection in satellite videos based on an improved ViBe algorithm,"This paper studies moving object detection in satellite videos, which plays a significant role for large-scale video monitoring and dynamic analysis. Due to the tiny targets, complex background, and completely or partly occlusion, moving object detection accurately from each image frame is difficult and challenging. In order to tackle the issues, we propose an improved Visual Background Extractor algorithm (ViBe) with an improved Canny edge detection operator. First, the improved Canny operator based on iteration method is employed to find the optimal high and low thresholds and extract more edges information of satellite videos. Furthermore, the eight pixels are replaced with twenty-four pixels and the times of target threshold is introduced in ViBe detection to increase the selection range of backgrounds. The experiments are tested in SATSOT datasets, where the results verify that the proposed method is more robust in complex background with interference, turning and rapid motion."
"Aureispira anguillae sp. nov., isolated from Japanese eel Anguilla japonica leptocephali","A novel filamentous eel-leptocephalus pathogenic marine bacterium, designated strain EL160426T, was isolated from Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica, leptocephali reared at a laboratory in Mie, Japan. In experimental infection studies on eel larvae, the strain EL160426T caused massive larval mortality and was reisolated from moribund leptocephali. Characteristically, observations of infected larvae found that EL160426T forms columnar colonies on the cranial surface of larvae. The novel isolate exhibited growth at 15–30 °C, pH 7–9, and seawater concentrations of 60–150% (W/V). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain EL160426T was most closely related to Aureispira maritima 59SAT with 97.7% sequence similarity. The whole genome sequence analysis of the strain EL160426T showed that the strain maintained a circular chromosome with a size of approximately 7.58 Mbp and the DNA G + C content was 36.2%. The major respiratory quinone was MK-7 and the predominant cellular fatty acids were 16:0, 20:4 w6c (arachidonic acid), 17:0 iso and 16:0 N alcohol. DNA relatedness between the closest phylogenetic neighbor strain EL160426T and A. maritima (JCM23207T) was less than 13%. On the basis of the polyphasic taxonomic data, the strain represents a novel species of the genus Aureispira, for which the name Aureispira anguillae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is EL160426T (= JCM 35024 T = TSD-286 T)."
The association between gut microbiota and resting metabolic rate in overweight/obese women: a case–control study,"When examining the underlying processes of obesity, evaluation of gut flora and energy homeostasis can be crucial since disruption of the normal gut microbiota community and energy imbalances are significant factors in the development of obesity. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the relative abundance of important obesity modulator gut microbiota (including Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Bifidobactrium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Akkermansia muciniphila, and Escherichia coli) in fecal samples of normometabilic and hypometabolic overweight/obese individuals."

Mulches assist degraded soil recovery via stimulating biogeochemical cycling: metagenomic analysis,"Soil degradation of urban greening has caused soil fertility loss and soil organic carbon depletion. Organic mulches are made from natural origin materials, and represent a cost-effective and environment-friendly remediation method for urban greening. To reveal the effects of organic mulch on soil physicochemical characteristics and fertility, we selected a site that was covered with organic mulch for 6 years and a nearby lawn-covered site. The results showed that soil organic matter, total nitrogen, and available phosphorus levels were improved, especially at a depth of 0–20 cm. The activities of cellulase, invertase, and dehydrogenase in soil covered with organic mulch were 17.46%, 78.98%, and 283.19% higher than those under lawn, respectively. The marker genes of fermentation, aerobic respiration, methanogenesis, and methane oxidation were also enriched in the soil under organic mulch. Nitrogen cycling was generally repressed by the organic mulch, but the assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reduction processes were enhanced. The activity of alkaline phosphatase was 12.63% higher in the mulch-covered soil, and functional genes involved in phosphorus cycling were also enriched. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of the influence of organic mulch on soil microbes and provides a deeper insight into the recovery strategy for soil degradation following urban greening."
One-Year Follow-Up Results of MIS-C Patients with Coronary Artery Involvement: A Multi-center Study,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) in children is a rare complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Knowing the course of the affected or unaffected coronary arteries in the patients under follow-up is important in terms of defining the long-term prognosis of the disease and determining the follow-up plan. This is a multicenter and retrospective study. The data were obtained from nine different centers. Between May 2020 and August 2022, 68 of 790 patients had coronary artery involvement. One-year echocardiographic data of 67 of 789 MIS-C patients with coronary artery involvement were analyzed. Existing pathologies of the coronary arteries were grouped as increased echogenicity, dilatation and aneurysm according to Z scores, and their changes over a 1-year period were determined. The data of all three groups are defined as frequency. SPSS Statistics version 22 was used to evaluate the data. In our study, aneurysm was observed in 16.4%, dilatation in 68.7% and increased echogenicity in 13.4% of the patients. All of the patients with involvement in the form of increased echogenicity recovered without sequelae by the end of the first month. No progression to aneurysm was observed in any of the patients with dilatation. No new-onset involvement was observed in patients with previously healthy coronary arteries during the convalescent period. In addition, from the sixth month follow-up period, there was no worsening in the amount of dilatation in any of the patients. At least 94% of the patients who completed the 12th month control period returned to normal."
Resistance exercise in combination with aerobic exercise reduces the incidence of serious events in patients with liver cirrhosis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Exercise, particularly resistance exercise, is beneficial for sarcopenia in patients with liver cirrhosis.

"New Nano-Silica Supported Basic Ionic Liquids-Catalyzed Multicomponent Synthesis of imidazo [1,2-a] Pyridines Under Solvent-Free Conditions","Recently, the development of supported ionic liquid on magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) and multicomponent reactions in industry and academia has been a matter of intense study. In this new and environmentally benign synthetic methodology, a dihydroxyl functionalized basic ionic liquid precursor was immobilized onto the magnetic silica nanoparticles via covalent bonding to prepare a novel powerful basic catalyst (DHBIL@Si-MNPs). The synthesized catalyst was characterized extensively by various techniques. Also, the alkalinity of the DHBIL@Si-MNPs catalyst (pKb value) was obtained at 9.23. The catalytic activity of the prepared catalyst was investigated in a one-pot and three-component reaction between pyridine, phenacyl bromide, and thiocyanate to afford corresponding substituted imidazo [1,2-a] Pyridine derivatives under solvent-free conditions. Different spectroscopic methods were used to establish the structures of target compounds. The imidazopyridines were generated in excellent yields (80–98%) under the optimum conditions utilizing 10% by weight of DHBIL@Si-MNPs to pyridine, a molar ratio of 1.2: 1.2: 1 mmol (mmol), and a temperature of 100 °C. The present developed synthetic protocol permits the production of interesting medicinal compounds with high purity and different functional group tolerating abilities. Also, the other significant advantages of this protocol are highlighted by less reaction time, cleaner reaction profiles, avoidance of toxic catalysts, simplicity of the process, benign reaction conditions, use of available raw materials, and easy separation of products. The catalyst could be easily recycled from the reaction mixture using an external magnet thanks to its superparamagnetic and reused several times without any appreciable decrease in its reactivity and product yield."
Semiparametric estimation in generalized additive partial linear models with nonignorable nonresponse data,"We address the semiparametric challenge of identifying and estimating generalized additive partial linear models with nonignorable missingness in the response. Identifiability is ensured under instrumental variable assumption that there is an instrumental covariate related to the prospensity but unrelated to the response variable, or the assumption that the conditional score function is linear in the response variable. We propose a new estimating equation for the prospensity by taking expectation of the unobservable part on a linear combination of all covariates rather than the covariates themselves. This estimating equation does not suffer from the typical curse of dimensionality. Then the unknown nonparametric function is approximated by polynomial spline basis functions and we construct estimating equations for mean of response based on the inverse probability weighting. Under some regular conditions, we establish asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators for parametric components and consistency of the estimators of nonparametric functions. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed inference procedure performs well in many settings. The proposed method is applied to analyze the household income dataset from the Chinese Household Income Project Survey 2013."

Effects of climate and winter cover crops on nutrient loss in agricultural watersheds in the midwestern U.S.,"Nutrient runoff from agricultural regions of the midwestern U.S. corn belt has degraded water quality in many inland and coastal water bodies such as the Great Lakes and Gulf of Mexico. Under current climate, observational studies have shown that winter cover crops can reduce dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus losses from row-cropped agricultural watersheds, but performance of cover crops in response to climate variability and climate change has not been systematically evaluated. Using the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, calibrated using multiple years of field-based data, we simulated historical and projected future nutrient loss from two representative agricultural watersheds in northern Indiana, USA. For 100% cover crop coverage, historical simulations showed a 31–33% reduction in nitrate (NO3−) loss and a 15–23% reduction in Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP) loss in comparison with a no-cover-crop baseline. Under climate change scenarios, without cover crops, projected warmer and wetter conditions strongly increased nutrient loss, especially in the fallow period from Oct to Apr when changes in infiltration and runoff are largest. In the absence of cover crops, annual nutrient losses for the RCP8.5 2080s scenario were 26–38% higher for NO3−, and 9–46% higher for SRP. However, the effectiveness of cover crops also increased under climate change. For an ensemble of 60 climate change scenarios based on CMIP5 RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, 19 out of 24 ensemble-mean simulations of future nutrient loss with 100% cover crops were less than or equal to historical simulations with 100% cover crops, despite systematic increases in nutrient loss due to climate alone. These results demonstrate that planting winter cover crops over row-cropped land areas constitutes a robust climate change adaptation strategy for reducing nutrient losses from agricultural lands, enhancing resilience to a projected warmer and wetter winter climate in the midwestern U.S."
Potential to reduce the nitrate residue after harvest in maize fields without sacrificing yield through precision nitrogen management,"Site-specific nitrogen management has been proposed as a tool to increase crop yield while decreasing nutrient losses to the environment. Many reports can be found on sensing technologies to quantify the variability within a field and the definition of management zones based on the observed variability. However, fewer studies have been dedicated to the selection of the most suitable N fertilizer management scenario: should more or less nutrients be applied in the zones with a lower crop productivity potential? To address this knowledge gap, nine Flemish maize fields were selected as potential candidates for precision fertilization based on the soil maps and historical vegetation index patterns. Within each field, two management zones were identified based on historical vegetation index patterns and electrical conductivity maps, and different fertilization strategies were tested in each zone. The field trial results in terms of yield and soil residual nitrate showed that site-specific N management outperforms the conventional practice only in the fields with temporally stable management zones. In the fields having differences in the physical soil properties (e.g. presence of stones or clay particles), affecting water availability, lower fertilization in zones with a poor soil productivity potential could be recommended. In the fields where the performance of the management zones changes from year to year mainly due to annual variation in precipitation, a risk of incorrect implementation of the precision fertilization concept was identified. Historical NDVI time series serve a good basis to delineate the temporally stable management zones."
Thermodynamic modeling and exergy analysis of a gas turbine and fuel cell hybrid system (SOFC + GT) equipped with single-effect and double-effect absorption chillers,"One of the reliable methods to make more use of energy production sources, is to use power generation units that use a fuel source, and by utilizing any wasted energy, bring the temperature of the exhaust gases closer to the ambient temperature. The use of waste energy of exhaust gases increases the efficiency and improves the performance of the system. The purpose of this paper is to make optimal use of gas turbine exhaust gases and use them to produce cooling in absorption chillers. And then analyze the thermodynamic and exergy performance of a triple hybrid system to generate electrical, heating and cooling energy. In this research, a hybrid cycle of a gas turbine and a fuel cell is considered as the primary actuator, and two single-effect and double-effect absorption chillers are considered as the secondary actuator. To perform this research, two proposed hybrid systems with their peripherals have been analyzed from a thermodynamic point. To have high accuracy results, in addition to thermodynamic analysis, the thermal and the electrochemical analysis has also been performed in order to the importance of the fuel cell in the hybrid system in this component. In the following, the effect of compressor pressure ratio, turbine inlet temperature, evaporator inlet water temperature, cooling tower inlet temperature and generator inlet temperature on energy and exergy efficiency, as well as exergy destruction rate in the system has been checked with the parametric study of the mentioned hybrid system. The results show that the increase in compressor pressure ratio causes the increase of electrical efficiency and exergy efficiency and the decrease of exergy destruction rate of the system. Also, if a double-effect absorption chiller is used instead of a single-effect absorption chiller, the energy efficiency and exergy will increase by 8% and 2%, respectively, and the exergy destruction rate will decrease by 5.4%."
Double-index rainfall warning and probabilistic physically based model for fast-moving landslide hazard analysis in subtropical-typhoon area,"In subtropical typhoon-prone regions, landslides are triggered by short-duration intense rainfall and prolonged periods of elevated pore-water pressure. However, fast-moving landslides pose a significant challenge for timely warning because of insufficient data on rainfall triggers and the identification of potential failure sites. Thus, our study introduces an integrated approach that combines a double-index intensity-duration (I-D) threshold, accounting for daily rainfall (R0) and 5-d effective rainfall (R5), with the MC-TRIGRS, a probabilistic physically based model, to analyze fast-moving landslide hazards at a regional scale. This approach is characterized by its innovative features: (i) it employs a double-index model to categorize rainfall events, differentiating between long-term continuous rainfall and short-term intense precipitation; (ii) it utilizes a comprehensive dataset from extensive field investigations to implement the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) -enhanced long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) to predict soil thickness distributions across the study area; and (iii) it adopts the classical Monte Carlo method to calculate failure probabilities under various rainfall scenarios, incorporating randomness in key soil parameters, such as cohesion and internal friction angle. By leveraging geotechnical data from both field and laboratory tests and integrating the accumulated knowledge, these models can be applied to the coastal mountainous basins of Eastern China, a region highly prone to landslides. Our goal was to augment the effectiveness of landslide early warning systems. Particularly, the synergistic use of rainfall empirical statistics and probabilistic physically based slope stability models is poised to bolster real-time control and risk mitigation strategies, providing a robust solution for short-term preparedness."
Characterization and geophysical evaluation of the recent 2023 Alausí landslide in the northern Andes of Ecuador,"The province of Chimborazo located in the northern Andes of Ecuador presents many intrinsic factors, which contribute to the occurrence of mass movements, leaving in many of the cases registered damages of materials and loss of life. The recent landslide of March 26, 2023, in the Alausí canton is an event of great interest due to the magnitude of the occurred destruction and the corresponding fatalities. Therefore, there are two predominant objectives of the current study, of which the first has been to determine the most relevant characteristics of this mass movement by identifying and analyzing the geomorphology of the recorded slope movement and the lithological units involved, by field work and through geophysical surveys. Secondly, we performed a preliminary study of the possible triggers of the movement by means of the historical analysis of the precipitations during the months of January to March of the last decade and the study of the recent seismic series. However, through the obtained analysis, it is determined that the study site is composed of three distinctive lithological units. The observed mass movement is of the rotational type, as result of the intense rainfall that occurred during the first quarter of 2023, being hereby the most probable triggering factor. This corresponds to a 600% increase in the average monthly rainfall compared to the period from 2010 to 2022."
Contrasting physical mechanisms linking stratospheric polar vortex stretching events to cold Eurasia between autumn and late winter,"The weak stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) is usually linked to Northern Hemisphere cold spells. Based on the fifth generation of ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis and WACCM model experiments, we use K-means cluster analysis to extract the zonally asymmetric pattern of October-February stratospheric variability, which involves a stretched SPV and hence leads to cold surges in Northern Hemispheric mid-latitudes. There are contrasting effects and mechanisms between autumn (October–November) and late winter (February) SPV stretching events. In October, anomalies in the stratospheric circulation affect the near-surface 16–20 days after the weakening of the SPV. This contributes to a shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) towards its negative phase, leading to cold anomalies over northern Eurasia. Together with the weakening of planetary wave-1 during days 31–40, the second stratosphere–troposphere coupling strengthens the East Asian trough and the Siberian high, resulting in Eurasian high-latitude cooling. For November, the suppressed upward propagation of wave-1 during days 11–15 is conducive to anomalous high pressure over northern Europe and thereby European cooling through a stratospheric pathway, while for days 21–30, the weakening of propagating wave-2 over Eastern Europe intensifies the mid-latitude wave train through a tropospheric pathway, favorable for cold temperatures in mid-latitude East Asia. In contrast, the late winter SPV stretching events and the attendant Eurasian coldness during 11–25 days are likely to have been simultaneously driven by the long-lived European high anomaly, which enhanced the upward-propagating tropospheric waves into the stratosphere and thus favored SPV stretching. It indicates that the tropospheric pathway, rather than the stratospheric pathway, plays a dominant role in cold Eurasia following February SPV stretching events."
Optimal blood tau species for the detection of Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology: an immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and autopsy study,"Plasma-to-autopsy studies are essential for validation of blood biomarkers and understanding their relation to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Few such studies have been done on phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and those that exist have made limited or no comparison of the different p-tau variants. This study is the first to use immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) to compare the accuracy of eight different plasma tau species in predicting autopsy-confirmed AD. The sample included 123 participants (AD = 69, non-AD = 54) from the Boston University Alzheimer’s disease Research Center who had an available ante-mortem plasma sample and donated their brain. Plasma samples proximate to death were analyzed by targeted IP-MS for six different tryptic phosphorylated (p-tau-181, 199, 202, 205, 217, 231), and two non-phosphorylated tau (195–205, 212–221) peptides. NIA-Reagan Institute criteria were used for the neuropathological diagnosis of AD. Binary logistic regressions tested the association between each plasma peptide and autopsy-confirmed AD status. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) statistics were generated using predicted probabilities from the logistic regression models. Odds Ratio (OR) was used to study associations between the different plasma tau species and CERAD and Braak classifications. All tau species were increased in AD compared to non-AD, but p-tau217, p-tau205 and p-tau231 showed the highest fold-changes. Plasma p-tau217 (AUC = 89.8), p-tau231 (AUC = 83.4), and p-tau205 (AUC = 81.3) all had excellent accuracy in discriminating AD from non-AD brain donors, even among those with CDR < 1). Furthermore, p-tau217, p-tau205 and p-tau231 showed the highest ORs with both CERAD (ORp-tau217 = 15.29, ORp-tau205 = 5.05 and ORp-tau231 = 3.86) and Braak staging (ORp-tau217 = 14.29, ORp-tau205 = 5.27 and ORp-tau231 = 4.02) but presented increased levels at different amyloid and tau stages determined by neuropathological examination. Our findings support plasma p-tau217 as the most promising p-tau species for detecting AD brain pathology. Plasma p-tau231 and p-tau205 may additionally function as markers for different stages of the disease."
Evaluating the Utility of Liver Transaminases as Predictors of Feto-Maternal Outcome in Lieu of Serum Bile Acids in Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy: A Prospective Observational Study,Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP) is a disorder of the second half of pregnancy causing pruritus and abnormal liver function tests (LFT). Incidence in India is 1.2–1.5%. ICP leads to adverse feto-maternal outcomes with early delivery indicated before serum bile acids (SBA) (gold standard) and hepatic transaminases are critically high. With paucity of evidence these levels are not well defined.
Deciphering microbial communities and their unique metabolic repertoire across rock-soil–plant continuum in the Dayoukeng fumarolic geothermal field of the Tatun Volcano Group,"High temperature and sulfur concentrations in geothermal sulfur fumaroles host unique microbial ecosystems with niche-specific metabolic diversity and physiological functions. In this study, the microbial communities and their functionalities associated with the Dayoukeng geothermal field and the rock-soil–plant continuum were investigated to underpin the microbial modulation at different distances from the fumaroles source. At the phylum level, Bacteroidota, Planctomycetota, Armatimonadota, and Patescibacteria were abundant in plant samples; Elusimicrobiota and Desulfobacterota were in the rock samples while Nitrospirota, Micrarchaeota, and Deinococcota were dominant in the soil samples. Acidophilic thermophiles were enriched in samples within close proximity to the fumaroles, primarily at a distance of 1 m. The sulfur and iron-oxidizing acidophilic bacterial genera such as Acidothiobacillus and Sulfobacillus were abundant in the rock samples. The thermoacidophilic archaeon Acidianus and acidophilic bacteria Acidiphilium were abundant in the soil samples. Additionally, Thermosporothrix and Acidothermus were found abundant in the plant samples. The results of the functional annotation indicated that dark sulfur oxidation, iron oxidation, and hydrogen oxidation pathways were abundant in the soil samples up to 1 m from the fumaroles, while methanogenic and fermentation pathways were more prevalent in the soil samples located 10 m from the fumaroles. Interestingly, the results of this study indicated a higher microbial richness and abundance of acidophilic communities in the soils and plants compared to the rocks of the DYK fumarolic geothermal field."
"Lessons from the holy grail of industrial psychology: theoretical, practical, and social implications for HRM in the current landscape of academia amidst the Covid-19 crisis","The relationship between job satisfaction and job performance, known as the holy grail of industrial psychology, has been extensively researched but with conflicting results. Our study revisits this relationship in the context of academic organizations amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, thus providing insights for HRM in academic settings. A dynamic cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) was employed, utilizing longitudinal data from 217 lecturers in Malaysian institutions collected before, after, and two months following the initial strict lockdown in 2020. Gender and age were also considered as potential influencing factors over time. The study, aligning with the Affective Events Theory, found no direct relationship between job satisfaction and job performance, with neither being stable over time. There were no gender differences in job satisfaction and job performance, but age was a predictor of both only at the start of the lockdown. Our study indicates that it is crucial to prioritize policies and practices that enhance lecturers’ job performance, particularly during stressful situations, since job performance is more significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The study also highlights the significance of lecturers’ job satisfaction and job performance, as two important psychological constructs, in the current landscape of academia that focuses on talent management and the development of knowledge societies."
Preparation and exploration of optical performance of novel polythiophene-ZrO2 composites,"Studies were carried out to comprehend the synergetic effect of ZrO2 on the optical behavior of Polythiophene (PTh). PTh was composited with the requisite amount of ZrO2 to produce the novel composite materials (PZs), which were further investigated for their optical properties viz. optical band-gap, extinction coefficient, refractive index, dielectric constants, and consequently optical conductivity. The studies represent the composite PZ-1 (PTh: ZrO2, 2:1 w/w%) shows a low optical band-gap (2.45 eV) as compared to PTh (3.14 eV), ZrO2 (3.51 eV) and other PZs, owing to the overlap of the valance and conduction bands of the two components. Correspondingly the optical conductivity of PZ-1 was encountered to be 1.55 × 1011 Scm−1 which is much higher as compared to all the other PZs and individual components, thus, suggesting the potential application of ZrO2-Doped PTh (PZ-1) in optoelectronic devices. The optical band gap and optical conductivity for PZs (especially PZ-1) were found to be much more promising as compared to other studies represented on PTh and its composites. Studies like FT-IR, SEM, TGA, and DSC were carried out to study the other important parameters of the PTh, ZrO2, and PZs."
High dimensional image super-resolution model based on infrared spectral imaging for aerobics training simulation monitoring,"In the process of calisthenics training, athletes’ movements need to be monitored and analyzed. The traditional monitoring method has the problem of insufficient resolution, which limits the improvement of accuracy and reliability. In this paper, a high dimensional image super resolution model is developed by using infrared spectral imaging technology to improve the monitoring and simulation results in the process of aerobics training. In this paper, infrared spectral imaging technology combined with deep learning algorithm is used to design a high dimensional image super resolution model. Infrared spectral imaging data were collected during aerobics training, and the data were trained and learned to extract features and realize super-resolution reconstruction. Finally, the model is tested and verified to evaluate its monitoring and simulation effect in aerobics training. The experimental results show that the high-dimensional image super resolution model has good monitoring and simulation effects in aerobics training. By increasing the detail and clarity of the image, the model can provide more accurate motion analysis and motion suggestions, so as to help the trainer improve the movement skills and improve the training effect."
Investigation of solitons structures for nonlinear ionic currents microtubule and Mikhaillov-Novikov-Wang dynamical equations,"In this work, we analysis the novel behavior of solitons to the nonlinear evolution equations describing the ionic currents microtubule and Mikhaillov-Novikov-Wang dynamical equations under an auxiliary equation approach. As a result, a variety of solitons solutions are achieved such as singular bright solitons, kink solitons, singular dark solitons and anti-kink solitons. All outcomes in this work are necessary to understand the physical meaning and behavior of the explored results and shed light on the significance of the investigation of several nonlinear wave phenomena in sciences and engineering including nonlinear optics, material energy, soliton wave theory, computational fluid mechanics, system identification, earthquake modeling, water wave mechanics, signal transmission, and optical fibers. We designed the utilized approach to be reliable and accurate, with precise for analytical results."
"Multiple single-channel cryptosystem based on QZ decomposition, CMYK color space fusion and wavelength multiplexing","A new multiple-single-channel cryptosystem using QZ decomposition, cyan-magenta-yellow-black (CMYK) color space fusion and wavelength multiplexing is proposed. In this cryptosystem, the four LL subbands of the first set of the four RGB images are fused. The RGB image is first converted into CMYK image and then decomposed into C, M, Y and K channels. The C and M channels and the Y and K channels are decomposed independently by QZ decomposition to generate two upper quasitriangular matrices and two unitary matrices. The four upper quasitriangular matrices are fused to construct a single-channel image, which is modulated by the first random biometric key (RBK) and then Fresnel transformed. The resulting image is modulated again by the second RBK and then Fresnel transformed. Each Fresnel spectrum is analytically decomposed into phase-only mask (POM) and amplitude-only mask (AOM). The sum of POMs (as an encrypted image) and the sum of AOMs (as a common decryption key) for N sets are obtained separately. The proposed system has the main advantages of a common decryption key for multiple images, the phase key and amplitude key as individual decryption keys, and two RBKs as unique individual encryption keys to endure potential attacks. A hybrid optoelectronic system can be employed to implement the proposed method. Numerical simulation results prove the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system."
"Structural, linear/nonlinear optical, and electrical characteristics of polyvinyl chloride doped with non-stoichiometric nano cadmium sulfide","In this work, it was proposed to introduce non-stoichiometric nano cadmium sulfide (CdS1-x) nanoparticles into polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polymer using simple, environmentally friendly and low-cost techniques. Undoped and doped PVC polymers with non-stoichiometric CdS1-x were formed using casting and thermolysis procedures. Rietveld refinement was applied to identify the phases formed and microstructure parameters in non-stoichiometric CdS1-x. Different techniques were used to investigate the structure, morphology, optical properties and dielectric of polymer films. The direct and indirect optical band gap (Eg) values of the undoped PVC film are 5.63 eV and (5.22, 4.49, 3.51) eV. As the sulfur concentration in the nanofiller increased to 97%, the direct and indirect Eg values of the CdS1-x doped polymers decreased to (5.21, 4.07, 2.44) eV and (4.18, 2.3, 2.03) eV, respectively. The optical dielectric constant and optical conductivity reached their maximum values as the amount of sulfur reached 97% in CdS1-x. Doped polymers are effective materials against UVA, UVB, and UVC spectra and work very well as solar cell absorber materials. The CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram revealed that PVC shifted from blue color to green-yellow and yellow-orange regions under excitation wavelengths of 317 and 380 nm, respectively. The electrical dielectric constant reached its maximum value when the sulfur content of the nanofiller reached 95%. AC conductivity has its maximum value when PVC is loaded with CdS0.9. The manageable optical and electrical features show that PVC/CdS1-x polymers could be potential optical materials in the development of futuristic flexible-type optoelectronic devices."
Quantum photonics advancements enhancing health and sports performance,"Given that AI has been developing quickly in recent years, its usage has become increasingly important. It has had a significant influence on a variety of industries, including sports. Although not many experts are discussing it, the use of AI in sports has become commonplace. Predictive analytics has made it possible for many different kinds of athletic events to produce more precise outcomes and judgements. Making the game more difficult on and off the pitch is one of sports AI's main objectives. As a result, it is critical for sports firms to always stay current. As we analyse this document, our goal is to comprehend and research fresh, cutting-edge ways to apply artificial intelligence (AI) to the world of sports. Elite sports require objective evaluation of an athlete’s performance to enable in-depth quantum photonics research. The shortcomings of manual performance analysis techniques are solved by the application of automatic detection as well as recognition of sport-specific motions. Inertial measurement unit (IMU) and/or computer vision data inputs were used in this work to recognise sport-specific movements. The goal of the study was to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of literature on ML and DL for these purposes. There was a multi-database search done. Included papers must to have examined a sport-specific movement and used machine learning or deep learning techniques to construct a model."
Photo-induced single-electron tunnelling based Coulomb staircase effect observed at high applied bias in ZnSe/CdSe core-shell quantum dots,"In this study, ZnSe, CdSe, and their inverse type-I ZnSe/CdSe core-shell quantum dots (QDs) have been synthesized through the chemical bath deposition using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a capping agent. Various structural and morphological characterizations were carried out which reveal the cubic zinc blende type structure having spherical shaped core and core-shell QDs nanostructures. The synthesized samples were excited by white light at different intensities in order to investigate their photoinduced current-voltage (I–V) characteristics. The Coulomb staircase, a unique quantum mechanical phenomenon, is observed in the I–V characteristics of the core-shell QDs when white light interacts with them. A semiempirical two-tunnel junction model for the QDs has been adopted to examine the phenomenon quantitatively. The genesis and nature of this photon-induced unique behavior have been discussed in length. The observed photon-assisted oscillatory Coulomb staircase behavior in the ZnSe/CdSe core-shell QDs is attributed to surface and interface-induced defects that occurred during the synthesis process. The current study focuses primarily on the novel photo-electronic properties of ZnSe/CdSe core-shell QDs, which necessitates a more detailed theoretical investigation to enable the implementation of these materials in next-generation nanoelectronic devices."
A Complex Dynamical Study of Spatiotemporal Plankton-Fish Interaction with Effects of Harvesting,"In this article, we propose an aquatic system, in terms of three dimensional plankton-fish interaction model that takes into account holling type II and IV functional responses. Both species (fish and phytoplankton) are thought to be growing logistically. Our objective is to apply the dynamical behavior model with constant rate harvesting to the fish population. The stability of the model system has been investigated for both geographical and non-spatial systems, and the theoretical findings have been proven using numerical simulation. It is observed that the aquatic system is particularly sensitive to maximum per capita predation rate and capable of causing bifurcating occurrences. Persistence and permanence are discussed. We observed the Hopf bifurcation situations for varied maximal per capita predation rates and harvesting constant rates. Furthermore, the diffusion-driven Turing instability is investigated, and various time level and harvesting constant rate based Turing patterns are observed.The results of this study reveal that the mortality rate of phytoplankton and the continual harvesting of the fish population play key roles in marine systems."
Optimized pavement structures via multi-objective optimization using genetic algorithm and highway development and management model four (case study: Iran low-volume roads),"Pavement management and optimization tools at the project level provide designers and decision-makers with an optimal and sustainable solution. This research aimed to optimize pavement-designed sections by employing the multi-objective optimization model (MOOM) and the Highway Development and Management Model Four (HDM-4). The study analyzed 14 distinct designs of low-volume road (LVR) asphalt pavement structures across four climate zones, considering five types of subgrades and four types of traffic volume. Based on the analysis results, it is important to note that, although the selected pavements using MOOM and HDM-4 had lower discounted costs compared to the designed pavements (with reductions of 2.41 and 1.54%, respectively), the optimized pavement structures suggested by these two methods were not identical. In other words, in most cases, the analysis indicated that HDM-4 tended to prefer pavement structures with greater bearing capacity, while MOOM often favored structures with lower bearing capacity. Additionally, the discounted costs of the structures optimized using MOOM were 4.58% less than those of the structures optimized using HDM-4."
Experimental Investigation on Interrelation Between Hydraulic Conductivity and Compressive Strength of Soft Soil Using Metakaolin as Stabilizer,"The building industry requires methods that improve the quality of soil; if they want the foundation to be more durable and rigid, this is particularly true for residential construction. Modifying soft soils with metakaolin (MK) has proven to be an effective method for stabilizing soil. In this research, we studied the physiochemical properties of soft soil samples obtained from a construction site. The specimens were treated with different concentrations of metakaolin (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% by weight of soil) and analyse to determine their strength and hydraulic conductivity. The observations showed that the hydraulic conductivity significantly decreased after the incorporation of metakaolin into the clay soil, compared to untreated soil. The hydraulic conductivity of the soil decreased by 70% for 15% metakaolin concentration. Forming of metakaolin hydrated calcium silicate gel (C-S-H) in the soil matrix results in increased pore-filling impact and reduced pore dimensions; both contribute to a reduction in hydraulic conductivity. The unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of the altered soil samples significantly improved after MK was incorporated into the mix. The UCS of the samples increased by 75% after adding the 15% MK substance. The increase in UCS can be attributed by the pozzolanic interaction that takes place between MK and soil. This interaction results in the production of new saturated products, which contribute to an increase in the material's strength. The strength and permeability of MK-treated soil show continuous changes as curing time extended; this observation is substantiated by the test outcomes, which demonstrate a decrease in permeability and an increase in strength as the curing period increases. In conclusion, MK has the ability to improve the resiliency of clay soil while simultaneously lowering its permeability. The results of the research indicate that addition of MK in clay soil improves its mechanical and hydrodynamic characteristics, making it a practical and effective approach. This finding has significant repercussions for the construction industry because it paves the way for an alternative that is both workable and inexpensive to the earth-stabilization methods that are currently in use."
The Risk for Readmission to Juvenile Detention: The Role of Trauma Exposure and Trauma-related Mental Health Disorders,"The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of childhood trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress disorder, and trauma-related comorbid diagnoses on the risk for readmission to juvenile detention among youth in a large metropolitan area (N = 1282). The following research questions were addressed: 1) Does a greater number of childhood traumas increase the risk for readmission to detention following release? 2) Does the risk for readmission differ by type of trauma? 3) Do PTSD and other co-morbid diagnoses increase the risk for readmission? and 4) What role do demographic factors play in the relationship between trauma-related variables and risk for readmission? This study utilized the screening results of 1282 youth who were voluntarily screened for PTSD, depressive symptoms and substance use during their initial intake to detention. More than half of the sample was readmitted during the three-year study period, with readmissions most likely to occur within one year of release. Returning to detention within one year was also associated with increased risk for multiple readmissions. Youth readmitted to detention were more likely to have a history of sexual abuse and problematic substance use. No other significant relationships were found between risk for readmission and trauma-related variables. Although trauma-related symptoms may be crucial targets for treatment, focusing solely on trauma exposure and traumatic stress symptoms without considering the impact of other risk factors may not be enough to decrease the likelihood of readmission for youth of color in a large urban environment."
Minority Representation in Special Education: 5-Year Trends from 2016–2020,"The persistent disproportionate representation of minority students in special education, either over- or underrepresented, spans decades. This study aims to explore minority representation in special education between 2016 and 2020."
"Assessment of prices, availability and affordability of essential medicines in Juba County, South Sudan","Access to safe, effective, affordable, and high-quality medications has been included in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations as a crucial step towards attaining universal health coverage. Access to medicines is a fundamental human right. If medicines are accessible and affordable, they save lives by reducing mortality and morbidity associated with acute and chronic diseases. WHO recommends that all countries voluntarily reach the minimum target of 80% availability of medicines by 2025. The primary purpose of this research is to assess access to essential medicines in Juba County, South Sudan."
A multi-constraint transfer approach with additional auxiliary domains for IoT intrusion detection under unbalanced samples distribution,"The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a vast and interconnected network comprising smart objects with comprehensive capabilities. Unfortunately, the vulnerabilities of IoT device awareness layer nodes are vulnerable to network intrusion. Therefore, it is crucial to detect new types of intrusions in the IoT environment. Also, the current IoT intrusion detection models are trained by samples with a balanced distribution. However, the distribution of intercepted network samples is unbalanced in some specific scenarios. In addition, malicious traffic easily interferes with the IoT environment. As a result, detection efficiency and accuracy decrease. In this study, we propose a multi-constraint transfer approach with additional auxiliary domains for IoT intrusion detection under unbalanced samples distribution. First, we construct a high precision and efficiency feature extractor using PointNet ++ as a framework to complete attack feature extraction. We then design a multi-constraint transfer approach with additional auxiliary domains. In addition, we also design a multi-scale and multi-level sample augmented discriminator to complete the final IoT intrusion detection under unbalanced samples distribution. Finally, we validate our approach by using four intrusion datasets from IoT networks, and it demonstrates excellent performance. In the comparison results of all approaches, the detection accuracy of our approach is the highest under four unbalanced sample combinations. Also, the average accuracy is 96.398% on the four datasets. One of the biggest advantages of this approach is its very good convergence, efficiency and detection stability in the presence of noise. In particular, it can be used effectively for intrusion detection in real IoT environments."
Group decision making based on consistency adjustment of distributed preference relations under asymmetric evaluation grades,"Group decision making (GDM) is common in real world. Distributed preference relation (DPR) is suitable for capturing the original preference information of decision makers (DMs) in uncertain decision-making environment. The consistency of preference relations is very important to ensure the rationality of decision results. Existing research on the consistency of DPRs assumes that evaluation grades are symmetric on the scale. However, some situations such as risk assessment and investment decisions need to be evaluated with asymmetric and non-uniform evaluation grades. DMs with different cognitive abilities and backgrounds may tend to use multi-granular grade sets, differences in their risk attitudes will lead to different meanings of grades. In this paper, a GDM method with multigranular asymmetric evaluation information is developed. First, a general grade score function is proposed to represent both symmetric and asymmetric grade sets selected by DMs. Due to the limited rationality, it is difficult to ensure that DMs’ subjective preferences are perfectly consistent. Therefore, we establish the consistency of DPRs on a set of asymmetric grades. Considering the willingness of DMs and adjustment magnitude, interactive local adjustment and global adjustment algorithms are presented to achieve acceptable consistency for inconsistent DPR matrices. The different grade sets are unified through conversion between grades, which enables DPRs to be aggregated by evidential reasoning (ER) approach. An example of a decision problem involving investment risk is provided, and the results of comparative analysis demonstrate the validity of the proposed method."
Kinetics and Isotherms Studies on the Adsorption of Anionic Dyes and As (V) in Aqueous Solutions Employing Modified Chitosan-Alumina Nanocomposites (CSAO3 and CAO3),"The nanocomposite of chitosan-alumina was fabricated for the considerable adsorption of the anionic contaminants including dyes (methyl orange (MO) and reactive black 5 (RB5)) and arsenic (V) ions in the aqueous solutions. The various samples were synthesized using oxalic acid and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as modifiers. The achievements showed that the modification of the adsorbent surface by employing oxalic acid as well as the presence of SDS in the sample structure play an important role in increasing the adsorption capacity. The batch sorption tests were carried out to evaluate the different operating conditions, encompassing contact time, initial concentration of contaminants, pH, and temperature. The sorbents were characterized by XRD, FTIR, BET, TEM, and FESEM with EDAX analysis. The equilibrium adsorption was examined by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The results indicated a better match between the experimental data with Langmuir’s isotherm. The maximum adsorption capacity was calculated to be about 370.37, 185.185, and 76.92 mg/g for MO, RB5, and As (V), respectively. The kinetic study of the adsorption also followed the pseudo-second-order equation. The reusability of the best adsorbent was studied for 5 consecutive cycles with a straightforward method, the results of which illustrated the outstanding efficiency of the recovered adsorbent. Only 10% of the adsorption capacity for arsenic ions was reduced in the fifth cycle."
A virus from Aspergillus cibarius with features of alpha- and betachrysoviruses,"From the ascomycete Aspergillus cibarius strain NW-FVA 2590, which was originally isolated from a root, associated with stem collar necrosis of Fraxinus excelsior L., a novel virus was isolated and characterized. Its genome is encoded on three monocistronic dsRNA segments ranging from 3683 bp (dsRNA 1) over 3093 (dsRNA 2) to 2902 bp (dsRNA 3), which are packed in isometric particles of around 35 nm. While the viral RdRp (P1) is encoded on segment 1, protein sequencing showed that two more structural proteins are present which are translated from dsRNA 2 (P2) and dsRNA 3 (P3) and possibly form the viral capsid. Additionally, P2 and P3 may undergo posttranslational modifications since the detected proteins bands deviated from the calculated sizes. Due to its phylogenetic position, the novel virus was grouped in the family of Chrysoviridae and was tentatively denominated as Aspergillus cibarius chrysovirus 1 (AcCV1). Due to its composition, biological properties and phylogenetic position, distant from the genera Alphachrysovirus and Betachrysovirus, we suggest to position AcCV1 in a proposed genus “Gammachrysovirus”."
Investigation of Solid-Liquid Interface Effects on the Impurity Concentration in the DS Grown Mc-Si Ingot by using C-Clamp Insulation Block for Solar Cell Applications: Numerical Analysis,"A C-clamp insulation block was designed and installed at the top of the heat exchanger block (HEB) in a lab-scale directional solidification system (DSS) to produce the high-efficiency multi-crystalline Silicon (mc-Si) ingot for solar cell applications. The transient global model is used to study the DSS's heat transport and investigate the effect of modified DSS on the solid-liquid (S-L) interface, power consumption, and impurity concentration. Results are compared. The simulation results show that the modified DSS grown mc-Si ingot’s power consumption of 489 kWh, is comparatively lower than the conventionally grown ingot’s power consumption of 544 kWh. The S-L interface shape changes from W-shape to convex in the conventional DSS growth and in the modified DSS growth is changed from highly convex to slightly convex S-L interface. The radial temperature gradient increases due to rapid growth in the modified DSS. However, the conventional DSS ingot has a lower radial temperature gradient due to the heat extraction from the side silica crucible wall (SCW). So, it maintains the minimum temperature gradient at the margin of the grown mc-Si ingot. The S-L interface and the growth rates affect the oxygen and carbon concentration in the grown mc-Si ingot. The oxygen concentration in the conventional DSS grown ingot ranges from 1.20E12 to 8.00E17 atoms/cm3 and in the modified DSS grown ingot it ranges from 1.20E12 to 2.40 E17 atoms/cm3. The carbon concentration in the conventional DSS grown ingot ranges from 1.58E16 to 1.60E17 atoms/cm3 and in the modified DSS grown ingot it ranges from 1.58E16 to 8.79E16 atoms/cm3. The modified DSS-grown ingot gained maximum oxygen and carbon concentration in the ingot red zone. It need not be considered for practical applications. The modified ingot reduces the wire saw damage in the wafering process due to the presence of minimum carbon concentration. Due to the lower oxygen concentration level in the modified DSS grown mc-Si ingot, the LID effect reduces in the solar cell ."
Influence of Silicon Size Distribution on Hydrochlorination Process of Solar-grade Silicon in Spouted Reactor via MP-PIC Approach,"The escalating demand for high-purity solar-grade silicon has elevated the significance of trichlorosilane as a pivotal element in semiconductor silicon production. Thus, this investigation utilizes the multiphase particle-in-cell approach to simulate the hydrochlorination process of silicon in the gas–solid spouted system. After the model validation, this analysis centers on evaluating the effect of silicon particle size distribution on the fluid dynamics and mass transfer dynamics of the gas–solid flow system. The results reveal the oscillations in gas radial velocity and mass flux across the bed height, whereas gas axial velocity and solid mass flux exhibit a progressive rise along the height, followed by a gradual decline. The distribution of solid particles in the spouted bed delineates two discernible regions: the annular and spouted domains. With enlarging the width of particle size distribution (PSD), concomitant increases manifest in the gas radial velocity, mass flux of gas and solid phase, bed pressure drop, solid mass fraction, and gas phase temperature. Conversely, the distributions of the axial velocity and mass flux of gas phase, turbulent viscosity, velocity and mass flux of solid phase undergo gradual decrease. Furthermore, an expansion in PSD width is observed to increase the HCl conversion rate, while spouted beds with silicon particles of uniform size impede efficient mass transfer."
The Social Insurance Literacy Questionnaire (SILQ): Development and Psychometric Evaluation,"For clients to understand social insurance decisions and processes, information from authorities needs to be comprehensible, and clients need sufficient individual abilities. These dimensions are captured by the concept social insurance literacy, which has been operationalized into a measure, the Social Insurance Literacy Questionnaire (SILQ). The aim of this study was to describe the development of the SILQ and evaluate its psychometric properties using Rasch measurement theory."
Impact of plastic-related compounds on the gene expression signature of HepG2 cells transfected with CYP3A4,"The presence of plastic and microplastic within the oceans as well as in marine flora and fauna have caused a multitude of problems that have been the topic of numerous investigations for many years. However, their impact on human health remains largely unknown. Such plastic and microplastic particles have been detected in blood and placenta, underlining their ability to enter the human body. Plastics also contain other compounds, such as plasticizers, antioxidants, or dyes, whose impact on human health is currently being studied. Critical enzymes within the metabolism of endogenous molecules, especially of xenobiotics, are the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs). Although their importance in maintaining cellular balance has been confirmed, their interactions with plastics and related products are poorly understood. In this study, the possible relationship between different plastic-related compounds and CYP3A4 as one of the most important CYPs was analyzed using hepatic cells overexpressing this enzyme. Beginning with virtual compound screening and molecular docking of more than 1000 plastic-related compounds, several candidates were identified to interact with CYP3A4. In a second step, RNA-sequencing was used to study in detail the transcriptome-wide gene expression levels affected by the selected compounds. Three candidate molecules ((2,2′-methylenebis(6-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol), 1,1-bis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-2-hydroxyphenyl)ethane, and 2,2′-methylenebis(6-cyclohexyl-4-methylphenol)) had an excellent binding affinity to CYP3A4 in-silico as well as cytotoxic effects and interactions with several metabolic pathways in-vitro. We identified common pathways influenced by all three selected plastic-related compounds. In particular, the suppression of pathways related to mitosis and ‘DNA-templated DNA replication’ which were confirmed by cell cycle analysis and single-cell gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, several mis-regulated metabolic and inflammation-related pathways were identified, suggesting the induction of hepatotoxicity at different levels. These findings imply that these compounds may cause liver problems subsequently affecting the entire organism."
"Aureispira anguillae sp. nov., isolated from Japanese eel Anguilla japonica leptocephali","A novel filamentous eel-leptocephalus pathogenic marine bacterium, designated strain EL160426T, was isolated from Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica, leptocephali reared at a laboratory in Mie, Japan. In experimental infection studies on eel larvae, the strain EL160426T caused massive larval mortality and was reisolated from moribund leptocephali. Characteristically, observations of infected larvae found that EL160426T forms columnar colonies on the cranial surface of larvae. The novel isolate exhibited growth at 15–30 °C, pH 7–9, and seawater concentrations of 60–150% (W/V). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain EL160426T was most closely related to Aureispira maritima 59SAT with 97.7% sequence similarity. The whole genome sequence analysis of the strain EL160426T showed that the strain maintained a circular chromosome with a size of approximately 7.58 Mbp and the DNA G + C content was 36.2%. The major respiratory quinone was MK-7 and the predominant cellular fatty acids were 16:0, 20:4 w6c (arachidonic acid), 17:0 iso and 16:0 N alcohol. DNA relatedness between the closest phylogenetic neighbor strain EL160426T and A. maritima (JCM23207T) was less than 13%. On the basis of the polyphasic taxonomic data, the strain represents a novel species of the genus Aureispira, for which the name Aureispira anguillae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is EL160426T (= JCM 35024 T = TSD-286 T)."
Moving object detection in satellite videos based on an improved ViBe algorithm,"This paper studies moving object detection in satellite videos, which plays a significant role for large-scale video monitoring and dynamic analysis. Due to the tiny targets, complex background, and completely or partly occlusion, moving object detection accurately from each image frame is difficult and challenging. In order to tackle the issues, we propose an improved Visual Background Extractor algorithm (ViBe) with an improved Canny edge detection operator. First, the improved Canny operator based on iteration method is employed to find the optimal high and low thresholds and extract more edges information of satellite videos. Furthermore, the eight pixels are replaced with twenty-four pixels and the times of target threshold is introduced in ViBe detection to increase the selection range of backgrounds. The experiments are tested in SATSOT datasets, where the results verify that the proposed method is more robust in complex background with interference, turning and rapid motion."
Identifying Quality Factors for Surface Defects on Small Steel Bars Using a Two-step Method of Statistical Difference Testing and k-means Clustering,"Small steel bars (SSBs) are common steel products, and their surface defects pose a significant quality issue. Despite numerous studies conducted to detect and predict such defects, identifying the underlying causes, or ‘quality factors,’ remains a challenge. Most of the existing methods focused on validation of known factors based on the theories of physical properties and material composition; thus, they lack exploring new quality factors. This study proposes a two-step method for identifying these quality factors, considering two common issues that often arise when analyzing operational data in SSB manufacturing processes: ‘merged measurement’ and ‘variation due to operation dates.’ These issues are resulted because the rolling process is lack of measurement capability and exposed to external environment. They make it difficult to use various analytical methods such as statistical analysis and data mining methods. The proposed method sequentially employs statistical difference testing and k-means clustering, thereby providing a practical heuristic for overcoming the aforementioned difficulties. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated through a case study that highlighted its ability to effectively identify the quality factors critical to surface defects on SSBs."
Application of image analysis and machine learning for the assessment of grape (Vitis L.) berry behavior under different storage conditions,"Fresh grapes are characterized by a short shelf life and are often subjected to quality losses during post-harvest storage. The quality assessment of grapes using image analysis may be a useful approach using non-destructive methods. This study aimed to compare the effect of different storage methods on the grape image texture parameters of the fruit outer structure. Grape bunches were stored for 4 weeks using 3 storage methods ( – 18 °C, + 4 °C, and room temperature) and then were subjected subsequently to image acquisition using a flatbed scanner and image processing. The models for the classification of fresh and stored grapes were built based on selected image textures using traditional machine learning algorithms. The fresh grapes and stored fruit samples (for 4 weeks) in the freezer, in the refrigerator and in the room were classified with an overall accuracy reaching 96% for a model based on selected texture parameters from images in color channels R, G, B, L, a, and b built using Random Forest algorithm. Among the individual color channels, the carried-out classification for the R color channel produced the highest overall accuracies of up to 92.5% for Random Forest. As a result, this study proposed an innovative approach combining image analysis and traditional machine learning to assess changes in the outer structure of grape berries caused by different storage conditions."
A theoretical method to assess cyclability of intercalation electrode materials using DFT,"Density functional theory is widely used to theoretical investigation and comparison of electrode materials. In this paper, we propose novel theoretical approach to evaluate cyclability of intercalation electrode materials. Crystal structure of an intercalation electrode material have to be stable after deintercalation, which is called “structural stability”. Capability of an electrode to endure many cycles is called as “cyclability”. We suggest that changing in properties in atomic scale under intercalation/deintercalation (cycling) is responsible for low cyclability, while changing in cell parameters and unit cell properties is responsible for the primitive structural stability. Also, thermodynamic stability of the electrode polymorph after deintercalation can be another parameter of structural stability. We use layered oxides and spinel electrode materials, to verify the here proposed approach, respectively, for atomic forces and magnetic moment. As a consideration in analysis of calculated forces, LiCoO2 is estimated to have the most stable cycling in the family. According to the results, Fe atoms in LiFeO2 would experience huge changes in the force value after (de)lithiation, causing low cyclability, as observe in experiments. In term of changes in magnetic moment under (de)lithiation, our calculations show significant changes of magnetic moment for LiMn2O4, which justifies its low cyclability observed in the experimental studies."
Bifurcation analysis of calcium dynamics in nerve cell,"Communication between neurons and astrocytes involves numerous significant chemical transmissions. It has been established that \(\textrm{Ca}^{2+}\) signaling is among the most adaptable second mediators in the majority of cell morphology and diverse cellular processes are regulated by complicated dynamical behaviors that range from random picking to well-ordered oscillations and periodic waves. Including muscular contraction, gene transcription, cell death, and neural activity. A significant regulator of intracellular \(\textrm{Ca}^{2+}\) dynamics, including the voltage-gated \(\textrm{Ca}^{2+}\) channels, the store-operated \(\textrm{Ca}^{2+}\) channel (SOCC), and the receptor-operated \(\textrm{Ca}^{2+}\) channel (ROCC), is the rate at which \(\textrm{Ca}^{2+}\) enters cells through plasma membrane cells. In order to analyze the model’s dynamic behavior, we have solved the neuron–astrocyte model and conducted a bifurcation analysis. The consequences of changing certain parameters, specifically the bifurcation of numerous limit cycles, on the dynamics of \(\textrm{Ca}^{2+}\) with changes in the signaling mechanism for distinct flows through the ER. Multiple limit cycle bifurcation, which may result in complicated dynamical behaviors, arises from the generalized coupling of mitochondria and NCX. It is further demonstrated that the parameter range for stable oscillations is determined by the fluctuation of the maximum flows for various calcium channels."
Comprehensive assessment of soil quality in greenhouse agriculture based on genetic algorithm and neural network,"With the continuous advancement of modern agriculture and urbanization, soil quality assessment has been considered an important guarantee for sustainable agricultural development. Despite the availability of numerous methods for assessing soil quality, little emphasis has been paid to comprehensive studies on soil quality in greenhouse agriculture. This study aims to construct a comprehensive evaluation model of greenhouse agricultural soil quality, including soil nutrition and heavy metal pollution, to better assess greenhouse soil quality."
"Implications for metallogenic evolution of the giant Zhenyuan gold deposit (Yunnan, SW China) from textures and geochemical compositions of pyrite","Pyrite, the most common sulfide mineral, is a ubiquitous component of many hydrothermal gold deposits. Geochemical patterns within the refractory pyrite structure represent a valuable repository of information that can help constrain the sources of ore-forming materials, and the evolution of ore-forming processes over time. However, there are still a lot of debates on the mechanisms of physico-chemical processes in ore-forming fluid controlling trace element and sulfur isotope distributions in pyrite during growth. In our manuscript, we use cutting-edge complementary microanalytical methods to understand the origin and evolution of zoned gold-bearing pyrite in samples from the largest gold deposit in the Ailaoshan gold belt, SW China, Zhenyuan (exceeding 100t Au, average grade: 5.3 g/t). Pyrite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, and stibnite are the most abundant sulfide minerals in most orebodies. Of these, pyrite is dominant and is also the most important host for gold. Two types of pyrite can be clearly distinguished: framboidal pyrite and hydrothermal pyrite. Gold is most commonly hosted by hydrothermal pyrite. Framboidal pyrite, mainly hosted by carbonaceous slate, hosts negligible Au, and features low δ34S values ranging from − 35.0 (± 0.9) to − 25.6 (± 1.0)‰. Hydrothermal pyrite is characterized by complex intra-grain zoned textures with alternating As-rich and As-poor bands readily recognizable on backscattered electron images. Scanning electron microscopy and trace-element analyses show that both visible and invisible gold occur only in the As-rich bands. Compared to the As-poor bands (72.1% of Au concentration data < 1.96 ppm, n = 43), the As-rich bands are characterized by far higher concentrations of Au (up to 1420 ppm), Cu, Ag, Sb, and Tl, but lower concentrations of Co and Ni. In-situ sulfur isotope analysis indicates that the δ34S values of As-rich zones range from − 7.3 (± 0.6) to 2.9 (± 0.6)‰ and are similar to those of As-poor zones (from − 6.9 (± 0.7) to 2.8 (± 0.6)‰), but distinct from the framboidal pyrite. Combined with published fluid inclusion data and a probable age for the magmatic event associated with mineralization, these data suggest that magmatic–hydrothermal fluids contributed most ore-forming materials and that periodic boiling led to formation of the rhythmic As-rich and As-poor bands in pyrite. Our data for pyrite constrain the evolution of ore-forming processes and provide new insights into the formation of zoned pyrite, with the conclusions having broad implications for analogous hydrothermal gold deposits worldwide."
Modeling the adsorption mechanism of 3-tertiary-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (3BHA) on polyethylene and polypropylene microplastics,"The polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) microplastics (MPs) can act as carriers of the molecule 3-tertiary-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (3BHA), which propose harmful impacts to aqueous ecosystems. Meanwhile, 3BHA has already been detected in several environments and human urine and serum samples. 3BHA is an antioxidant in foods, food packaging, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. However, it raised concerns about its possible endocrine-disrupting effect in recent years. The interaction between two MPs and 3BHA could start in farmland and be maintained during transportation to the ocean. Herein, the adsorption behavior and mechanism of 3BHA by PE and PP MPs were investigated via molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, density functional theory (DFT), non-covalent interactions (NCI), the total density of states (TDOS) and frontier molecular orbital (FMO). Furthermore, the stability of 3BHA adsorbed complexes was investigated by adsorption-free energies (ΔGads), showing that the 3BHA has a significant interaction with the MPs studied, with energies of -1.31 kcal mol−1 and − 4.19 kcal mol−1 for PE and PP, respectively. Intermolecular van der Waals forces were one of the primary adsorption mechanisms of 3BHA by MPs, as evidenced by NCI calculations. It was demonstrated that the adsorption of the 3BHA in MPs decreases the energy gap (Eg) of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals; for PE MP, the Eg decreases from 12.8386 to 9.1445 eV, and from 12.7957 to 9.2092 eV for PP MP. The adsorption of the 3BHA on the MPs resulted in an increase in the TDOS distribution and a slight shift in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) states. In conclusion, this study about the mechanism of adsorption of the 3BHA in PE and PP MPs can provide new evidence and enhance our understanding of the environmental behavior of 3BHA in the environment."
Reutilization of waste PET water bottles as 3D printing filaments: a preliminary study on physical and mechanical properties of the produced filaments,"In this study, filament was produced from waste PET water bottles, and the performance of the obtained reused PET (R-PET) filament was evaluated through tensile, surface roughness, and hardness tests. The conducted tests revealed that higher infill density enhances the mechanical durability of the filament and promotes a more homogeneous structure. This study emphasizes the importance of utilizing waste PET water bottles for filament production and evaluating the performance of R-PET filament, with the aim of contributing to a sustainable production process through the reuse of plastic waste. The results of this study demonstrate that waste PET water bottles can be transformed into economic value and offer a potential solution to the plastic waste issue. Additionally, this study highlights the significance of reducing plastic waste and promoting recycling by investigating the mechanical properties of R-PET filament and exploring sustainable material options."
"Earthworm Assemblages and Edaphic Factors in Various Land-Use Systems in Koraput, Eastern Ghats of India","A survey of earthworm species was carried out from June to December 2019 in three different land-use systems (forests, agricultural lands and residential areas) at four different sites in the Koraput district of Odisha, India. Attempt has been made to study the available species in three land-use systems. The findings show six different species, Drawida willsi and Drawida calebi, Glyphidrilus tuberosus, Perionyx excavatus, Ocnerodrilus occidentalis and Octochaetona surensis, under five different families, Moniligastridae, Almidae, Megascolecidae, Ocnerodrilidae and Octochaetidae, respectively. Five of the six species reported were native, found in agriculture land-use system, D. willsi, D. calebi, G. tuberosus, P. excavatus and O. surensis excluding O. occidentalis. Major species were native indicating least habitat disturbance in the forests as well as agriculture habitats. Edaphic factors of soil showed different characteristics among sites in three land-use systems. The pH was found to be one of the limiting factors for earthworm abundance, whereas available Nitrogen was found to be responsible for species richness. Elevation was observed to be associated with both species richness and abundance. D. calebi showed significant negative correlation with temperature, available phosphorus and positively correlated with available nitrogen. P. excavatus showed significant positive correlation with elevation, available potassium and available phosphorus. O. occidentalis showed significant positive correlation with temperature. The agricultural land-use system provided a better ecological condition for earthworms compared to forest and residential areas, which may be due to sustainable traditional agriculture practices in the region along with presence of more favourable soil edaphic factors."
Protective and Therapeutic Effects of Gymnema sylvestre Leaf Extract on Cisplatin-Induced Nephrotoxicity,"Nephrotoxicity is a side effect of cisplatin (CIS) use as a cancer treatment. The primary method through which CIS causes nephrotoxicity is by releasing free radicals. The study objective was to evaluate the ability of Gymnema sylvestre leaf extract (GLE), which has high antioxidant contents, to reduce CIS nephrotoxicity. The experiment was designed to include five groups, each group containing six rats, including the control group, the GLE group (rats ingested 100 mg/kg b.w. of GLE orally for 12 continuous days), the CIS group (rats received only one dose of CIS, 5 mg/kg b.w.), the GLE + CIS group (rats ingested daily GLE orally for 7 continuous days and then received only one dose of CIS), and the CIS + GLE group (rats received only one dose of CIS then, 5 days later treated with an oral dose of GLE daily for 7 continuous days). Induction of CIS increased serum kidney function parameters (urea, uric acid, and creatinine) as well as renal levels of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), malondialdehyde (MDA), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and apoptosis parameters (caspases 8, 9 and12) and decreased renal superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities. While administration of GLE decreased serum kidney function parameters as well as renal levels of KIM-1, MDA, NF-κB, TNF-α, and apoptosis parameters and increased renal activities of SOD and CAT. This work demonstrated that GLE has the ability to suppress the various pathways taken by CIS to induce nephrotoxicity."
Kinetics and Isotherms Studies on the Adsorption of Anionic Dyes and As (V) in Aqueous Solutions Employing Modified Chitosan-Alumina Nanocomposites (CSAO3 and CAO3),"The nanocomposite of chitosan-alumina was fabricated for the considerable adsorption of the anionic contaminants including dyes (methyl orange (MO) and reactive black 5 (RB5)) and arsenic (V) ions in the aqueous solutions. The various samples were synthesized using oxalic acid and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as modifiers. The achievements showed that the modification of the adsorbent surface by employing oxalic acid as well as the presence of SDS in the sample structure play an important role in increasing the adsorption capacity. The batch sorption tests were carried out to evaluate the different operating conditions, encompassing contact time, initial concentration of contaminants, pH, and temperature. The sorbents were characterized by XRD, FTIR, BET, TEM, and FESEM with EDAX analysis. The equilibrium adsorption was examined by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The results indicated a better match between the experimental data with Langmuir’s isotherm. The maximum adsorption capacity was calculated to be about 370.37, 185.185, and 76.92 mg/g for MO, RB5, and As (V), respectively. The kinetic study of the adsorption also followed the pseudo-second-order equation. The reusability of the best adsorbent was studied for 5 consecutive cycles with a straightforward method, the results of which illustrated the outstanding efficiency of the recovered adsorbent. Only 10% of the adsorption capacity for arsenic ions was reduced in the fifth cycle."
Challenges and pitfalls in classification of disproportionate mitral regurgitation,"The concept of disproportionate mitral regurgitation (dispropMR) has been introduced to identify patients with functional mitral regurgitation (MR) who benefit from percutaneous treatment. We aimed to examine echocardiographic characteristics behind this entity. We retrospectively included 172 consecutive patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and more than mild MR referred to clinically indicated echocardiography. According to the proportionality ratio (effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA)/left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV)) patients were divided into dispropMR and proportionate MR (propMR) group. Potential factors which might affect proportionality definition were analyzed. 55 patients (32%) had dispropMR. Discrepant grading of MR severity was observed when using regurgitant volume (RegVol) by proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method or volumetric method, with significant discordance only in dispropMR (p < 0.001). Patients with dispropMR had more frequently left ventricular foreshortened images for LVEDV calculation than patients with propMR (p = 0.003), resulting in smaller LVEDV in dispropMR group. DispropMR group had more substantial dynamic variation of regurgitant flow compared to propMR. Accordingly, EROA was consistently overestimated by standard single-point PISA method compared to serial PISA method. This was more pronounced in dispropMR (bias:10.5 ± 28.3 mm2) compared to propMR group (bias:6.4 ± 12.8 mm2). DispropMR may be found in roughly one third of clinically indicated echocardiographic studies in patients with reduced LVEF and more than mild MR. EROA overestimation due to dynamic variation of regurgitant flow and LVEDV underestimation due to LV foreshortening were more frequently found in dispropMR. Our results indicate that methodological limitations of echocardiographic MR grading could not be neglected in classifying the proportionality of MR."
"Assessment of prices, availability and affordability of essential medicines in Juba County, South Sudan","Access to safe, effective, affordable, and high-quality medications has been included in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations as a crucial step towards attaining universal health coverage. Access to medicines is a fundamental human right. If medicines are accessible and affordable, they save lives by reducing mortality and morbidity associated with acute and chronic diseases. WHO recommends that all countries voluntarily reach the minimum target of 80% availability of medicines by 2025. The primary purpose of this research is to assess access to essential medicines in Juba County, South Sudan."
A theoretical method to assess cyclability of intercalation electrode materials using DFT,"Density functional theory is widely used to theoretical investigation and comparison of electrode materials. In this paper, we propose novel theoretical approach to evaluate cyclability of intercalation electrode materials. Crystal structure of an intercalation electrode material have to be stable after deintercalation, which is called “structural stability”. Capability of an electrode to endure many cycles is called as “cyclability”. We suggest that changing in properties in atomic scale under intercalation/deintercalation (cycling) is responsible for low cyclability, while changing in cell parameters and unit cell properties is responsible for the primitive structural stability. Also, thermodynamic stability of the electrode polymorph after deintercalation can be another parameter of structural stability. We use layered oxides and spinel electrode materials, to verify the here proposed approach, respectively, for atomic forces and magnetic moment. As a consideration in analysis of calculated forces, LiCoO2 is estimated to have the most stable cycling in the family. According to the results, Fe atoms in LiFeO2 would experience huge changes in the force value after (de)lithiation, causing low cyclability, as observe in experiments. In term of changes in magnetic moment under (de)lithiation, our calculations show significant changes of magnetic moment for LiMn2O4, which justifies its low cyclability observed in the experimental studies."

CTSB Nuclear Translocation Facilitates DNA Damage and Lysosomal Stress to Promote Retinoblastoma Cell Death,"Retinoblastoma (RB) is a pernicious tumor originating from photoreceptor precursor cells that often endangers the lives of children. The purpose of our study was to further investigate the influence of cathepsin B (CTSB) nuclear translocation on RB cell death. Y79 cells were injected into the vitreous cavity of nude mice at a dose of 4 µL/mouse to establish an animal model of RB. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT–qPCR), Western blot analysis, a comet assay, a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry were used to measure the levels of the interrelated genes and proteins and to evaluate alterations in autophagy, apoptosis, proliferation, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest. CTSB was found to be expressed at low levels in RB animal model samples and RB cell lines. Functionally, CTSB nuclear translocation promoted DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, ferroptosis and autophagy in Y79 cells and inhibited their proliferation. Downstream mechanistic studies showed that nuclear translocation of CTSB facilitates DNA damage and cell cycle arrest in RB cells by inhibiting breast cancer 1 protein (BRCA1) expression and also activates the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1 (STAT3/STING1) pathway to induce lysosomal stress, leading to ferroptosis and autophagy in Y79 cells and alleviating RB. Nuclear translocation of CTSB facilitates DNA damage and cell cycle arrest in RB cells by inhibiting BRCA1 expression and activating the STAT3/STING1 pathway and induces lysosomal stress, which eventually leads to ferroptosis and autophagy and mitigates RB."
Global prevalence of hypomagnesemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus – a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies,"Hypomagnesemia, characterized by low magnesium levels, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). This meta-analysis aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of hypomagnesemia prevalence in individuals with T2DM as well as its potential implications for diabetes management and complications."
Identifying Quality Factors for Surface Defects on Small Steel Bars Using a Two-step Method of Statistical Difference Testing and k-means Clustering,"Small steel bars (SSBs) are common steel products, and their surface defects pose a significant quality issue. Despite numerous studies conducted to detect and predict such defects, identifying the underlying causes, or ‘quality factors,’ remains a challenge. Most of the existing methods focused on validation of known factors based on the theories of physical properties and material composition; thus, they lack exploring new quality factors. This study proposes a two-step method for identifying these quality factors, considering two common issues that often arise when analyzing operational data in SSB manufacturing processes: ‘merged measurement’ and ‘variation due to operation dates.’ These issues are resulted because the rolling process is lack of measurement capability and exposed to external environment. They make it difficult to use various analytical methods such as statistical analysis and data mining methods. The proposed method sequentially employs statistical difference testing and k-means clustering, thereby providing a practical heuristic for overcoming the aforementioned difficulties. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated through a case study that highlighted its ability to effectively identify the quality factors critical to surface defects on SSBs."
Mining local exome and HLA data to characterize pharmacogenetic variants in Saudi Arabia,"Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is a promising field of precision medicine where efficacy of drugs is maximized while side effects are minimized for individual patients. Knowledge of the frequency of PGx-relevant variants (pharmacovariants) in the local population is a pre-requisite to informed policy making. Unfortunately, such knowledge is largely lacking from the Middle East. Here, we describe the use of a large clinical exome database (n = 13,473) and HLA haplotypes (n = 64,737) from Saudi Arabia, one of the largest countries in the Middle East, along with previously published data from the local population to ascertain allele frequencies of known pharmacovariants. In addition, we queried another exome database (n = 816) of well-phenotyped research subjects from Saudi Arabia to discover novel candidate variants in known PGx genes (pharmacogenes). Although our results show that only 26% (63/242) of class 1A/1B PharmGKB variants were identified, we estimate that 99.57% of the local population have at least one such variant. This translates to a minimum estimated impact of 9% of medications dispensed by our medical center annually. We also highlight the contribution of rare variants where 71% of the pharmacogenes devoid of common pharmacovariants had at least one potentially deleterious rare variant. Thus, we show that approaches that go beyond the use of commercial PGx kits that have been optimized for other populations should be implemented to ensure universal and equitable access of all members of the local population to personalized prescription practices."
Influence of layer thickness on bioremediation of drought-induced soil desiccation cracks using microbially induced calcite precipitation,"Intensified drought exacerbated by climate change aggravates the development of soil desiccation cracking, triggering several weakening mechanisms in surface soils and eventually causing various geohazards and environmental problems. This study investigates the effect and mechanisms of a bio-mediated approach based on microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) for remediation of desiccation cracks in soils with different layer thicknesses. We conducted 5 MICP treatment cycles on clayey soil samples to explore the influence of layer thickness on the water evaporation properties, desiccation cracking behaviors, and calcium carbonate content and distribution of MICP-treated soils. The results show that the MICP treatment can significantly decrease the water evaporation rate, the surface crack ratio, average crack width, and total crack length of all soil samples. The crack reduction ratio reaches over 90% after 5 MICP treatment cycles. The soil layer thickness has an obvious influence on the effectiveness of MICP for the clayey soil treatment. Thicker soil samples exhibit wider desiccation cracks, which, in turn, require more MICP treatment cycles for remediation. The calcium carbonate content and distribution of MICP-treated soils is governed by the original desiccation cracks, the wider cracks in thicker soil samples result in the higher calcium carbonate content of soil nearby the cracks, and the denser cracks in thinner soil samples lead to the more homogenous distribution of calcium carbonate. The remediation of soil desiccation cracks is mainly attributed to the coupling effect of the soil volume change and the accumulation of calcium carbonate crystal during MICP treatment. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of the interaction between MICP-treated soil and drought climate and contribute to developing environmentally friendly approaches for soil improvement in regions subjected to droughts."
Post-activation potentiation and potentiated motor unit firing patterns in boys and men,"Post-activation potentiation (PAP) describes the enhancement of twitch torque following a conditioning contraction (CC) in skeletal muscle. In adults, PAP may be related to muscle fibre composition and is accompanied by a decrease in motor unit (MU) firing rates (MUFRs). Muscle fibre composition and/or activation is different between children and adults. This study examined PAP and MU firing patterns of the potentiated knee extensors in boys and men."
Comparative Economic Assessment of On-Grid Solar Power System Applications Having Limited Areas: A Case Study on a Shore Facility,"The objective of this study is to assess the economic feasibility of installing high-efficiency solar panels in a yacht marina in the Çeşme district of Izmir, Türkiye. In this aim, the facility’s energy demand from the grid is reduced. The study compares ten different PV panel modules with various installation configurations, including fixed, horizontal, vertical, and two-axis. The most cost-effective option is determined with novel comparative economic indicators involving the costs associated with purchasing electricity from the grid. The PVGIS online tool is used to simulate energy production from solar panel systems and determine the ideal quantity of solar panels that can be deployed within the designated regions. New economic indicators, Relative Levelized Energy Cost (RLEC), and Relative Payback Period (RPBP) are proposed in the study to compare the economic performance of the different solar panel sets. The results indicate that the facility can compensate for 14.44% of its energy demand with the two-axis configuration. Module 5 yielded the best relative economic performance with an RLEC of 0.090 $/kWh. The best Payback Period (PBP) is obtained from fixed module 7, while the best RPBP is achieved with fixed module 5 at 7.113 years, which shows the importance of using comparative economic indicators for suitable energy systems."
Development and evaluation of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomal gel: rheology and in vitro drug release properties,"Liposomes have emerged as pivotal entities in the field of therapeutics, particularly in the domain of protein and vaccine administration. Hence, the development of novel liposomal formulations has garnered considerable interest. Liposomal delivery systems are considered advantageous as medication carriers, especially in the field of dermatology, owing to their moisturizing and restorative characteristics. Nevertheless, a significant drawback in the utilization of liposomes in topical applications is the inherent fluidity of the formulation, which might result in leakage following delivery to the skin surface. The use of liposomes inside the gel matrix, while maintaining the integrity of the vesicles, presents a potentially appealing method for topical administration. The primary objective of this work is to develop a liposomal-loaded gel formulation and assess its in vitro release characteristics as well as its rheological profile, including viscoelastic properties and flow behaviour. This study incorporated two different types of drugs, namely hydrophilic (specifically diphenhydramine hydrochloride) and hydrophobic (namely curcumin), inside its formulations. A liposome, composed of a long alkyl chain lipid such as DPPC with a chain length of 16, was synthesized using the thin film hydration process and subsequently integrated into a carbopol gel. It is noteworthy that the introduction of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (DPH) resulted in a substantial decrease in the elastic modulus and cohesiveness of the liposomal gel. Conversely, the incorporation of curcumin-loaded liposomal gel led to an increase in critical strain and cohesiveness when compared to the plain liposomal gel. In contrast, the liposomal gel containing DPH and curcumin demonstrated a reduced release rate compared to the plain liposomal gel, spanning a duration of 48 h. The in vitro release studies offer the potential for the utilization of liposomal gels as a sustained delivery system."
"An analysis of LULC changes for understanding the impact of anthropogenic activities on food security: a case study of Dudhganga watershed, India","Although the Dudhganga watershed is the primary water and food resource of the Kashmir Valley, it has undergone significant changes in food resources and strategies due to rampant urbanization in the area over the past 20 years. This urbanization has had a profound impact on the watershed and has also affected land use and land cover (LULC) patterns and environmental changes. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of urban development on food security parameters in the Dudhganga watershed area, India, from 2000 to 2020, by evaluating LULC changes. Additionally, the study aims to examine the relationship between climate changes and LULC indices, such as the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI). The results indicate a 21.66% increase in barren areas, at the expense of snow-covered lands, during the 2000–2020 period. The primary land cover transition observed is towards barren areas. The predictions for LULC in 2030 highlight the need for careful management of land use and climate changes in the study area. This study can assist local government officials in reassessing food strategies by identifying areas where urban expansion should be controlled and climate impacts minimized, to prevent local hunger and ecological degradation. Therefore, the development of systematic urban planning approaches and mitigation of climate change sources are crucial. Furthermore, the adoption of advanced agricultural technology should be considered to mitigate the impact of urban expansion."
“There is Nothing Fun About Pain”: A Critical Phenomenology of Games for Chronic Pain,"This article examines the gamification of health applications designed to help patients manage chronic pain. Through description of one such program and in-depth interviewing, I describe why gamified pain applications are appealing to patients living with chronic pain. Individuals living with chronic pain are especially disposed to try novel pain management technologies due to the in-control and out-of-control paradox of pain (Leder, 2016). These applications are seductive not only due to this embodied phenomenon, but also because gamification taps into the logic of proactive self-management that is tantamount to an era of biomedicalization, wherein subjects are incentivized to take control of their own health in the face of austerity budgets. However, pain also limits the user’s ability to adopt an immersive, lusory attitude. Thus, the speculative promises of gamified health technologies are just that – speculative, and their immersive potential should not be overstated."
Metacognitive effects of instructional visuals: the role of cue use and judgment type,"Prior research suggests most students do not glean valid cues from provided visuals, resulting in reduced metacomprehension accuracy. Across 4 experiments, we explored how the presence of instructional visuals affects students’ metacomprehension accuracy and cue-use for different types of metacognitive judgments. Undergraduates read texts on biology (Study 1a and b) or chemistry (Study 2 and 3) topics, made various judgments (test, explain, and draw) for each text, and completed comprehension tests. Students were randomly assigned to receive only texts (text-only condition) or texts with instructional visualizations (text-and-image condition). In Studies 1b, 2 and 3, students also reported the cues they used to make each judgment. Across the set of studies, instructional visualizations harmed relative metacomprehension accuracy. In Studies 1a and 2, this was especially the case when students were asked to judge how well they felt they could draw the processes described in the text. But in Study 3, this was especially the case when students were asked to judge how well they would do on a set of comprehension tests. In Studies 2 and 3, students who reported basing their judgments on representation-based cues demonstrated more accurate relative accuracy than students who reported using heuristic based cues. Further, across these studies, students reported using visual cues to make their draw judgments, but not their test or explain judgments. Taken together, these results indicate that instructional visualizations can hinder metacognitive judgment accuracy, particularly by influencing the types of cues students use to make judgments of their ability to draw key concepts."
Chemical composition and antioxidant and antibacterial properties of the essential oils extracted from Citrus sinensis peels by hydrodistillation and microwave methods,"The present study is devoted to evaluate in vitro the chemical composition and the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of essential oils (Eo) extracted by hydrodistillation (HD) and microwave (MW) from the plant peels of Citrus sinensis. The extraction provided yields of 0.26% and 0.02%, respectively. The essential oils were analyzed by GC–MS whose major component is limonene that has a remarkable percentage (78.192% and 58.6%, respectively) for the essential oil extracted by HD and MW. The results of the antioxidant potential were noticeable in each of the essential oils with a higher priority to that extracted by hydrodistillation. The evaluation of the antioxidant power by the free radical scavenging method (DPPH) showed that the essential oils studied have good antioxidant activity, especially for the oil extracted by HD having presented an IC50 of (13.07 ± 0.169) mg/ml, while BHT and ascorbic acid showed very potent and effective anti-free radical activity with IC50 of the order of (19.54 ± 0.32) µg/ml and (1.17 ± 0.05) µg/ml respectively. According to the β-carotene/linoleic acid test, the oxidation of β-carotene was effectively inhibited by the two essential oils of Citrus sinensis peels with a percentage of inhibition of (56.46 ± 0.76) % and (31.39 ± 1.49) % respectively for HD and MW. Eo extracted by HD is more active than ascorbic acid (15.43%). In the antibacterial test, the activity was evaluated by the disc-diffusion method, the two types of sweet orange essential oils inhibited the growth of five bacterial strains out of six: The best activity was obtained against E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Agrobacterium with a diameter of the zone of inhibition between 70 and 84 mm, with the exception of the strain of Bacillus subtilis, there is no zone of inhibition has been observed."
Landfill fire impact on bee health: beneficial effect of dietary supplementation with medicinal plants and probiotics in reducing oxidative stress and metal accumulation,"The honey bee is an important pollinator insect susceptible to environmental contaminants. We investigated the effects of a waste fire event on elemental content, oxidative stress, and metabolic response in bees fed different nutrients (probiotics, Quassia amara, and placebo). The level of the elements was also investigated in honey and beeswax. Our data show a general increase in elemental concentrations in all bee groups after the event; however, the administration of probiotics and Quassia amara help fight oxidative stress in bees. Significantly lower concentrations of Ni, S, and U for honey in the probiotic group and a general and significant decrease in elemental concentrations for beeswax in the probiotic group and Li in the Quassia amara group were observed after the fire waste event. The comparison of the metabolic profiles through pre- and post-event PCA analyses showed that bees treated with different feeds react differently to the environmental event. The greatest differences in metabolic profiles are observed between the placebo-fed bees compared to the others. This study can help to understand how some stress factors can affect the health of bees and to take measures to protect these precious insects."
The impact of climate change and human activities on the change in the net primary productivity of vegetation—taking Sichuan Province as an example,"Vegetation is an essential component of terrestrial ecosystems, influenced by climate change and human activities. Quantifying the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to vegetation dynamics is crucial for addressing global climate change. Sichuan Province is one of the essential ecological functional areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and its vegetation change is of great significance to the environmental function and ecological security of the Yangtze River Basin and southwest China. In this paper, the modified Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach(CASA) model was used to estimate the monthly NPP (Net Primary Productivity) of vegetation in Sichuan Province from 2000 to 2018, and the univariate linear regression analysis was used to analyze the temporal and spatial variation of vegetation NPP in Sichuan Province from 2000 to 2018. In addition, taking vegetation NPP as an index, Pearson correlation analysis, partial correlation analysis, and second-order partial correlation analysis were carried out to quantitatively analyze the contribution of climate change and human activities to vegetation NPP. Finally, the Hurst index and nonparametric Man-Kendall significance test were used to predict the future change trend of vegetation NPP in Sichuan Province. The results show that (1) from 2000 to 2018, the NPP of vegetation in Sichuan Province has a significant increasing trend (Slope = 6.09gC·m−2·a−1), with a multi-year average of 438.72 gC·m−2·a−1, showing a trend of low in the east and high in the middle. The response of vegetation NPP to altitude is different at different elevations; (2) the contribution rates of climate change and human activities to vegetation NPP change are 4.12gC·m−2·a−1 and 1.97gC·m−2·a−1, respectively. In contrast, the impact of human activities on NPP is more significant than climate change. Human activities are the main factors affecting vegetation restoration and degradation in Sichuan Province. However, the positive contribution to NPP change is less than climate change; (3) the future vegetation NPP change trend in Sichuan Province is mainly rising, and the same direction change trend is much larger than the reverse change trend. The areas with an increasing trend in the future account for 89.187% of the total area. This research helps understand the impact of climate change and human activities on vegetation change in Sichuan Province. It offers scientific bases for vegetation restoration and ecosystem management in Sichuan and the surrounding areas."
"Effect of 2850 MHz electromagnetic field radiation on the early growth, antioxidant activity, and secondary metabolite profile of red and green cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.)","The proliferation of wireless and other telecommunications equipment brought about by technological advances in the communication industry has substantially increased the radiofrequency radiation levels in the environment. The emphasis is, therefore, placed on investigating the potential impacts of radiofrequency radiation on biota. In this work, the impact of 2850 MHz electromagnetic field radiation (EMF-r) on early development, photosynthetic pigments, and the metabolic profile of two Brassica oleracea L. cultivars (red and green cabbage) was studied. On a daily basis for seven days, seedlings were exposed to homogeneous EMF-r for one, two, and four hours, and observations were carried out at 0-h, 1-h, and 24-h following the final dose. Irrespective of the duration of harvest, exposure to EMF-r resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in both root (from 6.3 cm to 4.0 cm in red; 6.1 cm to 3.8 cm in green) and shoot lengths (from 5.3 cm to ⁓3.1 cm in red; 5.1 cm to 3.1 cm in green), as well as a decrease in biomass (from 2.9 mg to ⁓1.1 mg in red; 2.5 to 0.9 mg in green) of the seedlings when compared to control samples. Likewise, the chlorophyll (from 6.09 to ⁓4.94 mg g−1 d.wt in red; 7.37 to 6.05 mg g−1 d.wt. in green) and carotenoid (from 1.49 to 1.19 mg g−1 d.wt. in red; 1.14 to 0.51 mg g−1 d.wt. in green) contents of both cultivars decreased significantly when compared to the control. Additionally, the contents of phenolic (28.99‒45.52 mg GAE g−1 in red; 25.49‒33.76 mg GAE g−1 in green), flavonoid (21.7‒31.8 mg QE g−1 in red; 12.1‒19.0 mg QE g−1 in green), and anthocyanin (28.8‒43.6 mg per 100 g d.wt. in red; 1.1‒2.6 mg per 100 g d.wt. in green) in both red and green cabbage increased with exposure duration. EMF-r produced oxidative stress in the exposed samples of both cabbage cultivars, as demonstrated by dose-dependent increases in the total antioxidant activity (1.33‒2.58 mM AAE in red; 1.29‒2.22 mM AAE in green), DPPH activity (12.96‒78.33% in red; 9.62‒67.73% in green), H2O2 content (20.0‒77.15 nM g−1 f.wt. in red; 14.28‒64.29 nM g−1 f.wt. in green), and MDA content (0.20‒0.61 nM g−1 f.wt. in red; 0.18‒0.51 nM g−1 f.wt. in green) compared to their control counterparts. The activity of antioxidant enzymes, i.e., superoxide dismutases (3.83‒8.10 EU mg−1 protein in red; 4.19‒7.35 EU mg−1 protein in green), catalases (1.81‒7.44 EU mg−1 protein in red; 1.04‒6.24 EU mg−1 protein in green), and guaiacol peroxidases (14.37‒47.85 EU mg−1 protein in red; 12.30‒42.79 EU mg−1 protein in green), increased significantly compared to their control counterparts. The number of polyphenols in unexposed and EMF-r exposed samples of red cabbage was significantly different. The study concludes that exposure to 2850 MHz EMF-r affects the early development of cabbage seedlings, modifies their photosynthetic pigments, alters polyphenol content, and impairs their oxidative metabolism."
A Novel Positioning Accuracy Improvement Method for Polishing Robot Based on Levenberg–Marquardt and Opposition-based Learning Squirrel Search Algorithm,"Achieving high-precision manufacturing of optical components requires improving the absolute positioning accuracy of the robot to the highest possible level. Identifying the robot's kinematic parameters and compensating for kinematic errors are effective methods for improving the robot's positioning accuracy. This paper proposes a hybrid algorithm that combines the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm and an opposition-based learning squirrel search algorithm to identify the kinematic parameters of a polishing robot. Firstly, the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm is utilized to solve the suboptimal values of kinematic parameter deviations. Secondly, an opposition-based learning strategy is integrated into the standard squirrel search algorithm to increase the diversity of the population and prevent the population from getting stuck in local optima. The suboptimal values obtained by the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm are subsequently used as the central values to generate the initial population for the opposition-based learning squirrel search algorithm, which helps identify more accurate kinematic parameter deviations. Ultimately, the kinematic parameters of the robot are effectively calibration. The calibration experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved a high level of calibration accuracy, resulting in a 62.61% improvement in absolute positioning error compared to before calibration. Offline machining experiments have validated the effectiveness of LM-OBLSSA in reducing deviations in the dwell points of optical components during the machining process."
"Investigation of structural, electrical and linear/non-linear optical properties of MgPc thin films grown by CSP technique for optoelectronic applications","Organic semiconductor MgPc thin films were grown onto n-Si, p-Si and corning glass substrates by Chemical Spray Pyrolysis (CSP) technique. The structural and surface morphological properties of MgPc thin films were investigated by XRD, RAMAN and FEG-SEM analysis. It was observed that the surface area on which MgPc thin films grow on n-Si and p-Si substrates were dendritic nanostructures and has homogeneous surface morphology. XRD patterns showed us that all organic semiconductor MgPc thin films have monoclinic α-phase structure with 2θ peak at − 7.8° which is 100%. X-ray diffraction and grain sizes measurements of MgPc thin films indicated that organic semiconductor MgPc thin films have nanocrystalline nature. We observed 25 Raman active peaks belonging to MgPc thin films. The diode parameters of p-MgPc/n-Si and p-MgPc/p-Si which are organic-inorganic hybrid heterojunctions have been investigated by current–voltage (I–V) measurements at room temperature in dark condition. The linear & non-linear optical properties of MgPc thin films growth on corning glass substrate were determined from transmittance and reflectance measurements. The optical bandgap of the organic MgPc semiconductor was found as 1.91 eV. The linear and nonlinear optical parameters of the organic MgPc thin film were investigated to determine the potential for use in optoelectronic applications."
The piezoelectric response of electrospun PVDF/PZT incorporated with pristine graphene nanoplatelets for mechanical energy harvesting,"Flexible nanogenerators based on electrospun piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/lead zirconium titanate (PZT) incorporated with unmodified graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) were fabricated via the electrospinning method. The microstructural and phase characterizations demonstrated a continuous and homogeneous fiber-shaped composite structure with good interfacial interaction between the GNP and the PVDF/PZT matrix. It was found that the diameter of the PVDF/PZT fibers was on average 270 nm, while the PVDF/PZT/GNP fiber with GNP content of 1.5wt.% had a diameter of approximately 236 nm. The piezoelectric performance evaluations of all nanogenerator devices indicated that the PVDF/PZT/GNP with GNP content of 1.5wt.% nanogenerator had an almost 6 times higher electrical output (8.68 µW) compared to that of the PVDF/PZT-based nanogenerator (1.51 µW) at 20 Hz within the same resistance of 2.5 MΩ. Considering its simple and low-cost fabrication technology, high performance, and stable electrical power efficiency, the introduced flexible nanogenerator based on the PVDF/PZT/GNP offers a promising capability of powering portable and wearable electronics."
Knockdown of circSlc8a1 inhibited the ferroptosis in the angiotensin II treated H9c2 cells via miR-673-5p/TFRC axis,"This study aimed to investigate the role of circSlc8a1 in cardiac hypertrophy (CH), a pathological change in various cardiovascular diseases."
Production of bioactive peptides with antioxidant and antihypertensive activities from wheat gluten using Withania coagulans,"This study aimed to produce bioactive hydrolysates and peptide fractions from wheat gluten using Withania coagulans plant protease, and evaluate antioxidant and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitory activities. Plant samples were collected and protease was extracted and purified using precipitation with ammonium sulfate. The enzyme activity was measured (7.3 U/ml) and highest enzyme activity (82%) was observed at 45 °C and pH 5. Wheat gluten hydrolysis was performed for 6 h and the degree of hydrolysis was measured (6.51%). Fractionation of gluten hydrolysates was performed using ultrafiltration and four peptide fractions were obtained, F1 (MW < 3 kDa), F2 (3 < MW < 30 kDa) and F3 (30 < MW < 100 kDa) and F4 (MW > 100 kDa). The highest solubility at pH 4 was exhibited by the F4 fraction. The highest DPPH radical scavenging activity was demonstrated by the F1 fraction. The highest value for angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitory activity was obtained for the F2 fraction. Our results showed that wheat gluten hydrolysis with Withania coagulans protease was an effective approach in order to generate bioactive hydrolysates and peptides, which could then be added to functional foods formulations and pharmaceutical products."
Acid heating treatment of octenyl succinate anhydride starch and its application in Pickering emulsion stability,"Starch-based Pickering emulsions have received much attention recently due to their low cost, biodegradability, and green characteristics. To investigate the effect of acid heat treatment on the physicochemical properties of octenyl succinic anhydride starch (OSAS) and the stability of Pickering emulsion, acid heat treatment of esterified starch with hydrochloric acid was performed to obtain samples with different degrees of treatment and to make Pickering emulsion. The structure of starch particles before and after acid heating treatment was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The stability of the emulsions was evaluated using the emulsion index, droplet size, and zeta potential. The results showed that compared to natural starch, acid heat treatment of esterified starch resulted in increased solubility, darker coloration, greater exposure of reducing ends leading to higher reducing sugar content, and reduced starch orderliness. However, the original granular morphology was still retained. Additionally, based on the emulsification index, droplet size, etc., it can be concluded that acid heat treatment OSAS is more suitable as a Pickering emulsion stabilizer compared to untreated OSAS."
A belief Sharma-Mittal divergence with its application in multi-sensor information fusion,"Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DSET) has a wide and important application in information fusion. However, when the pieces of evidence are highly conflicting, Dempster’s rule may lead to counter-intuitive results. To address this issue, a new enhanced belief Jensen-Sharma-Mittal (\(\mathcal {EBJSM}\)) divergence is proposed in this paper to measure the degree of conflict between the pieces of evidence. The \(\mathcal {EBJSM}\) divergence takes into account the influence of both single-element and multiple-element subsets. Furthermore, important properties of the \(\mathcal {EBJSM}\) divergence are explored and proved, including its non-negativity, non-degeneracy, symmetry and relationships with the belief Jensen-Tsallis divergence, the belief Jensen-Rényi divergence, the Kullback–Leibler divergence, the Hellinger distance and \(\chi ^2\) divergence. Based on the \(\mathcal {EBJSM}\) divergence and the improved belief entropy, a new multi-sensor information fusion method is designed. Finally, the proposed multi-sensor information fusion method is applied to several applications, and the practicality and effectiveness of the new method is verified. In particular, the proposed method achieved the best average classification accuracy of 0.9292 on the Iris dataset."
The Risk for Readmission to Juvenile Detention: The Role of Trauma Exposure and Trauma-related Mental Health Disorders,"The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of childhood trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress disorder, and trauma-related comorbid diagnoses on the risk for readmission to juvenile detention among youth in a large metropolitan area (N = 1282). The following research questions were addressed: 1) Does a greater number of childhood traumas increase the risk for readmission to detention following release? 2) Does the risk for readmission differ by type of trauma? 3) Do PTSD and other co-morbid diagnoses increase the risk for readmission? and 4) What role do demographic factors play in the relationship between trauma-related variables and risk for readmission? This study utilized the screening results of 1282 youth who were voluntarily screened for PTSD, depressive symptoms and substance use during their initial intake to detention. More than half of the sample was readmitted during the three-year study period, with readmissions most likely to occur within one year of release. Returning to detention within one year was also associated with increased risk for multiple readmissions. Youth readmitted to detention were more likely to have a history of sexual abuse and problematic substance use. No other significant relationships were found between risk for readmission and trauma-related variables. Although trauma-related symptoms may be crucial targets for treatment, focusing solely on trauma exposure and traumatic stress symptoms without considering the impact of other risk factors may not be enough to decrease the likelihood of readmission for youth of color in a large urban environment."
School Stratification and Science Climate in Early Secondary Education in Ireland and Flanders: Associations with Students’ Science Dispositions and Science Literacy,"Adaptive science dispositions (epistemology, enjoyment, interest, and self-efficacy) have been shown to be related to schools’ science climate and science literacy. School stratification may promote positive linkages among science dispositions, science literacy, and science climate. To examine the association between school stratification and such linkages, we undertook a comparative study of early secondary schools in Ireland (less stratified—modest tracking, modest grade retention) and Flanders (Dutch-speaking Belgian region; more stratified—multiple tracks, extensive grade retention). Using Program for International Student Assessment (PISA 2015) data and multilevel modeling methods, we included 5419 (Ireland) and 5675 (Flanders) students nested within 157 and 171 schools, respectively. Student- and school-level variables with potential associations with our outcome measures (science dispositions for the first research question (RQ1); science literacy for RQ2) were included in baseline models. Subsequent models estimated “over-and-above” associations of science climate with science dispositions (RQ1) and of both science dispositions and climate with science literacy (RQ2). Science dispositions, as outcomes, were associated with disciplinary climate and teaching support in science classroom, particularly in Ireland. All four science dispositions (as independent variables) were associated with science literacy (both separately and in concert) for both Irish and Flemish cases. Epistemology was most strongly associated with science literacy. A less stratified school system may grant teachers more opportunities to craft positive science learning environments. A more stratified school system may amplify existing divergences in science (dispositions and literacy)."
MALT1 Protease Regulates T-Cell Immunity via the mTOR Pathway in Oral Lichen Planus,"Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a T cell–mediated immune mucosal disease of unknown pathogenesis. Whether mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1), an intracellular signaling protein, is involved in the T-cell immune dysfunction of OLP remains elusive. MALT1 expression in local and peripheral T cells of OLP and controls was analyzed using immunohistochemistry, multiplex immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. The expression of MALT1 in activated Jurkat T cells incubated with either OLP plasma or interleukin (IL)-7/IL-15 was determined by flow cytometry. The effects of MALT1 and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) on T-cell immunity were investigated through western blot, CCK8 assay, and flow cytometry. The expression of MALT1 protein was elevated in local OLP T cells and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, while reduced in peripheral OLP T cells, MAIT cells, and follicular helper-like MAIT (MAITfh) cells. Stimulation with OLP plasma and IL-7/ IL-15 had no effect on MALT1 expression in activated Jurkat T cells. MALT1 protease-specific inhibitor (MI-2) induced mTOR phosphorylation, increased B-cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10) expression, inhibited T-cell proliferation, and promoted T-cell apoptosis. The combination of MI-2 and rapamycin increased MALT1 expression, further suppressed T-cell proliferation, and facilitated T-cell apoptosis. MALT1 expression is aberrant in both local lesions and peripheral blood of OLP. Inhibition of the mTOR pathway further enhances the suppression of T-cell proliferation and the promotion of apoptosis induced by the MALT1 inhibitor MI-2."
A pre-burning treatment facilitating formation of pores in biochars and reinforcing their electrochemical performance in supercapacitor,"Continuous efforts are always being made to reinforce biochars’ properties for large-scale utilization in new energy devices. Here, a pre-burning treatment is introduced for preparing the biochars from shaddock peel, longan pericarp, and loofah sponge. The results of XRD demonstrate more disordered structures are caused in the prepared biochars by the pre-burning, which also introduces more oxygen-containing functional groups on the biochars’ surface discovered by the FTIR and XPS tests. The N2 adsorption–desorption results indicate that the pre-burning can facilitate pore formation in the biochars, boosting specific surface area and pore volume, significantly reducing the average pore size of biochars. Specifically, for the loofah sponge based biochar, the pre-burning treatment causes an increase in specific surface area (from 271 to 973 m2 g−1), a rise in pore volume (from 0.22 to 0.53 cm3 g−1), and a decrease in average pore diameter (from 3.21 to 2.3 nm). The specific capacitance of the supercapacitor with the loofah sponge based biochar electrodes is raised from 85.4 to 170 F g−1at 0.5 A g−1 by the pre-burning treatment. Besides, the longan pericarp-derived biochar with the pre-burning treatment achieves a power density of 5000 W kg−1 under an energy density of 21.81 Wh kg−1. We believe the pre-burning treatment is an effective and convenient route for the reinforcement of biochars."
"Preparation, Structural Characterization, and Enzymatic Properties of Alginate Lyase Immobilized on Magnetic Chitosan Microspheres","Alginate lyase is an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of alginate into alginate oligoalginates. To enhance enzyme stability and recovery, a facile strategy for alginate lyase immobilization was developed. Novel magnetic chitosan microspheres were synthesized and used as carriers to immobilize alginate lyase. The immobilization of alginate lyase on magnetic chitosan microspheres was successful, as proven by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction spectra. Enzyme immobilization exhibited the best performance at an MCM dosage of 1.5 g/L, adsorption time of 2.0 h, glutaraldehyde concentration of 0.2%, and immobilization time of 2.0 h. The optimal pH of the free alginate lyase was 7.5, and this pH value was shifted to 8.0 after immobilization. No difference was observed at the optimal temperature (45 °C) for the immobilized and free enzymes. The immobilized alginate lyase displayed better thermal stability than the free alginate lyase. The Km values of the free and immobilized enzymes were 0.05 mol/L and 0.09 mol/L, respectively. The immobilized alginate lyase retained 72% of its original activity after 10 batch reactions. This strategy was found to be a promising method for immobilizing alginate lyase."

Additionally, we reviewed all the reported right paraduodenal hernia cases and proposed appropriate surgical strategies according to different anatomical features."
Modeling Uncertainty Energy Price Based on Interval Optimization and Energy Management in the Electrical Grid,"Energy providers are faced with the challenge of effectively managing electrical energy systems amidst uncertainties. This study focuses on the management and dispatch of energy demand in the electricity microgrid, employing an interval optimization strategy to address electricity price uncertainties. The demand response program (DRP) incentive modeling is utilized to implement demand dispatch. To mitigate the impact of electricity price uncertainties, an incentive modeling approach based on offering reduced electricity demand during peak periods is proposed. The interval optimization approach is employed to minimize operational costs, with the epsilon constraint-based fuzzy method utilized to solve and address the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach under conditions of uncertainty is demonstrated through the use of the microgrid in various case studies and numeric simulations. The participation of the DRP leads to minimizing the average and deviation costs by 9.5% and 6.5% in comparison with non-participation."
A novel methodology for the optimization of design parameters of electromagnetic relays,"The reliability of electromagnetic relays is affected by dynamic and contact bounce behaviors. To address this issue, a novel optimal parameter design strategy based on a nonlinear contact model and constrained optimization method is proposed to compensate for the effects of complicated contact bounces. Dynamic response is considered within a multi-objective optimization problem, which balances closure efficiency and bounce optimization. Given engineering design requirements, a constrained multi-objective optimization model is built. To solve the optimization model and search Pareto solutions of optimal design parameters, a self-adaptive updating operator is included in the multi-objective differential evolution algorithm. Considering the robustness requirement and parameter uncertainties introduced by the manufacturing process, a robustness evaluation criterion based on Monte Carlo simulation is used to attain the most robust set of design parameters from the Pareto solutions. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy are well verified by commercial electromagnetic relays, including specific achievements such as a computational accuracy of 96.34% for the nonlinear contact model, complete suppression of contact bounce in the optimized relay, and the identification of five sets of design parameters that meet the reliability requirements of electromagnetic relays while considering the robustness of these parameters."
Modeling and hardware implementation of a class of Hamiltonian conservative chaotic systems with transient quasi-period and multistability,"Compared with dissipative chaotic systems, conservative chaotic systems are more suitable for secure communication based on chaos. In this paper, an effective method for constructing a class of four-dimensional conservative chaotic systems is proposed by coupling four generalized Euler equations with four coupling parameters. Moreover, this method is also applicable to the construction of higher-dimensional Hamiltonian conservative systems. The chaotic and conservative properties of the system are verified in detail by relevant analytical methods, including equilibrium points, phase diagram, Lyapunov exponents, bifurcation diagram, energy, and transient quasi-periodic orbit. An interesting transient quasi-period phenomenon is observed in the new system. In addition, the Hamiltonian energy level affects the coexistence behavior of the new system. The coexistence phenomenon was analyzed from an energy perspective. With the increase in Hamiltonian energy level, the ergodicity and randomness increase. Besides, the system also has abundant coexistence orbitals at equal energy levels. Finally, the National Institute of Standards and Technology test verifies that the pseudo-random sequence based on the new system has good pseudo-randomness, and the hardware circuit of the system is realized by field programmable gate array, and the physical feasibility of the system is verified. This study demonstrates that the constructed class of Hamiltonian conservative chaotic systems is a good entropy source that can be applied to various chaotic embedded systems, including secure communication systems, cryptographic systems, and random number generators."
"Lessons from the holy grail of industrial psychology: theoretical, practical, and social implications for HRM in the current landscape of academia amidst the Covid-19 crisis","The relationship between job satisfaction and job performance, known as the holy grail of industrial psychology, has been extensively researched but with conflicting results. Our study revisits this relationship in the context of academic organizations amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, thus providing insights for HRM in academic settings. A dynamic cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) was employed, utilizing longitudinal data from 217 lecturers in Malaysian institutions collected before, after, and two months following the initial strict lockdown in 2020. Gender and age were also considered as potential influencing factors over time. The study, aligning with the Affective Events Theory, found no direct relationship between job satisfaction and job performance, with neither being stable over time. There were no gender differences in job satisfaction and job performance, but age was a predictor of both only at the start of the lockdown. Our study indicates that it is crucial to prioritize policies and practices that enhance lecturers’ job performance, particularly during stressful situations, since job performance is more significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The study also highlights the significance of lecturers’ job satisfaction and job performance, as two important psychological constructs, in the current landscape of academia that focuses on talent management and the development of knowledge societies."
Quantum photonics advancements enhancing health and sports performance,"Given that AI has been developing quickly in recent years, its usage has become increasingly important. It has had a significant influence on a variety of industries, including sports. Although not many experts are discussing it, the use of AI in sports has become commonplace. Predictive analytics has made it possible for many different kinds of athletic events to produce more precise outcomes and judgements. Making the game more difficult on and off the pitch is one of sports AI's main objectives. As a result, it is critical for sports firms to always stay current. As we analyse this document, our goal is to comprehend and research fresh, cutting-edge ways to apply artificial intelligence (AI) to the world of sports. Elite sports require objective evaluation of an athlete’s performance to enable in-depth quantum photonics research. The shortcomings of manual performance analysis techniques are solved by the application of automatic detection as well as recognition of sport-specific motions. Inertial measurement unit (IMU) and/or computer vision data inputs were used in this work to recognise sport-specific movements. The goal of the study was to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of literature on ML and DL for these purposes. There was a multi-database search done. Included papers must to have examined a sport-specific movement and used machine learning or deep learning techniques to construct a model."
Photo-induced single-electron tunnelling based Coulomb staircase effect observed at high applied bias in ZnSe/CdSe core-shell quantum dots,"In this study, ZnSe, CdSe, and their inverse type-I ZnSe/CdSe core-shell quantum dots (QDs) have been synthesized through the chemical bath deposition using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a capping agent. Various structural and morphological characterizations were carried out which reveal the cubic zinc blende type structure having spherical shaped core and core-shell QDs nanostructures. The synthesized samples were excited by white light at different intensities in order to investigate their photoinduced current-voltage (I–V) characteristics. The Coulomb staircase, a unique quantum mechanical phenomenon, is observed in the I–V characteristics of the core-shell QDs when white light interacts with them. A semiempirical two-tunnel junction model for the QDs has been adopted to examine the phenomenon quantitatively. The genesis and nature of this photon-induced unique behavior have been discussed in length. The observed photon-assisted oscillatory Coulomb staircase behavior in the ZnSe/CdSe core-shell QDs is attributed to surface and interface-induced defects that occurred during the synthesis process. The current study focuses primarily on the novel photo-electronic properties of ZnSe/CdSe core-shell QDs, which necessitates a more detailed theoretical investigation to enable the implementation of these materials in next-generation nanoelectronic devices."
"Structural, linear/nonlinear optical, and electrical characteristics of polyvinyl chloride doped with non-stoichiometric nano cadmium sulfide","In this work, it was proposed to introduce non-stoichiometric nano cadmium sulfide (CdS1-x) nanoparticles into polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polymer using simple, environmentally friendly and low-cost techniques. Undoped and doped PVC polymers with non-stoichiometric CdS1-x were formed using casting and thermolysis procedures. Rietveld refinement was applied to identify the phases formed and microstructure parameters in non-stoichiometric CdS1-x. Different techniques were used to investigate the structure, morphology, optical properties and dielectric of polymer films. The direct and indirect optical band gap (Eg) values of the undoped PVC film are 5.63 eV and (5.22, 4.49, 3.51) eV. As the sulfur concentration in the nanofiller increased to 97%, the direct and indirect Eg values of the CdS1-x doped polymers decreased to (5.21, 4.07, 2.44) eV and (4.18, 2.3, 2.03) eV, respectively. The optical dielectric constant and optical conductivity reached their maximum values as the amount of sulfur reached 97% in CdS1-x. Doped polymers are effective materials against UVA, UVB, and UVC spectra and work very well as solar cell absorber materials. The CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram revealed that PVC shifted from blue color to green-yellow and yellow-orange regions under excitation wavelengths of 317 and 380 nm, respectively. The electrical dielectric constant reached its maximum value when the sulfur content of the nanofiller reached 95%. AC conductivity has its maximum value when PVC is loaded with CdS0.9. The manageable optical and electrical features show that PVC/CdS1-x polymers could be potential optical materials in the development of futuristic flexible-type optoelectronic devices."
Preparation and exploration of optical performance of novel polythiophene-ZrO2 composites,"Studies were carried out to comprehend the synergetic effect of ZrO2 on the optical behavior of Polythiophene (PTh). PTh was composited with the requisite amount of ZrO2 to produce the novel composite materials (PZs), which were further investigated for their optical properties viz. optical band-gap, extinction coefficient, refractive index, dielectric constants, and consequently optical conductivity. The studies represent the composite PZ-1 (PTh: ZrO2, 2:1 w/w%) shows a low optical band-gap (2.45 eV) as compared to PTh (3.14 eV), ZrO2 (3.51 eV) and other PZs, owing to the overlap of the valance and conduction bands of the two components. Correspondingly the optical conductivity of PZ-1 was encountered to be 1.55 × 1011 Scm−1 which is much higher as compared to all the other PZs and individual components, thus, suggesting the potential application of ZrO2-Doped PTh (PZ-1) in optoelectronic devices. The optical band gap and optical conductivity for PZs (especially PZ-1) were found to be much more promising as compared to other studies represented on PTh and its composites. Studies like FT-IR, SEM, TGA, and DSC were carried out to study the other important parameters of the PTh, ZrO2, and PZs."
High dimensional image super-resolution model based on infrared spectral imaging for aerobics training simulation monitoring,"In the process of calisthenics training, athletes’ movements need to be monitored and analyzed. The traditional monitoring method has the problem of insufficient resolution, which limits the improvement of accuracy and reliability. In this paper, a high dimensional image super resolution model is developed by using infrared spectral imaging technology to improve the monitoring and simulation results in the process of aerobics training. In this paper, infrared spectral imaging technology combined with deep learning algorithm is used to design a high dimensional image super resolution model. Infrared spectral imaging data were collected during aerobics training, and the data were trained and learned to extract features and realize super-resolution reconstruction. Finally, the model is tested and verified to evaluate its monitoring and simulation effect in aerobics training. The experimental results show that the high-dimensional image super resolution model has good monitoring and simulation effects in aerobics training. By increasing the detail and clarity of the image, the model can provide more accurate motion analysis and motion suggestions, so as to help the trainer improve the movement skills and improve the training effect."
"Multiple single-channel cryptosystem based on QZ decomposition, CMYK color space fusion and wavelength multiplexing","A new multiple-single-channel cryptosystem using QZ decomposition, cyan-magenta-yellow-black (CMYK) color space fusion and wavelength multiplexing is proposed. In this cryptosystem, the four LL subbands of the first set of the four RGB images are fused. The RGB image is first converted into CMYK image and then decomposed into C, M, Y and K channels. The C and M channels and the Y and K channels are decomposed independently by QZ decomposition to generate two upper quasitriangular matrices and two unitary matrices. The four upper quasitriangular matrices are fused to construct a single-channel image, which is modulated by the first random biometric key (RBK) and then Fresnel transformed. The resulting image is modulated again by the second RBK and then Fresnel transformed. Each Fresnel spectrum is analytically decomposed into phase-only mask (POM) and amplitude-only mask (AOM). The sum of POMs (as an encrypted image) and the sum of AOMs (as a common decryption key) for N sets are obtained separately. The proposed system has the main advantages of a common decryption key for multiple images, the phase key and amplitude key as individual decryption keys, and two RBKs as unique individual encryption keys to endure potential attacks. A hybrid optoelectronic system can be employed to implement the proposed method. Numerical simulation results prove the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system."
The experimental and MD studies of the sorption processes of organic molecules on the SiO2 surface,"In this paper the experimental and molecular dynamics studies have been performed for the adsorption processes of n-butanol and butyl acetate on the SiO2 surface. The experimental measurements of the adsorption/desorption processes of n-butanol and butyl acetate on the SiO2 surface include data from thermokinetic spectrometry. Additionally, the computer molecular dynamics (MD) simulations involved the analysis of temperature, energy, and structural characteristics of the adsorption processes of n-butanol and butyl acetate on the SiO2 surface. Based on the MD simulations of the triple system—surface (SiO2)—carrier gas (Ar)—target molecule (n-butanol, butyl acetate), radial distribution function (RDF) profiles were constructed and analyzed at three temperatures of the system: T = 300, 500, and 700 K. A comparative analysis of the results reveals that the addition of an acetate group enhances the affinity of the butyl acetate molecule towards the SiO2 surface. Consequently, the adsorption process of butyl acetate occurs more completely at higher temperatures compared to n-butanol. In addition, changes in size influence the arrangement of atoms within the butyl acetate molecule relative to the surface atoms of SiO2, leading to the observed ""displacement"" effect of an identical chain for both molecules (n-butanol and butyl acetate) of the carbon ""skeleton"" atoms (C1(Q=−3)–C2(Q=−2)–C3(Q=−2)–C4(Q=−1)–O1(Q=−2)). The experimental data on the desorption processes of n-butanol and butyl acetate from the SiO2 surface in the triple system ""n-butanol/SiO2/argon"" (""butyl acetate/SiO2/argon"") yield an Arrhenius activation energy value of 78.83 kJ/mol (87.58 kJ/mol) and a pre-exponential multiplier value of 4.41 × 107 s−1 (1.81 × 1010 s−1)."
Investigation of solitons structures for nonlinear ionic currents microtubule and Mikhaillov-Novikov-Wang dynamical equations,"In this work, we analysis the novel behavior of solitons to the nonlinear evolution equations describing the ionic currents microtubule and Mikhaillov-Novikov-Wang dynamical equations under an auxiliary equation approach. As a result, a variety of solitons solutions are achieved such as singular bright solitons, kink solitons, singular dark solitons and anti-kink solitons. All outcomes in this work are necessary to understand the physical meaning and behavior of the explored results and shed light on the significance of the investigation of several nonlinear wave phenomena in sciences and engineering including nonlinear optics, material energy, soliton wave theory, computational fluid mechanics, system identification, earthquake modeling, water wave mechanics, signal transmission, and optical fibers. We designed the utilized approach to be reliable and accurate, with precise for analytical results."
Deep graphene based reconfigurable circularly polarized star-shaped microstrip antenna design at terahertz frequencies for biomedical application,"Next generation wireless communication (WC) needs high-performance which assist high-speed data transmission while meeting the requirements for low profile, weight and cost. Several researchers introduce graphene-based circular, triangular, square and hexagonal antenna for WC in the terahertz (THz) resonant frequency (RF). This research work introduces a deep graphene based reconfigurable circularly polarized star-shaped microstrip antenna at 2.98 THz frequency for biomedical application. Graphene has been applied in the structure of star-shaped microstrip antenna. This reconfigurable circularly polarized graphene-based antenna is obtained on a SiO2 substrate. The introduced circularly polarized antenna has a single feed and an easy design. The major objective of this research work is to propose graphene material as an efficient solution in designing antenna for organizing and adjusting its polarization. Because of the complexity of the structure of graphene antenna, enhanced scalable graph random improved Fick’s law neural networks is applied for predicting the antenna parameters. This proposed method is a combination of enhanced scalable graph random neural network (ESGRNN) and an improved Fick’s law optimization which is used to optimize the prediction error of the proposed ESGRNN. To prevent premature incomplete convergence in the traditional Fick's law algorithm, a dynamic lens-imaging learning strategy is incorporated. Finally, the achieved prediction accuracy is 98%, the mean square error is 2%, minimal return loss (S11) is − 55.98 dB, impedance bandwidth is 800 GHz, gain is 9.8 dB, and voltage standing wave ratio is 1.011 at 2.98 THz RF. As a result, the designed antenna is well-suitable for biomedical applications like riboflavin detection."
Potential to reduce the nitrate residue after harvest in maize fields without sacrificing yield through precision nitrogen management,"Site-specific nitrogen management has been proposed as a tool to increase crop yield while decreasing nutrient losses to the environment. Many reports can be found on sensing technologies to quantify the variability within a field and the definition of management zones based on the observed variability. However, fewer studies have been dedicated to the selection of the most suitable N fertilizer management scenario: should more or less nutrients be applied in the zones with a lower crop productivity potential? To address this knowledge gap, nine Flemish maize fields were selected as potential candidates for precision fertilization based on the soil maps and historical vegetation index patterns. Within each field, two management zones were identified based on historical vegetation index patterns and electrical conductivity maps, and different fertilization strategies were tested in each zone. The field trial results in terms of yield and soil residual nitrate showed that site-specific N management outperforms the conventional practice only in the fields with temporally stable management zones. In the fields having differences in the physical soil properties (e.g. presence of stones or clay particles), affecting water availability, lower fertilization in zones with a poor soil productivity potential could be recommended. In the fields where the performance of the management zones changes from year to year mainly due to annual variation in precipitation, a risk of incorrect implementation of the precision fertilization concept was identified. Historical NDVI time series serve a good basis to delineate the temporally stable management zones."
Characterization and geophysical evaluation of the recent 2023 Alausí landslide in the northern Andes of Ecuador,"The province of Chimborazo located in the northern Andes of Ecuador presents many intrinsic factors, which contribute to the occurrence of mass movements, leaving in many of the cases registered damages of materials and loss of life. The recent landslide of March 26, 2023, in the Alausí canton is an event of great interest due to the magnitude of the occurred destruction and the corresponding fatalities. Therefore, there are two predominant objectives of the current study, of which the first has been to determine the most relevant characteristics of this mass movement by identifying and analyzing the geomorphology of the recorded slope movement and the lithological units involved, by field work and through geophysical surveys. Secondly, we performed a preliminary study of the possible triggers of the movement by means of the historical analysis of the precipitations during the months of January to March of the last decade and the study of the recent seismic series. However, through the obtained analysis, it is determined that the study site is composed of three distinctive lithological units. The observed mass movement is of the rotational type, as result of the intense rainfall that occurred during the first quarter of 2023, being hereby the most probable triggering factor. This corresponds to a 600% increase in the average monthly rainfall compared to the period from 2010 to 2022."
Double-index rainfall warning and probabilistic physically based model for fast-moving landslide hazard analysis in subtropical-typhoon area,"In subtropical typhoon-prone regions, landslides are triggered by short-duration intense rainfall and prolonged periods of elevated pore-water pressure. However, fast-moving landslides pose a significant challenge for timely warning because of insufficient data on rainfall triggers and the identification of potential failure sites. Thus, our study introduces an integrated approach that combines a double-index intensity-duration (I-D) threshold, accounting for daily rainfall (R0) and 5-d effective rainfall (R5), with the MC-TRIGRS, a probabilistic physically based model, to analyze fast-moving landslide hazards at a regional scale. This approach is characterized by its innovative features: (i) it employs a double-index model to categorize rainfall events, differentiating between long-term continuous rainfall and short-term intense precipitation; (ii) it utilizes a comprehensive dataset from extensive field investigations to implement the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) -enhanced long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) to predict soil thickness distributions across the study area; and (iii) it adopts the classical Monte Carlo method to calculate failure probabilities under various rainfall scenarios, incorporating randomness in key soil parameters, such as cohesion and internal friction angle. By leveraging geotechnical data from both field and laboratory tests and integrating the accumulated knowledge, these models can be applied to the coastal mountainous basins of Eastern China, a region highly prone to landslides. Our goal was to augment the effectiveness of landslide early warning systems. Particularly, the synergistic use of rainfall empirical statistics and probabilistic physically based slope stability models is poised to bolster real-time control and risk mitigation strategies, providing a robust solution for short-term preparedness."
Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with multiple sclerosis who received SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and are under treatment with high-efficacy therapies in Argentina,We aimed to evaluate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in people with MS (PwMS) on high-efficacy disease-modifying therapies (HET) included in the national MS registry in Argentina (RelevarEM).
Fatal Accident Analysis and Hazard Identification in Turkish Coal-Extracting Industry Using Analytic Hierarchy Process,"The aim of this study is to present hazard classifications of location, type, and causes of accidents in Turkish coal-extracting industries using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). In this study, fatal mine accidents were analyzed by pairwise comparison and weighting, and the most important hazards were identified by determining the effective main and sub-criteria among location, type, and causes of accidents. For this purpose, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level hazards consisting of location, type, and causes of accident were determined by using the data of fatal mine accidents in underground and open-pit coal mining in Turkey between the years of 2010 and 2020. And then the data were categorized, and each category was prioritized using the AHP technique. According to the weights calculated by AHP, the most dangerous main criteria at 1st level hazards in underground coal mining is ventilation operations (0.363), while the most dangerous sub-criterion at 2nd level hazards is firedamp explosions and other gas accidents (0.409). On the other hand, in open-pit coal mining, the most dangerous main criteria at 1st level hazards are slopes and benches (0.575), while the most dangerous sub-criterion at 2nd level hazards are landslides (0.429)."

Indonesian literacy teachers’ efforts to integrate children’s literature in literacy classrooms,"Literacy is now an essential part of teaching for Indonesian teachers. This qualitative case study reports on three Indonesian teachers as they integrate the use of children’s literature into their literacy instruction. For 4 months, the teachers’ efforts to use children’s literature were documented through multiple sources such as focus group discussions and interviews, teachers’ reflections, and classroom observational notes. The study uses the reader-response theory framework, especially the notion of teachers as part of the learning context in promoting students’ engagement with a text. The study highlighted some case study teachers’ classroom practices centering on children’s literature, giving access to books, infusing children’s literature in teaching, and using books to discuss difficult topics with students. The findings discussion sheds light on some contributing factors to the teachers’ decision to integrate children’s literature into their classrooms and how they could make such decisions. The discussion points to a larger picture of how these teachers were empowered to make decisions to integrate children’s literature, particularly with diverse themes."
Probabilistic Seismic Risk Assessment of a reinforced concrete building considering hazard level and the resulting vulnerability using Bayesian Belief Network,"Seismic losses have significantly increased in size and frequency during the past few years, harming the economy and communities. Seismic Risk Assessment (SRA) requires integration of seismic hazard, building exposure and vulnerability, which entails many levels of complicated models, and necessitates taking uncertainties into account. The present study focuses on the probabilistic SRA of a single building, thereby excluding building exposure modelling and incorporating only seismic hazard and the resulting building vulnerability. In this study, the confidence level on probabilistic SRA is enhanced by considering a soft computing technique like Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) that makes use of the strength of Bayesian statistics to account for complicated connections and correlations amongst events at different levels of a network model of the system. This approach is based on developing a node-based model and assigning probabilities to each node by forming a Conditional Probability Table (CPT), which is based on both data as well as logically driven assumptions. The probabilistic seismic risk obtained has been represented in the form of three indices: low, medium and high. The established BBN model is next subjected to sensitivity analysis, which can help with the evaluation of updated data as new information from experimental observations or improved simulations is integrated. The application of the methodology is illustrated for a reinforced concrete (RC) hospital building located at Silchar city in northeast India, which is one of the most seismically active regions of the country. The developed model enables the identification of the seismic risk associated with a particular building which can be utilised to guide stakeholders, policymakers and designers in the efficient planning of emergency response, rescue operations and recovery activities."
MD-UNet: a medical image segmentation network based on mixed depthwise convolution,"In the process of cancer diagnosis and treatment, accurate extraction of the lesion area helps the doctor to judge the condition. Currently, medical image segmentation algorithms based on UNet have been verified to be able to play an important role in clinical diagnosis. However, these methods still have the following drawbacks in extracting the region of interest (ROI): (1) ignoring the intra-class variability of medical images. (2) Failure to obtain effective feature redundancy. To address these problems, a U-shaped medical image segmentation network based on a Mixed depthwise convolution residual module (MDRM), called MD-UNet, is proposed in this paper. In MD-UNet, the MDRM built with a Mixed depthwise convolution attention block (MDAB) captures both local and global dependencies in the image to mitigate the effects of intra-class differences. MDAB captures valid redundant features and further captures global features of the input data. At the same time, the lightweight MDAB senses changes in the receptive field and generates multiple feature mappings. Compared with UNeXt on the ISIC2018 dataset, the MD-UNet segmentation accuracy Dice and IoU are improved by 1.33% and 1.91%, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/Cloud-Liu/MD-UNet."
Application of image analysis and machine learning for the assessment of grape (Vitis L.) berry behavior under different storage conditions,"Fresh grapes are characterized by a short shelf life and are often subjected to quality losses during post-harvest storage. The quality assessment of grapes using image analysis may be a useful approach using non-destructive methods. This study aimed to compare the effect of different storage methods on the grape image texture parameters of the fruit outer structure. Grape bunches were stored for 4 weeks using 3 storage methods ( – 18 °C, + 4 °C, and room temperature) and then were subjected subsequently to image acquisition using a flatbed scanner and image processing. The models for the classification of fresh and stored grapes were built based on selected image textures using traditional machine learning algorithms. The fresh grapes and stored fruit samples (for 4 weeks) in the freezer, in the refrigerator and in the room were classified with an overall accuracy reaching 96% for a model based on selected texture parameters from images in color channels R, G, B, L, a, and b built using Random Forest algorithm. Among the individual color channels, the carried-out classification for the R color channel produced the highest overall accuracies of up to 92.5% for Random Forest. As a result, this study proposed an innovative approach combining image analysis and traditional machine learning to assess changes in the outer structure of grape berries caused by different storage conditions."
Comparison of high-resolution mass spectrometry acquisition methods for the simultaneous quantification and identification of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),"Simultaneous identification and quantification of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were evaluated for three quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF) acquisition methods. The acquisition methods investigated were MS-Only, all ion fragmentation (All-Ions), and automated tandem mass spectrometry (Auto-MS/MS). Target analytes were the 25 PFAS of US EPA Method 533 and the acquisition methods were evaluated by analyte response, limit of quantification (LOQ), accuracy, precision, and target-suspect screening identification limit (IL). PFAS LOQs were consistent across acquisition methods, with individual PFAS LOQs within an order of magnitude. The mean and range for MS-Only, All-Ions, and Auto-MS/MS are 1.3 (0.34–5.1), 2.1 (0.49–5.1), and 1.5 (0.20–5.1) pg on column. For fast data processing and tentative identification with lower confidence, MS-Only is recommended; however, this can lead to false-positives. Where high-confidence identification, structural characterisation, and quantification are desired, Auto-MS/MS is recommended; however, cycle time should be considered where many compounds are anticipated to be present. For comprehensive screening workflows and sample archiving, All-Ions is recommended, facilitating both quantification and retrospective analysis. This study validated HRMS acquisition approaches for quantification (based upon precursor data) and exploration of identification workflows for a range of PFAS compounds."
Low-dose Rivaroxaban: is it a safe alternative in Chinese older patients?,10 mg rivaroxaban is widely used in the Chinese mainland. This study aims to explore the association between 10 mg once daily rivaroxaban and all-cause mortality in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).
Female preferences for dominant frequency in frogs: constraints and impact on sexual size dimorphism,"Favoring males’ specific sexual signals, female preferences play a major role in frogs’ evolutionary process by selecting traits linked to those signals. However, the factors constraining and determining those preferences are scarcely explored in an evolutionary background. Here, through a phylogenetic comparative approach we check whether anuran species phylogenetic proximity and calling site predicts female preferences for dominant frequency and whether those preferences influence species sexual size dimorphism. Our hypotheses are as follows: 1) closer species have similar females’ preferences related to the dominant frequency of the partners’ calls; 2) the calling site influences sound propagation and consequently the preference of females for the dominant frequency of the males’ calls; and 3) the preference for calls with low dominant frequency influences the size of the males and consequent reduction of the biSased dimorphism for females. We did not find support for our hypotheses, neither for the influence of phylogenetic proximity nor for calling site determining these preferences. Moreover, female preferences did not impact on species sexual size dimorphism. Besides shedding light into our hypotheses, this study represents a considerable advance on evolutionary studies of female preferences in anura, which still lacks broad species comparative approaches. Furthermore, we suggest future studies to expand knowledge regarding frogs’ female preferences."

"Evaluating biogas potential of organic fraction of wholesale market wastes in New Delhi, India: anaerobic co-digestion with sewage sludge and cattle manure","This study investigated the influence of seasonal variation of fruits, vegetables and agrowastes (FVA) generated in wholesale markets in New Delhi, India, for biogas production. The mechanically pretreated FVA wastes were individually co-digested with waste activated sludge (WAS) under mesophilic conditions for 30 d. The combination of radish leaves with WAS exhibited the highest biogas yield of 407.22 mL/g VSfed. Later, four different mixed combinations were formulated based on four different seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon and winter) to digest using three different inocula: waste activated sludge (WAS), cow dung and anaerobic sludge. The mixed combination of substrates for the winter season co-digested with WAS provided the highest biogas yield of 699.49 mL/g VSfed. The modified Gompertz model predicted the biogas potential from all the experimental results and simulated that the lignocellulosic substrates exhibited high lag time (> 1). The biodegradability index (BD) was lower (< 50%) for all the individual substrates, other than the case of reactor with radish leaves and WAS. Most of the mixed substrate’s combination exhibited BD above 50% and also showed positive synergistic effects of 1.25 to 1.94, most probably due to the positive attributes of co-digestion strategy. With the future prospects available to improve the digestibility of certain substrates, a thermogravimetric analysis was conducted on them. It suggests that the thermal degradation of each substrate varies according to its individual characteristics. Hence, possibilities of strategizing thermal pretreatment for selected substrates could be further evaluated, delivering improved sustainable energy utilization and enhanced biogas production."
Implementation of ambiguous governance instruments in higher education,"The article examines how higher education institutions respond to ambiguous governance instruments. A key focus is how ambiguity is tackled in the interpretation and implementation processes. Building on theoretical perspectives from institutional analysis of organisations, an empirical point of departure is the analysis of ten higher education institutions in Norway and their response on the introduction of development agreements. The findings point out two important dimensions in analysing implementation processes: focusing on the change dynamics and the degree of internal integration. In combination, these point towards distinct patterns in organisational responses to ambiguous policy instruments."
A survey study of chinese teachers’ continuous intentions to teach artificial intelligence,"As the world is increasingly infused with artificial intelligence (AI), school teachers are beginning to acquire AI literacy and to integrate AI-related content into their teaching practices. However, research on teachers’ AI competencies is still in its early stage, leaving many gaps yet to be explored. This study engaged 364 Chinese practicing teachers involved in teaching AI lessons after receiving training, employing a six-factor instrument. The survey assessed teachers’ efficacies in understanding AI and teaching AI, with additional considerations of promoting ethical awareness and designing socially beneficial AI applications. In addition, teachers’ continuous intention to learn AI and their attitudes toward teaching AI were measured. The survey underwent rigorous validation procedures, confirming its construct validity through confirmatory factor analysis, and demonstrating satisfactory reliabilities and convergent and discriminant validities through other statistical analyses. Structural equation modeling provided support for most of the hypotheses. Further, variance analyses indicated that high school teachers scored higher than primary and middle school teachers across all six measured factors, possibly due to the contextual demands of the university entrance examinations. Overall, the findings suggest a willingness among teachers to enhance their competencies for teaching AI, and underscore the need for increased attention on strengthening teachers’ competencies to promote ethical judgement and design AI for social good. The validated survey should be a valid and reliable assessment tool for future teacher development initiatives."
What is the degree of high-quality development of oil–gas resource-based cities in China: based on a new total factor productivity measurement method,"Oil–gas resource-based cities play a huge role in China’s social economy, and the proposal of carbon peak and carbon neutrality has made their demand for high-quality development more urgent. This study first proposes high-quality total factor productivity and constructs the static economic system, ecosystem, and social system–Slacks-Based Measure (ESE-SBM) and dynamic economic system, ecosystem, and social system–global Malmquist–Luenberger (ESE-GML) high-quality total factor productivity measurement models based on the panel data of 18 oil–gas resource-based cities from 2007 to 2018; the high-quality development foundation of oil–gas resource-based cities is divided into good, moderate, and poor according to the static ESE-SBM measurement results; and the high-quality development process is divided into good and poor according to the dynamic ESE-GML decomposition results. The results show that: first, since the concept of high-quality development was proposed in 2017, the high-quality total factor productivity of most oil–gas resource-based cities has improved; second, there is a large difference between high-quality total factor productivity, green total factor productivity, and total factor productivity, Yan’an, Yulin, Karamay, and Qingyang are cities with a good foundation for high-quality development, Songyuan, Daqing, and Panjin are moderate, Nanchong, Ordos, Dongying, Guangan, Dazhou, Puyang, Luzhou, Tangshan, Zibo, and Nanyang are poor; third, the average values of pure efficiency change (0.95) and scale efficiency change (0.97) are less than 1, indicating the efficiency of production activities and development scale decline in the process of high-quality development, and the average values of pure technological progress change (1.01) and technological scale change (1.09) are greater than 1, indicating technology and technological scale effect increase in the process of high-quality development. In addition, they have different impacts on the high-quality development of oil–gas resource-based cities. Songyuan, Yulin, Qingyang, Daqing, Dongying, Dazhou, Karamay, Puyang, Luzhou, and Zibo are identified as cities with better high-quality development process, and Nanchong, Yan’an, Ordos, Guangan, Jiuquan, Panjin, Tangshan, and Nanyang are poor. This study is helpful to explore the degree of high-quality development of different oil–gas resource-based cities and changes sources of high-quality total factor productivity."
How does digital finance affect energy consumption in China? Empirical evidence from China,"The integration of energy finance is an emerging trend in international financial development, which is an inevitable product of the integration of energy and economy. Exploring the relationship between digital finance (DF) and energy consumption is of particular significance for achieving sustainable development of the energy economy. This paper uses a fixed-effects model to analyze Chinese provincial panel data from 2011 to 2020 to explore the ways in which DF affects energy consumption. The analysis shows an inverted U-shaped relationship between DF and energy consumption. Different aspects of DF have varying effects on energy consumption. There is regional diversity in the influence of DF on energy. Economic growth plays a crucial intermediary role in the impact of DF on energy usage. Our research supports the implementation of government policies aimed at advancing DF for environmental conservation purposes."

The role of HCN channels on the effects of T-type calcium channels and GABAA receptors in the absence epilepsy model of WAG/Rij rats,"In this study we used ivabradine (IVA), a hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated (HCN) channel blocker, to identify its effect on spike-wave discharges (SWDs); and aimed to determine the role of IVA on the effects of T-type calcium channel blocker NNC 55-0396, GABAA receptor agonist muscimol and antagonist bicuculline in male WAG/Rij rats. After tripolar electrodes for electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings were placed on the WAG/Rij rats' skulls, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg IVA were intraperitoneally administered for 7 consecutive days and ECoG recordings were obtained on days 0th, 3rd, 6th, and 7th for three hours before and after injections. While acute injection of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg IVA did not affect the total number and the mean duration of SWDs, subacute administration (7 days) of IVA decreased the SWDs parameters 24 hours after the 7th injection. Interestingly, when IVA was administered again 24 hours after the 6th IVA injection, it increased the SWDs parameters. Western-blot analyses showed that HCN1 and HCN2 expressions decreased and HCN4 increased in the 5-month-old WAG/Rij rats compared to the 1-month-old WAG/Rij and 5-month-old native Wistar rats, while subacute IVA administration increased the levels of HCN1 and HCN2 channels, except HCN4. Subacute administration of IVA reduced the antiepileptic activity of NNC, while the proepileptic activity of muscimol and the antiepileptic activity of bicuculline were abolished. It might be suggested that subacute IVA administration reduces absence seizures by changing the HCN channel expressions in WAG/Rij rats, and this affects the T-type calcium channels and GABAA receptors."
Technology structure of China’s export of agricultural products: empirical analysis based on technical complexity,"Growing labour costs, increasing resources and environmental constraints and a desire to emphasize high-quality trade have promoted China to prioritize upgrading the agricultural export structure. This brings forth a need for further research on agricultural export technology. We measure the technical complexity and height based on the sample of 178 countries over the 2002–2020 period. The results are then compared with those of the world’s major exporters of agricultural products (APs). We find that China’s APs export exhibited a pattern of medium-technology products and slowly transitioned towards medium–high and high technology levels. The technology structure of China’s APs export was significantly lower than that of the major global AP exporters (except Brazil). The overall technical level of China’s APs exports slightly fluctuated near the medium technology grade. The evolutionary trend of the technology structure of China’s APs export differs from its export scale, showing a tendency towards a more downmarket in 2002–2012 but some improvement since 2013. There is a widening gap in the technology structure of APs export between China and major developed exporters. China’s APs export is losing competitiveness overall, and the upgrading of the technology structure of China’s APs export was slower. Therefore, the technology structure of China’s APs export can be escalated by raising standards of quality, concentrating on the export of higher technical complexity products, promoting the advances and innovations in agricultural science and technology, and further exploring the trade potential hidden behind the differences between China and other countries in export technology structure."
Stability properties of nontrivial periodic water waves for fixed-depth rotational equatorial flows,"We investigate the local stability for fixed-depth rotational equatorial flows. We first obtain the precise formula of the second derivative of bifurcation parameters at the bifurcation point. In particular, their signs can be assessed when vorticity is small enough and the mean depth is small or large enough. Furthermore, we study the stability property for periodic traveling waves of the thermocline near the equator with a fixed mean depth. For this aim, we obtain a new stability exchange formula which improves the famous Crandall-Rabinowitz stability exchange theorem."
An Egalitarian Perspective on Information Sharing: The Example of Health Care Priorities,"In health care, the provision of pertinent information to patients is not just a moral imperative but also a legal obligation, often articulated through the lens of obtaining informed consent. Codes of medical ethics and many national laws mandate the disclosure of basic information about diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment alternatives. However, within publicly funded health care systems, other kinds of information might also be important to patients, such as insights into the health care priorities that underlie treatment offers made. While conventional perspectives do not take this as an obligatory part of the information to be shared with patients, perhaps through viewing it as clinically “non-actionable,” we advocate for a paradigm shift. Our proposition diverges from the traditional emphasis on actionability. We contend that honoring patients as equal moral agents necessitates, among other principles, a commitment to honesty. Withholding specific categories of information pertinent to patients’ comprehension of their situation is inherently incompatible with this principle. In this article, we advocate for a recalibration of the burden of proof. Rather than requiring special justifications for adding to the standard set of information items, we suggest that physicians should be able to justify excluding relevant facts about the patient’s situation and the underlying considerations shaping health care professionals’ choices. This perspective prioritizes transparency and empowers patients with a comprehensive understanding, aligning with the ethos of respect for the patient as person."
Peristaltic Flow of Ethylene Glycol and Water Mixture-Based Hybrid Nanofluid in an Asymmetric Channel,"This novel study examines the peristaltic magnetohydrodynamic hybrid nanofluid flow comprising the single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes and an ethylene glycol–water mixture in an asymmetric channel in a permeable medium. The Xue model is considered for the thermal conductivity of carbon nanotubes. The heat transmission is evaluated in the presence of viscous dissipation and Joule heating. Moreover, at both walls of the channel, velocity and thermal slip conditions are assumed. The mathematical formulation is accomplished by employing a long wavelength and a low Reynolds number. We here will look into the impact of the varied parameters on associated profiles while considering the Xue model with binary mixture base fluid. The system of equations is solved using the built-in DSolve function in Mathematica to obtain its solution. The effect of pertinent flow parameters in the peristaltic flow phenomenon is graphically plotted and analyzed. Observations revealed that for the low magnetic parameter, the hybrid nanofluid flow would experience less pressure gradient load and for the high magnetic parameter hybrid nanofluid flow would experience more pressure. In addition, owing to higher estimations of the slip parameter, the velocity profile diminishes; however, an opposite outcome is witnessed for the porosity parameter."
Investigating the Impact of Cumulative Pressure-Induced Stress on Machine Learning Models for Pipe Breaks,"Significant financial resources are needed for the maintenance and rehabilitation of water supply networks (WSNs) to prevent pipe breaks. The causes and mechanisms for pipe breaks vary between different WSNs. However, it is commonly acknowledged that the operational management and water pressure influence significantly the frequency of pipe breaks. Pipe breaks occur when the water pressure exceeds the tensile strength of a pipe, or due to repetitive pressure cycles that result in fatigue-related failures. Considering these pipe failure modes, a new metric known as cumulative pressure-induced stress has been introduced. This metric takes into account both static and dynamic pressure components that contribute to pipe breaks, including mean pressure and the magnitude and frequency of pressure fluctuations, respectively. The impact of CPIS on pipe breaks has not been extensively investigated. Consequently, this study investigates and evaluates the impact of this metric when incorporated as an explanatory variable in Random Forest (RF) models that analyse the key causes of pipe breaks in two WSNs. Different RF models were developed both with and without incorporating pressure components. Subsequently, the performance of these models and the significance of each input variable were assessed. The results of this study suggest that CPIS is an important variable, especially in cases where pressure-related factors play a significant role in pipe breaks. Consequently, incorporating CPIS has shown a notable improvement in the accuracy of pipe break models."
Cleansing Investor’s Conscience: The Effects of Incidental Guilt on Socially Responsible Investment Decisions,"This paper explores the effects of incidental guilt on Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) decisions of retail investors. Do investors who feel guilty invest more in SRIs to clear their conscience? Are guilty investors willing to sacrifice returns to restore their moral selves? Using survey data from an online quasi-experiment among a sample of US retail investors, we find that individuals who experience incidental guilt are willing to invest more in SRI funds than those in a neutral state. We show that this effect, albeit moderate in magnitude, cannot be explained solely by differences in retail investors’ moral reasoning, attitudes towards social responsibility, risk tolerance and demographic factors. When presented with a trade-off between sustainability, risk and return characteristics of the funds, guilty investors are more willing to sacrifice returns for greater sustainability than non-guilty participants. Our research provides new evidence of the effect that incidental guilt has on the sustainable investing decisions of retail investors."
Long-term entecavir therapy of chronic hepatitis B in real-life setting—Importance of quantitative HBsAg level,The global burden of chronic hepatitis B remains high and the best possible treatment remains long-term viral suppression expecting cure.
Degradation of Rice Straw in the Presence of ZnO Nanoparticles and Cellulase Production with the Help of Streptomycetes Species,"This study aims to determine how ZnO nanoparticles affect rice straw during solid-state fermentation and cellulase production. The zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles of concentration 1 mg/gm was supplemented in a solid-state fermentation medium with the isolated actinobacterial species Streptomycetes calvus for cellulase production. It was also noticed that the addition of the nanoparticles catalyzed the biodegradation of rice straw complex structure and facilitates cellulase production. So, higher cellulase activities were observed in the enzymes produced in the presence of the ZnO, i.e., 0.38 IU/ml, followed by 0.27 IU/ml in control (without nanoparticles). Further, XRD, SEM and FTIR clearly showed the degradation of lignocellulose and morphological changes in rice straw structure during fermentation. Additionally, higher FPases activities and saccharification percentage indicated that nanoparticle-mediated cellulases would be a better option for further applications."
A novel micronutrients and methyl jasmonate cocktail of elicitors via seed priming improves drought tolerance by mitigating oxidative stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.),"Drought is a major limiting factor for rice (Oryza sativa L.) production globally, and a cost-effective seed priming technique using bio-elicitors has been found to have stress mitigating effects. Till date, mostly phytohormones have been preferred as bio-elicitors, but the present study is a novel attempt to demonstrate the favorable role of micronutrients-phytohormone cocktail, i.e., iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and methyl jasmonate (MJ) via seed priming method in mitigating the deleterious impacts of drought stress through physio-biochemical and molecular manifestations. The effect of cocktail/priming was studied on the relative water content, chlorophyll a/b and carotenoid contents, proline content, abscisic acid (ABA) content, and on the activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), NADPH oxidase (Nox), and catalase (CAT). The expressions of drought-responsive genes OsZn-SOD, OsFe-SOD, and Nox1 were found to be modulated under drought stress in contrasting rice genotypes -N-22 (Nagina-22, drought-tolerant) and PS-5 (Pusa Sugandh-5, drought-sensitive). A progressive rise in carotenoids (10–19%), ABA (18–50%), proline (60–80%), activities of SOD (27–62%), APX (46–61%), CAT (50–80%), Nox (16–30%), and upregulated (0.9–1.6-fold) expressions of OsZn-SOD, OsFe-SOD, and Nox1 genes were found in the primed plants under drought condition. This cocktail would serve as a potential supplement in modern agricultural practices utilizing seed priming technique to mitigate drought stress-induced oxidative burst in food crops."
"Body mass index, height, and osteoporotic fracture risk in community-dwelling Japanese people aged 40–74 years",The association between body size and fracture risk is complex and varies by sex and ethnicity. This study aimed to examine associations of body mass index (BMI) and height with osteoporotic fracture risk in middle-aged and older people.
Bioengineered Ag/NiO nanocomposites as advanced battery-supercapacitor electrodes for highly efficient symmetric hybrid devices,"In the present work, Ag/NiO nanocomposite was synthesized through the sol–gel process using Withania somnifera leaf extract (WSLE). UV–Vis absorption from ~ 250 to 500 nm confirms the formation of Ag/NiO nanocomposite. Spherical morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy, and its elemental compositions were identified by energy dispersive absorption spectroscopy. The composite nature of Ag/NiO was confirmed through powder X-ray diffraction analysis. Density profiles of mid-bond electrons and bond length were also analysed with the help of Rietveld refinement method. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy addressed the alkaloids as the main responsible biocompounds in the leaf extract of WSLE. The good thermal stability and superparamagnetic properties of the sample have been studied by TGA/DTA and VSM analysis. The supercapacitor Ag/NiO electrode reveals the specified capacitance of 262 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s, and about 90.34% of retention was maintained after 5000 cycles. The battery-supercapacitor capacitive contribution of the electrode was estimated through the Transatti method. Battery type dominance kinetics on/from the surface of Ag/NiO electrode was analysed. Furthermore, admirable electrochemical properties of Ag/NiO have been observed in the symmetric hybrid device with a maximum energy density of 26 Wh/Kg and power density of 1580 W/Kg, demonstrating that bioengineered Ag/NiO electrodes are suitable for electrochemical energy storage applications. Intermolecular interactions are confirmed by the formation of critical points of electron density (3, -1) of the obtained complex."
"Characterization of Priestia megaterium S1, a polymer degrading gut microbe isolated from the gut of Tenebrio molitor larvae fed on Styrofoam","This study reveals that Tenebrio molitor larvae are fed with two different feeds i.e., barley bran along with Styrofoam, and barley bran without Styrofoam, the survival percentage of mealworms shows 86 and 89%, respectively. Five isolates namely S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5 were isolated from the gut of Styrofoam-feeding Tenebrio molitor larvae and tested for Hydrophobicity percentage, clear zone assay and turbidity measurement. S1 isolate showed best (turbidity percentage of 19.65%, 13.54% hydrophobicity percentage, and 37% zone of clearance) when compared to other isolates, respectively. 16S rRNA characterization of S1 isolate revealed that the isolate belongs to Priestia megaterium S1(ON024787). Biodegradation of PE and PS beads by Priestia megaterium S1 makes physical and structural changes over 180 days, after microbial adhesion to the beads. Growth parameters have shown that the Priestia megaterium S1 thrives more effectively in the pH (6.5), temperature (28 °C) and at 1.5% LDPE/HDPE/PS concentration there is maximum utilization of carbon and a high percentage survival rate. Significant colonization of the isolate after 30 days over beads of LDPE (52.47%), HDPE (49.26%), and PS (48.11%), respectively. Experimental data revealed that Priestia megaterium S1 have PE and PS beads degradation capacity, proven by weight loss studies, at 6th-month percentage weight loss of LDPE (36.1%), HDPE (31.9%), and PS (28.6%), the percentage loss of carbon and hydrogen shows higher when compared to control. One month Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) showed that LDPE (7.4 mg/l), HDPE (7.2 mg/l), PS (6.7 mg/l), and simultaneous studies on CO2 evolution over LDPE treatment is 5.05 g/l, HDPE (4.26 g/l), and PS (3.91 g/l), respectively. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) prove the occurrence of biodegradation on the surface of beads. This work highlights that Priestia megaterium S1 plays a vital role in effectively degrading PE and PS beads."
Evaluation of the Versatility of a Traffic Anomaly Detection Method during Heavy Rainfall,"During heavy rains, traffic monitoring is limited, as the affected areas are monitored by reporting and patrolling. In this study, a method for detecting traffic anomalies during heavy rainfall events was established, and a model that uses probe vehicle data to detect traffic anomalies during a disaster (an event in which vehicles make U-turns in front of a damaged area) was proposed. In addition, a parameter calibration method was developed for the model using past disaster-related data. The generalizability of the calibrated model was evaluated by applying it to other disasters. According to the results, the proposed model exhibited good generalizability."
Effect of comprehensive rehabilitation on apnea hypopnea index in patients with obstructive sleep apnea: a protocol for randomized controlled trial,The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of comprehensive rehabilitation on apnea hypopnea index (AHI) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
Beauveria bassiana transcriptomics reveal virulence-associated shifts during insect lipid assimilation,"Insect cuticular lipids, especially epicuticular hydrocarbons (CHC), have a significant role in insect ecology and interactions with other organisms, including fungi. The CHC composition of a specific insect species may influence the outcome of the interaction with a specific fungal strain. Some insects, such as Piezodorus guildinii, have low susceptibility towards fungal infections seemingly due to their CHC composition. The entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana can assimilate CHC and incorporate them as building blocks via cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs). However, little is known about other enzymes that promote the degradation/assimilation of these cuticular components. In this study, we performed a transcriptomic analysis to evaluate the in vitro response of two virulence-contrasting B. bassiana strains when grown on three different P. guildinii CHC sources. We found a different expression profile of virulence-related genes, as well as different GO and KEGG parameters enriched at 4 days post-inoculation, which could help account for the intrinsic virulence and for an alkane-priming virulence enhancement effect. The hypovirulent strain predominantly showed higher expression of cuticle penetration genes, including chitinases, proteases, and CYPs, with GO term categories of “heme binding,” “monooxygenase activity,” and “peroxisome” pathways enriched. The hypervirulent strain showed higher expression of cell wall remodeling and cell cycle genes, and cuticle adhesion and a distinct set of CYPs, with GO categories of “DNA-binding transcription factor activity” and KEGG pathways corresponding to “meiosis-yeast” and “cell cycle” enriched. These results suggest a delay and alternate routes in pathogenicity-related metabolism in the hypovirulent strain in comparison with the hypervirulent strain."
Phage cocktail alleviated type 2 diabetes by reshaping gut microbiota and decreasing proinflammatory cytokines,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D), a global health concern, is closely associated with the gut microbiota. Restoration of a balanced microbiota and intestinal homeostasis benefit therapy of T2D. Some special phages may selectively alter the gut microbiota without causing dysbiosis, such as MS2 and P22. However, scarcely systematic analysis of cascading effects triggered by MS2 and P22 phages on the microbiota, as well as interactions between specific gut bacteria and systemic metabolism, seriously inhibit the development of positive interventions of phages. Based on multi-omic analysis, we analyzed the intrinsic correlations among specific microbiota, their bioactive metabolites, and key indicators of T2D. We found that gavage of the MS2-P22 phage cocktail could significantly alter the gut microbiome to attenuate dysbiosis of diabetic C57BL/6 mice caused by high-fat diets (HFDs) and streptozotocin (STZ), by affecting microbial compositions as well as their metabolic pathways and metabolites, especially increasing amounts of short-chain fatty acid-producing (SCFA-producing) bacteria (e.g., Blautia and Romboutsia) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Correspondingly, a noteworthy reduction in the number of several opportunistic pathogens occurred, e.g., Candidatus Saccharimonas, Aerococcus, Oscillibacter, Desulfovibrio, and Clostridium sensu stricto 1. Synchronously, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were reduced to recover gut barrier function in T2D mice. These findings might benefit the development of a new dietary intervention for T2D based on phage cocktails."
Evaluation of safe areas for miniscrew use according to various skeletal anomalies with CBCT,We aimed to determine safe areas to apply miniscrews in the interradicular region of the maxilla and mandible in individuals with various sagittal skeletal malocclusions.
Investigating the potential clinical impact of periodontitis on the progression of Alzheimer’s disease: a prospective cohort study,This study aimed to investigate the effect of periodontitis and current occlusal relationship on the progression rate of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Phosphate solubilization and plant growth properties are promoted by a lactic acid bacterium in calcareous soil,"On the basis of good phosphate solubilization ability of a lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strain Limosilactobacillus sp. LF-17, bacterial agent was prepared and applied to calcareous soil to solubilize phosphate and promote the growth of maize seedlings in this study. A pot experiment showed that the plant growth indicators, phosphorus content, and related enzyme activity of the maize rhizospheric soils in the LF treatment (treated with LAB) were the highest compared with those of the JP treatment (treated with phosphate solubilizing bacteria, PSB) and the blank control (CK). The types of organic acids in maize rhizospheric soil were determined through LC-MS, and 12 acids were detected in all the treatments. The abundant microbes belonged to the genera of Lysobacter, Massilia, Methylbacillus, Brevundimonas, and Limosilactobacillus, and they were beneficial to dissolving phosphate or secreting growth-promoting phytohormones, which were obviously higher in the LF and JP treatments than in CK as analyzed by high-throughput metagenomic sequencing methods. In addition, the abundance values of several enzymes, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthology, and Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZys), which were related to substrate assimilation and metabolism, were the highest in the LF treatment. Therefore, aside from phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms, LAB can be used as environmentally friendly crop growth promoters in agriculture and provide another viable option for microbial fertilizers."
Gray matter asymmetry alterations in children and adolescents with comorbid autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,"Despite the high coexistence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (ASD + ADHD), the underlying neurobiological basis of this disorder remains unclear. Altered brain structural asymmetries have been verified in ASD and ADHD, respectively, making brain asymmetry a candidate for characterizing this coexisting disorder. Here, we measured the gray matter (GM) volume asymmetry in ASD + ADHD versus ASD without ADHD (ASD-only), ADHD without ASD (ADHD-only), and typically developing controls (TDc). High-resolution T1-weighted data from 48 ASD + ADHD, 63 ASD-only, 32 ADHD-only, and 211 matched TDc were included in our study. We also assessed brain-behavior relationships and the effects of age on GM asymmetry. We found that there were both shared and disorder-specific GM volume asymmetry alterations in ASD + ADHD, ASD-only, and ADHD-only compared with TDc. This finding demonstrates that ASD + ADHD is neither an endophenocopy nor an additive pathology of ASD and ADHD, but an entirely different neuroanatomical pathology. In addition, ASD + ADHD displayed altered GM volume asymmetries in the prefrontal regions responsible for executive function and theory of mind compared with ASD-only. We also found significant effects of age on GM asymmetry. The present study may provide structural insights into the neural basis of ASD + ADHD."
Effects of sagittal split Ramus osteotomy on condylar position and Ramal orientation in patients with mandibular asymmetry,The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of Sagittal Split Ramus Osteotomy (SSRO) on the alignment of the condyle and orientation of the Ramal segment following surgery in patients operated for the correction of mandibular asymmetry.
"Quantification of hydrogen bond energy based on equations using spectroscopic, structural, QTAIM-based, and NBO-based descriptors which calibrated by the molecular tailoring approach","Hydrogen bonds critically influence the structure and properties of both organic molecules and biomolecules, as well as supramolecular assemblies. For this reason, the development and elaboration of methods for quantitative assessment of hydrogen bond energy is an urgent challenge. In this study, using a large series of hydroxycarbonyl aliphatic compounds with the O‒H···O = C intramolecular hydrogen bond, a bank of hydrogen bond descriptors was created, including spectroscopic, structural, QTAIM-based, and NBO-based parameters. It was shown that the O‒H vibration frequency, OH chemical shift as the spectroscopic descriptors, the O···H hydrogen bond length, O···O distance, and O‒H covalent bond length as the structural descriptors, the electron density and its Laplacian, electron potential energy density in the hydrogen bond critical point, the electron density at the ring critical point as the QTAIM-based descriptors change in a correlated manner. The same correlation is found in change of the charge transfer energy through a hydrogen bond, the occupancy of the O‒H bond antibonding orbital, the Wiberg indices of the O···H hydrogen bond, and the O‒H covalent bond, as well as the polarization of the O‒H bond, which are the NBO-based descriptors. It was also recognized that the specified descriptors from the spectroscopic, structural, QTAIM-based, and NBO-based categories are functionally related to the values of intramolecular hydrogen bond energy, quantified via the molecular tailoring approach. This allowed one to obtain a system of equations for quantitative estimation of intramolecular hydrogen bond energy based on the spectroscopic, structural, QTAIM, and NBO descriptors, which makes such quantification more dependable and reliable."
Augmented versus non-augmented Trochanteric Fixation Nail-Advanced (TFNA) nails for treating trochanteric fractures in patients over sixty-five years of age,"Intramedullary nailing is a common treatment for pertrochanteric fractures. However, implant-related mechanical failures, such as cut-out and cut-through, lead to higher rates of revision surgery, loss of autonomy, and mortality. Cemented augmentation enhances the bone-implant interface. This study compared the frequency of mechanical failures between augmented and non-augmented Trochanteric Fixation Nail-Advanced (TFNA) nails."
"Danish third, sixth and eighth grade students’ strategy adaptivity, strategy flexibility and accuracy when solving multidigit arithmetic tasks","In this paper, the multidigit arithmetic-related strategy adaptivity, strategy flexibility and solution accuracy of Danish compulsory school students is examined. Participants, 749 grade three, 731 grade six and 818 grade eight, were drawn from twenty demographically different schools. Drawing on a tri-phase assessment tool, each student completed a series of tasks designed to elicit shortcut strategies. First, students solved each task by means of their preferred strategy; those using shortcut strategies were construed as adaptive for that task. Second, students solved the same tasks by means of whatever alternative strategies they had available; those offering at least two strategies were construed as flexible for that task. Third, for each task, students were asked to indicate which of their strategies they believed was optimal. Across all grades, students were more flexible than adaptive. Overall, sixth graders exhibited higher levels of flexibility than third graders and marginally lower levels than eighth graders. Sixth graders exhibited higher levels of adaptivity than those in either grade three or grade eight. Students’ accuracy, which improved with maturation, was influenced positively by both adaptivity and flexibility, with flexibility having the greatest influence in grade three and adaptivity in grade six. The findings raise further questions concerning, inter alia, culture’s influence on students’ strategy choices and the interaction of adaptivity, flexibility and maturity on accuracy."
Effectiveness of permissive weight bearing in surgically treated trauma patients with peri- and intra-articular fractures of the lower extremities: a prospective comparative multicenter cohort study,The aim of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of a novel approach involving permissive weight bearing (PWB) in surgically treated trauma patients with peri- and intra-articular fractures of the lower extremities.
Superhydrophobic treatment of PDMS-based microfluidic devices using CO2 laser ablation,"This study proposed a two-step simple method for rapid superhydrophobic surface modification of PDMS for PDMS-based microfluidics. A laser-patterned PMMA plate was used as the mask for the following selective CO2 laser surface treatment on PDMS. The water contact angle, SEM and ATR-FTIR analysis were conducted for the characterization of the proposed superhydrophobic surface modification method for PDMS. The result shows that the water contact angle on the modified PDMS surface reaches around 160° with the laser power of 12 W and with a scanning speed of 60 mm/s. This method aims to develop a faster, easier, and low-cost method for selective superhydrophobic modification method for PDMS-based microfluidic devices. The proposed method could have wide applications potentials in the microfluidics field, especially for PDMS-based droplet microfluidics."
Tensile and Shear Creep Behavior of Structural Adhesives: Experiments and Modeling,"Structural adhesives characterized a turning point in the post-connection of structural elements due to their excellent performances and ability to transfer stress without losing their integrity. These materials are typically particle-reinforced composites made by a thermoset polymer matrix and fillers. During the in-situ application of this material, the thermal activation of the polymer is typically not possible, leading to an undefined degree of cure and therefore to a variation of the mechanical performance over time. This altering means that after applying a sustained load on a bonded anchor system installed at regular temperature, the adhesive changes material properties. Ample studies convince that the progressive increase of the degree of cure of the thermosetting polymer leads to higher strength and stiffness. However, limited studies have been dedicated to the post-curing effects on the long-term behavior. The main goal of this work is to investigate the tensile and shear creep behavior of two commercially available structural adhesives and the influence of curing conditions on their long-term performances. An extensive experimental campaign comprising short and long-term characterizations has been carried out on specimens subjected to three different curing and post-curing protocols, with the scope of imitating relevant in-situ conditions. The results demonstrate that structural adhesives cured at higher temperatures are less subjected to creep deformations. As a material equation, the generalized Kelvin model is utilized to fit the tensile and shear creep data, and two continuous creep spectra have been selected to represent the creep behavior and facilitate extrapolations to the long-term behavior."
Power reduction using Unified techniques in Switch-tail Ring counter for sequential circuits,"The diminution of power dissipation has recently become a paramount concern in contemporary VLSI design. Owing to the shrinking chip size and the gradual development of several micro-electronic reliabilities, low-power (LP) system design has become the utmost priority. Hence, this paper proposes an effective power reduction method that combines clock gating (CG) and a multi-bit flip flop (MBFF) approach. Initially, the CG and MBFF schemes were implemented separately in two standard Johnson counters, one involving a true single-phase clock (TSPC) LP D flip flop (DFF) with five transistors and the other involving a standard DFF with 32 transistors. Furthermore, a combined CG-MBFF scheme is proposed and implemented in 4-bit and 16-bit Johnson counters to illustrate the superiority of the proposed CG-MBFF scheme in terms of power diminution over the CG and MBFF methods when implemented separately. Additionally, an LP application employing a 4-bit Johnson counter was implemented with and without the proposed scheme."
RAMP experiments in solving the uncapacitated facility location problem,"In this paper, we consider three Relaxation Adaptive Memory Programming (RAMP) approaches for solving the Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem (UFLP), whose objective is to locate a set of facilities and allocate these facilities to all clients at minimum cost. Different levels of sophistication were implemented to measure the performance of the RAMP approach. In the simpler level, (Dual-) RAMP explores more intensively the dual side of the problem, incorporating a Lagrangean Relaxation and Subgradient Optimization with a simple Improvement Method on the primal side. In the most sophisticated level, RAMP combines a Dual-Ascent procedure on the dual side with a Scatter Search (SS) procedure on primal side, forming the Primal–Dual RAMP (PD-RAMP). The Dual-RAMP algorithm starts with (dual side) the dualization of the initial problem, and then a projection method projects the dual solutions into the primal solutions space. Next, (primal side) the projected solutions are improved through an improvement method. In the PD-RAMP algorithm, the SS procedure is incorporated in the primal side to carry out a more intensive exploration. The algorithm alternates between the dual and the primal side until a fixed number of iterations is achieved. Computational experiments on a standard testbed for the UFLP were conducted to assess the performance of all the RAMP algorithms."
Narratives of reduction and change among patients of an internet-delivered therapy for gambling harm,"Shame and fear of stigma represent barriers which prevent many gamblers from seeking help. To overcome some of these obstacles, new types of professional help have emerged, based on use of telephone and information technology. The aim of this study was to offer an overview of the characteristics of high-risk gamblers who entered an internet-delivered therapy program, and provides a typology of such patients through their narratives of gambling reduction and change."
Evaluation of the effect of high-intensity light-curing device on micro-leakage of pits and fissure sealants,"Reducing treatment time is one of the most important trends in modern dentistry. This study aimed to compare the micro-leakage around the resin sealants when using both high and conventional intensity light-curing systems. The study sample consisted of 30 extracted human maxillary premolar teeth that were divided into two equal groups according to the light-curing system used: Group 1, High-Intensity Light-Curing System and Group 2, Conventional Light-Curing System. Light-curing by Woodpecker I-LED device with two intensities (high and conventional) has been used. All teeth were subjected to 500 cycles of thermocycling. Then, a methylene blue dye microleakage test was performed, and the teeth were sectioned longitudinally and studied under a stereo microscope. The mean of micro-leakage in the high-intensity group (1.33 ± 1.29) was less than in the conventional intensity group (1.63 ± 1.29) without any statistically significant differences (p = 0.320). The high-intensity light-curing system mode may be a good and acceptable alternative to conventional intensity light-curing system mode in polymerization of pits and fissure sealants."
Transformation of corn cob waste into mesoporous carbon by template-free method and construction of TiO2-mesoporous carbon nanocomposite for MO dye degradation,"In this investigation, transformation of agricultural corn cob waste into mesoporous carbon nanoparticles (MCNPS) by template-free method. This synthesized MCNPs are used for the construction of Titanium dioxide-Mesoporous carbon (TMC) nanocomposites by precipitation and calcination method. Synthesized samples were confirmed by various characterization techniques. The photocatalytic behavior of the TMC nanocomposites was checked by the degradation of Methyl Orange (MO) in the presence of UV light. The optimized TMC21 composite shows 92% degradation efficiency towards MO dye within 80 min under UV light than the bare TiO2 and also shows excellent stability and recyclability after five runs. The histo-toxicological studies are done by using freshwater Lobeo Rohita fish organs such as kidney and ovary. The results show that MO dye-containing solution damages the internal structure of kidney and ovary tissues whereas the photo-degraded product of MO dye exhibited no variations in their typical structure similar to the control group indicating that the MO-degraded solution is non-toxic."
The Description of Neoechinorhynchus miniovalis n. sp. (Acanthocephala: Neoechinorhynchidae) from the Mudskipper Boleophthalmus dussumieri Valenciennes (Gobiiformes: Oxudercidae) in Shatt Al-Basrah Canal Southern Iraq,"The aim of this article is to describe a new and unusual species of Neoechinoprhynchus Stiles & Hassall, 1905 from the Arabian Gulf coast off Iraq."
Harnessing the potential of chestnut shell extract to enhance fresh cheese: a sustainable approach for nutritional enrichment and shelf-life extension,"A novel approach for enhancing the nutritional benefits and shelf-life of fresh cheese, while reducing food industry waste, is adding chestnut shell extract to the cheese. Chestnut shells are a great source of bioactive substances including phenolic compounds, with anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant activities. The chestnut shell extract exhibited interesting antioxidant properties, resulting from the presence of catechin and gallic acid, 2.59 and 0.97 mgcompound∙gsample−1, respectively, in its composition. The incorporation of the phenolic extract did not influence the pH value of the cheese, with values within the range of 6.2–6.5. Additionally, the extract decreased the syneresis which is important in terms of stability. Regarding the antioxidant characteristics, incorporating the extract improved this biological property. The results proved that an increase in the extract concentration allows the inhibition of higher percentages of this radical. Cheese with extract exhibited higher acceptance, but visual components need improvement. Hence, incorporating chestnut shell extract into fresh cheese is a promising approach to adding value to dairy products and promoting sustainable food production. This study can be considered innovative and relevant because it allows the utilisation of agro-industrial by-products to increase the shelf life of fresh cheese, an extremely relevant parameter for the producer, promoting the circular economy."
Characterization and in vitro cytotoxicity of piperine-loaded nanoemulsion in breast cancer cells,"Piperine is an alkaloid of natural origin with potent anti-cancer activity. However, due to its physicochemical characteristics, piperine's biological performance is limited, with low bioavailability resulting from high lipophilicity and low water solubility. To improve its cytotoxic activity in 4T1 and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines, we developed and characterized piperine-loaded nanoemulsions (Pip-NE). The nanoemulsions were obtained by spontaneous emulsification followed by sonication and were characterized regarding their size by dynamic light scattering techniques and their zeta potential by electrophoretic mobility. Pip-NE showed an average hydrodynamic diameter of 102 nm, polydispersity index of 0.2, and zeta potential of − 31.8 mV. Compared to piperine in solution, Pip-NE showed sustained in-vitro release, preserving the cytotoxic activity of piperine. The formulations presented no irritancy potential in the Hen’s Egg Test on Chorioallantoic Membrane assay. Additionally, the nanoemulsification increased the piperine cytotoxicity against both breast cancer cell lines, as evidenced by the IC50 values. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the potential of drug delivery nanosystems as a novel strategy to optimize the delivery and enhance the cytotoxic properties of lipophilic drugs such as piperine in breast cancer cell lines."
Characterization and chemometric based optimization of bioactive metabolites in Hypoxis hemerocallidea with the aid of UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS,"β-sitosterol and solasodine are major bioactive ingredients in Hypoxis hemerocallidea (H. hemerocallidea) with significant pharmacological properties. As a result, developing a simple and efficient extraction method for simultaneous extraction of both analytes is critical. The purpose of this study was to identify and separate β-sitosterol and solasodine from ethanolic extracts of H. hemerocallidea using a modified QuEChERS method and subsequent analysis via UPLC triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Response surface methodology was carried out, which included numerical parameters such as ultrasonication time, centrifugation time, and ultrasonication power. The categorical factors included the type of salt used to facilitate extraction, which was (NH4)2SO4 and Na2SO4. Fitting the response surface model to the experimental data produced a quadratic model with a good fit (R2 = 0.9966 for solasodine and R2 = 0.9857 for β-sitosterol). The optimum conditions for extraction of β-sitosterol and solasodine were an ultrasonication time of 30 min, ultrasonication power of 300 W and centrifugation time of 12 min. The generally higher concentrations of analytes obtained for (NH4)2SO4 indicated that it had a superior salting-out ability compared to Na2SO4. In conclusion, for the first time, β-sitosterol and solasodine were simultaneously extracted using modified QuEChERS with good yields through the salting-out action of (NH4)2SO4 in the presence of environmentally friendly solvents, ethanol and water. This modified QuEChERS technique can potentially be applied on a large scale as a sustainable and quick method for enrichment of therapeutic compounds from natural products."
“Turn ON–OFF” detection of lead using Moringa oleifera gum-derived cyan-emissive carbon dots integrated with a smartphone-assisted sensing platform,"Lead poisoning is one of the most common and preventable environmental health problems. Prevention is directly correlated with detection and quantification. This report provides a green, facile and economical approach to synthesizing carbon dots (CDs) from Moringa oleifera gum (MOG) which can quantify the lead in environmentally desecrated samples like water, e-waste leachate using a smart phone for the first time. The synthesized MOG-CDs are functional group-rich and are naturally doped with calcium and sulfur, which enhances their photoluminescence. The intrinsic nature of MOG-CDs displayed a photoluminescence “Turn ON–OFF” mechanism even in trace amounts of Pb2+ ions. MOG-CDs selectively and sensitively detect Pb2+, with a detection limit (LOD) of 0.41 ppb (1.08 nM). The photoluminescent probe quantified Pb2+ in actual water and electronic waste samples. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of < 7% makes its performance highly reproducible. The probe has high sensitivity, selectivity, repeatability, stability, and applicability. Furthermore, the Pb2+-induced photoluminescence quenching recognition using a smartphone-based portable sensing platform showed excellent linearity (R2 = 0.9961) within the range of 0–100 ppb, with satisfactory sensitivity (LOD = 4.41 ppb (11.62 nM)). The demonstrated photoluminescent sensing probe offers palatable results, extending its potential applications in resource-constrained areas."
The Utility of the Unified Protocol in Treating Borderline Features,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by maladaptive levels of neuroticism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. The Unified Protocol (UP), a treatment for neuroticism, has previously demonstrated promising effects when applied to BPD; however, not all individuals with BPD respond, suggesting the UP may be incomplete for some BPD presentations. This secondary analysis explored the extent to which adapted versions of UP represent an efficacious treatment approach for BPD symptoms. Data from a subset of twelve participants with clinically-significant BPD features were included. We explored within-group changes in BPD symptoms and differences in within-person changes in BPD scores based on patients’ personality profiles. The UP resulted in improvements in BPD symptoms that were moderate in magnitude, Hedges’s g = 0.48, 95% CI [0.35, 0.62]. Individuals with personality profiles characterized by high neuroticism and low conscientiousness exhibited early gains in the UP but did not sustain them, whereas those with at least moderate levels of conscientiousness generally continued to improve across 12 weeks. Possible explanations and limitations were discussed."
High-yield production of porous carbon spheres derived from enzymatic hydrolysis lignin for zinc ion hybrid capacitors,"The widespread implementation of supercapacitors is hindered by the limited energy density and the pricey porous carbon electrode materials. The cost of porous carbon is a significant factor in the overall cost of supercapacitors, therefore a high carbon yield could effectively mitigate the production cost of porous carbon. This study proposes a method to produce porous carbon spheres through a spray drying technique combined with a carbonization process, utilizing renewable enzymatic hydrolysis lignin as the carbon source and KOH as the activation agent. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between the quantity of activation agent and the development of morphology, pore structure, and specific surface area of the obtained porous carbon materials. We demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the carbon yield of porous carbon, achieving a yield of 22% in contrast to the conventional carbonization-activation method (9%). The samples acquired through this method were found to contain a substantial amount of mesopores, with an average pore size of 1.59 to 1.85 nm and a mesopore ratio of 25.6%. Additionally, these samples showed high specific surface areas, ranging from 1051 to 1831 m2·g−1. Zinc ion hybrid capacitors with lignin-derived porous carbon cathode exhibited a high capacitance of 279 F·g−1 at 0.1 A·g−1 and an energy density of 99.1 Wh·kg−1 when the power density was 80 kW·kg−1. This research presents a novel approach for producing porous carbons with high yield through the utilization of a spray drying approach."
"Application of the Matched Filtering Method to Study the Stream Sediment Geochemistry and Prospecting Prediction of the Baiyun Gold Deposit, Qingchengzi Ore Field, China","The alteration formed by the reaction of ore-bearing fluid and wall rock is often used as an important prospecting indicator, resulting in the dilution or enrichment of metals or related trace elements. A variety of rock-forming and metallogenic elements have been analyzed in regional stream sediments so that the relationship between the ore-bearing altered rock and the change in the geochemical elemental content can be obtained. Therefore, by using appropriate models, such as matched filtering, the abundance of the distribution of wall rock alteration, similar to the discovered deposits, can be modeled by using the distribution of geochemical elements in the region, and the areas with high distribution abundances are usually favorable prospecting targets. The alteration types related to gold mineralization in the Baiyun gold deposit are potassium feldspar alteration, silicification, pyritization, sericitization, and chloritization. In this paper, the geochemical data of the Qingchengzi ore field (1:200,000 and 1:50,000) have been used to form geochemical images through rasterization. In the three sections of the Baiyun gold deposit, binary-coded curves have been formed, revealing the differences in geochemical elements in stream sediments between altered rocks and the rocks surrounding the Baiyun gold mine. Among them, Au, W, and Mo are enriched elements, while Sn, Zn, and Hg are depleted elements. Several gold deposits are found in the predicted altered rock area by using the matched filtering method during fieldwork, which shows the effectiveness of the method."
Effect of silicon in calcium phosphate cements to obtain nanopore scaffolds for medical applications,"We have developed a new biomaterial based on calcium silicate and calcium phosphate whose structure and properties depend on the silicon content. The cement was prepared using as a solid phase a mixture of silicon-doped β-tricalcium phosphate (Si-β-TCP) and monocalcium phosphate monohydrated (MCPM) and as a liquid phase an aqueous solution. The main phases of silicon-doped calcium phosphate cements (Si-CPCs) were brushite, silicarnotite, and hydroxyapatite (HA); it is worth noting the peaks in the cements prepared with 80 wt.% Si-β-TCP of larnite, wallastonite, and calcium carbonate. To increasing silicon content, the Si-CPCs experienced great changes in their morphology forming scaffolds of pore diameters of 0.05, 0.02, and 0.04 µm for 40, 60, and 80 wt.% of Si-CPCs respectively, indicating that the tortuosity and mechanical properties of the cement matrix change with the amount of Si added in Si-β-TCPs. These changes in Si-CPC porosity could help to improve the properties of biomaterials for bone regeneration with a simple method in a cost-effective way."
Effects of reading instructions on pre-service teachers’ judgment bias when learning from texts,"Learning from texts means acquiring and applying knowledge, which requires students to judge their text comprehension accurately. However, students usually overestimate their comprehension, which can be caused by a misalignment between the cues used to judge one’s comprehension and the cognitive requirements of future test questions. Therefore, reading instructions might help students to use more valid cues and hence to make more accurate judgments. In two randomized experiments, we investigated the effect of application instructions (in contrast to general and memory instructions) on judgment bias regarding memory test performance and application test performance. In Experiment 1, 131 pre-service teacher students read two texts: For the first text (pretest phase), all participants received general reading instructions. For the second text (testing phase), they received one of the three reading instructions. Main results were that the general reading instructions in the pretest phase resulted in underestimation for memory test performance and overestimation for application test performance. Results from the testing phase yielded mixed effects and, overall, no strong evidence that reading instructions, and in particular application instructions, are beneficial for debiasing judgments of comprehension. Experiment 2 (N = 164 pre-service teachers) restudied the effects with the same texts but a different study design. Results replicated the effects found in the testing phase of Experiment 1. Overall, the results indicated that reading instructions without further support are not sufficient to help students to accurately judge their comprehension and suggested that text characteristics might impact the effect of reading instructions on judgment bias."
Intracellular iron accumulation facilitates mycobacterial infection in old mouse macrophages,"Aging has a significant impact on the immune system, leading to a gradual decline in immune function and changes in the body’s ability to respond to bacterial infections. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), also known as atypical mycobacteria or environmental mycobacteria, are commonly found in soil, water, and various environmental sources. While many NTM species are considered opportunistic pathogens, some can cause significant infections, particularly in individuals with compromised immune systems, such as older individuals. When mycobacteria enter the body, macrophages are among the first immune cells to encounter them and attempt to engulf mycobacteria through a process called phagocytosis. Some NTM species, including Mycobacterium avium (M. avium) can survive and replicate within macrophages. However, little is known about the interaction between NTM and macrophages in older individuals. In this study, we investigated the response of bone marrow–derived macrophage (BMMs) isolated from young (5 months) and old (25 months) mice to M. avium serotype 4, one of the main NTM species in patients with pulmonary NTM diseases. Our results demonstrated that BMMs from old mice have an increased level of intracellular iron and are more susceptible to M. avium serotype 4 infection compared to BMMs from young mice. The whole-cell proteomic analysis indicated a dysregulated expression of iron homeostasis–associated proteins in old BMMs regardless of mycobacterial infection. Deferoxamine, an iron chelator, significantly rescued mycobacterial killing and phagolysosome maturation in BMMs from old mice. Therefore, our data for the first time indicate that an intracellular iron accumulation improves NTM survival within macrophages from old mice and suggest a potential application of iron-chelating drugs as a host-directed therapy for pulmonary NTM infection in older individuals."

A smart intelligent approach based on hybrid group search and pelican optimization algorithm for data stream clustering,"Big data applications generate a huge range of evolving, real-time, and high-dimensional streaming data. In many applications, data stream clustering regarding efficiency and effectiveness becomes challenging. A major issue in data mining is clustering of data streams. The several clustering techniques were implemented for stream data, but they are mostly quite restricted approaches to cluster dynamics. Generally, the data stream is an arrival of data sequence and also several factors are added in the clustering, which is rather than the classical clustering. For every data point, the stream is mostly unbounded and also the data has been estimated atleast once. It leads to higher processing time and an additional requirement on memory. In addition, the clusters in each data and their statistical property vary over time, and streams can be noisy. To address these challenges, this research work aims to implement a novel data stream clustering which is developed with a hybrid meta-heuristic model. Initially, a data stream is collected, and the micro-clusters are formed by the K-Means Clustering (KMC) technique. Then, the formation of micro-clusters, merge and sorting of the data clusters, where the cluster optimization is performed by the Hybrid Group Search Pelican Optimization (HGSPO). The main objective of the clustering is performed to maximize the accuracy through the radius, distance and similarity measures and then, the thresholds of these metrics are optimized. In the training phase, a stream of clustering threshold is fixed for each cluster. When new data comes into this stream clustering model, the output of training data is measured with new data output that is decided to forward the data into the appropriate clusters based on the assigned threshold with minimum similarity. Through the performance analysis and the attained results, the clustering quality of the recommended system is ensured regarding standard performance metrics by estimating with various clustering and heuristic algorithms."
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling of pitavastatin in relation to SLCO1B1 genetic polymorphism,"Pitavastatin, a potent 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Hepatic uptake of pitavastatin is predominantly occupied by the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) gene, which is a polymorphic gene that encodes OATP1B1. SLCO1B1 genetic polymorphism significantly alters the pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin. This study aimed to establish the physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict pitavastatin pharmacokinetics according to SLCO1B1 genetic polymorphism. PK-Sim® version 10.0 was used to establish the whole-body PBPK model of pitavastatin. Our pharmacogenomic data and a total of 27 clinical pharmacokinetic data with different dose administration and demographic properties were used to develop and validate the model, respectively. Physicochemical properties and disposition characteristics of pitavastatin were acquired from previously reported data or optimized to capture the plasma concentration–time profiles in different SLCO1B1 diplotypes. Model evaluation was performed by comparing the predicted pharmacokinetic parameters and profiles to the observed data. Predicted plasma concentration–time profiles were visually similar to the observed profiles in the non-genotyped populations and different SLCO1B1 diplotypes. All fold error values for AUC and Cmax were included in the two fold range of observed values. Thus, the PBPK model of pitavastatin in different SLCO1B1 diplotypes was properly established. The present study can be useful to individualize the dose administration strategy of pitavastatin in individuals with various ages, races, and SLCO1B1 diplotypes."
The First Width of Non-negatively Curved Surfaces with Convex Boundary,"In this paper, free boundary geodesic networks whose length realizes the first min–max width of the length functional are investigated. This functional acts on the space of relative flat 1-dimensional cycles modulo 2 in a compact surface with boundary. The widths are special critical values of the volume functional in some class of submanifolds which naturally arise in the Min–max Theory of Almgren and Pitts. The main result of this work concerns the existence of a geodesic network with a rather simple structure which realizes the first width of a surface with non-negative sectional curvature and strictly convex boundary. More precisely, it is either a simple geodesic meeting the boundary orthogonally, or a geodesic loop with vertex at a boundary point determining two equal angles with that boundary curve."
Acromegaly increases depressive symptoms and reduces quality of life of cohabitants,To assess how living with patients with acromegaly affects people’s psychology and quality of life (QoL).
A New Framework for Evaluating Social Transparency Factors and Personal Brands in Social Networks,"A personal brand is represented as promoting skills, experience, and career goals to other professionals. The business process of the internet as the media for information and communication technology is known as e-trade which encourages the display of creation on e-trade sites or digital markets as cost-efficient. It makes brands hard to follow the suggestions due to their vagueness and is an obstacle to estimating efficiency. Thus, this study stripped the personal brand down as well as integrated social transparency theory to develop a unique framework evaluating how social transparency factors affect the personal brand which is highlighted to audiences. A survey was performed based on audiences’ responses to posts and active audiences from Facebook and Instagram, and applied SEM to build the proposed model. The empirical results showed content and interaction transparency were significantly related to competency, standards, and relationship commitment. Identity transparency was found to have a negligible relationship with competency, standards, and relationship commitment. This study also researches brand ethics and brand research methods from the ethical perspective. The contributions of this study are twofold. First, the proposed framework provides a new view of evaluating personal brands in social networks in depth, which encourages more theory development in this area. Second, the empirical results clarified the association between the factors of social transparency and personal brand. The effective methods of improving personal brands were discussed for practitioners."
The Non-religious Component of the “Jewish Enterprise”,"The “Jewish Enterprise” (Mordecai Kaplan’s term) consists of all attitudes and actions, not just religious, which are held or performed by people who call themselves Jewish. This paper focuses on Pew 2020 variables that measure non-religious attitudes and behaviors of self-identified Jewish Americans. The Pew 2020 survey includes more non-religious indicators than did Pew 2013. We investigate how well these newer questions measure the “Jewish Enterprise,” and also identify important topics that are not measured by either Pew study. We characterize the distribution of non-religious attitudes and behaviors from the perspective of three different classifications of the Jewish American population (Jewish type, denomination, and Jewish engagement). The results of our analysis show important characteristics of the Jewish American population that are not made visible in the Pew 2020 report. This paper concludes with recommendations for changes in future national and regional studies that will enable the capture and display of additional important non-religious information over the entire self-identifying Jewish American population."
Re-viewing the entrepreneurial university: strategic challenges and theory building opportunities,"Influenced by the neo-liberal economic perspective, in which universities are evaluated based on their contribution to society, the term “Entrepreneurial University” (EU) emerged in the early 1980s. The entrepreneurial university has evolved as a “natural” incubator supporting entrepreneurship, innovation, and sustainability in the university community (e.g., students, alumni, staff, and academics) and beyond civic engagement. Over the last four decades, academic debates on why and how higher education organizations could play this key role have become increasingly important in the business and management literature. It has motivated several special issues published in multidisciplinary academic journals, literature reviews, and theoretical-empirical contributions. However, there is a defragmentation of the literature given the unique nature of each entrepreneurial university during the current decade and the forced transformation of entrepreneurial organizations due to new (technological and health) paradigms. Therefore, this new decade opens the door for re-viewing the theoretical foundations and empirical evidence of entrepreneurial universities. Inspired by these universities’ challenges, this special issue represented a unique opportunity to build a novel theory that provides an updated theoretical view of the entrepreneurial university phenomenon (e.g., re-conceptualization, re-view missions, re-view business models, re-view metrics), as well as to offer new insights about how the new paradigms have transformed core entrepreneurial university activities (education, research, technology transfer, and entrepreneurship), strategies, and interconnectedness with ecosystems. This introductory paper encouraged an in-depth multidisciplinary conversation within the management and related research community from different socio-economic settings to make theoretical and empirical contributions. As a result, six papers have contributed to this special issue and provide several implications for different stakeholders."
Enhanced phenol removal from aqueous media by adsorption onto organo-modified bentonite,"The removal of organic pollutants from contaminated water was the interest of numerous research works, which demonstrated the efficiency of adsorption and organo-modified bentonite-based adsorbents in discharging organic pollution from wastewater. However, the availability and the high cost of those adsorbents have limited further application; this study aims to solve these issues. The intercalation of an organic surfactant, tetraheptylammonium bromide (THPAB) onto the surface of Algerian bentonite from the deposit M’zila we named Ben, yields a new material. The synthesized tetraheptylammonium bentonite (THPA-Ben) underwent characterization before testing its effectiveness as an adsorbent for removing phenol from aqueous solutions. The FTIR, TGA, XRD, and SEM–EDS analysis confirmed successful intercalation of the THPAB onto the Ben surface. The results of adsorption experiment demonstrate the high efficiency of the new adsorbent in removing phenol from aqueous solution. The greatest percentage of the removed phenol was 98.2% when the initial concentration was 5 mg L−1. Adsorbing onto 40 mg of THPA-Ben, the optimum adsorption conditions were: 55 °C; pH values of 4.26 and ~ 9; equilibrium was reached after a contact time of 90 min. The modeling of phenol removal results by kinetic equations shows that the pseudo-second-order model is the best to describe the adsorption process (R2 > 0.9999). The modeled isotherms of phenol adsorption onto the THPA-Ben were well fitted with both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models; the highest phenol adsorption capacity was obtained for the organo-modified bentonite; this indicates that the organo-bentonite THPA-Ben is a promising low-cost adsorbent that enhanced the phenol removal from aqueous media."
SMigraPH: a perceptually retained method for passive haptics-based migration of MR indoor scenes,"To enhance users’ immersion in the mixed reality (MR) cross-scene environment, it is imperative to make geometric modifications to arbitrary multi-scale virtual scenes, including adjustments to layout and size, based on the appearance of diverse real-world spaces. Numerous studies have been conducted on the layout arrangement of pure virtual scenes; however, they often neglect the issue of incongruity between virtual and real environments. Our objective is to mitigate the incongruity between virtual and real scenes in MR, establish a rational layout and size for any virtual scene within an enclosed indoor environment, and leverage tangible real objects to achieve multi-class passive haptic feedback. To achieve these goals, we propose SMigraPH, a perceptually retained indoor scene migration method with passive haptics in MR. Firstly, we propose a scene abstraction technique for constructing mathematical representations of both virtual and real scenes, capturing geometric information and topological relationships, while providing a mapping strategy from the virtual to the real domain. Subsequently, we develop an optimization framework called v2rSA that integrates rationality, relationship preservation, haptic reuse, and scale fitting constraints in order to iteratively generate final layouts for virtual scenes. Finally, we render scenarios on optical see-through MR head-mounted displays (HMDs) to enable users to engage in realistic scene exploration and interaction with haptic feedback. We have conducted experiments and a user study on our proposed method, which demonstrates significant improvements in surface registration accuracy, haptic interaction efficiency, and fidelity compared to the state-of-the-art indoor scene layout arrangement method MakeItHome as well as the random placement approach RandomIn. The results of our approach closely resemble those achieved through manual placement using the Human method."
Robust superpixel-based fuzzy possibilistic clustering method incorporating local information for image segmentation,"In recent years, several superpixel-segmentation methods have been developed to efficiently segment noisy images. However, these methods still face challenges such as high computational complexity and poor adaptability. Therefore, this paper develops a novel superpixel-based robust segmentation model including two modules: superpixel generation and superpixel-based image segmentation. In the superpixel generation module, a fuzzy factor containing local spatial information of pixels is introduced into fuzzy possibilistic clustering algorithm with local search. In the superpixel-based segmentation module, a superpixel-based fuzzy C-means algorithm with local spatial information of superpixels is proposed, which nonlinearly combines the membership of superpixels with the membership of their neighboring superpixels. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms in terms of evaluation indexes and visual effects."
Limited contribution of the of P2X4 receptor to LPS-induced microglial reaction in mice,"Sepsis is life-threatening condition that can trigger long-term neurological sequelae, including cognitive impairment in survivors. The pathogenesis of the so-called sickness behavior is poorly understood, but sepsis-driven neuroinflammation is thought to play a key role. Microglia are the central nervous system resident immune cells and play major roles in the induction and the control of neuroinflammatory processes. Accordingly, we recently demonstrated important microglia reaction, characterized by dramatic microglia transcriptome remodeling, in an experimental model of sepsis. Interfering with microglia pathways thus represents an interesting opportunity to tune microglia reaction towards beneficial outcomes. Purinergic signaling is central to microglia biology and controls key microglia functions. In particular, P2X4 receptors, which are highly permeable to calcium and de novo expressed in reactive microglia, seem to be an interesting target to modulate microglia reaction. Here, we investigated the impact of P2X4 receptors on the LPS-driven microglia transcriptome remodeling. Although we used complementary and sensitive biostatistical approaches, we did not measure significant impact of P2X4 deficiency onto microglia transcriptome either in homeostatic nor reactive condition. Overall, our results revealed that microglia reaction elicited by LPS-mediated sepsis is P2X4 independent and highlights the functional diversity of microglia reaction. These results also promote for the search of disease-specific targets to tune microglia reaction towards beneficial outcomes."
A new insight to access carbonate reservoir quality using quality factor and velocity deviation log,"Estimating wave damping in carbonate rocks is complex due to their heterogeneous structure. For this reason, further research in this area is still necessary. Since the identification and evaluation of reservoir quality play an essential role in the optimal use of hydrocarbon resources, efforts are made to provide new solutions to achieve this goal by managing knowledge and accessing information from new tools such as the Vertical Seismic Profile (VSP). Seismic waves are deformed in frequency content and amplitude as they pass through the earth's layers. Part of the reduction in wavelength is related to the nature of the wave propagation and part to the geological properties, including porosity and fracture. Anisotropy and velocity model analysis, rather than the direct connection between reservoir parameters and seismic absorption coefficient, have received the majority of attention in earlier studies on the impact of reservoir parameters and fractures on changes in the quality factor. In this study, the correlation of the quality factor with parameters such as velocity deviation, fracture density, and permeability has been investigated, and an attempt has been made to define the quality factor as a tool to assess the quality of the reservoir. The statistical study using the multiple linear regression method found that fracture density is the most important parameter that follows the trend of the quality factor value. In the analysis, the quality factor showed a relatively good correlation with the permeability of the core data, so in the periods with maximum permeability, the quality factor had the lowest values. According to K-Means Clustering Analysis, 18% of the studied reservoir interval was evaluated as good quality, 33% as medium, 36% as poor, and 12% as hydrocarbon-free. This work provides insight into accessing reservoir quality using quality factor and velocity deviation logs and would be valuable for the development of reservoir quality prediction methods. Based on the study's results, it is recommended to apply this technique for modeling reservoir heterogeneity and assessing 2D and 3D seismic data to predict the reservoir quality of gas fields prior to drilling operations and reduce exploration risks."
Network-based statistics distinguish anomic and Broca’s aphasia,Aphasia is a speech-language impairment commonly caused by damage to the left hemisphere. The neural mechanisms that underpin different types of aphasia and their symptoms are still not fully understood. This study aims to identify differences in resting-state functional connectivity between anomic and Broca’s aphasia measured through resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI).
Facile Synthesis of Cu–Zn Bimetallic MOF: Application as Superior Adsorbent for Effective Removal of Methylene Blue from Aqueous Solutions,"Copper–zinc benzene tricarboxylic acid bimetallic organic framework (Cu–Zn–BTC MOF) was synthesized by solvothermal process and characterized using various characterization techniques, i.e., SEM, XRD, EDX, TGA and FTIR spectroscopy. The synthesized Cu–Zn–BTC MOF was used as an effective adsorbent for methylene blue (MB) removal from water. Different experimental parameters, i.e., solution pH, adsorbent dosage, agitation time, initial dye concentration and temperature were optimized. Various kinetics and isotherms models were applied to analyze adsorption data. Pseudo-second order and Langmuir model fitted the kinetics and isotherms data well, with correlation coefficient (R2) values ≈ 0.99. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity calculated for Cu–Zn–BTC was 339.5 mg/g at 298 K. The thermodynamic parameters, i.e., ΔG, ΔS and ΔH°, confirmed the spontaneity and exothermic nature of adsorption. The used Cu–Zn–BTC adsorbent was regenerated using ethanol and reused for up to five consecutive cycles. Results revealed that Cu–Zn–BTC is effective for MB decontamination and can be efficiently used for purification of wastewater."
"A citizen science report—Tiger mosquitoes (Aedes albopictus) in allotment gardens in Graz, Styria, Austria","Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, is an invasive species not native to Europe. Due to its ability to transmit pathogens, such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses, Ae. albopictus is considered a major health threat. In Austria, it was first reported in 2012 in the Western province of Tyrol and was documented in the metropolitan area of Vienna in 2020, demonstrating its ability to colonize urban areas. In July 2021, a garden owner from Graz, Styria, Austria, contacted experts because of the possible presence of tiger mosquitoes in an allotment garden complex. Accordingly, citizen scientists collected adult mosquitoes and set up ovitraps. Adults and eggs were sent to the laboratory for morphological examination and molecular DNA barcoding within the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene. In total, 217 eggs of Ae. albopictus were found at the allotment garden as well as at a second location in the city of Graz. In addition, 14 adult Ae. albopictus specimens, of which 7 were molecularly identified as an identical haplotype, were collected at the allotment garden. With its mild climate and numerous parks and gardens, Graz provides the perfect environment for reproduction of tropical/subtropical alien Aedes mosquitoes. The presence of eggs and adult specimens in the current study period indicates that Ae. albopictus is already breeding in Graz. However, monitoring efforts need to be continued to determine whether stable populations of Ae. albopictus can survive there."
Population genetics of the Ixodes affinis (Ixodida: Ixodidae) complex in America: new findings and a host-parasite review,"Ticks are hematophagous ectoparasites associated with a wide range of vertebrate hosts. Within this group, the Ixodidae family stands out, in which the Ixodes genus contains at least 245 species worldwide, from which 55 species are present in the Neotropical region. Ixodes affinis, a tick described in 1899, has a wide distribution from the Southern Cone of America to the United States. However, since its description, morphological variability has been reported among its populations. Furthermore, attempts have been made to clarify its status as a species complex using mitochondrial markers, but mainly in restricted populations of South and Central America. Thus, information related to populations of the transition region between the Neotropical and Nearctic zones is lacking. For these reasons, the objectives of the study were to evaluate the genetic diversity and structure of I. affinis across the Americas and to compile all the published records of I. affinis in America, to elucidate the host-parasite relationships and to identify their geographical distribution. For this, a phylogeny, and AMOVA analyses were performed to assess the genetic structure of samples obtained by field work in South Carolina, USA and Yucatán, Mexico. A total of 86 sequences were retrieved from a fragment of the 16S region. Phylogeny and genetic structure analysis showed four groups that were geographically and genetically related with high branch support and Fst values, all of them statistically significant. The results obtained support the hypothesis that I. affinis it corresponds to a complex of four species, which must be validated through future morphological comparisons."
Detection of Chikungunya Virus Using Tantalum Diselenide (TaSe2)-Based Surface Plasmon Resonance Biosensor,"In our current study, silver (Ag) as a noble metal and tantalum diselenide (TaSe2) material are used in the proposed SPR biosensor to detect the chikungunya virus. To increase the sensitivity of the Ag-based SPR biosensor, TaSe2 is used. We have discussed various refractive indices of the analytes normal plasma (1.350), infected plasma (1.330), normal platelets (1.390), and infected platelets (1.380), as well as sensitivity, detection accuracy (DA), and figure of merit (FoM) maximum performance parameters for proposed sensors. For early detection of the chikungunya virus, we designed a structure comprised of Ag and TaSe2. CsF-coupled prisms are combined with an Ag layer in the proposed sensor. TaSe2 layers have been optimized for superior performance by optimizing the thickness of the Ag layer. An SPR sensor with Kretschmann configuration at a wavelength of 633 nm has a sensitivity of 167.31°/RIU and 371.27°/RIU for plasma and platelets, respectively, at minimum reflectance (Rmin) value. We achieved the maximum sensitivity of 387°/RIU with a TaSe2 layer thickness of 0.75 nm and an optimized Ag layer thickness."
Pure quadratization and solution of ordinary differential equations by probabilistic evolution theory with concurrent computation of coefficients using exact arithmetic,"Probabilistic evolution theory provides a promising method for the solution of ordinary differential equations with multinomial right hand side functions. In this work, the solution by probabilistic evolution theory is implemented in C++ programming language. A novel algorithm for concurrent computation of the coefficients of the series expansion is designed and implemented. Using the program, approximate solutions for different ordinary differential equations are obtained and the results are compared to results of certain prominent methods for numerical solution of ordinary differential equations."
Spectral analysis for signed social networks,"In complex real-world networks, the relation among vertices (people) changes over time. Even with millions of vertices, adding new vertices or deleting a few previous ones can drastically change the network’s dynamics. The Iterated Local Transitivity model is a deterministic model based on the principle of transitivity and local interaction among people. The same has been extended to signed social networks. Let \(\Sigma\) be a signed graph with underlying graph \(G = (V, E)\) and a function \(\sigma :E\rightarrow \{+,-\}\) assigning signs to the edges. We determine the relation between the characteristic polynomials of signed graph \(\Sigma\) and the signed graph obtained from \(\Sigma\) by adding (deleting) vertices or by adding (deleting) edges. Consequently, we present a recurrence relation for a characteristic polynomial of the Iterated Local Transitivity model for signed graphs."
Research on fabricating Cu/stainless steel composite thin strips by two-pass cold roll-bonding with intermediate annealing,"Roll bonding is feasible to fabricate T2 copper (Cu)/ stainless steel (SS) composite thin trips, which have great potential for use in micromanufacturing, robotics, aerospace, and other applications. However, the effective bonding of Cu and SS could be hindered by limited diffusion of the elements and uncoordinated deformation of the metal matrices. In this study, Cu/SS composite strips with 0.24 mm thickness were prepared by the two-pass cold rolling process with intermediate annealing at 400 ~ 1000℃. The influences of the intermediate annealing process on the tensile and peeling strength were investigated. Finite element simulation and microstructure evaluation were carried out to analyze the deformation behaviors and bonding mechanisms of the strips. The results indicate that the deformation coordination in the second-pass rolling and the bonding strength were improved by appropriate intermediate annealing processes. The difference in the deformation resistance between Cu and SS became the lowest by intermediate annealing at 1000℃, while the deformation of Cu and SS was severely uncoordinated by annealing at 600℃. The peel strength and elongation of the strips annealed at 1000℃ were 11.65 ± 0.7N/mm and 34.8 ± 1.3% after the second-pass rolling, which were 79.23% and 6.64 times higher than the strips manufactured without intermediate annealing, respectively. In this work, Cu/SS thin strips with high bonding strength and ductility were successfully manufactured by appropriate intermediate annealing process, and the bonding mechanisms were systematically discussed."

The dietary supplements effect on metabolic markers in non-pharmacologically managed gestational diabetes mellitus patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials,"Although several randomized clinical trials have tested the effect of prenatal dietary supplements on plasma glucose and lipid levels in non-pharmacologically managed gestational diabetes mellitus patients (GDM), a rigorous meta-analytic compendium lacks in the context. Therefore, this study aims to address this evidence gap."
Geodesics on an arbitrary ellipsoid of revolution,"The algorithms given in Karney (J. Geodesy 87:43–55, 2013), to compute geodesics on terrestrial ellipsoids, are extended to apply to ellipsoids of revolution with arbitrary eccentricity. For the direct and inverse geodesic problems, this entails implementing the formulation in terms of elliptic integrals given by Legendre and Cayley. The integral for the area of geodesic polygons is computed in terms of the discrete sine transform of the integrand. In all cases, accuracy close to full machine precision is achieved. An open-source implementation of these algorithms is available."
Robust joint learning of superpixel generation and superpixel-based image segmentation using fuzzy C-multiple-means clustering,"In recent years, many superpixel-based image segmentation algorithms have been presented. However, most of these algorithms face issues of high model complexity and weak robustness. There are two main reasons for this. On the one hand, the traditional superpixel-based image segmentation algorithm constructs two different models to complete the tasks of superpixel generation and superpixel-based image segmentation, which significantly increase the complexity of the algorithm. On the other hand, the segmentation results are largely affected by the characteristics of the generated superpixels, and many superpixel generation algorithms are sensitive to noise, resulting in poor robustness. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel superpixel-based fuzzy C-multiple-means clustering algorithm, which generates superpixels and segments superpixel image in one step to reduce the complexity of the algorithm. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm introduces local spatial information of pixel, enhancing the robustness of superpixel generation to noise. In addition, the generated superpixels have centroid shift property, further improving the algorithm’s detail-preservation ability and robustness. Experimental results show that this algorithm outperforms many state-of-the-art superpixel-related and unrelated fuzzy clustering algorithms in noisy image segmentation, and consumes less time when providing similar segmentation results. Overall, the work in this paper will greatly promote the development of superpixel-based image segmentation theory."
A Chromo-fluorogenic Probe for Selective Detection of Picric Acid Alongside Its Recovery by Aliphatic Amines and Construction of Molecular Logic Gates,"Nitroaromatic compounds are illicit explosive chemicals. For environmental security and homeland safety, selective and sensitive identification of these secondary-class explosives has been a reason for the exhaustive research arena of chemists for about a decade. We introduced a sensitive optical sensor with desalted neutral red (NR) dye. After ingressing picric acid (PA) in acetonitrile, the probe becomes non-fluorescent, displaying a colorimetric change from yellow to pink. The quenched phenomena and the changed color were re-established with aliphatic amine, trimethylamine (TEA). The reversibility is produced cyclically, both in fluorimetrically and spectrophotometrically. The detection limit for PA with our probe comes out as 0.639 µM; this value is significantly lower than many chemosensors available in the literature. Also, NR-stained filter paper strips-based test kit analysis has been deployed as a displayable photonic device for in-situ detection of PA. Furthermore, the whole system was conceptualized to produce single input, single output, and double input single output logic gates, which can be applied to digital devices. The chronological input manner as NTP (NR- TEA-PA) pushed us to configure a molecular keypad lock system, the basis of digital locking devices. The repeatable & reversible detection system exhibits ""Write read- Erase-read Write-read' type memory devices."
Nicorandil Regulates Ferroptosis and Mitigates Septic Cardiomyopathy via TLR4/SLC7A11 Signaling Pathway,"This study mainly explored the role of nicorandil in regulating ferroptosis and alleviating septic cardiomyopathy through toll-like receptor (TLR) 4/solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) signaling pathway. Twenty-four male SD rats were randomly divided into control, Nic (nicorandil), LPS (lipopolysaccharide), and LPS + Nic groups and given echocardiography. A detection kit was applied to measure the levels of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB); HE staining and the levels of glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), total iron, and Fe2+ of myocardial tissues were detected. Moreover, the expression of TLR4 and SLC7A11 were measured by qRT-PCR and the proteins regulating ferroptosis (TLR4, SLC7A11, GPX4, ACSL4, DMT1, Fpn, and TfR1) were checked by western blot. Myocardial cells (H9C2) were induced with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and transfected with si-TLR4 or SLC7A11-OE. Then, the viability, ferroptosis, and TLR4/SLC7A11 signaling pathway of cells were examined. Nicorandil could significantly increase left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) while reduce LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and LV end-systolic volume (LVESV). Also, it greatly reduced the levels of LDH, cTnI, and CK-MB; alleviated the pathological changes of myocardial injury; notably decreased MDA, total iron, and Fe2+ levels in myocardial tissues; and significantly increased GSH level. Besides, nicorandil obviously raised protein levels of GPX4, Fpn, and SLC7A11, and decreased protein levels of ACSL4, DMT1, TfR1, and TLR4. After knockdown of TLR4 or overexpression of SLC7A11, the inhibition effect of nicorandil on ferroptosis was strengthened in LPS-induced H9C2 cells. Therefore, nicorandil may regulate ferroptosis through TLR4/SLC7A11 signaling, thereby alleviating septic cardiomyopathy."
Multiple gene-drug prediction tool reveals Rosiglitazone based treatment pathway for non-segmental vitiligo,"Vitiligo is a skin disease characterized by selective loss of melanocytes, which seriously affects the appearance and causes great psychological stress to patients. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of two vitiligo microarray datasets from the GEO database using bioinformatics tools to identify 297 up-regulated mRNAs and 186 down-regulated mRNAs, revealing important roles for pathways related to melanin synthesis, tyrosine metabolism, and inflammatory factors, such as “PPAR signaling pathway”, “tyrosine metabolism”, “nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathway”, “melanogenesis”, and “IL-17 signaling pathway”. Combining the Search Tool for Interacting Chemicals (STITCH) database 5.0 and the drug-gene interaction database 3.0 (DGIdb), we identified that the PPAR-γ agonist rosiglitazone may promote melanin synthesis via EDNRB. Next, we investigated the mechanism of rosiglitazone and PPAR-γ pathway in promoting melanin production. Consistent with the results of bioinformatics analysis, the expression levels of PPAR-γ, EDNRB, and TYR were significantly reduced in human non-segmental vitiligo skin along with the reduction of MITF, a key gene for epidermal melanogenesis. Meanwhile, rosiglitazone increased melanin synthesis capacity in melanocytes and zebrafish by activating PPAR-γ and upregulating TYR, TYRP-1, and TYRP-2. Conversely, treatment of melanocytes with the PPAR-γ antagonist GW resulted in inhibition of melanin synthesis and expression of melanin-related factors. At the same time, simultaneous treatment of rosiglitazone with GW reversed the inhibitory effect of GW on melanin synthesis. In this study, we identified that rosiglitazone, an important insulin sensitizer, promotes melanin synthesis in melanocytes by increasing PPAR-γ activity and upregulating the expression levels of EDNRB and TYR. These findings may provide new ideas for exploring the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets of non-segmental vitiligo."
Sodium Butyrate Ameliorates Atopic Dermatitis-Induced Inflammation by Inhibiting HDAC3-Mediated STAT1 and NF-κB Pathway,"A topic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic and recurrent skin disorder. The protective effects of sodium butyrate (NaB), a metabolite of short-chain fatty acid breakdown by the gut microbiota, have been widely reported in numerous inflammatory diseases. However, the effect of NaB treatment alone on AD has not been reported. In the current study, AD was induced in BALB/c mice with 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) for 28 days with NaB (200 mg/kg) treatment by gavage. NaB attenuated AD-induced skin bleeding, scarring, dryness, abrasions and erosions. In addition, NaB inhibited inflammatory cells infiltration and attenuated the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Mechanistically, NaB reduced histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) expression and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation by increasing the lysine acetylation levels of STAT1 and NF-κB p65 in AD. Taken together, our study suggests that NaB inhibits inflammatory mediators and ameliorates AD by inhibiting HDAC3 expression, thereby upregulating STAT1 and NF-κB p65 lysine acetylation levels and reducing NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. Therefore, this study provides a new theoretical basis for NaB in the treatment of AD."
Evaluating and modeling a rainfall kinetic energy and erosivity: a case study of a humid watershed in the Ethiopian highlands,"Erosivity is an important component in soil erosion modeling, and it is highly influenced by the kinetic energy of raindrops. However, little research has been conducted on the characterizing and modeling of the kinetic energy and erosivity of rainfall events using measured drop size and velocity in the highlands of Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to evaluate and model rainfall kinetic energy and erosivity in a humid highland watershed (Guder) in Ethiopia. In this study, 1-min rainfall data were recorded with an optical disdrometer for 52 rainfall events from June to October 2022. Regression analyses using linear, power, logarithmic and polynomial functions were employed for 52 rainfall events to established model of kinetic energy and erosivity from commonly available rainfall data (intensity and depth). The result revealed that the volume-based kinetic energy (KEvol) and time-based kinetic energy (KEtime) values of events in the Guder watershed varied from 7.65 to 30.96 J m−2 mm−1 and 32.66 to 1562.94 J m−2 h−1, respectively. A polynomial function (R2 = 0.75, n = 52) was found to be the best fit between KEvol and I, followed by a logarithmic function (R2 = 0.70), whereas the best fit for KEtime was a power function (R2 = 0.76). The potential rainfall erosivity of events was estimated to be 0.96–155.67 MJ mm ha−1 h−1, with an annual value of 1502.74 MJ mm ha−1 h−1. The power function showed a better correspondence with the association between erosivity and rainfall depth (R2 = 0.73) and kinetic energy (R2 = 0.89). Thus, the established models will contribute to estimate the basic rainfall parameters such as KE and erosivity from readily available rainfall data (I and depth) for similar geographical and rainfall characteristics. Additionally, the study contributes for science as input to develop event based soil erosion modeling."
Spirituality and Social-Emotional Learning: A Qualitative Examination of Teachers’ Perspectives,"Spirituality is an important factor in supporting resilience and well-being among children, yet it is not often discussed in the field of school psychology or the public school setting. Indeed, aspects of spirituality align with the core components of social-emotional learning (SEL), such as awareness of self and others, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making. The aims of this study were to explore public school teachers’ perspectives of spirituality and SEL in the classroom and their relationship to student well-being. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve public school educators, and the data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Themes and subthemes reflect participants’ perspectives of the components of spirituality, pushback in the school, and their reflections on discussing spirituality and SEL. We also discuss implications for school psychologists, limitations, and future directions."
Enhanced laser wakefield acceleration utilizing Hermite–Gaussian laser pulses in homogeneous plasma,"The paper investigates the phenomenon of laser wakefield acceleration in a collisionless underdense plasma using Hermite–Gaussian laser pulses. Laser wakefield acceleration is a promising method to generate high-energy particle beams over short distances. The study focuses on utilizing Hermite–Gaussian laser pulses, which have a unique intensity distribution, to drive the wakefield and accelerate electrons effectively. Through theoretical analysis, the paper explores the intricate interplay between the laser pulse's characteristics, the resulting laser wakefield structure, and the electron energy gain. In our research, we revealed that the electron energy gain rises as the amplitude of the laser pulse increases irrespective of Hermite mode index (s). Under identical conditions, we observed enhanced energy gain for s = 0 and s = 2 mode indexes than for s = 1 mode. Electron energy gain varies with pulse length, plasma density, and beam waist for a given Hermite mode index. As a result, the optimized value of any one parameter for maximum energy gain fluctuates with the corresponding values of the other two parameters as well. We have successfully obtained an energy gain of 2.65 GeV with a selected set of parameters. The findings shed light on the potential of Hermite–Gaussian laser pulses in enhancing the performance of laser wakefield acceleration setups, offering insights into optimizing the generation of high-energy particle beams for various applications, such as particle physics experiments and medical treatments."
An experimental investigation of lossy mode resonance-based fiber-optic hydrazine sensor utilizing high-index AZO overlay,"The worldwide community is paying close attention to environmental pollution and energy issues. For instance, hydrazine, a hazardous substance that can harm human health and the environment, is widely utilized in a variety of sectors and may be the cause of multiple disorders. As a result, precise hydrazine determination is crucial. In accordance with this, a lossy mode resonance based (LMR) fiber-optic hydrazine sensor utilizing aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) thin film coated over an uncladded fiber has been reported. AZO thin film was grown using RF sputtering technique, and material properties have been studied. The physicochemical interaction of hydrazine concentration with the AZO layer alters the AZO layer's effective refractive index and changes the peak intensity. The sensor performance has been validated within the concentration range of 2–14 µL/mL. The sensor possesses maximum sensitivity of about 10.71%, and better response and recovery times of 20 s and 23 s, respectively. Thus, the remarkable sensing property advocates that AZO is a propitious candidate for hydrazine sensor."
Plant responses induced by Adoxophyes honmai oviposition in host tea plants and non-host Arabidopsis thaliana,"In the tea ecosystem, tea plants are exposed to attack by the smaller tea tortrix, Adoxophyes honmai Yasuda (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). Ascogaster reticulata Watanabe (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a solitary egg-larval parasitoid wasp that uses chemical cues from tea leaves to search for its host habitat. However, wasp responses to volatiles from egg-laden tea leaves, and plant signaling in response to oviposition by A. honmai, which also recruits parasitoids, are still unknown. Therefore, in this study, we examined wasp responses to volatiles from tea leaves treated with A. honmai egg or reproductive system (RS) homogenate. Although wasps did not show preference for volatiles of host egg-masses or RS homogenates themselves, they preferred egg-laden and RS-treated leaf volatiles to intact leaf volatiles. These results indicate that host plant responses involved in volatile emission attract wasps. Thus, we also investigated plant innate responses induced by A. honmai oviposition. Multiple defense related genes, including JA- and ET-signaling genes, were induced on RS-treated tea leaf. We also investigated gene expression profiles of the SA, JA and ET pathways in a nonhost plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. In A. thaliana, expression of SA and ET-signaling genes was induced by egg treatment, but that of JA-signaling genes was down-regulated. These results suggest that volatile compounds induced by JA pathway may attract A. reticulata to host plant tea leaves."
Pullback Exponential Attractors with Explicit Fractal Dimensions for Non-Autonomous Partial Functional Differential Equations,"The aim of this paper is to propose a new method to construct pullback exponential attractors with explicit fractal dimensions for non-autonomous infinite-dimensional dynamical systems in Banach spaces. The approach is established by combining the squeezing properties and the covering of finite subspace of Banach spaces, which generalize the method established for autonomous systems in Hilbert spaces (Eden A, Foias C, Nicolaenko B, and Temam R Exponential attractors for dissipative evolution equations, Wiley, New York, 1994). The method is especially effective for non-autonomous partial functional differential equations for which phase space decomposition based on the exponential dichotomy of the linear part or variation techniques are available for proving squeezing property. The theoretical results are illustrated by applications to several specific non-autonomous partial functional differential equations, including a retarded reaction–diffusion equation, a retarded 2D Navier–Stokes equation and a retarded semilinear wave equation. The constructed exponential attractors possess explicit fractal dimensions which do not depend on the entropy number but only on some inner characteristics of the studied equations including the spectra of the linear part and the Lipschitz constants of the nonlinear terms and hence do not require the smooth embedding between two spaces in the previous work."
Large diameters and tree bark physical attributes drive vascular epiphyte-phorophyte relationships in Amazonian black-water floodplain forest,"Understanding the interactive relationships between organisms is key to understanding community structure and planning appropriate conservation measures. Even more so for plant-plant interactions, which are poorly understood. We studied the vascular epiphyte community and its interactions with the tree community (phorophytes) in Amazonian black-water floodplain forests (igapó), analyzing 58 floristic inventory plots located along a 517 km stretch of the Brazilian Negro River, in the Central Amazon. The vascular epiphytes and trees were identified and quantified, and the physical attributes of the bark were measured, as well as the diameter at breast height (DBH) of the tree species. A total of 2746 trees ≥ 10 cm DBH were inventoried, of which 969 were phorophytes (35.29%), hosting 4692 individuals of epiphytic species, belonging to 17 families 50 genera, and 106 species. Pouteria elegans was the most abundant phorophyte, however, Aldina latifolia showed proportionally higher richness and abundance of epiphytes. Codonanthopsis crassifolia was the epiphyte that colonized most of the phorophytes and showed the highest Epiphytic Importance Value (EIV). The average values for thickness, saturated weight, water retention capacity, and diameter were significantly higher in the tree species that housed vascular epiphytes. In addition, the vascular epiphyte richness (R2m = 0.32; R2c = 0.41) and abundance (R2m = 0.36; R2c = 0.90) were strongly influenced by larger diameters of phorophytes and their saturated bark weight. Our results confirm the importance of phorophyte size (DBH) for epiphyte colonization, present the most complete epiphyte list of Amazonian black-water floodplain forests and provide evidence that physical attributes of tree bark drive the structure of vascular epiphyte-phorophyte interactions."
Assessment of Discharged 222Rn at Surface from Ventilation Shafts of Underground Uranium Mine at Narwapahar in India,"Measurements of atmospheric release from underground uranium mine at Narwapahar in state of Jharkhand has been done to assess the discharged 222Rn at surface from ventilation shafts of mine. Annual volume of atmospheric discharge has been estimated around 6 × 109 m3 from ventilation shafts of mine with associated radon (222Rn) activity around 2.3 × 1013 Becquerel. Such a huge amount of radioactivity discharge in open atmosphere through underground uranium mine is always under consideration to assess the exposure of public residing in surrounding villages, if any. Realizing the non-negligible health hazards due to radon exposure, the present study has been carried out to measure the radon concentrations in surface discharged air. A portable radon-measuring device (Alpha-guard) is used to determine the radon levels. Alpha-guard is used in diffusion mode for the measurements of radon concentration in the vicinity of ventilation shafts of the U-mine. The study reveals that the discharge of radon from mine exhaust is confined within 100 m of the discharge point of the mine (in no man area within mine premises) and it does not affect the inhalation hazards to inhabitants residing in public domain in nearby villages."
An adaptive traffic engineering approach based on retransmission timeout adjustment for software-defined networks,"Traffic engineering of software-defined networks (SDNs) refers to network traffic monitoring and network status analysis to improve network performance, which can be achieved by addressing a variety of issues such as routing, congestion control, flow control, and load balancing. In this paper, a new traffic engineering approach is proposed that attempts to manage the traffic of SDN by adjusting the retransmission timeout. In the proposed approach, the initial retransmission timeout is determined based on transmission and propagation delays, and then this time is adaptively adjusted according to the priority of the packets, which depends on the type of packet and the number of elapsed hops. The conducted simulations in the Mininet tool have validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to counterpart methods in terms of average throughput, average bandwidth utilization, end-to-end delay, and packet loss ratio. Eventually, analysis of the time complexity and message complexity demonstrates that the overhead of the proposed approach is negligible."
Task Bias in Contrastive Vision-Language Models,"Incidental supervision from language has become a popular approach for learning generic visual representations that can be prompted to perform many recognition tasks in computer vision. We conduct an in-depth exploration of the CLIP model and show that its visual representation is often strongly biased towards solving some tasks more than others. Moreover, which task the representation will be biased towards is unpredictable, with little consistency across images. To resolve this task bias, we show how to learn a ‘task guidance token’ that can be appended to the input to prompt the representation towards features relevant to their task of interest. Our results show that this task guidance can be independent of the input image and still effectively provide a conditioning mechanism to steer visual representations towards the desired task."
Poly(HIPEs) from terpenoid-derived acrylates,"The need for utilization of non-fossil fuel derived sources for polymer production is growing. In this study the terpenoids tetrahydrogeraniol, citronellol and nopol were modified with an esterification procedure using acryloyl chloride, forming terpenoid acrylates. The synthesised acrylates were used for the production of hierarchically porous polymers via high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) templating with emulsions consisting of an organic (monomer) phase and an aqueous phase with a volume fraction of 85%. The acrylate terpenoids in the organic phase were crosslinked with trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) to form the polyHIPEs. A crosslinking degree of 5 and 10 mol% was used to investigate the feasibility of polyHIPE production. While both crosslinking degrees enabled the synthesis of polymers, only the 10 mol% crosslinking yielded the typical interconnected porous cellular topology. The average primary pore diameter in the case of the tetrahydrogeraniol acrylate and citronellyl acrylate was 15.6 and 16.5 μm, respectively, while the average primary pore diameter in the case of nopol acrylate was 5.6 μm."
Biochar derived from tobacco waste significantly reduces the accumulations of cadmium and copper in edible parts of two vegetables: an in-situ  field study,"Biochar, as a soil amendment, can be applied to remediate heavy metal (HM) contaminated farmland. However, there is little research on the effect of tobacco biochar (TB) derived from tobacco waste on HM controlling in edible parts of vegetables. In this study, the impact of two TB levels on the plant growth, copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) accumulation in the edible parts of lettuce and chrysanthemum, and on Cu and Cd bioavailability of rhizosphere soil was investigated through in-situ  field experiments. The results showed that TB has rich oxygen containing functional groups, high porosity, high nitrogen adsorption capacity. The addition of 5 t ha−1 and 10 t ha−1 TB significantly increased the shoot biomass of chrysanthemum, but had no effect on the growth of lettuce. Two levels of TB significantly increased the pH value, but decreased the available Cu and Cd concentrations of rhizosphere soil, thereby reducing the Cu and Cd accumulations in the edible parts of lettuce and chrysanthemum. The findings provided effective evidences that TB derived from tobacco waste is an efficient strategy for controlling Cu and Cd accumulation in the edible parts of vegetables to ensure agri-product  safety production in HM-polluted farmland."
A comparative LCA of external wall assemblies in context of Iranian market: considering embodied and operational energy through BIM application,"Building envelopes have a critical role in the sustainability of the construction sector. The goals of the current research are assessing the environmental impacts of typical exterior wall assemblies and presenting the best Iranian market option through taking account of both embodied and operational energy. Autodesk Green Building Studio (GBS) is used to determine the operating loads of each wall. Simapro, a life cycle assessment software, is applied for managing data on environmental impacts. The derived results demonstrate that human health is the most severe damage category for all the analyzed walls. Also, the end-of-life stage’s environmental impact is insignificant compared to the production and use stages. Reducing carbon emissions has the highest priority, such that replacing 1 m2 of masonry brick wall (the worst option) with prefabricated extruded polystyrene (XPS) drywall (the best option) can result in saving 1257.85 kgCO2eq. The operational phase of the studied walls has a wide range of environmental impacts. Prefabricated Knauf drywall as well as prefabricated XPS drywall consumes less energy for the operating phase mainly due to providing sufficient quantity of isolations that leads to the better total environmental performance. In conclusion, it should be noted that the thermal performance of building materials should be given more attention."
"Development of landslide susceptibility maps of Tripura, India using GIS and analytical hierarchy process (AHP)","Landslides are one of the most extensive and destructive geological hazards on the globe. Tripura, a northeastern hilly state of India experiences landslides almost every year during monsoon season causing casualties and huge economic losses. Hence, it is required to assess the landslide susceptibility of the area that would support short- and long-term planning and mitigation. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) integrated with geospatial technology has been adopted for landslide susceptibility mapping in the state. Eight influencing factors such as slope, lithology, drainage density, rainfall, land use land cover, distance from rivers and roads, and soil type were selected to map the landslide susceptibility. Landslide susceptibility index (LSI) was found to vary from 6.205 during monsoon to 1.427 during post-monsoon season. The LSI values were classified into very high, high, moderate, low, and very low susceptibility. Landslide susceptibility maps for three different seasons, namely, pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon, were prepared. The study showed that most of the areas of the state come under very low to moderate landslide susceptibility zones. Around 73.2% area of the state is found to be under low landslide-susceptible zones during the pre-monsoon season, around 62% area is prone to landslides with moderate susceptibility during the monsoon season, and 68.5% area comes under landslides with low susceptibility zones during the post-monsoon season. The results of this study may be referred to the engineers and planners for the assessment, control, and mitigation of landslides and the development of basic infrastructure in the state."
Does incentive-based green governance compensate for green innovation in enterprises? The role of green orientation,"Government-led green governance, as a crucial tool for achieving green and sustainable development, has garnered significant attention among researchers worldwide. Nevertheless, research on incentive-based green governance and green orientation remains insufficient. This study adopts an evolutionary game theory framework to elucidate the mechanisms underlying incentive-based green governance and green orientation in facilitating green innovation. The effectiveness of this framework is then verified through the utilization of propensity score matching (PSM) and difference-in-differences (DID) methods using data from Chinese companies. The main findings include the following: (1) Government incentive-based green governance exhibits a compensatory effect on green innovation, which is validated through robustness testing. (2) Internal green orientation serves as an intermediary factor between incentive-based green governance and green innovation, while external green orientation exerts a positive regulatory effect. (3) Heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that the impact of incentive-based green governance on green innovation is more pronounced in non-high-pollution industries, high-tech corporations, and companies operating in areas with lower governance intensity. This study is conducive to illustrate the compensatory effect of government incentive-based green governance on green innovation and also provides reference for the government to issue targeted green governance policies."
Multiple cartilaginous exostoses of rib in dog: a case report,"Osteochondroma is a proliferative condition that affects cartilage and bone in rare cases. Osteochondroma of the ribs is uncommon in dogs, and its manifestation has the potential to induce compression and harm to the vasculature and internal organs of the thoracic cavity. The discoverable evidence of this condition was encountered during the dissection of the chest of a 5-year-old male dog of mixed breed, who had no previous record of illness. The salient features noted during the dissection process were the identification of four dome-shaped masses which evinced a solid consistency and were found to be located in the right hemithorax, thus leaving an impression on the caudal lobes of the right lung. The masses were distinguished by their smooth surfaces and hard texture. Upon histological analysis, the lesion was characterized by spongy bone enveloped by periosteum and hyaline cartilage. The results obtained from the study’s macroscopic and microscopic levels indicated multiple cartilaginous exostosis."
Does Parental Support Moderate the Association Between Bullying Victimization and Anti-bullying Attitudes Among Chinese Adolescents,"This study investigated the effects of three types of bullying victimization (relational, verbal, and physical) on attitudes toward anti-bullying, moderated by the role of parental support. The data used in this study were obtained from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018, a survey conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that included responses from 11,990 Chinese adolescents aged 15 years. Multivariate regression modeling and the Johnson–Neyman technique were used to examine the moderating effect of parental support on the relationship between the three types of bullying victimization and attitudes toward bullying. The results indicated that the three types of bullying victimization were significantly and positively correlated with students’ anti-bullying attitudes. Furthermore, parental support moderated the relationship between the three types of bullying victimization and anti-bullying attitudes. Specifically, when the value of parental support was less than 84.215, 81.728, and 69.878, relational, verbal, and physical bullying victimization, respectively, had a significant positive effect on adolescents’ anti-bullying attitudes through the moderating effect of parental support. These findings suggest that parents should provide care and support to children who are victims of bullying."
Magnetic iron oxide: preparation and characterization for antibacterial activity applications,"Using the extract of Cuminum seeds (S1) and dried lemon peels (S2), iron oxide nanoparticles were prepared using green synthesis. After converting the extract to powder using the sol-gel method, the nanoparticles of iron oxide were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emotion-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The XRD results confirmed the formation of the face-centered cubic phase of iron oxide (α-Fe2O3) with high purity and strong diffraction peaks for both S1 and S2. The FE-SEM image reveals aggregated particles resembling nanoparticle clusters of polyhedral, oval, and irregular semispherical shapes for S1 samples, whereas S2 samples exhibited spherical and oval shapes. Both samples’ magnetic characteristics revealed mild ferromagnetism and intermediate magnetization saturation, confirming the existence of non-magnetic surface layers derived from the phytomolecules found in the leaf extract. Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria were used to examine the inhibition of each plant using the diffusion-drilling agar method, as it is known that these plants possess therapeutic efficacy for numerous diseases. Both dried cumin seed extract and dried lemon peel extract were more efficient against Staphylococcus aureus than they were against E. coli."
A study on simulation-based optimization of a stochastic flexible job shop scheduling undergoing preventive maintenance with sequence-dependent setup time,"Routing flexibility (RF) and maintenance aspects in manufacturing system leads to effective and efficient production system. The present study considered flexible job shop scheduling undergoing reliability-based preventive maintenance with sequence-dependent setup time (SdSt) in stochastic environment. A simulation-optimization strategy is used to solve this complex problem. Reliability-centered preventive maintenance (RCPM) and reliability-centered periodic preventive (RCPPM) maintenance are two reliability-based preventive maintenance approaches integrated with this study in which five reliability levels and two maintenance time levels are considered. The study also comprises six levels of RF to assess its effect. Five shop performance measures, i.e., mean flow time, maximum flow time, mean tardiness, maximum tardiness, and number of tardy jobs, are utilized to evaluate shop performance. The analysis results indicate that in both preventive maintenance approaches, i.e., RCPM and RCPPM, incorporating RF enhances shop performance up RF level three, beyond that, shop performance deteriorates. Single and multi-objective optimization results demonstrate that lower level of reliability and maintenance time, and middle-level RF provide the optimum solution. Addressing job shop scheduling problem with preventive maintenance in a stochastic and dynamic environment with RF and SdSt using simulation-optimization approach shows the work novelty."
A systematic literature review of factors influencing the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices,"Adopting climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices is a long-term solution for enhancing agricultural sustainability and food security under the changing climate. However, the penetration rate of CSA practices remains low worldwide. Understanding the key factors driving the adoption of CSA practices is key to increasing its penetration. This study provides a systematic review of the literature comprising 190 studies published between 2013 and 2023. Based on the reviewed literature, we provide comprehensive definitions of CSA practices from broad and narrow perspectives. We also discuss the factors influencing farmers’ decisions to adopt CSA practices from four categories: socio-demographic factors, institutional factors, resource endowment factors, and socio-economic factors. Our literature review reveals that most of the factors (e.g., age, gender, education, risk perception and preference, access to credit, farm size, production conditions, off-farm income, and labor allocation) discussed in the literature have a dual (either positive or negative) impact on CSA practice adoption. The variables such as labor endowment, land tenure security, access to extension services, access to agricultural training, membership in farmers’ organizations, non-governmental organization (NGO) support, climate conditions, and access to information consistently and positively impact CSA practice adoption. These findings provide solid evidence for designing appropriate policy instruments that help accelerate CSA diffusion and transmission. We also find gaps in CSA practice measurements, influencing factor identification, and econometric methods used for empirical analysis, which should be explored by future research."
Elevation and temperature are strong predictors of long-term carbon accumulation across tropical Andean mountain peatlands,"Mountain peatlands are understudied globally, especially in tropical regions such as the Andes. Their high abundance across the landscape and thick carbon (C)-rich soils establish them as regionally important C reservoirs. However, they are at high risk of degradation due to unsustainable land use and climate change. Mitigation of these threats requires detailed inventories of C stocks present and improved understanding of the major drivers of long-term C accumulation in these ecosystems. We cored 24 peatlands located between 3000 and 4800 m elevation across Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, calculated C storage and long-term and recent apparent rate of C accumulation (LARCA and RARCA, respectively), and tested their relationships to environmental variables (elevation, temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation). The peatlands had a mean thickness of 4.7 m (range, 0.7‒11.25 m). The mean age of peatland was 7918 yrs B.P., with a range from 490 to 20,000 yrs B.P. The mean C stock was 1743 Mg ha-1 and did not significantly vary by climatic region or basal age but did increase with elevation. LARCA was best predicted by age and elevation, while RARCA was negatively related to mean annual temperature. These findings indicate that peatlands in the tropical Andes store thick deposits of soil C that are likely influenced by temperature, making them vulnerable to changes in climate. To inform climate policy, there is a need for science that will determine the potential for adaptation and mitigation treatments to increase the resilience of these C-rich ecosystems to climate change."
Narrow Band Gap and High Saturation Magnetization in Y-Doped NiCo Ferrites,"Yttrium-doped nickel–cobalt ferrite Ni0.5Co0.5YxFe2-xO4 (x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) nanostructures have been prepared by sol–gel auto combustion method. Structural properties were analyzed by X-ray diffraction method, and the formation of single phased spinel ferrite formation for all the samples prepared is confirmed. The crystalline size is varied from 21 to 37 nm. The lattice parameter varied randomly with increase of Y doping. The surface morphology of these ferrites was observed by FESEM, and agglomerate grains were observed with increase of yttrium doping. EDX spectrum confirms the presence of the required elements. FTIR spectrum indicates the formation of the spinel ferrite structure with M–O bonds. Optical direct band measurements from UV–Vis spectroscopy indicated that the direct band gap decreased from Y = 0.10 to Y = 0.20. The magnetic properties of these ferrites studied by VSM at room temperature. The saturation magnetization decreased from 65.65 to 38.49 emu/g with increase of Y doping up to 0.15 and then slightly increased to x = 0.20 sample to 38.572 emu/g. Interestingly, the remanent magnetization and coercivity also follows the same trend. This may be due to variation in crystallite size, grain boundaries, and increase in Y doping results in the magnetic crystalline anisotropic nature."
Effects of breathing variables on modelled particle lung deposition at physical activity for children and adults,"The respiratory tract deposited fraction (DF) is the link between exposure and health effects of airborne particles. Here, we investigate how breathing pattern alterations at increasing physical activity affect DF in different regions of the respiratory tract and compare DF between adults and children (5 and 10 years old). We performed a literature review on the alteration of tidal volume with minute ventilation at increasing physical activity and used the results to model the size resolved (0.001–10 µm) DF, primarily using the deposition models from NCRP and Yeh and Schum (1980), but also MPPD. We found a shift in the deposited size distribution with increasing physical activity—DF of ultrafine particles increased in the alveolar region and decreased in the other regions, while DF of coarser particles decreased in the alveolar region and increased in the extra-thoracic region. Children had a 10–20% higher DF of ultrafine particles in the alveolar region compared to adults. We also present parametrizations of the daily average size resolved (0.005–5 µm) DF, accounting for varying physical activity throughout the day and oral/nasal breathing. These can be applied to any size distribution to estimate deposited doses. We found that deposited mass and number doses were more than twice as high for 5-year-olds compared to adults when normalized for body weight, primarily caused by their higher weight normalized minute ventilation. This demonstrates the importance of studying children’s exposure to air pollution and not only rely on data from adults."
Selenium Deficiency Can Promote the Expression of VEGF and Inflammatory Factors in Cartilage Differentiation and Mediates Cartilage Injury,"Selenium plays a crucial role as a micronutrient, primarily exerting its biological functions through selenoproteins. It has been established that selenium deficiency adversely impacts cartilage development, leading to alterations in chondrocyte function. In regions with low selenium intake, endemic osteochondrosis has been documented, characterized by compromised growth plate and articular cartilage formation. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stands out as a pivotal angiogenic factor, with elevated levels contributing significantly to vascular invasion into chondrocytes. This VEGF-mediated invasion serves as a key signal, prompting morphological changes in the growth plate and initiating cartilage remodeling. In animal models, the selenium deficiency group exhibited heightened levels of the cartilage damage marker matrix metalloproteinases 13 (MMP13). This resulted in articular cartilage degeneration, accompanied by a substantial increase in VEGF expression within the growth plate and articular cartilage, as compared to the normal group. In a chondrogenic progenitor cell (CPC) differentiation model, insufficient selenium induced chondrocyte damage and upregulated inflammatory factors such as inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2). The selenium-deficient groups showed elevated expressions of VEGF, VEGFR2, MMP13, Collagen X, and Angiopoietin 1, accelerating the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which further promoted the development of cartilage-related diseases. Taken together, these findings provide novel insights for a better understanding of the role of low selenium in cartilage degeneration and angiogenesis. They shed light on the intricate influence of low selenium levels on the development of articular cartilage, emphasizing the interconnected pathways and processes involved."
"Purmorphamine, a Smo-Shh/Gli Activator, Promotes Sonic Hedgehog-Mediated Neurogenesis and Restores Behavioural and Neurochemical Deficits in Experimental Model of Multiple Sclerosis","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a pathological condition characterized by the demyelination of nerve fibers, primarily attributed to the destruction of oligodendrocytes and subsequent motor neuron impairment. Ethidium bromide (EB) is a neurotoxic compound that induces neuronal degeneration, resulting in demyelination and symptoms resembling those observed in experimental animal models of multiple sclerosis (MS). The neurotoxic effects induced by EB in multiple sclerosis (MS) are distinguished by the death of oligodendrocytes, degradation of myelin basic protein (MBP), and deterioration of axons. Neurological complications related to MS have been linked to alterations in the signaling pathway known as smo-shh. Purmorphine (PUR) is a semi-synthetic compound that exhibits potent Smo-shh agonistic activity. It possesses various pharmacological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuromodulatory effects. Hence, the current investigation was conducted to assess the neuroprotective efficacy of PUR (at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally) both individually and in conjunction with Fingolimod (FING) (at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally) in the experimental model of MS induced by EB. The administration of EB was conducted via the intracerebropeduncle route (ICP) over a period of seven days in the brain of rats. The Wistar rats were allocated into six groups using randomization, each consisting of eight rats (n = 8 per group). The experimental groups in this study were categorized as follows: (I) Sham Control, (II) Vehicle Control, (III) PUR per se, (IV) EB, (V) EB + PUR5, (VI) EB + PUR10, (VII) EB + FING 0.5, and (VIII) EB + PUR10 + FING 0.5. On the final day of the experimental timeline, all animal subjects were euthanized, and subsequent neurochemical estimations were conducted on cerebrospinal fluid, blood plasma, and brain tissue samples. In addition, we conducted neurofilament (NFL) analysis and histopathological examination. We utilized the luxol myelin stain to understand better the degeneration associated with MS and its associated neurological complications. The findings of our study indicate that the activation of SMO-Shh by PUR has a mitigating effect on neurobehavioral impairments induced by EB, as well as a restorative effect on cellular and neurotransmitter abnormalities in an experimental model of MS."
(+)-Catechin Alleviates CCI-Induced Neuropathic Pain in Rats by Modulating the IL34/CSFIR Axis and Attenuating the Schwann Cell-Macrophage Cascade Response in the DRG,"The aim of this study was to investigate the potential therapeutic applications of (+)-catechin in the treatment of neuropathic pain. In vivo study, 32 SD rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham group, chronic constriction injury (CCI) group, CCI + ibuprofen group and CCI+ (+)-catechin group. They were subjected to behavioural tests, ELISA, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The mechanisms involved were investigated using specific inhibitors in cell experiments. Results of in vivo experiments showed that (+)-catechin could reduce the cold sensitivity pain in a rat model of CCI; ELISA and immunohistochemistry results showed that (+)-catechin could decrease the levels of IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, CCL2 and CCL5 in serum and the expression levels of nNOS, COX2, IL6, TNF-α, IBA-1 and CSF1R in DRG of CCI rats. Finally, western blot confirmed that (+)-catechin could diminish the levels of IL-34/CSF1R/JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway in DRG of CCI rats. In vitro studies showed that (+)-catechin reduced IL-34 secretion in LPS-induced RSC96 cells. Meanwhile, (+)-catechin administration in LPS-induced Schwann cell–conditioned medium (L-CM) significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of RAW264.7 cells; in addition, L-CM+(+)-catechin reduced the activation of the CSF1R/JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway. (+)-Catechin attenuated the Schwann cell-macrophage cascade response in the DRG by modulating the IL34/CSFIR axis and inhibiting activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, thereby attenuating CCI-induced neuropathic pain in rats."
Downregulation of ATF-4 Attenuates the Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress–Mediated Neuroinflammation and Cognitive Impairment in Experimentally Induced Alzheimer’s Disease Model,"Protein aggregation is invariably associated with the inflammation as a factor in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We investigated the interaction between downstream factors of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway and inflammation, with implications in cognitive impairment in AD. Amyloid-β (Aβ)(1–42) was administered by bilateral intracerebroventricular (icv) injection in the brain of adult male Wistar rats to experimentally develop AD. The cognitive impairment was assessed by measuring behavioral parameters such as Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in different rat brain regions. Inflammatory marker proteins such as cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 and phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-КB) (p65) were measured by the western blotting. Gene expression of ER stress downstream factors such as ATF-4, CHOP, and GADD-34 was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Histological studies were performed to check Aβ accumulation and neuronal degeneration. Integrated stress response inhibitor (ISRIB) was used to confirm the specific role of ER stress–mediated inflammation in cognitive impairment. Administration of Aβ(1–42) resulted in alteration in levels of inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory proteins, and mRNA levels of ER stress downstream factors. ISRIB treatment resulted in attenuation of Aβ(1–42)-induced ER stress, inflammation, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment in rats. These results indicate that ER stress–mediated inflammation potentiates the cognitive impairment in AD. An understanding of cascade of events, interaction of ER stress which was a hallmark of the present investigation together with inflammation and modulation of downstream signalling factors could serve as potent biomarkers to study AD progression."
"A New Vector for Mapping Gold Mineralization Potential and Proposed Pathways in Highly Weathered Basement Rocks using Multispectral, Radar, and Magnetic Data in Random Forest Algorithm","Various deformation events and weathering processes are among the obstacles to exploration of natural resources, especially mineral ones. This study addressed these obstacles by proposing solutions through the utilization of multiple multispectral, radar, and magnetic datasets. The study region, situated in a region between two blocks associated with the Arabian–Nubian Shield, is known for the presence of these obstacles. Also, the region is characterized by the conflicting nature of these blocks in relation to occurrences of gold mineralization. Various optical and multi-frequency radar datasets were used for detailed geological/mineralogical discrimination and surface lineaments mapping, respectively. Numerous composite enhancement, processing, and classification methods were applied to aeromagnetic and multispectral data to derive as much information as possible from these data. The results of the classification of minerals, the separation of rock units, and the identification of deep-seated geological structures were combined to produce a map for predicting gold prospectivity by generating a random forest model using 10 controlling factors and the previously defined zones of gold mineralization. A three-dimensional model was generated to show the locations of the expected gold mineralization potential areas with regard to depth in the investigated region. This model figured out the strong relation between gold potentialities related to their suggested pathways, particularly WNW- and N-trending shear zones. Our model indicates that the region is promising for mining activities and presents a new approach for mapping pathways of gold-mineralized–altered zones that can be applied worldwide."
Broadband supercontinuum generation in different lattices of As2Se3-photonic crystal fibers with all-normal dispersion and low peak power,"This paper introduces a new design based on As2Se3 photonic crystal fibers, with the first layer of air holes near the core being removed. Dispersion properties were investigated for fibers with various types of lattice, including circular, square, and hexagonal lattice. Three fibers with a flat, all-normal dispersion, and a low dispersion value are proposed for supercontinuum generation at the same pump wavelength of 5.5 µm. The input pulse has a duration of 180 fs and a low peak power of 2.778 kW propagating in 10 cm fibers length, generating supercontinuum spectrums at 30 dB levels of 5.725 µm, 5.348 µm, and 5.936 µm, respectively, for circular, square, and hexagonal lattices. In addition, the fiber with the hexagonal lattice has the highest nonlinear coefficient of 862.654 W−1.km−1 and the lowest confinement loss of 0.137 dB/m, causing the largest bandwidth. The supercontinuum generation with low peak power using optimized PCFs with high nonlinearity and low confinement loss, makes them suitable for many application areas, e.g., the polarization-maintaining, coherent optical communications, nonlinear optics, etc."
Atomic force microscopy and ellipsometry investigations of rare earth oxide Dy2O3 nano-layer processed by electron beam evaporation on n-GaAs substrate,"In this paper, we show and analyse the results of morphological characterisations of Dy2O3 layer deposited on an n-type GaAs substrate using atomic force microscopy (AFM). For structural measurement, the surface morphology of the elaborated layer was revealed as a nano-conical event. The global experimental ellipsometric results Ψ and Δ versus emission wavelength of the Dy2O3/n-GaAs structure have been presented and discussed. Using these results and a Matlab code in which we assumed the structure had three layers, we have calculated several linear and nonlinear optical constants of the Dy2O3 thin layer. Dysprosium oxide has high optical conductivity and a noticeable increase in nonlinear optical parameters, making it a promising candidate for various applications. This is especially true in the field of optoelectronics."
Optical medical equipment application and observing the occurrence of hypotension in elderly patients after general anesthesia induction through arteriovenous ultrasound parameters,"Induced hypotension after intraoperative general anesthesia can lead to various complications, affecting the prognosis and postoperative recovery. Injecting too much fluid into a patient during surgery can increase circulating pressure, causing tissue edema and even organ failure. This condition is especially common in elderly patients. The application of optical medical devices has shown great potential in the medical field. However, in older patients, there is a higher incidence of hypotension after general anesthesia, which may negatively affect the procedure and the patient's health status. The purpose of this study was to investigate the application of optical medical devices in observing hypotension after general anesthesia in elderly patients in order to better understand and prevent the occurrence of this complication. This study selected 30 elderly patients who underwent surgery in a certain hospital as the study object. FT3, FT4, and TSH were 4.672 ± 0.780 pmol/L, 16.924 ± 2.185 pmol/L, and 1.912 (1.255, 2.790) µ IU/ml, respectively; After anesthesia induction, the inner diameter of the left and right common carotid arteries significantly decreased (P < 0.05), with values of 5.871 ± 0.461 and 5.775 ± 0.633, respectively; The induced IVCe, IVCi, and CI showed significant changes, with IVCe and CI being 1.882 ± 0.200 and 36.898 ± 4.685, respectively. Optical medical devices have the potential to observe and monitor hypotension after general anesthesia in elderly patients. By observing the changes in the parameters of arteriovenous ultrasound, the risk of hypotension can be grasped earlier and corresponding preventive measures can be taken to improve the safety of surgical procedures and the health of elderly patients."
Multispace Maxillofacial Space Infections Involving Orbit: Report of a Rare Case,"Peri-apical infection is a prevalent form of odontogenic infection, typically following the path of least resistance through cancellous bone towards the cortical plate. This infection begins as cellulitis and may progress to an abscess, sometimes involving various anatomically potential spaces. While frontal space infection is a rare complication of odontogenic infection spread, it can occur in conjunction with buccal space, sub-mental space, and orbital space involvement. In this report, we present the case of a 62-year-old man with a history of tooth pain and diabetes mellitus for the past decade. The patient exhibited symptoms of swelling, multiple draining sinuses, pain, proptosis, and fever. Prompt action was taken to drain the multiple abscesses, and the causative teeth were subsequently extracted. This case illustrates one of the severe complications associated with odontogenic infection, which has the potential to be life-threatening."
Demcrp-et: decentralized multi-criteria ranked prosumers energy trading using distributed ledger technology,"Due to global warming and climate change, power generation from renewable resources, such as solar, wind, fuel cells, and others, is becoming increasingly important. The smart grid’s incorporation of renewable energy resources makes Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading through the local energy market possible. Due to its distributed nature, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading faces many challenges regarding security and privacy in energy trading. Most existing works do not consider data privacy among participants. A P2P energy trading model with Decentralized Multi-Criteria Ranked Prosumers called DeMCRP is introduced to address these privacy and security challenges in smart grid energy trading. The proposed DeMCRP trading model uses Corda-distributed ledgers, consensus, and smart contracts for energy trading between energy buyers and sellers, also termed prosumers. In the DeMCRP model, the mapping procedure between prosumers is done based on priority values for such prosumers determined using a multi-criteria decision-making method, namely the Preference Ranking for Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation II (PROMETHEE II). Furthermore, an energy-trading smart contract performs energy trading between buyers and sellers. The transactions’ validation, verification, and uniqueness process is acheived through consensus of the distributed ledger by notaries. The Distributed Service Operator (DSO) selects 51% of sellers as notaries according to the rank of sellers. The rank of sellers is determined using a multi-criteria decision-making method called PROMETHEE II by considering various parameters such as energy surplus, trust factor, and the number of times the seller is selected as notary. Moreover, the performance analysis of the proposed scheme has been carried out in terms of network deployment time and memory utilization. The proposed DeMCRP technique works in polynomial time if the number of participants increase. Furthermore, security analysis has been carried out for various security features like data sharing privacy, users’ privacy, non-repudiation, integrity, and preventing double-spending. The proposed method protects the privacy of participants’ data and stops double spending, which is not taken into account by many existing methods."
A dual-functional cuprum coordination framework for high proton conduction and electrochemical dopamine detection,"The present study selected 5, 5′-((6-(ethylamino)-1, 3, 5-triazine-2, 4-diyl) bis(azanediyl))diisophthalic acid (H4EATDIA) as ligand and an amino-functionalized cuprum-based MOF (EA-JUC-1000), successfully synthesized by microwave-assisted method, for proton conduction and dopamine sensing applications. In order to enhance the proton-conducting potential of EA-JUC-1000, the Brönsted acid (BA) encapsulated composites (BA@EA-JUC-1000) are dopped into chitosan (CS) to form a series of hybrid membranes (BA@EA-JUC-1000/CS). The impedance results display that the best proton conductivity of CF3SO3H@EA-JUC-1000/CS-8% reaches up to 1.23 × 10–3 S∙cm−1 at 338 K and ~ 98% RH, 2.6-fold than that of CS. Moreover, the EA-JUC-1000 is in-situ combined with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (rGO/EA-JUC-1000), which makes EA-JUC-1000 have a wide detection range (0.1 ~ 500 μM) and a low limit of detection (50 nM), together with good anti-interference performance, reproducibility and repeatability. In addition, the electrochemical sensing method has been successfully applied to detect DA in bovine serum samples. The dual-functional MOF-based hybrid membrane and composites including proton conduction and DA sensing would provide an example of practical application for MOFs."
"Characterization of soluble fibro-protein extract from Tunisian date seeds ""Deglet Nour"" by targeted and untargeted techniques","The present study aims to characterize Tunisian date seeds ""Deglet Nour"" and to determine the functional properties of the fibro-protein fraction obtained by simple water extraction. Date seed powder contains 10.61  g/100g water, 5.00 g/100g protein, 1.48 g/100g ash, 5.39 g/100g fat and 77.50 g/100g carbohydrate. The fibro-protein extract was prepared from defatted date seed powder by isoelectric precipitation at pH 4.5. The extract contained 18 g/100g of proteins with a yield of 18.58%. The oil retention capacity and water retention capacity were 3.23 g/ml and 3.04 g/ml, respectively. The emulsion capacity was significantly higher at pH 10 (174.04 m2/g) than at pH 7 (149.30 m2/g) and pH 4 (143.13 m2/g); however, a more stable emulsion over time was observed at pH 7. Protein solubility was improved with increasing pH from 4 to 7 and 10. The Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) showed the presence of proteins at 1300–1400 cm−1, 1615–1652 cm−1 (Amide I), 1557–1437 cm−1 (Amide II) and 1212–1340 cm−1 (Amide III) and fibers (771 cm−1, 820 cm−1, 1066 cm−1 and 1110 cm−1). Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed changes in the shape of spectra according to pH values. The obtained results showed that the fibro-protein extract of date seeds ""Deglet Nour"" presents good techno-functional properties and could be of interest as a natural additive for food applications."
Do Parents Have “The Talk” or Believe They Should?: Parent–Child Conversations About Interacting with the Police,"Parent–child conversations about how to interact with the police are colloquially known as “The Talk.” Studies have largely focused on the influence of age, race, and gender on the occurrence of such conversations. We extended this examination to other potentially influential factors as well as beliefs about whether parents should have “The Talk.” Parents of 5 to 17 year olds (N = 1131) completed questionnaires to assess the influence of demographics, child factors, and parent factors, on whether parents have talked to their child about how to interact with the police, and whether they believe parents should have such conversations. Though most parents believed parents should have “The Talk,” only half of parents had “The Talk” (around age 7). Binary logistic regressions revealed that whereas parental factors (anxiety, perceived discrimination) reduced beliefs that parents should have such conversations, child factors (affective reactivity) influenced whether parents had “The Talk.” Also, with greater perceived police bias and legitimacy, parents were more likely to have “The Talk” and believed parents should. Given that not all parents are having “The Talk” or believe parents should, we conclude that parents might need help in learning how to talk to their children about how to interact with the police."
Highly thermoconductive and mechanically robust boron nitride/aramid composite dielectric films from non-covalent interfacial engineering,"Two-dimensional (2D) boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS), with exceptional thermoconductive properties and wide band gap, hold a great promise as candidate fillers for the preparation of the functional dielectric composites. However, the unsatisfactory dispersity in solvents and poor interfacial compatibility with the polymer matrix are still a great baffle for its practical applications. In the present study, we show that non-covalent functionalization of BNNS via polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is a facile approach to optimizing their surface characteristics and facilitating the preparation of hybrid composites. The PVP functionalized BNNS (BNNS@PVP) can be dispersed stably in the aqueous solution for over 2 weeks. Composite films with ultrahigh thermal conductivity (~ 14.5 W m−1 K−1) are achieved solely by mixing with BNNS@PVP and one-dimensional (1D) aramid nanofibers (ANFs). Additionally, strong interfacial interactions are constructed between BNNS@PVP and ANFs, which further enables efficient stress transfer and charge dissipation through the 1D/2D configuration, contributing to outstanding tensile strength (~ 184 MPa) and high electric breakdown strength (~ 274 kV mm−1) for composite films. All these results demonstrate that surface modification of BNNS is a powerful tool for developing functional materials with multipurpose applications, including thermal management and high-voltage insulation."
The effects of an exercise program on inflammation in adults who differ according to obstructive sleep apnea severity,"Exercise improves chronic inflammation and is recommended as a first-line medical or behavioral treatment for OSA with obesity. We examined whether the effects of an exercise program on inflammatory blood markers differed according to severity of OSA among obese adults. Overweight (BMI > 27 kg/m2) adults were evaluated for OSA using overnight polysomnography and subsequently classified as exhibiting no-to-mild OSA (AHI < 15 events/hour) or moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI ≥ 15 events/hour). Cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition assessed by DXA, fasting metabolic parameters and adipokines (i.e., glucose, insulin, leptin and adioponectin), and multiple markers of inflammation (i.e., CRP, IL-4, IL-8 and TNF-α) were measured at baseline (Pre) and following a 6-week (3 days per week) comprehensive exercise program (Post). Ten adults (Age: 48 ± 8 years; W:6; M:4) with no/mild OSA and 12 adults (Age: 54 ± 8 years; W:5; M:7) with moderate/severe OSA completed all aspects of the trial. No significant differences in age, cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, fasting metabolic parameters and most inflammatory markers were observed between groups at baseline. Exercise training decreased total fat mass (Pre: 41,167 ± 13,315 g; Post: 40,311 ± 12,657 g; p = 0.008), leptin (Pre: 26.7 ± 29.6 pg/ml; Post: 22.7 ± 19.4 pg/ml; p = 0.028) and adiponectin (Pre: 16.6 ± 10.9 µg/ml; Post: 11.0 ± 10.6 µg/ml; p = 0.004) in those with moderate/severe OSA. Among those with no/mild OSA, exercise training resulted in a decrease in total fat mass (Pre = 37,332 ± 20,258 g; Post: 37,068 ± 18,268 g, p = 0.037). These data suggest that while 6 weeks of exercise reduced adipokines in those with moderate-to-severe OSA, it was not sufficient to improve common markers of inflammation among overweight adults with OSA."
Novel phase adjournment data capturing technique for a mobile object in wireless sensor network,"In the modern era, the wireless sensor networks play a vital role in scientific and industrial applications. The enduring energy is a crucial metric parameter to be considered in the process of calculating the life span of the wireless sensor networks. Because each sensor node having non-renewable battery supply. In the first generation of wireless sensor applications, data has been transferred from each sensor node to the sink. Further evolution suggests a cluster head approach for transferring data from sensor field to sink. Different strategies of cluster head selection have provided better energy utilization. In the context of effective energy utilization, this work proposes an algorithmic technique called Phase Adjournment Data Capture Technique for a mobile object. In this technique, data will be captured by the mobile object based on its present traveling layer count. When a mobile object goes beyond the receiving limit, it will initiate the sleep mode flag to indicate the master node to stop transferring the data. This technique extends the improvement in energy consumption and also provides effective control of data flooding. It extends and eradicates the need for an erudite antenna essential for setting the direction of the data."
Large text document summarization based on an enhanced fuzzy logic approach,"In today’s digital world, there is an enormous and exponential growth in the amount of knowledge available online. When seeking precise and pertinent information, it is very difficult for users to find exactly what they are looking for. In this paper, we propose an extractive text summarization approach that utilizes fuzzy logic to determine the relevance and importance of sentences in a multi-document such as legal documents, news articles, business articles, etc. The presented multi-document summarization approach aims to achieve good content coverage and high data richness with less redundancy. The fuzzy logic model is utilized to present a new features approach to deal with inaccurate and unpredictable featured value. Additionally, our proposed work eliminates redundant data through cosine similarity and threshold values. Our proposed approach is evaluated based on DUC2006 dataset using ROUGE evaluation metrics, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating informative and quality summary. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with the existing fuzzy logic-based multi-document summarization (MDS) method and deep learning-based approach for text summarization (DLbTS). The experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms in comparison of MDS and DLbTS by 8.30%, 3.84%, and 5.98% in terms of \(ROUGE_1\) score under precision, recall, and F-score, respectively."
Adoption and impact of integrated agriculture aquaculture on income and productivity of smallholder fish farmers in Kenya,"This paper examines the impact of integrated agriculture aquaculture (IAA) adoption on productivity and net farm incomes among smallholder fish farming households in Kenya. To control for selection bias, the paper uses an endogenous switching regression model (ESR) on farm-level cross-sectional data from 427 randomly selected farmers from four counties of Kenya. Results show that the adoption of IAA reduces the volatility of net yields and the risk of crop failure while significantly improving farm productivity and farmer income. Other factors found to be associated with an increase in farm productivity and farmer incomes are access to credit, secure land ownership, farmer education, number of economically active members in a household, and farm enterprise diversification. The policy implication is that integrated agriculture aquaculture is a worthwhile agricultural innovation that should be promoted by the national and sub-national governments through, say, improving farmer access to tailored credit facilities, providing appropriate farmer education and training, and linking the farmers to providers of the requisite services and input. While deliberately targeting integrated agriculture aquaculture, the governments should also pay attention to other sector-wide productivity and farmer income-enhancing measures such as access to agricultural credit, security of land tenure, less labor-intensive technologies and agricultural diversification."
Application value of serum S100B combined with glucose metabolism indexes in predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes of patients with severe preeclampsia,"S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) and glucose control are reflective of maternal-fetal risks. We investigated the value of serum S100B combined with fasting blood glucose (FBG)/hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in evaluating the pregnancy outcomes of patients with severe preeclampsia (SPE). The clinical characteristics of SPE patients/controls were collected. FBG/HbA1c and serum S100B levels were measured, with their correlations analyzed. SPE patients were subdivided into adverse/non-adverse outcome groups based on follow-up results. The value of different indexes in predicting pregnancy outcomes was analyzed. SPE patients showed higher systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, urine protein, and body mass index and lower platelets, gestational age at delivery, and infant birth weight than healthy controls. FBG and HbA1c were positively correlated with serum S100B. SPE patients with adverse outcomes exhibited increased serum S100B and FBG/HbA1c levels. The area under the curve of serum S100B + FBG/HbA1c in evaluating adverse pregnancy outcomes of SPE patients was 0.8412 (77.05% sensitivity/84.21% specificity), higher than either alone. Serum S100B and FBG/HbA1c were independent risk factors for adverse outcomes of SPE patients. Overall, serum S100B positively-correlates with FBG/HbA1c in SPE patients. Serum S100B and FBG/HbA1c are independent risk factors, and their combination has high value on predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes of SPE patients."
Targeting serine/glycine metabolism improves radiotherapy response in non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is the most lethal cancer, and 85% of cases are classified as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Metabolic rewiring is a cancer hallmark that causes treatment resistance, and lacks insights into serine/glycine pathway adaptations upon radiotherapy."
"Quercetin Supplementation Alleviates Cadmium
            Induced Genotoxicity-Mediated Apoptosis in Caprine Testicular Cells","Being a common environmental pollutant, cadmium causes detrimental
                health effects, including testicular injury. Herein, we document the ameliorative
                potential of quercetin, a potent antioxidant, against cadmium-induced
                geno-cytotoxicity and steroidogenic toxicity in goat testicular tissue. Cadmium
                induced different comet types (Type 0 – Type 4), indicating the varying
                degree of DNA-damage in testicular cells. The quantitative analysis at 50 and 100
                µM cadmium concentration revealed the DNA damage with per cent tail DNA as
                75.78 ± 1.49 and 94.65 ± 0.95,
                respectively, in comparison to the control group (8.87 ± 0.48)
                post 8 h exposure duration. Cadmium caused a substantial decrease in the
                activity of key steroidogenic enzymes’ (3β-HSD and 17β-HSD)
                along with reduction of testosterone level in testicular tissue. Furthermore,
                cadmium treatment induced various types of deformities in sperm, altered the
                Bax/Bcl-2 expression ratio in testicular tissue and thus suggesting the
                apoptosis-mediated death of testicular cells. Simultaneous quercetin
                supplementation, however, significantly (p < 0.05) averted the
                aforementioned cadmium-mediated damage in testicular tissue. Conclusively, the
                cadmium-induced DNA-damage and decrease in steroidogenic potential results in death
                of testicular cells via apoptosis, which was significantly counteracted by quercetin
                co-supplementation, and thus preventing the cadmium-mediated cytotoxicity of
                testicular cells."
Against the Spell of Modern Knowledge: Education as Multiplicity or the Need for Focused Arbitrariness,"Calvino’s apology of multiplicity starts with the exposure, revealed by his take on typically modern novels, of some fundamental contradictions underlaying the modern quest for knowledge, which are definitely not alien to our day education. Then, when Calvino goes on to explore how twentieth century literature transcended those difficulties, he provides us with a valuable inspiration for how education could cope with its ambiguous relation to knowledge, still deeply rooted in the modern approach. Guided by Calvino’s readings, we are shown that literature can succeed in its epistemological (r)evolution. Meanwhile, education, as it seems, is still struggling to overcome its entanglement with the unreachable goal of teaching everything about everything, to cope with the infinity and complexity of that everything, making reflecting upon education’s epistemological stance in the twenty-first century very much a necessity, one that I will try to pursue in the following pages After a methodological introduction, the paper starts by placing Calvino’s examination of beautiful, yet unsuccessful literary attempts at an exhaustive account of the world in the context of education, to show how their unattainable ambitions are mirrored in pedagogical practice, pointing out to the “modern spirit” underlying both the aforementioned novels’ and contemporary education’s relation to knowledge. Then, with the help of J. Rancière’s take on education, I will try and make educational sense of Calvino’s account of Bouvard and Pécuchet failed quest to know everything there is to be known, and relate it to the particular model of knowledge at work in education, one that needs to be questioned. Finally, I will draw on Calvino’s praise of “the contemporary novel as (…) a method of knowledge” (SM, p. 105), and particularly on his analysis of Perec’s masterpiece La Vie mode d’emploi, and his rehabilitation of the idea of arbitrariness, to outline some reflections about how an educational multiplicity, where “everything is in everything” could come to life (Rancière, 1991, p. 26)."
The significance of musical educational interactive technologies for the development of performance and memory in preschool children: The role of pedagogical-parental relationships,"Music contributes to the expansion of the outlook, memory training, and the development of children’s creative abilities. The main objective of the work is to determine the effectiveness of music education for preschool children through the use of modern technologies aimed at the development of the memory of students, taking into account the relationship between parents and teachers. The study relied on the methods of analysis and comparison, which contributed to the development of approaches to teaching preschoolers. The learning mechanisms were based on the development of musical hearing, sense of rhythm, technical aspects, and speech clarity. To implement the training, GNU Solfege, MUSIQUEST, LOOPIMAL, and Penxy were used. The study determined the preschoolers’ performance in Experimental Group 1 (EG1) (with parental involvement) and Experimental Group 2 (EG2) (without parental involvement). The findings suggested that 46% of members in EG1 and 12% of members in EG2 obtained strong knowledge after three months of study. After six months, the number of students with proficient knowledge increased to 83% and 21%, respectively. The increase in performance is associated with the development of practical skills, memorization of information, and the narrow focus of the used online learning applications. It was found that the training influenced the development of long-term memory in preschoolers of EG1 (0.98) and the development of short-term memory in students of EG2 (0.97). The paper’s practical implications are attributed to identifying the need for the implementation of preschool music education and the use of modern online music technology."
Synergistic effect of carbon nanotube/graphene nanoplatelet hybrids on the elastic and viscoelastic properties of polymer nanocomposites: finite element micromechanical modeling,"A micromechanics procedure performed by the finite element method (FEM) was developed for the sake of examining the synergistic effects of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) hybrids on the elastic and viscoelastic properties of polymer nanocomposites. The representative volume element (RVE) approach was employed owing to its capability to consider various nano-additives with disparate dimensions and evaluate microstructure-level aspects. Constant-strain minimization method and linear viscoelastic model were utilized to predict components of elastic stiffness and creep compliance tensors. The validity of the proposed model was assessed by comparison with the well-established Halpin–Tsai micromechanical model and available experimental measurements, providing an acceptable agreement. Effects of orientation (random or unidirectional dispersion), volume content, and variation in the length and thickness of the carbonaceous nano-additives on the Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and creep compliance of CNT/GNP/epoxy nanocomposites were investigated. The results explicitly revealed that the CNT and GNP contributions to the mechanical reinforcement and the creep resistance in polymer are strongly associated with their distribution and volume content within the hosting matrix. Moreover, the outcomes imply that increasing the length of CNT, reducing the thickness of GNP lead to increasing Young’s modulus, and decreasing creep compliance (or increasing creep resistance) of CNT/GNP/epoxy nanocomposites."
Smooth hyperelastic potentials for 1D problems of bimodular materials,"A family of one parametric infinitely differentiable hyperelastic potentials for three-dimensional infinitesimal problems of bimodular isotropic materials is constructed, yielding a set of uniform approximations to the discontinuous stepwise elastic modulus adopted in the original one-dimensional bimodular formulation. The introduced potentials enable either analytical solutions or construction of the explicit governing equations for a number of static and dynamic problems. Theorem of convergence to the discontinuous bimodular modulus is proved."
Water Level Fluctuations Modulate the Microbiomes Involved in Biogeochemical Cycling in Floodplains,"Drastic changes in hydrological conditions within floodplain ecosystems create distinct microbial habitats. However, there remains a lack of exploration regarding the variations in microbial function potentials across the flooding and drought seasons. In this study, metagenomics and environmental analyses were employed in floodplains that experience hydrological variations across four seasons. Analysis of functional gene composition, encompassing nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur metabolisms, revealed apparent differences between the flooding and drought seasons. The primary environmental drivers identified were water level, overlying water depth, submergence time, and temperature. Specific modules, e.g., the hydrolysis of β-1,4-glucosidic bond, denitrification, and dissimilatory/assimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, exhibited higher relative abundance in summer compared to winter. It is suggested that cellulose degradation was potentially coupled with nitrate reduction during the flooding season. Phylogenomic analysis of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) unveiled that the Desulfobacterota lineage possessed abundant nitrogen metabolism genes supported by pathway reconstruction. Variation of relative abundance implied its environmental adaptability to both the wet and dry seasons. Furthermore, a novel order was found within Methylomirabilota, containing nitrogen reduction genes in the MAG. Overall, this study highlights the crucial role of hydrological factors in modulating microbial functional diversity and generating genomes with abundant nitrogen metabolism potentials."
Effects of Fusarium solani on the Growth and Development of Anoplophora glabripennis Larvae,"Anoplophora glabripennis (Asian longhorned beetle) is a wood-boring pest that can inhabit a wide range of healthy deciduous host trees in native and non-native habitats. Lignocellulose degradation plays a major role in the acquisition of nutrients during the growth and development of A. glabripennis larvae. In this study, the lignocellulose degradation capacity of Fusarium solani, a fungal symbiont of A. glabripennis, was investigated in fermentation culture and in four host tree species. The impact of F. solani on larval growth and survival parameters was assessed. Fermentation culture demonstrated continuous and stable production of lignocellulolytic enzymes over the cultivation period. Furthermore, F. solani was able to degrade host tree lignocellulose, as shown by decreased soluble sugar and cellulose contents and an increase in protein content. No significant differences in larval survival were observed in larvae fed with or without F. solani. However, weight and head capsule width were higher in larvae fed on F. solani, and gut lignocellulose activities were elevated in fed larvae. Our results indicate a role for F. solani in the predigestion of lignocellulose during the colonization and parasitic stages of A. glabripennis larval development, and also the F. solani an important symbiotic partner to A. glabripennis, lowering barriers to colonization and development in a range of habitats."
Inpatient Resource Utilization for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome from Birth Through Fontan,"Completing 3-stage palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome requires significant resources. An analysis of recent data has not been performed. We aimed to determine total charges necessary to complete all 3 stages of single-ventricle palliation, including interstage encounters. We also aimed to determine overall resource utilization, including hospital days, interstage admissions, and interstage procedures. We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the Pediatric Health Information System database between 2016 and 2021, including all patients who completed 3-stage palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. We identified 199 patients who underwent 3-stage palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome between 2016 and 2021. Median total adjusted charges (interquartile range, IQR) over the course of 3-stage palliation were $1,475,800 ($1,028,900–2,191,700). Median adjusted charges (IQR) for stage 1, 2, and 3 hospitalizations were $604,300 ($419,000–891,400), $234,000 ($164,300–370,800), and $256,260 ($178,300–345,900), respectively. Median hospital length of stay (IQR) for stages 1, 2, and 3 was 36 (26,53), 9 (6,17), and 10 (7,14) days, respectively. Pulmonary artery stenosis was the most common admitting diagnosis for interstage hospitalizations (3.4% of hospitalizations). Cardiac catheterization (24.1% of procedures) and feeding tube placement (10.0% of procedures) were the most common principal procedures during interstage hospitalizations. Total inpatient charges incurred throughout 3-stage palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome are substantial and have risen since prior studies. Gastrointestinal comorbidities and feeding optimization contribute considerably to this resource utilization."
Effects of Postural Resonance on Skin Sympathetic Nerve Activity and Blood Pressure: A Pilot Study Evaluating Vascular Tone Baroreflex Stimulation Through Biofeedback,"Heart rate and vascular tension baroreflex exhibit resonance characteristics at approximately 0.1 and 0.03 Hz. In this study, we aimed to induce postural resonance (PR) through rhythmic postural adjustments. To assess the viability of this technique, we investigated the acute impacts of postural resonance on blood pressure, sympathetic nerve activity, and mood. Fifteen healthy study participants, consisting of 8 males and 7 females, were selected for this self-controlled study. Skin sympathetic nerve activity was continuously monitored during both the intervention and stress test on the experimental day. After PR intervention, the diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure in the PR group exhibited significant reductions compared to the CON group (P = 0.032, CON = 71.67 ± 2.348, PR = 64.08 ± 2.35; P = 0.041, CON = 75.00 ± 2.17, PR = 81.67 ± 2.17). After PR intervention both left brachial ankle pulse wave velocity and right brachial ankle pulse wave velocity exhibited a significant reduction compared to pre-intervention levels (from 1115.86 ± 150.08 to 1048.43 ± 127.40 cm/s, p < 0.001; 1103.86 ± 144.35 to 1060.43 ± 121.35 cm/s, p = 0.018). PR intervention also led to a significant decrease in burst frequency and duration (P = 0.049; CON = 8.96 ± 1.17, PR = 5.51 ± 1.17) and a noteworthy decrease in burst amplitude and burst threshold during the cold-pressor test (P = 0.002; P = 0.002). Additionally, VAS scores exhibited a substantial increase following PR (P = 0.035, CON = 28.4 ± 4.49, PR = 42.17 ± 4.10). PR can induce resonance effects within the cardiovascular system, resulting in the effective reduction of blood pressure, skin sympathetic nerve activity and pulse wave velocity, and decreased burst amplitude and burst threshold of the sympathetic nerve during the cold-pressor test."
The horizontal gene transfer of perchlorate reduction genomic island in three bacteria from an ecological niche,"Three new strains of dissimilatory perchlorate-reducing bacteria (DPRB), QD19-16, QD1-5, and P3-1, were isolated from an active sludge. Phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA genes indicated that QD19-16, QD1-5, and P3-1 belonged to Brucella, Acidovorax, and Citrobacter, respectively, expanding the distribution of DPRB in the Proteobacteria. The three strains were gram-negative and facultative anaerobes with rod-shaped cells without flagella, which were 1.0–1.6 μm long and 0.5–0.6 μm wide. The three DPRB strains utilized similar broad spectrum of electron donors and acceptors and demonstrated a similar capability to reduce perchlorate within 6 days. The enzyme activity of perchlorate reductase in QD19-16 toward chlorate was higher than that toward perchlorate. The high sequence similarity of the perchlorate reductase operon and chlorite dismutase genes in the perchlorate reduction genomic islands (PRI) of the three strains implied that they were monophyletic origin from a common ancestral PRI. Two transposase genes (tnp1 and tnp2) were found in the PRIs of strain QD19-16 and QD1-5, but were absent in the strain P3-1 PRI. The presence of fragments of IR sequences in the P3-1 PRI suggested that P3-1 PRI had previously contained these two tnp genes. Therefore, it is plausible to suggest that a common ancestral PRI transferred across the strains Brucella sp. QD19-16, Acidovorax sp. QD1-5, and Citrobacter sp. P3-1 through horizontal gene transfer, facilitated by transposases. These results provided a direct evidence of horizontal gene transfer of PRI that could jump across phylogenetically unrelated bacteria through transposase."
Genes controlling hydrolysate toxin tolerance identified by QTL analysis of the natural Saccharomyces cerevisiae BCC39850,"Lignocellulosic material can be converted to valorized products such as fuels. Pretreatment is an essential step in conversion, which is needed to increase the digestibility of the raw material for microbial fermentation. However, pretreatment generates by-products (hydrolysate toxins) that are detrimental to microbial growth. In this study, natural Saccharomyces strains isolated from habitats in Thailand were screened for their tolerance to synthetic hydrolysate toxins (synHTs). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae natural strain BCC39850 (toxin-tolerant) was crossed with the laboratory strain CEN.PK2-1C (toxin-sensitive), and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed on the segregants using phenotypic scores of growth (OD600) and glucose consumption. VMS1, DET1, KCS1, MRH1, YOS9, SYO1, and YDR042C were identified from QTLs as candidate genes associated with the tolerance trait. CEN.PK2-1C knockouts of the VMS1, YOS9, KCS1, and MRH1 genes exhibited significantly greater hydrolysate toxin sensitivity to growth, whereas CEN.PK2-1C knock-ins with replacement of VMS1 and MRH1 genes from the BCC39850 alleles showed significant increased ethanol production titers compared with the CEN.PK2-1C parental strain in the presence of synHTs. The discovery of VMS1, YOS9, MRH1, and KCS1 genes associated with hydrolysate toxin tolerance in S. cerevisiae indicates the roles of the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation pathway, plasma membrane protein association, and the phosphatidylinositol signaling system in this trait."
Bacteriophage cocktail for biocontrol of soft rot disease caused by Pectobacterium species in Chinese cabbage,"Pectobacterium spp. are necrotrophic plant pathogens that cause the soft rot disease in Chinese cabbage, resulting in severe yield loss. The use of conventional antimicrobial agents, copper-based bactericides, and antibiotics has encountered several limitations, such as bioaccumulation on plants and microbial resistance. Bacteriophages (phages) are considered promising alternative antimicrobial agents against diverse phytopathogens. In this study, we isolated and characterized two virulent phages (phiPccP-2 and phiPccP-3) to develop a phage cocktail. Morphological and genomic analyses revealed that two phages belonged to the Tevenvirinae and Mccorquodalevirinae subfamilies, respectively. The phiPccP-2 and phiPccP-3 phages, which have a broad host range, were stable at various environmental conditions, such as various pHs and temperatures and exposure to ultraviolet light. The phage cocktail developed using these two lytic phages inhibited the emergence of phage-resistant bacteria compared to single-phage treatments in in vitro challenge assays. The phage cocktail treatment effectively prevented the development of soft rot symptom in matured Chinese cabbage leaves. Additionally, the phage cocktail comprising three phages (phiPccP-1, phiPccP-2, and phiPccP-3) showed superior biocontrol efficacy against the mixture of Pectobacterium strains in Chinese cabbage seedlings. These results suggest that developing phage cocktails is an effective approach for biocontrol of soft rot disease caused by Pectobacterium strains in crops compared to single-phage treatments."
ICT-related dynamic capabilities and SMEs’ performance: An analysis during the economic stagnation in Belarus,"Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are effective in helping firms adapt to unstable external conditions. Specifically, the development of smartphones, mobile apps, social media, and payment systems have enabled both well-developed corporations and small to medium-sized enterprises to improve their performance and competitiveness. The focus of researchers and managers has shifted from the availability and functionality of ICTs to how effectively they can be used. However, there is a lack of agreement on the definition of ICT-related capabilities. Therefore, this study investigates the relationship between SMEs’ ICT-related dynamic capabilities and their performance during economic stagnation. The study introduces unique constructs for ICT-related capabilities based on dynamic capability theory. The main results of the structural equation modeling procedure demonstrate that the capability to align business development with ICT implementation and CRM capabilities have a direct positive effect on SMEs’ performance. Additionally, the estimated results indicate that the speed of industry change affects all ICT-related dynamic capabilities."
Phage-antibiotic synergism against Salmonella typhi isolated from stool samples of typhoid patients,"Typhoid fever is a fatal disease in humans that is caused by Salmonella typhi. S. typhi infections need immediate antibiotic therapy, and their extensive use has led to multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. The use of bacteriophages is becoming a new way to treat these resistant bacteria. This research was directed to bacteriophage isolation against S. typhi and to determine phage-antibiotic synergism."
Accuracy of small area mortality prediction methods: evidence from Poland,"We investigate the forecasting accuracy of several simple methods for predicting mortality in small regional areas in Poland. We focus on methods that scale country-level forecasts appropriately and, therefore, can be used by official statistical agencies to improve population projections. We examine data from 379 sub-NUTS-3 districts in Poland for the period 2006–2019, divided into three subperiods. The first period is treated as the training sample and the latter two the testing subperiods. The mortality surface method delivers the most accurate forecasts of the mortality profiles whereas using the district-level standardized mortality rates (SMR) calculated for several broad age groups to scale the country-level mortality forecasts gives the best life expectancy at birth predictions. The latter approach is far better than using the NUTS-2-based standardized mortality rate (SMR), as practiced by the Polish statistical agency. For single age-groups predictions, the SMR-based methods deliver relatively accurate forecasts for young cohorts, but their forecasting accuracy deteriorates significantly with age."
Maize promoted the growth and volatile oil accumulation of Atractylodes lancea through rhizosphere VOCs,"Different species within a multi-ecosystem can enhance their growth, nutrient absorption, and accumulation of secondary metabolites. Atractylodes lancea (A. lancea) and maize intercropping enhance A. lancea yield and secondary metabolite content.Few study have, however, exploration the rhizosphere interaction of A. lancea and maize intercropping."
"Saccade Induced Retrieval Enhancement, Handedness & the Retrieval of Central & Peripheral Details in Eyewitness Memory","Two experiments are presented that investigated the effects of horizontal saccadic eye movements and handedness on eyewitness memory for central and peripheral information. In both experiments, participants viewed a short video depicting a bank robbery and episodic memory was tested after a short delay. Experiment 1 used recognition memory and found an interaction between eye movement, handedness and type of information recalled. This indicated that eye movements enhanced memory to a greater extent for peripheral information for individuals classified as consistently handed. Experiment 2 used free-recall and found eye movement enhancement effects of similar magnitude for central and peripheral items. A similar pattern of eye movement effects was observed for both consistent and inconsistent-handed individuals. Inconsistent handers also had superior memory overall. The results are discussed in terms of theoretical accounts of eye movement effects and implications for the enhancement of eyewitness memory."
"In Vitro Maturation, In Vitro Oogenesis, and Ovarian Longevity","This paper will review a remarkable new approach to in vitro maturation “IVM” of oocytes from ovarian tissue, based on our results with in vitro oogenesis from somatic cells. As an aside benefit we also have derived a better understanding of ovarian longevity from ovary transplant. We have found that primordial follicle recruitment is triggered by tissue pressure gradients. Increased pressure holds the follicle in meiotic arrest and prevents recruitment. Therefore recruitment occurs first in the least dense inner tissue of the cortico-medullary junction. Many oocytes can be obtained from human ovarian tissue and mature to metaphase 2 in vitro with no need for ovarian stimulation. Ovarian stimulation may only be necessary for removing the oocyte from the ovary, but this can also be accomplished by simple dissection at the time of ovary tissue cryopreservation. By using surgical dissection of the removed ovary, rather than a needle stick, we can obtain many oocytes from very small follicles not visible with ultrasound. A clearer understanding of ovarian function has come from in vitro oogenesis experiments, and that explains why IVM has now become so simple and robust. Tissue pressure (and just a few “core genes” in the mouse) direct primordial follicle recruitment and development to mature oocyte, and therefore also control ovarian longevity. There are three distinct phases to oocyte development both in vitro and in vivo: in vitro differentiation “IVD” which is not gonadotropin sensitive (the longest phase), in vitro gonadotropin sensitivity “IVG” which is the phase of gonadotropin stimulation to prepare for meiotic competence, and IVM to metaphase II. On any given day 35% of GVs in ovarian tissue have already undergone “IVD” and “IVG” in vivo, and therefore are ready for IVM."
Deep Bi-LSTM with Binary Harris Hawkes Algorithm-Based Heart Risk Level Prediction,"Heart disease has seriously threatened people's health in recent decades due to its prevalence and high mortality rate. Detecting heart disease through clinical features is a major challenge in today’s world. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are technological innovations now being effectively used in healthcare, disease prediction, and biomedical care. This paper proposes a model RL-DLBH for identifying the Risk Levels (RL), to select the best features using BHHO(BH) and a deep learning model based on a Deep bi-LSTM (DL) classifier for detecting heart diseases and determining their risk level. The method was created by first choosing the most important attributes from the dataset by using BHHO to determine whether the patient has heart disease and the level of heart disease risk in patients based on their clinical report, and then using a deep Bi-LSTM model as a classifier. The characteristics of heart disease are defined by the main risk factors. ST depression, the highest heart rate, cholesterol, and chest pain are all factors to consider. Class labels were assigned to the following risk levels: risk level 1, risk level 2, and risk level 3. Three distinct datasets namely Cleveland, Hungarian, and CH (Cleveland and Hungarian) are used in this work. The experimental results show that BHHO with Deep bi-LSTM performs well with a classification accuracy of 98.12% compared with the existing models."
Fuzzy conceptualization of the search queries,"Deciding the context of the search query based on its representation over a concept network using fuzzy methods provides a better thrust to the overall search process. The existing context based search diversification methods emphasize the importance of the numerical representation of the query over a data repository and derive a query peace which is conceptually measured. The search operation can use these semantically meaningful segments as a confident segment in the conceptual network. The proposed Fuzzy Conceptual Search Model (FCM) derives a query string which is contextually measured by means of valid segmentation, Pairwise Type Detection and concept labeling on its Concept Network. The approach measures the semantic coherence among segments in the search query and prepares a valid query piece. The Maximal Clique Cycle Count (MCCC) algorithm is used in valid segmentation process. The novel randomized MCCC algorithm improved the quality of query segmentation process and considered shared segments and conceptual ring count to improvise the efficiency of the search. The segmented query paths are processed with proper instances to pinpoint the context of the search at an earlier phase. The instance ambiguity is removed by conducting a threshold pair wise modeling of typed terms followed by a weighted voting approach called Concept labeling. The proposed FCM shows good results in terms of precision for both query and tweet data sets with varying impact lexical feature indication values."
Exploring the potential of hydrogen sulfide in acquisition of aluminium stress tolerance in cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gasotransmitter, has numerous roles in mitigation of stress in plants. Aluminium (Al) is found in acidic soil where it affects crop yields and their beneficial companion cyanobacteria. In the recent years, the fate of H2S in modulation of metal stress in plants has increasingly been reported, however, its role in cyanobacteria remains elusive. The present study pointed that excessive Al accumulation adversely affects the growth of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 by declining pigments contents, rate of photosynthesis (oxygen evolution and PS II photochemistry), the level of antioxidants (non-enzymatic) and exopolysaccharides (EPS) secretion. Accumulation of Al in cells resulted in enhanced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS: O2•− and H2O2) inside the cell, resulting severe cellular damage (MDA accumulation) despite of enhanced activities of enzymatic antioxidants. Exogenous hydrogen sulfide (NaHS, a donor of H2S) significantly reversed the negative effects of Al on the growth and growth promoting processes in the test organism by significantly lowering the accumulation of Al and oxidative stress biomarkers (O2•−, H2O2 and MDA) in cells. Reverse to this, the addition of hypotaurin (HT, a H2S scavenger) as well as DL- propargylglycine (PAG, an inhibitor of H2S generating enzyme L-cysteine desulfhydrase) the cells showed excessive accumulation of Al hence resulted enhanced oxidative biomarkers following considerable decline in antioxidant system. Furthermore, H2S depletion in cells caused considerable decline in EPS secretion which could be correlated with the increased accumulation of Al. Therefore, overall results pinpoint towards the role of endogenous H2S in alleviating the Al toxicity in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120."
A review about synergistic effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in combination with motor imagery (MI)-based brain computer interface (BCI) on post-stroke rehabilitation,"The purpose of this study is to determine if the application of combined forms of tDCS and BCIs based on motor imagery (MI) through electroencephalography (EEG) can synergistically enhance the process of rehabilitation in stroke survivors. Additionally, a discussion is conducted about the issues of BCI maladaptation, as well as the lack of use of BCIs in post-stroke rehabilitation processes, concluding about the importance of using tDCS as a solution for this issue. Finally, we propose two different stroke rehabilitation protocols using cerebro-cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) and transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) in combination with the MI-based BCI."
"Isolation, characterization of Weissella confusa and Lactococcus lactis from different milk sources and determination of probiotic features","This study aimed to investigate the probiotic properties of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) isolates derived from various milk sources. These isolates identified based on their morphological characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Four strains of Lactococcus lactis and two strains of Weissella confusa were identified with over 96% 16S rRNA gene similarity according to the NCBI-BLAST results. The survival of the isolates was determined in low pH, pepsin, bile salts, and pancreatin, and their adhesion ability was assessed by in vitro cell adhesion assay, hydrophobicity, auto- and co-aggregation, and safety criteria were determined by hemolytic, gelatinase activities, and DNAse production ability tests. The results showed that the LAB isolates had different levels of resistance to various stress factors. L. lactis subsp. cremoris MH31 showed the highest resistance to bile salt, while the highest pH resistance was observed in L. lactis MH31 at pH 3.0. All the isolates survived in pepsin exposure at pH 3.0 for 3 h. The auto-aggregation test results showed that all strains exhibited auto-aggregation ranging from 84.9 to 91.4%. Co-aggregation percentage ranged from 19 – 54% and 17 – 57% against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, respectively. The hydrophobicity capacity of the LAB isolated ranged from 35–61%. These isolates showed different adhesion abilities to Caco-2 cells (81.5% to 92.6%). None of the isolates exhibited DNase, gelatinase and hemolytic activity (γ-hemolysis). All results indicate that these LAB strains have the potential to be used as probiotics."
Weakly negative permittivity: metal–organic frameworks derived cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated by positive-hexagon-shaped carbon nanosheets,"Epsilon-negative metamaterials (ENMs) have gained significant attention due to their promising applications in various fields, such as microwave absorption or shielding, radio transmission, and solar energy harvesting. However, for metal-based ENMs, negative permittivity is usually huge accompanied by high frequency dispersion behavior, which is difficult to achieve impedance matching and performance improvement. In this work, Co nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated into positive-hexagon-shaped carbon nanosheets that were covered by carbon nanotubes (Co@PHCNTs) were synthesized by carbonizing the zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF), and negative permittivity with weak value and low-frequency dispersion simultaneously was achieved for the first time in metal-based ENMs by fabricating polyurethane/Co@PHCNT metamaterials. The carbon nanosheets with two-dimensional structure were beneficial to form interconnected networks in the metamaterials, and carbon nanosheets were able to reduce electron concentration of Co NPs, resulting in weakly negative permittivity value. Besides, the generation of CNTs on surfaces from carbon nanosheets greatly facilitated electron transport and improved electron mobility, leading to low-frequency dispersion behavior."
Video-based coaching for surgical residents: what’s missing from current coaching models?,"Video-based coaching is an emerging instructional technique which has been shown to accelerate technical skill development in surgical residents. Existing coaching frameworks and training programs have been targeted toward peer coaching for surgeons in practice, rather than toward trainees. The goal of this study was to determine whether the style and content of resident coaching sessions differ from current coaching frameworks."
On the use of viscous micropumps for the transport of thixotropic fluids,"A cylinder rotating in an off-center position across a microchannel is known to generate a net flow for highly viscous Newtonian fluids. The mechanism is also known to be a viable option for the transport of viscoelastic or viscoplastic fluids albeit with a slight drop in performance. In the present work, the applicability of this mechanism is numerically investigated for the transport of (inelastic) time-dependent fluids obeying the structural-based Quemada model. By numerically solving the equations of motion, it is predicted that viscous micropumps can be used for the transport of thixotropic fluids although the obtained numerical results suggest that there exists a critical thixotropy number (a dimensionless number related to the fluid’s natural time) at which the flow rate is at its lowest value. It is shown that the critical thixotropy number can be avoided from the response of the fluid by properly choosing the geometrical parameters of the device. The general conclusion is that viscous micropumps can be deemed as an efficient mechanism for the transport of thixotropic fluids in microfluidic systems provided that the thixotropy number is sufficiently small, i.e., the fluid is strongly thixotropic. The device is predicted to be more suitable for anti-thixotropic fluids."
"Prevalence of Occupational Voice Disorder Among Teachers of Kathmandu District, Nepal","The objective of this research was to identify the prevalence of voice disorders among teachers in the Kathmandu District of Nepal, with an emphasis on identifying possible risk factors that may be associated with these disorders. A cross-sectional study design was used, with both quantitative and qualitative data-gathering techniques using a mixed-methods approach. Data were collected from 95 non-teachers and 194 participating teachers from different schools in Kathmandu Valley. The analysis covered self-reported voice problem prevalence, job details, and demographic data. We examined the relationships between several variables and voice issues, including gender, class size, length of instruction, and tobacco usage. Findings: Compared with nonteachers (33.7%), teachers had a considerably greater prevalence of voice issues (69.1%). Greater class size and more than ten years of teaching experience were shown to be risk factors, while female instructors reported a greater prevalence of voice issues. Additionally, it was shown that instructors’ voice issues are also linked to tobacco usage. The results of this study highlight how critical it is to provide voice therapy to educators employed in the Kathmandu District, particularly those in at-risk categories such as female instructors, more experienced educators, and educators with larger class sizes. The outcomes demonstrated important impacts on teacher well-being, job satisfaction, and academic achievement. More research and intervention strategies are needed to minimize the effects of voice problems and promote a positive teaching and learning environment."
Evading Law Enforcement in the Americas: Latin American women in organized crime,"This article presents the preliminary results of a qualitative exploratory study conducted between 2021 and 2023. This study was based on in-depth interviews with law enforcement agents and experts in gender and security, and document analysis. Using examples from Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, we aimed to analyze how stereotypes can shape gender bias, particularly regarding how women in middle and high-ranking positions in organized crime in the Americas outmaneuver law enforcement. We argue that women stereotypes, and gender bias may influence the capability of law enforcement agencies to prosecute and condemn Latin American women in middle and high-ranking positions in criminal organizations. Gender bias favors women, particularly in their perpetrators’ role, and has become a source of power, showing that Latin American women have agency, and act strategically within criminal organizations, since they are potentially less suspicious in the eyes of law enforcement agencies. This research contributes to shedding light on the currently existing blind spot on the role of Latin American women in organized crime in the Americas, and has policy implications. It is useful in fostering the implementation of state policies capable of including non-stereotypical women's role in organized crime."
Effects of Mannosylerythritol-Lipids-B on Cutibacterium acnes ATCC 6919,"Mannosylerythritol-lipids-B (MEL-B) are microbial-produced glycolipids with skincare properties, notably moisturizing, antimelanogenic, antimicrobial, and antiaging. Thus, there is a potential use of MEL-B in a formulation for treating acne-prone skin. This study investigated the antimicrobial effect of MEL-B against the Gram-positive bacteria Cutibacterium acnes. The broth macro dilution method was used to evaluate the growth of C. acnes (3–4 CFU/mL), in the absence (positive control) or presence of MEL-B (128, 192, 256, and 512 μg/mL). Additionally, the leakage of genetic materials was used to determine the potential drug-induced membrane disruption of glycolipids. The amount of DNA and RNA release was quantified spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. Macro dilution technique and membrane integrity experiments showed that MEL-B does not have antimicrobial activity against C. acnes. Indeed, MEL-B assisted C. acnes growth. Ultimately, MEL-B has been reported as a remarkably active compound for skincare formulations; however, preliminarily, it should be avoided for acneic skin."
"The Effects on Corporate Reputation of Corporate Social Irresponsibility, Philanthropy, and Customer Value Orientation","This study aimed to investigate whether philanthropy and customer-related corporate social irresponsibility influence the development of compliance, policies and rules, corporate image, and, indirectly, corporate reputation. We also aimed to verify whether the strategic orientation toward customer value influences compliance, image, and reputation. We proposed a structural model based on the literature, and a survey was carried out with 344 employees of large private companies using a questionnaire. We analyzed the data through structural equation modeling, with estimation by partial least squares. The results demonstrated that if a company invests in philanthropy and avoids cases of customer-related corporate social irresponsibility, it can stimulate the development of compliance. The adoption of compliance, combined with philanthropy, has the potential to impact the company’s image directly and reputation indirectly. We also observed that customer value orientation tends to be reflected in compliance, image, and reputation. In this way, we concluded that investing in philanthropy, avoiding irresponsible acts, and guiding the company to propose value to customers can increase the reputation of a large company."
Non-centro symmetric organic single crystal with NLO activity assembled by hydrogen bonding: 2-amino-6-methoxy benzothiazoleium picrate dimethyl sulphoxide solvate,"New organic NLO material, 2-amino-6-methoxy benzothiazolium picrate dimethyl sulphoxide (ABTPA) molecular salt crystal was prepared and grown as single crystals. X-ray crystal structure determination shows that it has been crystallized into a non-centrosymmetric P21 space group of monoclinic system. The crystal structure as well as electronic spectral studies indicates the existence of charge transfer interactions. UV–Vis-DRS spectrum displayed almost 70% transparency in the visible window having lower cut-off 455 nm. The emission bands at 447 and 469 nm indicate the existence of violet and blue emissions in the photoluminescence emission spectrum. The existence of various functional groups was identified by vibrational spectroscopy. Crystal packing analysis illustrates the existence of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties. SHG efficiency of the powder was determined with the use of Kurtz-Perry powder method. Moreover, DFT calculations have been carried out to examine molecular structures. In addition to comparing the optimized molecular geometry to experimental coordinates, UV–Visible spectra that were simulated were viewed as in good concurrence with the experiments. The NLO response properties were also assessed through estimation of molecular first and second hyperpolarizabilities. The density of states calculations was performed by projecting partial densities onto individual fragments. The 3-D plots of FMO and MEP diagrams indicated an intra and intermolecular charge transfer character in our entitled molecules. The optical and NLO potential of our entitled compound is demonstrated by the application of combined experimental and computational methods."
Maritime turbulence effect on the axis light intensity of a Bessel higher-order cosh-Gaussian laser beam,"In this study, the axial propagation properties of the Bessel higher-cosh-Gaussian (BHChG) beam in maritime atmospheric turbulence are reported. Based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel principal, we extracted the analytical expression of the BHChG beam spreading in the considered medium. Additionally, under suitable conditions various particular cases of the axial intensity of the BHChG beam have been derived from the derived result. The numerical results show that when the on-axis intensity of the BHChG beam reaches a particular limit value at a certain propagation distance zmax, the beam loses its dark central spot and returns to its original hollow shape. For small constant strength turbulence, low value of the initial beam waist size, large Bessel order, small value the parameter associated with the cosh function and weak parameter. The study also highlights specific cases of the considered beam, providing valuable insights for information coding and transmission applications. The outputs of this study have potential applications in laser designators, optical communication systems and remote sensing."
Investigation of the optical solitons for the Lakshmanan–Porsezian–Daniel equation having parabolic law,"This paper investigates the optical soliton solutions of the Lakshmanan–Porsezian–Daniel equation, a nonlinear evolution equation modeling the propagation of optical soliton waves in materials influenced by parabolic law nonlinearity and spatio-temporal dispersion. Employing both the Kudryashov and new Kudryashov methods, the study captures various soliton waves, deriving both dark and bright soliton solutions. The research delves into the effects of the model parameters on these solutions, presenting the findings through detailed 3D and 2D simulation images. Practical and rapid results achieved using both Kudryashov methods are highlighted, positioning this work as a valuable reference for peers. The study’s distinct combination of the Lakshmanan–Porsezian–Daniel equation and the chosen analytical techniques not only introduces novelty but also emphasizes practicality and efficiency. This innovative approach, coupled with its significant contribution to the knowledge base, underscores the research’s relevance in the field."
Exploring the physical properties of Co2MnSi full Heusler alloy: a first principles study,"Half-metallic ferromagnetic Heusler alloys attracted much attention in the last few decades due to their significant physical properties as well as its potential applications in spintronic devices. To explore and predict the various physical properties of Co-based Heusler alloy, Co2MnSi (CMS), First principles calculations are of interest and has been used in the present study. Optimized E–V curves represent that CMS alloy is most stable in its magnetic L21 structural phase. The electronic charge density plot represents the ionic bonding along with co-valent character for the compound. DOS and BS calculations shows 100% spin polarization at Fermi level (EF) which confirms the half metallic character of the compound. DOS exhibited the prominent role of Co-3d and Mn-3d electronic states along with Si-2p electronic states. Estimated magnetic moment of Co2MnSi Heusler alloy was found to be ~ 5μB per f. u. which is in line with the Slater-Pauling behaviour. Dynamical stability of Co2MnSi Heusler alloy has also been verified by the phonon dispersion curves which revealed that compound is dynamically stable. Additionally, the physical properties have also been explored as a consequence of SOC and significant changes in electronic and optical properties were observed. The observed significant results of electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of CMS Heusler alloy makes it promising towards potential application in optical and spintronic devices."
Securing healthcare big data in industry 4.0: cryptography encryption with hybrid optimization algorithm for IoT applications,"In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has grown at an exponential rate, transforming the healthcare business and perhaps leading to the creation of healthcare big data. As a result, there is a requirement to safeguard data from being attacked in order to ensure secure data transfer through the network. Cryptography has been discovered to be a simple and efficient method for safeguarding healthcare big data. At the same time, in cryptography, the best key generation process is viewed as an optimization issue that may be addressed with meta-heuristic algorithms. As a result, the main focus of this research is on the investigation of health care data security in IoT using the ASS-JFO-DHEA model, which combines an innovative hybrid Artificial Shuffle Shepherd Integrated Jellyfish optimization (ASS-JFO) algorithm with Digital Homomorphism Elgamal Algorithm (DHEA) encryption for data security. MATLAB software is used to carry out the execution and experiments for this research. On different benchmark images from a healthcare dataset, the ASS-JFO-DHEA model is experimentally validated. The peak signal to noise ratio, root mean square error, encryption time, mean square error, and other metrics are used to assess the findings.The findings are compared and contrasted as a consequence of this execution, and a variety of encryption algorithms with their optimization techniques from the literature are recognized as having the most intense PSNR values, i.e., 74 dB, generated by the suggested approach."
Deformation and Energy Absorption Properties of Porous Metal-Concrete Interpenetrating Phase Composites Filled Thin-Walled Tubes,"A filled thin-walled tube is an excellent energy absorption device, and its performance is closely related to the filled core material. In this paper, a porous metal-high performance concrete interpenetrating phase composites (PMCIPC) filling core material is proposed, which takes porous nickel as the matrix and high-performance concrete as the reinforcing element, trying to improve the energy absorption of thin-walled tube. Axial quasi-static compression tests were carried out on empty tube, PMCIPC and filled tube. Based on the experimental results, the effects of wall thickness and aspect ratio on the deformation and energy absorption performance of the filled tube were studied by numerical simulation. The results show that the larger wall thickness increases the energy absorption of the empty tube and the filled tube. The PMCIPC filling further improves the energy absorption capacity, and for the empty tubes with smaller wall thickness, the PMCIPC significantly increases the crushing force efficiency. When the aspect ratio (L/D) is 3.7, the deformation mode of the filled tube is Euler instability, and the performance begins to decrease sharply. Finally, a theoretical model is established to predict the mean crushing force of the filled tubes. The model results are in good agreement with the experimental results. This study provides effective guidance for the design of thin-walled structures with high energy absorption efficiency."
Machine-learning based process monitoring for automated composites manufacturing,"Automated fibre placement (AFP) is an advanced robotic manufacturing technique which can overcome the challenges of traditional composite manufacturing. The interlaminar strength of AFP-manufactured composites depends on the in-situ thermal history during manufacturing. The thermal history is controlled by the choice of processing conditions and improper interfacial temperatures may result in insufficient bonding. Being able to better predict such maintenance issues in real-time is an important focus of smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0 to improve manufacturing operations. The data analysis of real-time temperature measurements during AFP composites manufacturing requires the temperature profiles from Finite Element Analysis (FEA) based simulations of the AFP process to better predict the quality of layup. However, the FEA simulations of the AFP process are computationally expensive. This study focuses on developing a digital tool enabling real-time process monitoring and predictive maintenance of the AFP process. The digital tool constitutes a machine learning-based surrogate model based on results from Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations of the AFP process to predict the in-situ thermal profile during AFP manufacturing. Multivariate Linear Regression, Multivariate Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based models are compared to conclude that ANN based surrogate model performs best by predicting the important parameters of thermal profiles with a mean absolute percentage error of 1.56% on additional test data and reducing the time by four orders of magnitude as compared to FEA simulations. The predicted thermal profile can be compared with the real-time in-situ temperatures during manufacturing to predict the quality of the layup. A GUI application is developed to provide predicted thermal profiles data for analysis in conjunction with real-time temperatures during manufacturing enabling monitoring and predictive maintenance of the AFP process and paving way for the development of a digital twin of the AFP composites manufacturing process."
Paradigm or Practice? Situating GIS in Contemporary Archaeological Method and Theory,"Geographic information systems (GIS) has been used in archaeology for four decades, and colloquially appears to have become a main tool in the geospatial aspects of archaeological practice. In this paper, we examine temporal trends in the use and/or mention of GIS in archaeological publications (books and journal articles), conference presentations, and websites. We gathered data through keyword searches and with formal sampling surveys and conducted both quantitative and qualitative analyses to characterize the changing nature and intensity of GIS use in archaeology over time, and then contextualize these trends with a narrative history of archaeological GIS. We show how archaeological GIS-use has grown from a few early adopters of the 1980s, through a slow initial integration phase in the 1990s, to a set of two major expansions in the 2000s and 2010s. While we find that applied use of GIS has grown to the point where it can be considered ubiquitous—if not completely universal—in the discipline, we also discovered that the major focus in archaeological GIS advancement is methodological rather than theoretical. We identify five roadblocks that we believe have hampered the development of a theory-rich archaeological GIS: (1) deficiencies in the archaeological GIS education model, (2) over-reliance on commercial software, (3) technical/technological barriers, (4) gaps in acceptance of GIS, and (5) the perception of GIS as “just a tool.” We offer initial suggestions for ways forward to mitigate the effects of these roadblocks and build a more robust, theoretically sophisticated relationship with GIS in archaeology."
Avoiding unnecessary biopsy: the combination of PRIMARY score with prostate-specific antigen density for prostate biopsy decision,Avoiding unnecessary biopsies for men with suspected prostate cancer remains a clinical priority. The recently proposed PRIMARY score improves diagnostic accuracy in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). The aim of this study was to determine the best strategy combining PRIMARY score or MRI reporting scores (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS]) with prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) for prostate biopsy decision making.
Prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms in taxi drivers: a cross-sectional web-based survey,Aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of LUTS in taxi drivers.
Study on the Combination of Multi-wavelength Calibration and Liquid Chromatography with UV–Vis Detector for the Determination of the Synthetic Dye Sunset Yellow FCF in Soft Drinks,"Calibration is a fundamental step in instrumental quantitative methods that produce an analytical signal proportional to the concentration of the analyte in the sample. Multi-wavelength calibration (MWC), a novel calibration strategy, has been proposed as a simple method for the determination of analytes in samples with complex matrices. It has minimal matrix effects and straightforward sample preparation. The objective of this work was to apply this calibration strategy to the determination of the synthetic dye Sunset Yellow in soft drinks by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet–visible analysis (HPLC/UV–Vis). Multi-wavelength calibration planning was performed as recommended in the literature. MWC results were statistically compared with conventional external calibration (limit of detection, limit of quantification, linearity, repeatability and recovery). The results obtained with both calibrations showed that the soft drinks complied with Brazilian legislation. The dye contents obtained with both calibration methods did not show significant statistical differences. MWC appears as an alternative or complement to external calibrations and ensures minimal matrix effects and straightforward sample preparation."
Dynamics of protein–lipid interactions in a three-variable reaction–diffusion model of myristoyl-electrostatic cycle in living cell,Protein–lipid interactions dynamics through a three-variable reaction–diffusion model in the living cell are explored. It is proven that the dynamics of such a system is governed by a two-dimensional cubic complex Ginzburg–Landau equation. Linear stability analysis is carried out through modulational instability. It appears that both rate constant of lipid association of unphosphorylated proteins and the diffusion coefficient of proteins on membrane impact the zone of instability and the amplitude of the growth rate. The \((G'/G)\)-expansion method is used to construct analytical spiral and periodic solutions. These structures are robust and propagate for large values of the diffusion coefficient of proteins on membrane during protein–lipid interactions.
Development of competitive and noncompetitive lateral flow immunoassays for pendimethalin using synthetic peptides,"Peptidomimetic and anti-immunocomplex peptides can be easily isolated from phage display libraries, and can be used as alternatives to chemical competing haptens to improve the sensitivity of small molecule immunoassay. In this work, 16 peptidomimetics and 7 anti-immunocomplex peptides of pendimethalin (PND) were obtained from cyclic 7-, 8-, 9-, and 10-residue peptide phage libraries. Peptidomimetic EJ-2 (CMFTGTDFPC) with the highest sensitivity in competitive phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunocomplex peptide EF-30 (CNPGWPPIPC) with the highest sensitivity in noncompetitive phage ELISA were selected to prepare phage-free peptides with GGGSSK-biotin at the C-terminus. Competitive and noncompetitive lateral flow immunoassays (CLFIA and NLFIA) were developed by using the phage-free peptides. After optimization, the CLFIA and NLFIA showed visual limit of detections (vLODs) of 5 ng/mL and 2.5 ng/mL, respectively, which were improved two- and fourfold compared with a LFIA based on chemical hapten. The NLFIA showed better sensitivity than CLFIA in the detection of spiked samples, and can meet the detection requirements for agro-products regulated by EU and China. The detection results of CLFIA and NLFIA for blind samples were consistent with that of ultra performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry."
Navigation in immersive virtual reality: a comparison of 1:1 walking to 1:1 wheeling,"In most virtual reality (VR) experiences, locomotion is not the primary objective. Yet how someone moves through a virtual environment (VE) has a profound impact on their experience. Extant research considers 1:1 walking, where the same movement a user makes in the real world is translated identically into movement in the virtual world, as the paragon of comfortable VR locomotion. However, this form of locomotion is not practical in most applications and remains inaccessible to non-ambulant persons using VR. In the current study, 1:1 walking was compared to 1:1 wheeling, whereby pushes made on a physical wheelchair translated directly into movement in the VE. User experience in 1:1 walking was compared to 1:1 wheeling through changes in self-reported positive and negative affect, simulator sickness, system usability, and presence. Participants’ ability to learn a complex VE in the two conditions was also assessed with a spatial updating task. These comparisons revealed no statistically significant differences. This finding challenges the prevailing assumption that 1:1 walking in VR is superior to all other locomotion techniques and serves as an appeal for VR developers to consider designing applications for a seated experience that is safe, comfortable, and accessible to a broader population of people with diverse needs."
The impact of gradual increase in moisture on the collapse of Brazilian clayey sand soil,"Soil collapse is a critical factor contributing to various pathologies in civil construction, necessitating the use of suction-controlled techniques, often unavailable in smaller cities in developing countries. This study investigated the collapsible behavior of clayey sand from Tuneiras do Oeste, Paraná, Brazil, using conventional one-dimensional tests with varied initial moisture contents and pre-soaking stresses. Tests maintained constant specimen moisture, soaked samples at pre-defined stress values (S tests), and observed collapse behavior under gradual wetting (GIM tests). Supplementary mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) analyses determined the collapse’s influence on pore size distribution. Collapse indexes were computed, and the Pereira and Fredlund (J Geotech Geoenviron Eng 126:907–916, 2000) model was applied to predict collapsible behavior for GIM tests data, showing strong agreement with experimental results (R2 > 0.98). Additionally, two prediction models developed from different test data also exhibited a high degree of correlation (R2 = 0.97 and 0.95 for S and GIM tests, respectively). It was observed that pre-soaking moisture, i.e., the pre-soaking matric suction, played a crucial role in wetting-induced soil collapse, while pre-soaking stress had a secondary effect. The infiltration rate during soaking impacted the observed collapse, with higher rates resulting in greater collapse magnitudes. Regarding soil structure, collapse led to significant alterations only in the macropores, causing a notable reduction in their diameters. Ultimately, the experimental protocol developed in this study yielded valid results for modeling collapsible soils, even in the absence of sophisticated suction-controlled equipment."
Associated factors with liver fibrosis in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with methotrexate,There are conflicting findings on the link between liver fibrosis and cumulative methotrexate dosages.
A simple way to integrate distributed storage into a wholesale electricity market,"Current plans to decarbonize the electric supply system imply that the generation from wind and solar sources will grow substantially. This growth will increase the uncertainty of system operations due to the inherent variability of these renewable sources, and as a result, more reserve capacity will be required to provide the ramping (flexibility) needed for reliable operations. This paper assumes that all of the increased uncertainty comes from wind farms on the grid, and it shows how distributed storage managed locally by aggregators can provide the ramping needed without introducing a separate market for flexibility. This can be accomplished when the aggregators minimize the expected daily cost of the energy purchased from the grid for their customers by submitting optimal bids into the wholesale market with high and low price thresholds for discharging and charging the storage. This model is illustrated using a stochastic multi-period security constrained optimal power flow together with realistic data for a reduction of the network in the Northeast Power Coordinating Council region of the United States. The results show that the bidding strategy for distributed storage provides ramping to the grid just as effectively as storage managed by a system operator."
Audit committee equity incentives and stock price crash risk,"This paper theoretically and empirically investigates whether and how audit committee (AC) equity incentives affect future stock price crash risk. Consistent with our model prediction that equity incentives for ACs contribute to reducing the skewness of return distributions, we document evidence of a negative relationship between AC equity incentives and expected crash risk for a merged sample of 6550 US-listed firms over the 2001–2018 period, even after controlling for a wide range of other firm characteristics, using alternative variable specifications, and addressing potential endogeneity concerns. On average, a one-standard-deviation increase in AC equity incentives is associated with a reduction of 14.09–15.46% in stock price crash risk. Further analysis shows that AC equity incentives affect crash risk through financial reporting quality, the negative relationship between AC equity incentives and future stock price crash risk is more pronounced for firms with weaker external governance and for firms with more financial expertise in the AC, and this negative relationship is mainly driven by option-based equity incentives. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the view that equity-based compensation is critical for inducing greater monitoring efforts from AC members and mitigating managerial incentives to withhold bad news."
A new Andrews–Crandall-type identity and the number of integer solutions to \(x^2+2y^2+2z^2=n\),"Using a higher-dimensional analog of an identity known to Kronecker, we discover a new Andrews–Crandall-type identity and use it to count the number of integer solutions to \(x^2+2y^2+2z^2=n\)."

Can cyclical food restriction support growth of juvenile Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in brackish water biofloc?,"The effects of cyclical feeding restriction (3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days of feeding per week) on the performance of juvenile Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in a biofloc technology system (BFT) were evaluated in this study for 77 days. Fifteen experimental units (400L) with temperature control (mean 28.2 °C) randomly distributed 1500 fish (0.42 ± 0.02 g). Fish were fed commercial feed (46.7 g of crude protein and 4475.5 kcal kg−1 of gross energy) up to satiation. Feeding cycles with different restrictions (p < 0.05) influenced animal growth but not survival and final density (p > 0.05), which remained around 94% and 235 fish.m−3, respectively. Juveniles fed 6 days a week showed 1.25 of feeding efficiency, while animals fed 3 days a week (more restricted) showed hyperphagia but did not exhibit compensatory growth. Changes in the morphology of hepatocytes (presence of vacuoles, displacement of the nucleus to the periphery, and fatty degeneration) were observed with an increase in feeding days, and a high degree of hepatic steatosis (p < 0.05). Water quality parameters remained within acceptable limits for the species and system operation. Feeding regimes influenced the characteristics of bioflocs (total suspended solids and porosity) and the abundance of microorganisms (p < 0.05). Nutritionally, less restricted diets (6 and 7 days of feeding per week) produced more protein (38.3 and 40.6% CP) and energy bioflocs (2252.8 and 2313 kcal.kg−1) (p < 0.05), while protein, lipid, and body energy were significantly lower (p < 0.05) with the more restricted diet. The composition of microorganisms was influenced by the feeding regimes (p < 0.05). Results demonstrated that the occurrence of total compensatory growth (6 days of feeding per week) represents an economic advantage with a reduction of 26.8% of feed and greater profitability in the unitary commercialization of tilapia juveniles."
Synergistic effect of carbon nanotube/graphene nanoplatelet hybrids on the elastic and viscoelastic properties of polymer nanocomposites: finite element micromechanical modeling,"A micromechanics procedure performed by the finite element method (FEM) was developed for the sake of examining the synergistic effects of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) hybrids on the elastic and viscoelastic properties of polymer nanocomposites. The representative volume element (RVE) approach was employed owing to its capability to consider various nano-additives with disparate dimensions and evaluate microstructure-level aspects. Constant-strain minimization method and linear viscoelastic model were utilized to predict components of elastic stiffness and creep compliance tensors. The validity of the proposed model was assessed by comparison with the well-established Halpin–Tsai micromechanical model and available experimental measurements, providing an acceptable agreement. Effects of orientation (random or unidirectional dispersion), volume content, and variation in the length and thickness of the carbonaceous nano-additives on the Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and creep compliance of CNT/GNP/epoxy nanocomposites were investigated. The results explicitly revealed that the CNT and GNP contributions to the mechanical reinforcement and the creep resistance in polymer are strongly associated with their distribution and volume content within the hosting matrix. Moreover, the outcomes imply that increasing the length of CNT, reducing the thickness of GNP lead to increasing Young’s modulus, and decreasing creep compliance (or increasing creep resistance) of CNT/GNP/epoxy nanocomposites."
Smooth hyperelastic potentials for 1D problems of bimodular materials,"A family of one parametric infinitely differentiable hyperelastic potentials for three-dimensional infinitesimal problems of bimodular isotropic materials is constructed, yielding a set of uniform approximations to the discontinuous stepwise elastic modulus adopted in the original one-dimensional bimodular formulation. The introduced potentials enable either analytical solutions or construction of the explicit governing equations for a number of static and dynamic problems. Theorem of convergence to the discontinuous bimodular modulus is proved."
Inpatient Resource Utilization for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome from Birth Through Fontan,"Completing 3-stage palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome requires significant resources. An analysis of recent data has not been performed. We aimed to determine total charges necessary to complete all 3 stages of single-ventricle palliation, including interstage encounters. We also aimed to determine overall resource utilization, including hospital days, interstage admissions, and interstage procedures. We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the Pediatric Health Information System database between 2016 and 2021, including all patients who completed 3-stage palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. We identified 199 patients who underwent 3-stage palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome between 2016 and 2021. Median total adjusted charges (interquartile range, IQR) over the course of 3-stage palliation were $1,475,800 ($1,028,900–2,191,700). Median adjusted charges (IQR) for stage 1, 2, and 3 hospitalizations were $604,300 ($419,000–891,400), $234,000 ($164,300–370,800), and $256,260 ($178,300–345,900), respectively. Median hospital length of stay (IQR) for stages 1, 2, and 3 was 36 (26,53), 9 (6,17), and 10 (7,14) days, respectively. Pulmonary artery stenosis was the most common admitting diagnosis for interstage hospitalizations (3.4% of hospitalizations). Cardiac catheterization (24.1% of procedures) and feeding tube placement (10.0% of procedures) were the most common principal procedures during interstage hospitalizations. Total inpatient charges incurred throughout 3-stage palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome are substantial and have risen since prior studies. Gastrointestinal comorbidities and feeding optimization contribute considerably to this resource utilization."
Bone tissue regeneration by 58S bioactive glass scaffolds containing exosome: an in vivo study,"Exosomes, the naturally secreted nanocarriers of cells, have recently been demonstrated to have therapeutic benefits in a variety of disease models where parent cells are not present. However, the use of exosomes in bone defect regeneration has been unusual, and little is documented about the underlying processes. In recent study we produced and characterized exosomes derived human endometrial mesenchymal stem stromal cells and 58S bioactive glass scaffolds; in following, in this research exosome loaded scaffolds synthetized and release of exosome, porosity and bioactivity of them were assessed. More over the effect of scaffolds on repair of critical-size bone defects in rat’s calvaria was evaluated by histological examination and micro computed tomography (µ CT). The findings confirmed that constructed porous scaffolds consistently release exosomes; additionally, in vivo findings including Hematoxilin & Eosin staining, Immunohistochemistry, Masson's trichrome, histomorphometric analysis, and µ CT clarified that our implant has osteogenic properties. We discovered that Exo-treated scaffolds might promote osteogenesis especially compared to pure scaffolds, indicating that produced scaffolds containing exosomes could be a potential replacement in bone tissue engineering."
"Investigation of Melt Pool Geometry, Cooling Rate, and Microstructure Formation in Laser Surfacing of Al 7075 Alloy: Numerical Simulation and Experimental Analysis","The study involves numerically simulating the influence of process parameters on melt pool geometry, cooling rate, and microstructure during laser surfacing of 7075 Al alloy using COMSOL Multiphysics. Both numerical simulations and experiments show that increasing scan speeds at a constant laser power reduces melt pool dimensions and increases cooling rates. At 1000 W laser power and 15 mm/s scan speed, numerically simulated melt pool width, depth, and cooling rate are 3.8 mm, 1 mm, and 1370 K/s, closely matching experimental measurements of 4.2 mm, 1.3 mm, and 1449 K/s. Calculated thermal gradient (G) and solidification rate (R) are correlated with observed solidification morphology. The G/R ratio derived from simulations has higher values at the melt pool's bottom, gradually decreasing toward the top for a given laser power and scan speed. This pattern aligns with optical micrographs showing equiaxed dendrites at the top, and columnar and cellular dendrites in the middle and bottom of the melt pool."
A T-shaped compact dual-band MIMO antenna system for 5G smartphone applications,"Multiband MIMO antenna system is very important in 5G mobile communication to meet the requirements of increasing data rate. However integrating multiple antennas in the limited space causes mutual coupling. The antenna configuration gets more intricate, if additional circuitry is installed to obtain greater isolation and hence, the occupied area on the board grows significantly, making the overall antenna design bulky. Hence, to provide dual band coverage, decent isolation and compact design, a compact MIMO antenna system is presented in this paper. The proposed system includes a T-shaped resonating structure that is employed on the side-frames to form a MIMO system with eight antennas. The T-shaped strip is designed to resonate at two frequencies and thereby covering two 5G bands (LTE 42/LTE 46). The proposed dual band MIMO system is fairly compact as the individual antennas are mounted on the \(150\times 3.6 {\text {mm}}^{2}\) side-frames of the smartphone. The isolation between antenna elements is 14 dB. This is accomplished without the need of a decoupling structure or a complex tuning process. The ergodic channel capacity realized by the suggested MIMO system in the operational bands is more than 41 b/s/Hz and ECC is less than 0.075. The impacts of the presence of plastic frame, display panel and phantom hand on the performance of proposed design are discussed. The proposed design provides compactness, dual band coverage and high isolation."
Estimating Soil Carbon Sequestration of Jatropha for Sustainable Aviation Fuel Pathway,"The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) raw material planting process will inevitably cause carbon emissions from induced land use change (ILUC). However, limited by the regional specificity of energy plants, the ILUC emissions value of SAF is less considerable in the case of soil carbon sequestration during the raw material planting process. Therefore, this study used the CENTURY model to predict the carbon sequestration of soil in Jatropha plantations and compared it with the preparation of aviation fuel from soybean oil. The results showed that, when considering ILUC combined with the carbon sequestration effect of the raw material planting land, life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of the two methods for producing Jatropha oil–based aviation kerosene (pathway 1: oil residue used for fertilizer or power generation; pathway 2: oil residue detoxified and used for animal feed) were −36.1 g CO2e/MJ and −59.4 g CO2e/MJ, respectively. The life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of soybean oil–based aviation kerosene under the condition of straw returning and without straw returning are 2.9 g CO2e/MJ and 66.1 g CO2e/MJ, respectively. Compared with petroleum aviation fuel, the emission reduction potential of Jatropha oil-based aviation kerosene increased from 84.38% and 110.56% to 140.6% and 166.7%, respectively, based on the original core life cycle assessment (cLCA)+ILUC, considering soil carbon sequestration. The emission reduction potential of soybean-based aviation kerosene increased from 42.81 to 96.7% (with straw returned to the field) and 25.7% (without straw returned to the field). The results show that Jatropha oil–based aviation kerosene has great potential in terms of negative carbon emissions when considering the carbon sequestration effect of soil in the energy plant planting area. In the future, large-scale planting on marginal land with a climate suitable for Jatropha growth will help the civil aviation industry reduce carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality."
Paradigm or Practice? Situating GIS in Contemporary Archaeological Method and Theory,"Geographic information systems (GIS) has been used in archaeology for four decades, and colloquially appears to have become a main tool in the geospatial aspects of archaeological practice. In this paper, we examine temporal trends in the use and/or mention of GIS in archaeological publications (books and journal articles), conference presentations, and websites. We gathered data through keyword searches and with formal sampling surveys and conducted both quantitative and qualitative analyses to characterize the changing nature and intensity of GIS use in archaeology over time, and then contextualize these trends with a narrative history of archaeological GIS. We show how archaeological GIS-use has grown from a few early adopters of the 1980s, through a slow initial integration phase in the 1990s, to a set of two major expansions in the 2000s and 2010s. While we find that applied use of GIS has grown to the point where it can be considered ubiquitous—if not completely universal—in the discipline, we also discovered that the major focus in archaeological GIS advancement is methodological rather than theoretical. We identify five roadblocks that we believe have hampered the development of a theory-rich archaeological GIS: (1) deficiencies in the archaeological GIS education model, (2) over-reliance on commercial software, (3) technical/technological barriers, (4) gaps in acceptance of GIS, and (5) the perception of GIS as “just a tool.” We offer initial suggestions for ways forward to mitigate the effects of these roadblocks and build a more robust, theoretically sophisticated relationship with GIS in archaeology."
"Isolation, characterization of Weissella confusa and Lactococcus lactis from different milk sources and determination of probiotic features","This study aimed to investigate the probiotic properties of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) isolates derived from various milk sources. These isolates identified based on their morphological characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Four strains of Lactococcus lactis and two strains of Weissella confusa were identified with over 96% 16S rRNA gene similarity according to the NCBI-BLAST results. The survival of the isolates was determined in low pH, pepsin, bile salts, and pancreatin, and their adhesion ability was assessed by in vitro cell adhesion assay, hydrophobicity, auto- and co-aggregation, and safety criteria were determined by hemolytic, gelatinase activities, and DNAse production ability tests. The results showed that the LAB isolates had different levels of resistance to various stress factors. L. lactis subsp. cremoris MH31 showed the highest resistance to bile salt, while the highest pH resistance was observed in L. lactis MH31 at pH 3.0. All the isolates survived in pepsin exposure at pH 3.0 for 3 h. The auto-aggregation test results showed that all strains exhibited auto-aggregation ranging from 84.9 to 91.4%. Co-aggregation percentage ranged from 19 – 54% and 17 – 57% against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, respectively. The hydrophobicity capacity of the LAB isolated ranged from 35–61%. These isolates showed different adhesion abilities to Caco-2 cells (81.5% to 92.6%). None of the isolates exhibited DNase, gelatinase and hemolytic activity (γ-hemolysis). All results indicate that these LAB strains have the potential to be used as probiotics."
Deep Bi-LSTM with Binary Harris Hawkes Algorithm-Based Heart Risk Level Prediction,"Heart disease has seriously threatened people's health in recent decades due to its prevalence and high mortality rate. Detecting heart disease through clinical features is a major challenge in today’s world. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are technological innovations now being effectively used in healthcare, disease prediction, and biomedical care. This paper proposes a model RL-DLBH for identifying the Risk Levels (RL), to select the best features using BHHO(BH) and a deep learning model based on a Deep bi-LSTM (DL) classifier for detecting heart diseases and determining their risk level. The method was created by first choosing the most important attributes from the dataset by using BHHO to determine whether the patient has heart disease and the level of heart disease risk in patients based on their clinical report, and then using a deep Bi-LSTM model as a classifier. The characteristics of heart disease are defined by the main risk factors. ST depression, the highest heart rate, cholesterol, and chest pain are all factors to consider. Class labels were assigned to the following risk levels: risk level 1, risk level 2, and risk level 3. Three distinct datasets namely Cleveland, Hungarian, and CH (Cleveland and Hungarian) are used in this work. The experimental results show that BHHO with Deep bi-LSTM performs well with a classification accuracy of 98.12% compared with the existing models."
"In Vitro Maturation, In Vitro Oogenesis, and Ovarian Longevity","This paper will review a remarkable new approach to in vitro maturation “IVM” of oocytes from ovarian tissue, based on our results with in vitro oogenesis from somatic cells. As an aside benefit we also have derived a better understanding of ovarian longevity from ovary transplant. We have found that primordial follicle recruitment is triggered by tissue pressure gradients. Increased pressure holds the follicle in meiotic arrest and prevents recruitment. Therefore recruitment occurs first in the least dense inner tissue of the cortico-medullary junction. Many oocytes can be obtained from human ovarian tissue and mature to metaphase 2 in vitro with no need for ovarian stimulation. Ovarian stimulation may only be necessary for removing the oocyte from the ovary, but this can also be accomplished by simple dissection at the time of ovary tissue cryopreservation. By using surgical dissection of the removed ovary, rather than a needle stick, we can obtain many oocytes from very small follicles not visible with ultrasound. A clearer understanding of ovarian function has come from in vitro oogenesis experiments, and that explains why IVM has now become so simple and robust. Tissue pressure (and just a few “core genes” in the mouse) direct primordial follicle recruitment and development to mature oocyte, and therefore also control ovarian longevity. There are three distinct phases to oocyte development both in vitro and in vivo: in vitro differentiation “IVD” which is not gonadotropin sensitive (the longest phase), in vitro gonadotropin sensitivity “IVG” which is the phase of gonadotropin stimulation to prepare for meiotic competence, and IVM to metaphase II. On any given day 35% of GVs in ovarian tissue have already undergone “IVD” and “IVG” in vivo, and therefore are ready for IVM."
Exploring the potential of hydrogen sulfide in acquisition of aluminium stress tolerance in cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gasotransmitter, has numerous roles in mitigation of stress in plants. Aluminium (Al) is found in acidic soil where it affects crop yields and their beneficial companion cyanobacteria. In the recent years, the fate of H2S in modulation of metal stress in plants has increasingly been reported, however, its role in cyanobacteria remains elusive. The present study pointed that excessive Al accumulation adversely affects the growth of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 by declining pigments contents, rate of photosynthesis (oxygen evolution and PS II photochemistry), the level of antioxidants (non-enzymatic) and exopolysaccharides (EPS) secretion. Accumulation of Al in cells resulted in enhanced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS: O2•− and H2O2) inside the cell, resulting severe cellular damage (MDA accumulation) despite of enhanced activities of enzymatic antioxidants. Exogenous hydrogen sulfide (NaHS, a donor of H2S) significantly reversed the negative effects of Al on the growth and growth promoting processes in the test organism by significantly lowering the accumulation of Al and oxidative stress biomarkers (O2•−, H2O2 and MDA) in cells. Reverse to this, the addition of hypotaurin (HT, a H2S scavenger) as well as DL- propargylglycine (PAG, an inhibitor of H2S generating enzyme L-cysteine desulfhydrase) the cells showed excessive accumulation of Al hence resulted enhanced oxidative biomarkers following considerable decline in antioxidant system. Furthermore, H2S depletion in cells caused considerable decline in EPS secretion which could be correlated with the increased accumulation of Al. Therefore, overall results pinpoint towards the role of endogenous H2S in alleviating the Al toxicity in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120."
A review about synergistic effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in combination with motor imagery (MI)-based brain computer interface (BCI) on post-stroke rehabilitation,"The purpose of this study is to determine if the application of combined forms of tDCS and BCIs based on motor imagery (MI) through electroencephalography (EEG) can synergistically enhance the process of rehabilitation in stroke survivors. Additionally, a discussion is conducted about the issues of BCI maladaptation, as well as the lack of use of BCIs in post-stroke rehabilitation processes, concluding about the importance of using tDCS as a solution for this issue. Finally, we propose two different stroke rehabilitation protocols using cerebro-cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) and transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) in combination with the MI-based BCI."
Weakly negative permittivity: metal–organic frameworks derived cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated by positive-hexagon-shaped carbon nanosheets,"Epsilon-negative metamaterials (ENMs) have gained significant attention due to their promising applications in various fields, such as microwave absorption or shielding, radio transmission, and solar energy harvesting. However, for metal-based ENMs, negative permittivity is usually huge accompanied by high frequency dispersion behavior, which is difficult to achieve impedance matching and performance improvement. In this work, Co nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated into positive-hexagon-shaped carbon nanosheets that were covered by carbon nanotubes (Co@PHCNTs) were synthesized by carbonizing the zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF), and negative permittivity with weak value and low-frequency dispersion simultaneously was achieved for the first time in metal-based ENMs by fabricating polyurethane/Co@PHCNT metamaterials. The carbon nanosheets with two-dimensional structure were beneficial to form interconnected networks in the metamaterials, and carbon nanosheets were able to reduce electron concentration of Co NPs, resulting in weakly negative permittivity value. Besides, the generation of CNTs on surfaces from carbon nanosheets greatly facilitated electron transport and improved electron mobility, leading to low-frequency dispersion behavior."
An algorithm for calculating the shade created by greenhouse integrated photovoltaics,"Integration of photovoltaic modules into greenhouse roofs is a novel and intriguing method. The cost of products grown in greenhouses is particularly high because of their high energy consumption for heating and cooling, and at the same time the increase in demand for available land, increasing its cost and creating spatial issues, the integration of photovoltaics on the roof of greenhouses is a highly viable solution. Simultaneously, the use of solar radiation is critical to maintain optimal crop development, while also being a renewable energy source. However, photovoltaics reduce the incoming solar radiation in the greenhouse, due to their shade. Shading can be either beneficial for the crops or not, depending on the crop type, thus it is vital to find the shading caused by photovoltaics both temporally and spatially. In this study, a model calculating the shading in a greenhouse due to roof-integrated photovoltaics is developed, based on the Sun position, the geometry of both the greenhouse and of the roof-integrated photovoltaics and their position on the greenhouse roof. Calculating the coefficient of variation of radiation data, for the shaded and unshaded areas using the proposed algorithm, it was found the coefficient of variation for the shaded areas is lower than that for the unshaded areas for a least 76% of the time. Also, the radiation values under the shaded area are more uniform. The proposed model is a tool for PV designers, operators, and owners, in order to optimize the potential of their solar panel installations."
Analysis of Zheng in Zhuangzi’s Philosophy,"In Zhuangzi’s 莊子 philosophy, the concept of zheng 正 occupies an important place in realizing the Daoist ideal of “inner sageliness and outward kingliness,” in terms of cultivating oneself and lifting others. However, very few scholars have concentrated on this topic and examined the role it plays in achieving the sagely realm. This article, therefore, is primarily intended to investigate the connotation of zheng from the perspective of “virtuosity” (de 德) and to clarify why this virtuosity can “align other living beings.” First, the meaning of alignment in other living beings is introduced, followed by clarification of “activity of the Heavenly” (tian xing 天行), which is internally based on virtuosity and externally conforms to the “Heavenly Transitions” (tian ni 天倪) as a principle of value. Furthermore, through exploring specific examples in the Zhuangzi, I aim to show that the virtuosity of “vacuity and stillness” (xu jing 虛静) and its manifestation as “activity of the Heavenly,” in reality, have a marvelous effect in transforming the evil component."
Development of decision support system for the selection of chemical additive to cure asphaltene deposition problem in oil industry,"This research study aims to develop a decision support system for the selection of asphaltene-controlling chemical additives in crude oil. The decision support will incorporate all necessary criteria which include chemical efficiency, economic and HSE hazards. Therefore, in this study, a decision support system using the Fuzzy TOPSIS method was successfully developed and implemented for evaluating the performance ranking of four chemical additives used to control asphaltene stability in single crude oil. The four chemical additives which include DBSA, CDEA, salicylic acid and toluene were tested during the pre-asphaltene precipitation and post-asphaltene precipitation stages at three different concentrations, i.e., 2.5 wt%, 7.5 wt% and 15 wt%. Deposition level and onset measurement tests were conducted during the pre-asphaltene precipitation treatment process, while for the post-asphaltene precipitation treatment stage only deposition level test was conducted. Onset measurement tests were carried out to validate the results of pre-treatment deposition level tests. To record the deposition level precisely, all test tubes were calibrated and measurements of deposits in tubes were done using ImageJ software. The decision support system was applied to three major cases, namely case 1, case 2 and case 3, and each comprises some or all various criteria used in this study. The criteria taken in this study were the maximum efficiency achieved, concentration of chemical additive at which maximum efficiency was achieved, chemical HSE hazards and chemical cost. Each major case was run various times as its sub-cases by altering the weight importance of different criteria. The results indicate that the DBSA yields the highest accuracy of 100 percent at both pre- and post-treatment phases but at different concentrations. Moreover, DBSA also ranked first performance-wise when only maximum efficiency and dosage level were considered as criteria, i.e., in case 1. The CDEA secured second rank, while the third rank was shared by salicylic acid and toluene. However, when all four criteria were taken into account, CDEA was found to be the first rank chemical during pre-asphaltene precipitation treatment (case 2) in all scenarios of changing weight importance of criteria. DBSA was found to be the second rank chemical followed by salicylic acid and toluene. The comparatively better performance of CDEA over DBSA was due to the reason of its low cost and higher efficiency achievement at a minimum concentration of chemicals used. During the post-asphaltene precipitation treatment stage (case 3), the ranks of chemicals were changed significantly as the weight importance of criteria was changed concerning each other. In this case, CDEA was found to be the best chemical additive in most scenarios followed by DBSA and salicylic acid. Relatively, most of the chemical additive performance was affected adversely during the post-treatment stage as compared to the pre-treatment stage. This finding depicts that the selection of chemical additives for the post-treatment process was more challenging and complex as compared to the pre-treatment stage. The development of a decision support system will certainly prove to be a major advancement and tool toward offering a powerful and reliable integrated framework for the selection of chemical additives to control asphaltene instability in crude oils. Moreover, the decision support system is unique and flexible and can easily incorporate various important factors as criteria in future studies necessary to judge chemical additive performance to be utilized under varying conditions."
Suboptimal Weight Loss 13 Years After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Is Associated with Blunted Appetite Response,"Bariatric surgery remains the most efficient treatment to achieve a sustained weight loss. However, a large proportion of patients experience suboptimal weight loss (SWL). The exact mechanisms involved remain to be fully elucidated, but the homeostatic appetite control system seems to be involved. The aim of this study was, therefore, to compare the plasma concentration of gastrointestinal hormones, and appetite ratings, between those experiencing SWL and optimal weight loss (OWL) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)."
Building trust with digital democratic innovations,"Digital Democratic Innovations (DDIs) have largely been conceived of, by the academic community, as a possible solution to the crisis of representative democracy. DDIs can be defined as initiatives or institutions designed with the goal of deepening citizens’ participation and influence on political decisions through the use of digital tools and platforms. There is a hope that DDIs (as well as usual, non-digital DIs) could help nurture political trust in governing institutions. Yet the vast majority of research on trust and DDIs/DIs focuses only on one side of political trust – the trust of citizens vis-à-vis government. What has largely been ignored, however, is the trust of decision-makers towards citizen participation and its outcomes. We contend that political trust should be seen as a two-sided relationship that implies reciprocity. Therefore, we claim that it is necessary to design DDIs in such a way that they generate political trust from both common citizens and decision-makers. Citizens must trust institutions and processes implemented by the ones in power, and decision-makers must trust the input of citizens’ participatory processes. We argue that transparency is crucial when it comes to fostering reciprocal trust, and we identify the necessary elements to achieve it via DDIs."
Multi-energy CT material decomposition using graph model improved CNN,"In spectral CT imaging, the coefficient image of the basis material obtained by the material decomposition technique can estimate the tissue composition, and its accuracy directly affects the disease diagnosis. Although the precision of material decomposition is increased by employing convolutional neural networks (CNN), extracting the non-local features from the CT image is restricted using the traditional CNN convolution operator. A graph model built by multi-scale non-local self-similar patterns is introduced into multi-material decomposition (MMD). We proposed a novel MMD method based on graph edge–conditioned convolution U-net (GECCU-net) to enhance material image quality. The GECCU-net focuses on developing a multi-scale encoder. At the network coding stage, three paths are applied to capture comprehensive image features. The local and non-local feature aggregation (LNFA) blocks are designed to integrate the local and non-local features from different paths. The graph edge–conditioned convolution based on non-Euclidean space excavates the non-local features. A hybrid loss function is defined to accommodate multi-scale input images and avoid over-smoothing of results. The proposed network is compared quantitatively with base CNN models on the simulated and real datasets. The material images generated by GECCU-net have less noise and artifacts while retaining more information on tissue. The Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) of the obtained abdomen and chest water maps reaches 0.9976 and 0.9990, respectively, and the RMSE reduces to 0.1218 and 0.4903 g/cm3. The proposed method can improve MMD performance and has potential applications."
Evaluating testicular function changes in unilateral cryptorchid chinese infants underwent orchidopexy in the first year of life,"Management of cryptorchidism is typically recommended within the first 18 months of life to maximize fertility potential. However, there is a paucity of longitudinal postoperative data for Chinese infants. We aim to evaluate the Testicular function change when the procedure is done within the first year of life."
"Dust acoustic shock waves in nonuniform dusty plasmas with kappa-distributed ions and electrons, nonadiabatic dust charge fluctuation and dust size distribution","The propagation characteristics of dust acoustic shock waves have been investigated in an unmagnetized nonuniform dusty plasma containing dust grains with nonadiabatic changed charges and different size, electrons and ions modeled by kappa distribution. The modified Korteweg–de Vries Burgers equation is derived by using the standard reductive perturbation technique. Numerical and theoretical analyses show that there are two different shock structures, that is, oscillatory shock structures and monotonous shock structures, in system. The results show that the dust size with power law distribution and kappa parameters have an important influence on dust acoustic shock waves."
Spectrum of Cisplatin-Induced Cardiotoxicity in Dysgerminomas: Case Series and Review,"Cisplatin, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, is known for its efficacy against various malignancies including ovarian, testicular, and solid tumors of the head and neck. Its role as a radiosensitizer is also well established. Cisplatin has several side effects including nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and ototoxicity. AQ1 However, its rare toxicity includes the development of cardiotoxicity, which can range from subclinical changes to life-threatening cardiac dysfunction."
Role of Tumour Budding in Breast Cancer and Its Correlation with Other Prognostic Factors: A Cross Sectional Study in Rural Central India,"Tumour budding is considered as an essential step in invasion and metastasis. It is recognized as an important prognostic marker in recent years. It is a sign of cancer cell motility and as a first step in the process of metastases. The role of TB in breast cancer has been a subject of great interest. So, the present study was aimed to evaluate the role of tumour budding in breast cancer and its correlation with other prognostic factors at a tertiary care hospital in central India."
Effects of essential oil mixtures on expression of genes involved in lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in geese (Anser anser),"The use of essential oils has recently increased in the poultry sector. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of essential oil mixture (juniper, mint, oregano and rosemary oil) on fatty acid oxidation and lipogenic gene expression in geese. Research groups were formed as C (control; no additives), EK1 (0.4 ml/l essential oil mixture supplemented) and EK2 (0.8 ml/l essential oil mixture supplemented). Relative expression levels of genes included in lipogenesis (ACCα, ChREBP, FASN, LXRα and SREBP-1) expression levels of genes included in fatty acid oxidation (ACOX1, CPT1, CPT1A, PPARα and PPARγ) were measured using RT-qPCR. Group EK1 upregulates the mRNA expression levels of genes involved in lipogenesis such as ACCα, ChREBP and SREBP-1, while it downregulates the mRNA expression in levels of all genes involved in fatty acid oxidation. Group EK2 increases the mRNA expression levels of genes involved in lipogenesis such as ACCα, FASN and SREBP-1, while it decreased mRNA expression at the levels of all genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, as in the other group. In the study, adding an essential oil mixture to drinking water is predicted to increase fatty liver because it upregulates genes related to fat synthesis (lipogenesis) and downregulates genes related to fat degradation (fatty acid oxidation)."
AGD-Net: Attention-Guided Dense Inception U-Net for Single-Image Dehazing,"Image hazing poses a significant challenge in various computer vision applications, degrading the visual quality and reducing the perceptual clarity of captured scenes. The proposed AGD-Net utilizes a U-Net style architecture with an Attention-Guided Dense Inception encoder-decoder framework. Unlike existing methods that heavily rely on synthetic datasets which are based on CARLA simulation, our model is trained and evaluated exclusively on realistic data, enabling its effectiveness and reliability in practical scenarios. The key innovation of AGD-Net lies in its attention-guided mechanism, which empowers the network to focus on crucial information within hazy images and effectively suppress artifacts during the dehazing process. The dense inception modules further advance the representation capabilities of the model, facilitating the extraction of intricate features from the input images. To assess the performance of AGD-Net, a detailed experimental analysis is conducted on four benchmark haze datasets. The results show that AGD-Net significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM. Moreover, a visual comparison of the dehazing results further validates the superior performance gains achieved by AGD-Net over other methods. By leveraging realistic data exclusively, AGD-Net overcomes the limitations associated with synthetic datasets which are based on CARLA simulation, ensuring its adaptability and effectiveness in real-world circumstances. The proposed AGD-Net offers a robust and reliable solution for single-image dehazing, presenting a significant advancement over existing methods."
Can cyclical food restriction support growth of juvenile Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in brackish water biofloc?,"The effects of cyclical feeding restriction (3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days of feeding per week) on the performance of juvenile Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in a biofloc technology system (BFT) were evaluated in this study for 77 days. Fifteen experimental units (400L) with temperature control (mean 28.2 °C) randomly distributed 1500 fish (0.42 ± 0.02 g). Fish were fed commercial feed (46.7 g of crude protein and 4475.5 kcal kg−1 of gross energy) up to satiation. Feeding cycles with different restrictions (p < 0.05) influenced animal growth but not survival and final density (p > 0.05), which remained around 94% and 235 fish.m−3, respectively. Juveniles fed 6 days a week showed 1.25 of feeding efficiency, while animals fed 3 days a week (more restricted) showed hyperphagia but did not exhibit compensatory growth. Changes in the morphology of hepatocytes (presence of vacuoles, displacement of the nucleus to the periphery, and fatty degeneration) were observed with an increase in feeding days, and a high degree of hepatic steatosis (p < 0.05). Water quality parameters remained within acceptable limits for the species and system operation. Feeding regimes influenced the characteristics of bioflocs (total suspended solids and porosity) and the abundance of microorganisms (p < 0.05). Nutritionally, less restricted diets (6 and 7 days of feeding per week) produced more protein (38.3 and 40.6% CP) and energy bioflocs (2252.8 and 2313 kcal.kg−1) (p < 0.05), while protein, lipid, and body energy were significantly lower (p < 0.05) with the more restricted diet. The composition of microorganisms was influenced by the feeding regimes (p < 0.05). Results demonstrated that the occurrence of total compensatory growth (6 days of feeding per week) represents an economic advantage with a reduction of 26.8% of feed and greater profitability in the unitary commercialization of tilapia juveniles."
STIGCN: spatial–temporal interaction-aware graph convolution network for pedestrian trajectory prediction,"Accurately predicting the future trajectory of pedestrians is critical for tasks such as autonomous driving and robot navigation. Previous methods for pedestrian trajectory prediction dealt with social interaction and pedestrian movement factors either concurrently or sequentially, neglecting the link between them. Therefore, a spatial–temporal interaction-aware graph convolution network (STIGCN) is proposed for pedestrian trajectory prediction. STIGCN considers the correlation between social interaction and pedestrian movement factors to achieve more accurate interaction modeling. Specifically, we first constructed spatial and temporal graphs to model social interactions and movement factors. Then, we designed the spatial–temporal interaction-aware learning to utilize the spatial interaction features of each moment to assist the temporal interaction modeling and utilize the temporal interaction features of each pedestrian to assist the spatial interaction modeling, resulting in more accurate interaction modeling. Finally, a time-extrapolator pyramid convolution neural network (TEP-CNN) is designed to jointly estimate the two-dimensional Gaussian distribution parameters of future trajectories by combining the prediction features from multiple layers. Experimental results on two benchmark pedestrian trajectory prediction datasets show that our proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of average displacement error and final displacement error and achieves more accurate predictions for pedestrian motions such as convergence and encounter."
Genetic Risk of Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Case Control Study,"Vitamin D effects are mediated by vitamin D receptors (VDRs), which are influenced by various genetic polymorphisms, including ApaI and BsmI. These polymorphisms have been linked to several diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study aimed to compare the frequency and association of VDR ApaI and BsmI gene polymorphisms, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-(OH)-D) levels, and calcium (Ca) levels between a RA group and a matched healthy control group. In one hundred RA patients and fifty healthy controls, the genotypes of the VDR ApaI and BsmI gene polymorphisms were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP). Both Serum 25-(OH)-D level and calcium level were measured in the two groups. There was no significant difference between the cases and controls regarding the VDR ApaI gene polymorphism (p = 0.89). A significant difference was observed between the cases and controls in terms of the VDR BsmI gene polymorphism (p = < 0.001). The serum levels of 25-(OH)-D and calcium were significantly lower in the RA group compared to the control group (p = 0.04 and < 0.001 respectively). Significantly higher serum vitamin D levels were associated with the aa genotype (p = 0.007). Significantly increased calcium levels were associated with the AA genotype (p = 0.02). No significant difference was found among BsmI polymorphisms regarding vitamin D and Ca levels (p = 0.25 and 0.87 respectively). Vitamin D receptor gene BsmI polymorphism but not ApaI polymorphism could be a marker of RA susceptibility. Vitamin D and Ca levels are negatively affected by RA. Vitamin D receptor gene ApaI polymorphism contributes to vitamin D and Ca levels."
Complete Minimal Logarithmic Energy Asymptotics for Points in a Compact Interval: A Consequence of the Discriminant of Jacobi Polynomials,"The electrostatic interpretation of zeros of Jacobi polynomials, due to Stieltjes and Schur, enables us to obtain the complete asymptotic expansion as \(n \rightarrow \infty \) of the minimal logarithmic potential energy of n point charges restricted to move in the interval \([-1,1]\) in the presence of an external field generated by endpoint charges. By the same methods, we determine the complete asymptotic expansion as \(N \rightarrow \infty \) of the logarithmic energy \(\sum _{j\ne k} \log (1/| x_j - x_k |)\) of Fekete points, which, by definition, maximize the product of all mutual distances \(\prod _{j\ne k} | x_j - x_k |\) of N points in \([-1,1]\). The results for other compact intervals differ only in the quadratic and linear term of the asymptotics. Explicit formulas and their asymptotics follow from the discriminant, leading coefficient, and special values at \(\pm 1\) of Jacobi polynomials. For all these quantities we derive complete Poincaré-type asymptotics."
A T-shaped compact dual-band MIMO antenna system for 5G smartphone applications,"Multiband MIMO antenna system is very important in 5G mobile communication to meet the requirements of increasing data rate. However integrating multiple antennas in the limited space causes mutual coupling. The antenna configuration gets more intricate, if additional circuitry is installed to obtain greater isolation and hence, the occupied area on the board grows significantly, making the overall antenna design bulky. Hence, to provide dual band coverage, decent isolation and compact design, a compact MIMO antenna system is presented in this paper. The proposed system includes a T-shaped resonating structure that is employed on the side-frames to form a MIMO system with eight antennas. The T-shaped strip is designed to resonate at two frequencies and thereby covering two 5G bands (LTE 42/LTE 46). The proposed dual band MIMO system is fairly compact as the individual antennas are mounted on the \(150\times 3.6 {\text {mm}}^{2}\) side-frames of the smartphone. The isolation between antenna elements is 14 dB. This is accomplished without the need of a decoupling structure or a complex tuning process. The ergodic channel capacity realized by the suggested MIMO system in the operational bands is more than 41 b/s/Hz and ECC is less than 0.075. The impacts of the presence of plastic frame, display panel and phantom hand on the performance of proposed design are discussed. The proposed design provides compactness, dual band coverage and high isolation."
"Investigation of Melt Pool Geometry, Cooling Rate, and Microstructure Formation in Laser Surfacing of Al 7075 Alloy: Numerical Simulation and Experimental Analysis","The study involves numerically simulating the influence of process parameters on melt pool geometry, cooling rate, and microstructure during laser surfacing of 7075 Al alloy using COMSOL Multiphysics. Both numerical simulations and experiments show that increasing scan speeds at a constant laser power reduces melt pool dimensions and increases cooling rates. At 1000 W laser power and 15 mm/s scan speed, numerically simulated melt pool width, depth, and cooling rate are 3.8 mm, 1 mm, and 1370 K/s, closely matching experimental measurements of 4.2 mm, 1.3 mm, and 1449 K/s. Calculated thermal gradient (G) and solidification rate (R) are correlated with observed solidification morphology. The G/R ratio derived from simulations has higher values at the melt pool's bottom, gradually decreasing toward the top for a given laser power and scan speed. This pattern aligns with optical micrographs showing equiaxed dendrites at the top, and columnar and cellular dendrites in the middle and bottom of the melt pool."
The influence of viscose fibre properties on the absorbency of feminine hygiene tampons: the pivotal role of cross-sectional geometry,"Feminine hygiene products, used by millions of women worldwide on a daily basis, come in various forms. Among them, tampons are a prominent type that aims to absorb menstrual blood directly in the vagina. However, the underlying mechanisms governing liquid absorption in tampons have received limited research attention and remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate these mechanisms by examining the two main types of viscose fibres used in tampons and their effects when employed in tampon production. The sole distinction between the fibre types lies in their geometric shape—round or trilobal—while all other fibre parameters remain constant. To explore these mechanisms, tampon proxies made from these fibres were created and subjected to tests measuring liquid absorption. In addition, a novel method employing infrared thermography was utilized to infer the stored energy within the compressed tampon. Furthermore, individual fibres were characterised for chemical composition, surface properties, fine structure, liquid interaction, mechanical parameters, and friction behaviour. The results revealed that trilobal fibres exhibited higher tampon absorbency compared to their round counterparts, despite sharing similar chemical composition and comparable mechanical characteristics. This disparity can be attributed to the greater specific surface area of trilobal fibres, leading to enhanced liquid uptake through fibre swelling. However, single fibre swelling only accounted for a minor fraction of the total liquid absorbency of a tampon. The most influential fibre parameter was the geometric shape, as trilobal fibres facilitated the construction and maintenance of a bulkier network with increased available volume for liquid absorption."
Estimating Soil Carbon Sequestration of Jatropha for Sustainable Aviation Fuel Pathway,"The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) raw material planting process will inevitably cause carbon emissions from induced land use change (ILUC). However, limited by the regional specificity of energy plants, the ILUC emissions value of SAF is less considerable in the case of soil carbon sequestration during the raw material planting process. Therefore, this study used the CENTURY model to predict the carbon sequestration of soil in Jatropha plantations and compared it with the preparation of aviation fuel from soybean oil. The results showed that, when considering ILUC combined with the carbon sequestration effect of the raw material planting land, life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of the two methods for producing Jatropha oil–based aviation kerosene (pathway 1: oil residue used for fertilizer or power generation; pathway 2: oil residue detoxified and used for animal feed) were −36.1 g CO2e/MJ and −59.4 g CO2e/MJ, respectively. The life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of soybean oil–based aviation kerosene under the condition of straw returning and without straw returning are 2.9 g CO2e/MJ and 66.1 g CO2e/MJ, respectively. Compared with petroleum aviation fuel, the emission reduction potential of Jatropha oil-based aviation kerosene increased from 84.38% and 110.56% to 140.6% and 166.7%, respectively, based on the original core life cycle assessment (cLCA)+ILUC, considering soil carbon sequestration. The emission reduction potential of soybean-based aviation kerosene increased from 42.81 to 96.7% (with straw returned to the field) and 25.7% (without straw returned to the field). The results show that Jatropha oil–based aviation kerosene has great potential in terms of negative carbon emissions when considering the carbon sequestration effect of soil in the energy plant planting area. In the future, large-scale planting on marginal land with a climate suitable for Jatropha growth will help the civil aviation industry reduce carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality."
Bone tissue regeneration by 58S bioactive glass scaffolds containing exosome: an in vivo study,"Exosomes, the naturally secreted nanocarriers of cells, have recently been demonstrated to have therapeutic benefits in a variety of disease models where parent cells are not present. However, the use of exosomes in bone defect regeneration has been unusual, and little is documented about the underlying processes. In recent study we produced and characterized exosomes derived human endometrial mesenchymal stem stromal cells and 58S bioactive glass scaffolds; in following, in this research exosome loaded scaffolds synthetized and release of exosome, porosity and bioactivity of them were assessed. More over the effect of scaffolds on repair of critical-size bone defects in rat’s calvaria was evaluated by histological examination and micro computed tomography (µ CT). The findings confirmed that constructed porous scaffolds consistently release exosomes; additionally, in vivo findings including Hematoxilin & Eosin staining, Immunohistochemistry, Masson's trichrome, histomorphometric analysis, and µ CT clarified that our implant has osteogenic properties. We discovered that Exo-treated scaffolds might promote osteogenesis especially compared to pure scaffolds, indicating that produced scaffolds containing exosomes could be a potential replacement in bone tissue engineering."
Pediatric head injuries: particularities and neurosurgical experience in a lower-middle income country,"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study conducted in Tunisia on the neurosurgical management of child cranial trauma.

Optimal vitamin D supplement dosage for improving insulin resistance in children and adolescents with overweight/obesity: a systematic review and network meta-analysis,We conducted a network meta-analysis which aims to evaluate the comparative efficacy of different supplementation dosages of vitamin D on cardiometabolic and bone-metabolic indicators as well as insulin resistance in children and adolescents with overweight/obesity.
Engaging Young Children in STEAM Learning: An Inquiry Planning Guide for Early Educators,"The water station in The Pond Room had always been a popular option especially since in this region the summer heat is extremely intense. The Master Teacher noticed that Zach, a 3-year-old with special needs and an IEP from the local school district, returned to the water station over and over again and was very focused on his activities. His obsession with water also drew other children in the play. After observing the children play freely with water for two weeks, the teacher decided to expand this water play into a series of developmentally appropriate, meaningful investigations about water. She felt that this water project was a great opportunity for preschoolers with and without disabilities to construct STEAM concepts and skills which will prepare them for more complex and abstract STEAM concepts in later schooling. With the goals of developing students’ knowledge and positive attitudes toward STEAM and promoting their STEAM-related questioning and problem-solving skills, the master teacher began the inquiry and embarked on a water project in her classroom."
Is the perceptual disfluency effect moderated by working memory capacity? Direct replication of Lehmann et al. (2016),"According to an aptitude-treatment interaction experiment (Lehmann et al., Metacognition and Learning, 11, 89–105, 2016, N = 47, published in Metacognition and Learning), perceptually disfluent texts facilitated retention and comprehension performance (but not transfer performance) only for learners with higher working memory capacity (WMC). No effects of WMC for a fluent text were found (albeit theoretically, fluency may be more advantageous for learners with lower WMC). The findings of our (pre-registered) direct replication (supervised online sample of N = 96) show a substantial deviation from the original results: In contrast to the interaction effect (disfluency and WMC) of the primary study, we obtained null results for disfluency, WMC, and their interaction for all learning outcomes. Our replication data are not indicative of WMC as a boundary condition moderating the disfluency effect on learning. We discuss discrepancies in the results of the primary study and our direct replication regarding particular methodological and analytical decisions, questioning the robustness and generalizability of Lehman et al.’s results beyond their primary study."
"Development of an industrial solid waste ecological analysis model in Shanghai, China","Amid China’s rapid economic expansion, the country’s industrial solid waste (ISW) problem is escalating. As each sector generates distinct types of ISW, a multi-indicator assessment of each sector is essential to address China’s New Solid Waste Policy. To investigate the ISW situation of each sector and perform a comprehensive assessment, we formulate an industrial solid waste ecological analysis framework based on ISW generation and ISW flow in the sector. Various indicators (i.e., solid waste utilization coefficient, solid waste threat coefficient, and solid waste threat intensity) are employed to assess the utilization of solid waste generated for each sector, as well as the threat of solid waste originating in each sector to society. Ecological network analysis probes the interrelationships between diverse sectors. Taking Shanghai in 2017 as an example, the study indicates that some sectors (e.g., production and supply of electric power and heat power (EH) and metal smelting and rolling processing sector (MS)) exhibit higher direct ISW generation and the direct industrial solid waste value-added coefficient (SVAC) for common industrial solid waste (CISW). Specifically, the direct CISW generation of EH and MS is 539.21Mt and 277.00Mt respectively. The direct SVAC of EH and MS is 157.06kg/103RMB and 126.27kg/103RMB respectively. These sectors should prioritize reducing emissions at the source. Additionally, the threats to society from various sectors are relatively insignificant for the CISW, while for the hazardous waste (HW), all sectors pose a considerable threat to Shanghai’s society. Moreover, some sectors (e.g., mining industry) exhibit the highest mutualism relationships in the CISW and the HW. Enhancing mining sector technologies is a vital strategy for mitigating ISW sources. Specifically, MI has 9 pairs of mutualism relationships in the CISW and 8 pairs in the HW. These insights will provide empirical evidence for tackling the ISW problem in Shanghai."
"Ecological and statistical models to configure flow regime for environment benefit in highly engineered rivers: a case study in the MacKenzie River, Southeast Australia","Ecological and statistical models were developed using freshwater algal assemblages to assess water quality and ecological health of a regulated river. These models were used to inform configuration of flows to maintain or improve environmental conditions of the waterway whilst meeting consumptive water supply commitments. The flow regime of the MacKenzie River, western Victoria, Australia, has been substantially modified since the construction of a water supply reservoir on its upper reach in 1887. Water is withdrawn at several locations downstream of the reservoir, creating a substantially modified flow regime, impacting key environmental values of the river. To assess the impact of the different flow regimes on river health and ecosystem function, ten sites were repeatedly sampled along the river between February 2012 and April 2014. Physical and chemical characteristics of water, including pH, temperature, turbidity, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, cations, and anions, were measured. Biological properties of the algal periphyton communities, including dry mass, ash-free dry mass, chlorophyll-a concentration, and species composition, were also measured. Exploration of the algal assemblage and water chemistry data using the computationally unconstrained ordination technique such as principal component analysis principal component analysis (PCA), correspondence analysis (CA), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated two strong gradients in the data sets. Furthermore, the quantitative ecosystem response models have been developed as the prototype tool to assist in the future configuration of flows in this river. The empirical data and models showed the lower reaches of the river to be in poor condition under low flows, but this condition improved under flows of 35 ML/day, as indicated by the reduction in green algae and cyanobacteria and improvement. Finally, the results are presented to tailor discharge and duration of water volume by amalgamation of consumptive and environmental flows to improve the condition of the stream thereby supplementing the flows dedicated to environmental outcomes."
Simultaneous optimization of production yield and sulfadiazine adsorption of MgFe2O4 loaded on prickly pear biochars using Box-Behnken design,"A major challenge that humans facing is the uncontrolled discharge of antibiotic-containing wastewater into the environment, accompanying with huge threats to human community. The utilization of cost-effective biomass-based adsorbents is considered a potential solution for the treatment of antibiotic wastewater. This study aims to optimize the synthesis of MgFe2O4 nanoparticles loaded on prickly pear biochar (PPB) with outstanding sulfadiazine adsorbability using response surface methodology. Thirteen materials (MgFe2O4-PPB) produced based on Box-Behnken design were tested to evaluate the impact of the main factors on the material preparation process, including ratio of MgFe2O4:PPB precursors, calcination temperature and calcination time. Under optimized conditions, i.e., MgFe2O4:PPB ratio 0.5, temperature 600 °C and time 1 h, the production yield of 46.5% and sulfadiazine removal percentage of 85.4% were obtained. Characterization of optimized MgFe2O4-PPB indicated the good porosity and functionality suitable for the adsorption of sulfadiazine. Elovich model showed the best description of kinetic process. Temkin model was considered to be an accurate description of the isotherm adsorption. Proposed mechanism for antibiotic adsorption onto MgFe2O4-PPB was described. We clarify cost–benefit analysis to asses the importance of MgFe2O4-PPB as well as the economic and environmental impacts of biochar-based composites."
"Carbon ecological security assessment based on the decoupling relationship between carbon balance pressure and ecological quality in Xuzhou City, China","Building a carbon ecological security (CES) framework helps to scientifically evaluate and manage the regional carbon cycle and eco-environment and support regional ecological security patterns. This paper adopted the pressure-state-response-immune (PSRI) model and the carbon balance index method to evaluate the ecological quality and carbon balance pressure. Then, based on the decoupling model and the improved four-quadrant model, the CES framework was constructed to evaluate the changing trend of the CES of Xuzhou City from 2005 to 2020. The results showed that the carbon balance pressure of Xuzhou City showed a pattern of “low-high-low” from east to west, and most areas tended to have a carbon balance and surplus in 2020. The ecological quality showed an overall upward trend during the study period. Protection and restoration drove the response and immune index growth from 2010 to 2020. In the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan stage, the nine districts of Xuzhou City were in a stable decoupling state, and the overall decoupling process was ideal. The CES of districts showed individual differences in the general upward trend. The carbon balance pressure of Gulou and Quanshan Districts was the main factor restricting the districts’ CES. Therefore, based on the empirical results, this research proposes relevant suggestions to enhance carbon ecological security to achieve regional green and low-carbon development."
Quantile-based assessment of energy-CO2 emission nexus in Pakistan,"Nonrenewable energy sources maintain a substantial majority of Pakistan’s energy composition, exceeding 70%, posing challenges to achieving sustainability goals for a low-carbon economy. Recognizing this, the study determines the critical thresholds where renewable and nonrenewable energies affect more significantly on CO2 emission over the period from 1972Q1 to 2020Q4. The analysis begins by confirming the stationarity of the data through quantile unit root analysis, followed by an examination of long-term associations using quantile cointegration. For quantile-based impact assessments, we apply quantile regression. To uncover the direction of causality within quantiles, we use a novel approach, quantile causality analysis. Nonrenewable energy sources exhibit a long-term association at disaggregated levels, whereas the same is not true for renewable energy across the quantile distribution. Quantile regression results reveal that renewable energy sources positively impact CO2 emissions, with coal having the highest coefficient, followed by oil and gas, particularly in the upper quantiles, τ = {0.70–0.75}. However, renewable energy sources prove insignificant in decreasing CO2 emissions. Similarly, total energy consumption has a positive influence on CO2 emissions at extremely low quantiles, τ = {0.05–0.30} and high quantiles, τ = {0.65–0.90}, indicating sensitivity to extreme variations. The quantile causality analysis highlights a bidirectional causality relationship among CO2 emissions, total energy consumption, and both renewable and nonrenewable energy consumption across lower and upper quantiles. Policymakers should reallocate funds, provide subsidies, and introduce infrastructure development projects to reduce the burden on nonrenewable energy sources based on this quantile analysis."
Stress-mitigating behavior of glycine betaine to enhance growth performance by suppressing the oxidative stress in Pb-stressed barley genotypes,"The toxicity of lead (Pb) in agricultural soil is constantly increasing as a result of anthropogenic activities. Pb is one of the most phytotoxic metals in soil that accumulates in plant tissue, resulting in yield loss. It is currently becoming more popular to supplement glycine betaine (GB) for Pb-induced stress tolerance in crop plants. Currently, no report describes the use of GB as a stress mitigator for growth attributes and stress-specific biomarkers in barley plants under Pb stress conditions. Hence, the present research was designed to examine the stress-mitigating behavior of GB on various growth attributes including germination percentage, seed vigor index (SVI), radicle length, plant biomass (fresh and dry), shoot and root length, physiological attributes such as relative water content (RWC), and stress-specific biomarkers like electrolyte leakage (EL), and H2O2 content of two barley varieties viz. BH959 and BH946 at three Pb stress treatments (15 mM, 25 mM, and 35 mM), with and without GB (2 mM) supplementation in natural conditions. The present investigation showed that at the highest Pb stress (35 mM), the germination rate was reduced to zero, and the growth attributes and RWC of both barley varieties were also reduced as compared to the non-stressed plants (control) with an increase in Pb treatment. However, EL up to 70% and H2O2 content up to 30% increased with an increase in Pb stress concentration indicated by ROS accumulation, resulting in more oxidative stress. Additionally, GB application alleviated the toxic effect of Pb stress by improving the rate of germination by 33.3% and growth performance by reducing the ROS accumulation in terms of reducing stress biomarkers H2O2 by 25%, and EL by 12%. It has been revealed that the application of GB can minimize or reduce the toxic effects caused by Pb toxicity in both varieties, positively modulating plant growth performances and lowering oxidative stress. This research may provide a scientific basis for assessing Pb tolerance in barley plants and developing alternative approaches to protecting them from the severe effects of Pb toxicity."
Does smart city pilot improve green total factor productivity? Evidence from Chinese cities,"In recent years, the construction of smart cities has gradually become an effective means of addressing urban economic and environmental challenges. Based on panel data of 249 Chinese cities from 2005 to 2020, this study uses a super-efficiency epsilon-based measure model and a Malmquist-Luenberger index to calculate the urban green total factor productivity (GTFP). Using the smart city pilot as a quasi-natural experiment, the time-varying difference-in-difference (DID) method is applied to determine the causal effect of smart city pilot on GTFP. Results show that smart city pilot increases urban GTFP in China, and a series of robust analyses have verified the reliability of the results. The heterogeneity analysis results show that the smart city pilot policy has a more significant positive effect on urban GTFP in the eastern and central regions, the high population group, and the high per capita GDP group. The mediating analysis further suggests that smart city pilot positively affects technological innovations and human capital which promotes urban GTFP. These findings are of great significance for smart city construction and coordinating the relationship between urban economic development and environmental protection."
Concept of s-Numbers in Quaternionic Analysis and Schatten Classes,"In this paper we introduce an axiomatic approach to the theory of s-numbers in quaternionic analysis. To this end, Pietsch’s approach to s-number theory is adapted to the quaternionic framework, following the works of Colombo and Sabadini on quaternionic spectral analysis. One of the main results of this paper is the uniqueness of s-numbers over quaternionic Hilbert spaces. Moreover, examples are given in the quaternionic framework together with the introduction of nuclear numbers. A consequence of the presented theory is a basis independent definition of the Schatten classes over quaternionic Hilbert and Banach spaces."
Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor exerts dominant effects over macrophage colony stimulating factor during macrophage differentiation in vitro to induce an inflammatory phenotype,"Macrophages (Mφ) can exist along a spectrum of phenotypes that include pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) immune cells. Mφ colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and granulocyte Mφ colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are cytokines important in hematopoiesis, polarization and activation of Mφ."
A Novel Image Segmentation Algorithm based on Continuous-Time Quantum Walk using Superpixels,"The application of continuous-time quantum walk in the field of image segmentation has attracted much attention due to the advantages of quantum computation. However, the proposed image segmentation algorithm constructs the continuous-time quantum walk model based on pixels, which will cause a huge burden on quantum resources, and the various feature information of the image cannot be better considered. In addition, this pixel-based processing method requires a lot of manual annotation to achieve the desirable segmentation effect. To address these issues, we propose an image segmentation algorithm using continuous-time quantum walk based on superpixels. In our segmentation algorithm, the original image is firstly segmented into superpixels, and then a weighted graph is constructed with superpixels as nodes, where the weight of edges in graph is measured by the feature similarity of two adjacent superpixels, which consists of color features and texture features. Next, the continuous-time quantum walk model is constructed based on the weighted graph by redefining the new Hamiltonian operator. Finally, continuous-time quantum walk is executed and the image segmentation result can be obtained, which is realized by assigning each superpixel the class label corresponding to the greatest probability. Experiments on the BSD500 dataset show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve segmentation efficiency and accuracy while the manually selected seeds is reduced by 91%. More importantly, the new algorithm reduce the demision of the quantum walk system by more than 99%, which will yield a huge saving on the quantum resources."
Connecting Agent-Based Models with High-Dimensional Parameter Spaces to Multidimensional Data Using SMoRe ParS: A Surrogate Modeling Approach,"Across a broad range of disciplines, agent-based models (ABMs) are increasingly utilized for replicating, predicting, and understanding complex systems and their emergent behavior. In the biological and biomedical sciences, researchers employ ABMs to elucidate complex cellular and molecular interactions across multiple scales under varying conditions. Data generated at these multiple scales, however, presents a computational challenge for robust analysis with ABMs. Indeed, calibrating ABMs remains an open topic of research due to their own high-dimensional parameter spaces. In response to these challenges, we extend and validate our novel methodology, Surrogate Modeling for Reconstructing Parameter Surfaces (SMoRe ParS), arriving at a computationally efficient framework for connecting high dimensional ABM parameter spaces with multidimensional data. Specifically, we modify SMoRe ParS to initially confine high dimensional ABM parameter spaces using unidimensional data, namely, single time-course information of in vitro cancer cell growth assays. Subsequently, we broaden the scope of our approach to encompass more complex ABMs and constrain parameter spaces using multidimensional data. We explore this extension with in vitro cancer cell inhibition assays involving the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin. For each scenario, we validate and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing how well ABM simulations match the experimental data when using SMoRe ParS-inferred parameters versus parameters inferred by a commonly used direct method. In so doing, we show that our approach of using an explicitly formulated surrogate model as an interlocutor between the ABM and the experimental data effectively calibrates the ABM parameter space to multidimensional data. Our method thus provides a robust and scalable strategy for leveraging multidimensional data to inform multiscale ABMs and explore the uncertainty in their parameters."
Indazole derivatives as selective inhibitors of butyrylcholinesterase with effective blood-brain-barrier permeability profile,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic disease that is multifactorial. Its underlying cause and mechanisms are yet to be fully understood and numerous research are underway to develop more effective drug candidates. This research explores the synthesis of an indazole-containing novel drug targeting AD, particularly by inhibiting cholinesterase activity. Among the 17 indazole derivatives synthesized in this study, compound 4q was demonstrated to have potent and selective butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activity. Molecular docking simulations revealed that the binding of 4q with BChE was through hydrophobic and polar interactions. It was also found to easily permeate through the blood-brain-barrier via an in vitro model and is non-toxic when tested against SH-SY5Y cells."
Effects of pulmonary rehabilitation in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients: a randomized controlled study,"During hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), patients’ exercise capacity and quality of life (QOL) are impaired. Exercise training is recommended to preserve cardiorespiratory fitness during the compelling HSCT period. However, studies investigating the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in HSCT recipients are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of two different PR programs on maximal exercise capacity, respiratory muscle strength and endurance, pulmonary function, and QOL."
Analysis of Zheng in Zhuangzi’s Philosophy,"In Zhuangzi’s 莊子 philosophy, the concept of zheng 正 occupies an important place in realizing the Daoist ideal of “inner sageliness and outward kingliness,” in terms of cultivating oneself and lifting others. However, very few scholars have concentrated on this topic and examined the role it plays in achieving the sagely realm. This article, therefore, is primarily intended to investigate the connotation of zheng from the perspective of “virtuosity” (de 德) and to clarify why this virtuosity can “align other living beings.” First, the meaning of alignment in other living beings is introduced, followed by clarification of “activity of the Heavenly” (tian xing 天行), which is internally based on virtuosity and externally conforms to the “Heavenly Transitions” (tian ni 天倪) as a principle of value. Furthermore, through exploring specific examples in the Zhuangzi, I aim to show that the virtuosity of “vacuity and stillness” (xu jing 虛静) and its manifestation as “activity of the Heavenly,” in reality, have a marvelous effect in transforming the evil component."
Suboptimal Weight Loss 13 Years After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Is Associated with Blunted Appetite Response,"Bariatric surgery remains the most efficient treatment to achieve a sustained weight loss. However, a large proportion of patients experience suboptimal weight loss (SWL). The exact mechanisms involved remain to be fully elucidated, but the homeostatic appetite control system seems to be involved. The aim of this study was, therefore, to compare the plasma concentration of gastrointestinal hormones, and appetite ratings, between those experiencing SWL and optimal weight loss (OWL) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)."
Development of decision support system for the selection of chemical additive to cure asphaltene deposition problem in oil industry,"This research study aims to develop a decision support system for the selection of asphaltene-controlling chemical additives in crude oil. The decision support will incorporate all necessary criteria which include chemical efficiency, economic and HSE hazards. Therefore, in this study, a decision support system using the Fuzzy TOPSIS method was successfully developed and implemented for evaluating the performance ranking of four chemical additives used to control asphaltene stability in single crude oil. The four chemical additives which include DBSA, CDEA, salicylic acid and toluene were tested during the pre-asphaltene precipitation and post-asphaltene precipitation stages at three different concentrations, i.e., 2.5 wt%, 7.5 wt% and 15 wt%. Deposition level and onset measurement tests were conducted during the pre-asphaltene precipitation treatment process, while for the post-asphaltene precipitation treatment stage only deposition level test was conducted. Onset measurement tests were carried out to validate the results of pre-treatment deposition level tests. To record the deposition level precisely, all test tubes were calibrated and measurements of deposits in tubes were done using ImageJ software. The decision support system was applied to three major cases, namely case 1, case 2 and case 3, and each comprises some or all various criteria used in this study. The criteria taken in this study were the maximum efficiency achieved, concentration of chemical additive at which maximum efficiency was achieved, chemical HSE hazards and chemical cost. Each major case was run various times as its sub-cases by altering the weight importance of different criteria. The results indicate that the DBSA yields the highest accuracy of 100 percent at both pre- and post-treatment phases but at different concentrations. Moreover, DBSA also ranked first performance-wise when only maximum efficiency and dosage level were considered as criteria, i.e., in case 1. The CDEA secured second rank, while the third rank was shared by salicylic acid and toluene. However, when all four criteria were taken into account, CDEA was found to be the first rank chemical during pre-asphaltene precipitation treatment (case 2) in all scenarios of changing weight importance of criteria. DBSA was found to be the second rank chemical followed by salicylic acid and toluene. The comparatively better performance of CDEA over DBSA was due to the reason of its low cost and higher efficiency achievement at a minimum concentration of chemicals used. During the post-asphaltene precipitation treatment stage (case 3), the ranks of chemicals were changed significantly as the weight importance of criteria was changed concerning each other. In this case, CDEA was found to be the best chemical additive in most scenarios followed by DBSA and salicylic acid. Relatively, most of the chemical additive performance was affected adversely during the post-treatment stage as compared to the pre-treatment stage. This finding depicts that the selection of chemical additives for the post-treatment process was more challenging and complex as compared to the pre-treatment stage. The development of a decision support system will certainly prove to be a major advancement and tool toward offering a powerful and reliable integrated framework for the selection of chemical additives to control asphaltene instability in crude oils. Moreover, the decision support system is unique and flexible and can easily incorporate various important factors as criteria in future studies necessary to judge chemical additive performance to be utilized under varying conditions."
Fabrication of low-cost and efficient PEDOT:PSS-silicon hybrid heterojunction solar cell via tailoring the organic layer thickness,"Organic conjugate semiconductor, poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiopene): poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and silicon (Si) based hybrid heterojunction solar cells (HSCs) have shown tremendous potential as an alternative low-cost approach to the traditional crystalline Si (c-Si) solar cell technology. In the HSCs, opto-electronic properties of the organic layer play critical part in the junction formation and hence the performance of device. Therefore, the present study aims at tailoring the PEDOT:PSS thickness via spin speed variation of the organic solution and investigate its effect on morphological (PEDOT:PSS/Si interface), optical, surface passivation property and the device (HSCs) performance parameters. The results are further supported by comprehensive analysis of FESEM, UV–Vis–NIR, minority carrier lifetime, dark and illuminated J-V characteristics, quantum efficiency and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results of the solar cells utilizing the low-cost solar grade and thin Si wafers. The PEDOT:PSS layer exhibits anti-reflective and surface passivation properties in addition to forming efficient junction with n-Si. It has been found that the thickness of 140 ± 24 nm is the optimum for efficient HSCs on polished Si surfaces, with maximum efficiency of 8.89% contributed by the best optical, passivation and PEDOT:PSS/Si junction properties for effective generation of the charge carriers, separation and hence their transportation to the respective electrodes in the most fundamental device structure of ‘Ag/PEDOT:PSS/n-Si/In:Ga’. The present work may guide to the development of PEDOT:PSS/n-Si based optoelectronic devices via simple low thermal budget solution process."
Controlled addition of Fe3O4 for enhancing photocarrier generation in MoS2 visible light photodetector,"Visible light photodetectors (PDs) play a pivotal role in a diverse range of applications, including imaging, optical communication, sensing, and biomedical diagnostics. In this work, we did an investigation on the systematic study of the influence of Fe3O4 over MoS2 for the efficient photocarrier generation in broadband spectral region. The structural, morphological, and optical properties of MoS2, Fe3O4 and MoS2/Fe3O4 composites were studied using X-ray diffraction, Field Emission Transmission Electron Microscope (FESEM) and UV–Vis absorption. The structural findings from X-ray diffraction suggest the formation of pristine MoS2, Fe3O4 and MoS2/Fe3O4 composites. FESEM display a flower-like morphology for pristine MoS2 and an octahedral structure for pristine Fe3O4. Raman spectroscopy indicated two vibrational modes \(E_{{2{\text{g}}}}^{1}\) and A1g of MoS2 that correspond to in-plane vibration of sulphur and molybdenum atoms and out-plane vibration of sulphur atoms, respectively. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of MoS2 and MoS2/Fe3O4 PDs were evaluated under dark and light illumination. The nanocomposite showed maximum responsivity of 10.1 µA W−1 and a specific detectivity of 105 Jones. Fabricated PDs show a highly stable response throughout the cycle."

The investigation begins by examining the ground state phase diagrams, aiming to identify stable spin configurations under different physical parameters. Furthermore, the study investigates magnetic hysteresis cycles, focusing on the presence of multi-loops and multiple magnetization plateaus. The coercive and saturation fields were carefully analyzed in relation to exchange coupling interactions, temperature, and crystal field parameters.

Daidzein nanosuspension in combination with cisplatin to enhance therapeutic efficacy against A549 non-small lung cancer cells: an in vitro evaluation,"Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality, chemo-resistance, and toxicity limit treatment. The focus is on innovative combined phytotherapy to improve treatment outcomes. Our aim was to investigate the potential effects of daidzein nanosuspension (DZ-NS) and its combination with cisplatin (CIS) on A549 non-small lung cancer cells. Cytotoxicity was investigated using MTT and Chou-Talalay methods. Oxidative, apoptotic, and inflammatory markers were analyzed by ELISA and qRT-PCR. The IC50 value for DZ-NS was 25.23 µM for 24 h and was lower than pure DZ (IC50 = 835 µM for pure DZ). DZ-NS (at IC50x2 and IC50 values) showed synergistic cytotoxicity with CIS. The cells treated with DZ-NS had low TOS and OSI levels. However, DZ-NS failed to regulate Cas3 and TGF-β1 activation in A549 cells. MMP-9 gene expression was significantly suppressed in DZ-NS-treated cells, especially in combination therapy. DZ represents a potential combination option for the treatment of lung cancer, and its poor toxicokinetic properties limit its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, the effects of the nanosuspension formulation were tested. DZ-NS showed a cytotoxic effect on A549 cells and optimized the therapeutic effect of CIS. This in vitro synergistic effect was mediated by suppression of MMP-9 and not by oxidative stress or Cas3-activated apoptosis. This study provides the basis for an in vivo and clinical trial of DZ-NS with concurrent chemotherapy."
Optimized caged silica synthesis with lithium chloride and calcium chloride impregnation for prospective desalination application,"In twentieth century, nations are dealing with several problems related to fresh water availability that needs to be addressed at the earliest. Adsorption desalination by employing inorganic caged silica could be a feasible approach to address this pressing issue. Caged Silica is an inorganic sorbent that is widely employed in a variety of applications, including catalysts, thermal insulation, energy storage batteries, and as an adsorbent in the extraction of fresh water. Researchers have devised several techniques to prepare mono-dispersed caged silica with standard morphology. Template synthesis is quite prominent due to its structural stability and versatility. In this article, we present synthesis of caged silica microsphere via hard template synthesis by employing the process of calcination and subsequent drying. Emulsion polymerization was utilized to develop the polystyrene required in the procedure. This study also looks at how different parameters like silica precursor, surfactant, and catalyst affect silica morphology. We also impregnated Caged silica with 9% of hygroscopic salts (CaCl2 and LiCl) and it showed substantial uptake improvement. Preliminary results showed that LiCl impregnated caged silica is more efficient at water uptake compared to CaCl2.The proposed composite adsorbent (Si-9-Li & Si-9-Ca) could be a stepping stone for improvement in the field of desalination, specifically in adsorbent development, and open new doors to exploration and reliability."

However, the effect of I2 receptor agonists on the abuse liability of opioids is unknown. This study examined the impact of the I2 receptor agonist 2-BFI on some abuse-related behavioral effects of the opioid morphine in rats."
"Silver-Based 3D-Supramolecular Metal–Organic Framework: Crystallographic Evaluation, Antibiotic, Anticancer, and Visible-Light-Driven Photocatalytic Activity","A new dinuclear two-dimensional metal–organic framework (MOF) Ag(I) complex of 4-amino-N-pyridin-2yl-benzenesulfonamide (Ag-sprd) was successfully synthesized and characterized by 1H-NMR, FT-IR, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. The Ag(I) complex crystallizes in monoclinic space group P21/n. The crystal structure shows an Ag(I) metal coordinated with the secondary ligand tetrahydropyrrole (THP). The molecular structure of the dinuclear [Ag2(C11H9N3O2S)2.(C4H8N)2]n displays the two-dimensional polymeric chain linked via Ag1 metal atom to amino nitrogen N1(Ag1-N1 = 2.831 Å). The crystal structure of Ag(I) complex reveals an argentophilic interaction with Ag1-Ag1a distance of 2.9625(4) Å, showing distorted pyramidal shape and geometry index τ5 = 0.51 for Ag1. The Ag1a forms distorted tetrahedral coordination behavior and geometry index τ4 = 0.54. The Ag(I) complex exhibited remarkable photo-degradation of 98.49% within 120 min against the methylene blue (MB) in visible light radiation. Furthermore, we explored interconnects and interaction energy in crystal packing, complex’s active and non-active surfaces, the Hirshfeld surfaces (HS), and energy framework analysis. The stability of the molecule was assessed using DFT calculations like MEP, MPA, HOMO–LUMO energy, and global reactivity descriptors parameters. The Kb (binding constant) value was obtained for the binding behavior of the Ag(I) complex towards CT-DNA by UV–Vis. absorption titration, confirming the intercalation mode of binding.

Bioinformatics prospecting of biological activities of a compound was carried out using Molinspirational and ADMET-SAR studies."
Semi-blind image deblurring based on framelet prior,"The problem of image blurring is one of the most studied topics in the field of image processing. Image blurring is caused by various factors such as hand or camera shake. To restore the blurred image, it is necessary to know information about the point spread function (PSF). And because in the most cases it is not possible to accurately calculate the PSF, we are dealing with an approximate kernel. In this paper, the semi-blind image deblurring problem is studied. Due to the fact that the model of the deblurring problems is an ill-conditioned problem, it is not possible to solve this problem directly. One of the most efficient ways to solve this problem is to use the total variation (TV) method. In the proposed algorithm, by using the framelet transform and fractional calculations, the TV method is improved. The proposed method is used on different types of images and is compared with existing methods with different types of tests."
Sustainable coating solutions: a comparative life cycle analysis of electrophoretic deposition and electroplating for graphene-reinforced anti-wear coatings,"Graphene merges properties such as high conductivity and outstanding mechanical performance. In tribology, it is expected to be an excellent solid lubricant at both the macro-scale and micro-scale. As a result, graphene is particularly suitable for the self-lubricating anti-wear coatings production on metal substrates. Electrodeposition is one of the most effective processes and, therefore, most widely used in industries to produce metal-graphene coatings on conductive substrates. In particular, nickel-graphene electrodeposited coatings are the most present in literature. However, the environmental impact of the galvanic bath represents a limit in the widespread use of co-deposition through electroplating. The electrophoretic deposition may be an appealing alternative despite the solvent used for the graphene dispersion requires a high resource consumption, increasing the environmental impact. This paper investigates electrophoretic deposition and electroplating through life cycle assessment and costing procedures (LCA and LCC). To this aim, different coatings were produced considering many liquid mediums and tested to achieve specified performance. Then, ANOVA, life cycle assessment, and life cycle costing were performed to assess process repeatability and performance in terms of environmental impact. Electrophoretic deposition showed excellent results compared with electroplating, obtaining a maximum wear resistance improvement of over 80% and a significant reduction in environmental impact and cost in all the scenarios."
An algorithm for calculating the shade created by greenhouse integrated photovoltaics,"Integration of photovoltaic modules into greenhouse roofs is a novel and intriguing method. The cost of products grown in greenhouses is particularly high because of their high energy consumption for heating and cooling, and at the same time the increase in demand for available land, increasing its cost and creating spatial issues, the integration of photovoltaics on the roof of greenhouses is a highly viable solution. Simultaneously, the use of solar radiation is critical to maintain optimal crop development, while also being a renewable energy source. However, photovoltaics reduce the incoming solar radiation in the greenhouse, due to their shade. Shading can be either beneficial for the crops or not, depending on the crop type, thus it is vital to find the shading caused by photovoltaics both temporally and spatially. In this study, a model calculating the shading in a greenhouse due to roof-integrated photovoltaics is developed, based on the Sun position, the geometry of both the greenhouse and of the roof-integrated photovoltaics and their position on the greenhouse roof. Calculating the coefficient of variation of radiation data, for the shaded and unshaded areas using the proposed algorithm, it was found the coefficient of variation for the shaded areas is lower than that for the unshaded areas for a least 76% of the time. Also, the radiation values under the shaded area are more uniform. The proposed model is a tool for PV designers, operators, and owners, in order to optimize the potential of their solar panel installations."
Comparative study on safety effects of differential speed limit and uniform speed limit on highways using microsimulation,"This study compared the safety implications of Uniform Speed Limits (USL) and Differential Speed Limits (DSL) on State Highway of India using a microscopic traffic simulation model. According to many studies, speed has the most severe impact on the severity and the frequency of highway accidents. Various speed control strategies are now being incorporated into roads to reduce the frequency of accidents and their risk, as well as reduce the degree of fatalities from accidents. Some speed control strategies used worldwide are USL, DSL, Variable Speed Limits, and Lane-Based Speed Limits. Safety aspects of the selected stretch was analyzed using identified Key Performance Indicators (KPI). The study concluded that, USL is better control strategy in comparison to DSL. Other than speed, DSL's KPIs were greater than USL's. USL appears to be a superior speed control approach than DSL for highways with 60–80 kmph speed limits or below."
The direct impact of pegvisomant on osteoblast functions and bone development,"Acromegaly is a chronic disease characterized by growth hormone (GH) hypersecretion, usually caused by a pituitary adenoma, resulting in elevated circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor type I (IGF-I). Pegvisomant (PEG), the GH-receptor (GHR) antagonist, is used in treating acromegaly to normalize IGF-I hypersecretion. Exposure to increased levels of GH and IGF-I can cause profound alterations in bone structure that are not completely reverted by treatment of GH hypersecretion. Indeed, there is evidence that drugs used for the treatment of acromegaly might induce direct effects on skeletal health regardless of biochemical control of acromegaly."
Comparative Analysis of Teachers’ Assessments on the Traditional and Digital Educational Activities in a Resilient School,"This research aims to explore the potential for enhancing students’ motivation and practical skills within a resilient learning environment through digital technologies. The concept of the unity of education and nature was employed to examine the theoretical foundations of a school’s functioning regarding external conditions that influence overall learning productivity. The practical part of the research involved the application of a quasi-experimental method in which three schools in the Central District of the Russian Federation were selected. General sample consists of 354 people. The primary research method employed was the surveying of the teachers and administration of these educational establishments. The analysis was based on the random sampling approach. The findings revealed that a regular school exhibits slightly more democratic characteristics: 60% of teachers in the resilient school and 70% in the regular school adhere to the protocol-based teaching methodology. Of utmost importance is the indicator of the significance of integrating digital technologies into the educational process. A total of 78% of teachers confirmed the necessity of this measure, while 80% agreed that it would enhance student motivation. This study will contribute to the formulation of essential principles to advance studying process in resilient schools in the future, paying additional attention to the question of the need of learning process digitalization, as 90% of teachers believe in its effectiveness. For instance, this could involve the implementation of specialized educational platforms and applications (Google classroom, Kahoot, Educative Education World Wide, etc.) on the seminars and practical lessons. The results also can be used by the government to implement better schools programs in accordance with school sustainability aspects. Additionally, the question of the impact of a resilient environment on an individual’s success after receiving education (such as in job search and employment) remains an interesting and unexplored area for further experimentation."

Some parallel numerical experiments under OpenACC framework are given to show that the proposed method can accelerate the convergence rate of the existing method significantly."
Exploring the Complex Interplay of Trace Elements and Their Association with the Risk of Development of Pre-eclampsia in Pregnancy: a Case-Control,"Pre-eclampsia, a hypertensive disorder occurring during pregnancy, poses significant risks to maternal and fetal health worldwide. Despite extensive research, the precise cause of pre-eclampsia remains unknown. Recent studies have indicated that trace elements, essential minerals crucial for various biological processes, might be significant factors in the development of pre-eclampsia. This study examines the intricate relationship between trace elements (magnesium, copper, zinc, calcium, phosphorus, and iron) and the severity of pre-eclampsia. The study involves a total of 150 participants, categorized into three distinct groups: 50 individuals with mild pre-eclampsia, 50 with severe pre-eclampsia, and 50 healthy pregnant controls. Specifically, out of the 100 pre-eclampsia cases, 5 were identified as early-onset and 95 as late-onset. Participants were recruited from a tertiary care hospital based on stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. All the trace elements were quantitatively measured by direct colorimetric method using the Beckman Coulter AU480 analyzer system (Beckman Coulter, USA). Pre-eclampsia cases exhibited a significantly lowered level of magnesium (2.02 mg/dL), zinc (57.62 mg/dL), calcium (8.02 mg/dL), and phosphorus (3.93 mg/dL). These levels were approximately 14.4%, 20.2%, 21.1%, and 22.6% lower when compared to healthy pregnant women. Conversely, copper (151.67 mg/dL) and iron (53 μg/dL) levels were significantly elevated in pre-eclampsia cases. Age emerged as a significant risk factor, correlating with heightened pre-eclampsia susceptibility. Magnesium showed a protective effect, correlating negatively with age and positively with gestational age. The complex relationships between trace elements, age, and pre-eclampsia underline the need for personalized interventions, potentially including magnesium supplementation, in high-risk pregnancies."
Applying the Effective Bond Energy Formalism (EBEF) to Describe the Sigma (σ) Phase in the Co-Cr-Ni-Re System,"Proper descriptions of Topologically Closed-Packed (TCP) phases in thermodynamic databases are essential to adequately design new alloys. Thus, the recently introduced Effective Bond Energy Formalism (EBEF) is used in this work to describe the sigma (σ) phase in the Co-Cr-Ni-Re system. The EBEF is applied to a five-sublattice (5-SL) thermodynamic model consistent with its crystal structure and its implementation was supported by new data from Density Functional Theory (DFT). The Matrix Inversion Method is described and used to automate the generation of the EBEF parameters. Good descriptions of the ternary systems are obtained even without any ternary parameters for any of the phases. This is the first time that an EBEF description of a quaternary TCP phase is established using the SGTE descriptions for the pure elements."
Fabrication and characterization of cellulose acetate-EUSOL/polyvinyl alcohol-curcumin electro spun wound dressing for diabetic foot ulcer,"Diabetic foot ulcer is one of the serious complications of diabetes mellitus which grip the world with high comorbidity and mortality rates. The search for the best wound dressings has become more vital due to the rising population and incidence of chronic wounds. Wound dressings with nanofiber coatings have gained greater attention as creative and biocompatible materials. The Edinburg University Solution of Lime (EUSOL) is used an efficacious healing agent in the management of diabetic foot ulcer. In this work, we have fabricated a hybrid electro-spun nanofibrous patch of Cellulose Acetate (CA)/Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) with the encapsulation of therapeutic agent (EUSOL) and antimicrobial agent (Curcumin) respectively, for the immediate release of curcumin and sustain release of EUSOL to give antimicrobial effect and to promote granulation of tissues. The resultant Nano-fibrous films were characterized by SEM, ATR-FTIR, water contact angle measurement, tensile strength testing and UV–VIS Spectrophotometry to examine the morphology and chemical composition, wettability, stress–strain behavior and drug release profile. The drug release kinetics was evaluated through mathematical models Higuchi’s and Korsmeyer- Peppas. The characterization analysis shows the successful fabrication of nanofiber films. The release kinetic behavior of both encapsulated agents satisfied Higuchi’s model with co-efficient of correlation r2 = 0.91 and 0.86 which indicated that drug release diffusion is controlled. Dissolution was noticed as anomalous transport as fitted using Korsmeyer-Peppas equation. Consequently, the hybrid CA-EUSOL/PVA-Curcumin nanofibrous scaffolds are hopeful candidates for the sustainable and immediate release of therapeutic and antimicrobial agents to fabricate diabetic foot ulcer wound dressing."
Small object detection model for UAV aerial image based on YOLOv7,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) aerial image target detection mainly faces the problems of small targets and target occlusion. In order to improve detection accuracy while maintaining efficiency, this work introduces a UAV aerial image small object detection model based on the real-time detector YOLOv7(SOD-YOLOv7). To address the challenge of small object detection, we have designed a module that combines Swin Transformer and convolution to better capture the global context information of small objects in the image. Additionally, we have introduced the Bi-Level Routing Attention (BRA) mechanism to enhance the model's focus on small objects. To improve the model's detection capabilities at multiple scales, we have added detection branches. For the issue of detecting occluded objects, we have incorporated a dynamic detection head with deformable convolution and attention mechanisms to enhance the model's spatial awareness of targets. The experimental results on the VisDrone and CARPK unmanned aerial vehicle image datasets show that the average precision (mAP@0.5) of our model reaches 53.2% and 98.5%, respectively. Compared to the original YOLOv7 method, our model achieves an improvement of 4.3% and 0.3%, demonstrating better performance in detecting small objects. The code will be soon released at https://github.com/Gentle-Hui/SOD-YOLOv7."
Attention-based multi-scale recursive residual network for low-light image enhancement,"Aiming at the problems of color distortion, low image processing efficiency, rich context information, spatial information imbalance in the current low-light image enhancement algorithm based on a convolutional neural network. In this paper, an Attention-based multi-scale recursive residual network for low-light image enhancement (AMR-Net) is proposed based on high-resolution, single-scale image processing. First, shallow features are extracted using convolution and channel attention. In the recursive residual unit, a parallel multi-scale residual block is constructed, and the image features are extracted from the three scales: original image resolution, 1/2 resolution, and 1/4 resolution. Then, the deep features and shallow features are connected by selective kernel feature fusion to obtain rich context information and spatial information. Finally, the residual image is obtained by convolution processing of the deep features, and the enhanced image is obtained by adding the original image to the residual image. The experimental results on LOL, LIME, DICM, MEF datasets show that the proposed method has achieved good results in multiple indicators, and reasonably restored the brightness, contrast, and details of the image, thereby intuitively improving the perceived quality of the image."
Quaternion Hyperbolic Fourier Transforms and Uncertainty Principles,"The present study introduces the two-sided and right-sided Quaternion Hyperbolic Fourier Transforms (QHFTs) for analyzing two-dimensional quaternion-valued signals defined in an open rectangle of the Euclidean plane endowed with a hyperbolic measure. The different forms of these transforms are defined by replacing the Euclidean plane waves with the corresponding hyperbolic plane waves in one dimension, giving the hyperbolic counterpart of the corresponding Euclidean Quaternion Fourier Transforms. Using hyperbolic geometry tools, we study the main operational and mapping properties of the QHFTs, such as linearity, shift, modulation, dilation, symmetry, inversion, and derivatives. Emphasis is placed on novel hyperbolic derivative and hyperbolic primitive concepts, which lead to the differentiation and integration properties of the QHFTs. We further prove the Riemann–Lebesgue Lemma and Parseval’s identity for the two-sided QHFT. Besides, we establish the Logarithmic, Heisenberg–Weyl, Donoho–Stark, and Benedicks’ uncertainty principles associated with the two-sided QHFT by invoking hyperbolic counterparts of the convolution, Pitt’s inequality, and the Poisson summation formula. This work is motivated by the potential applications of the QHFTs and the analysis of the corresponding hyperbolic quaternionic signals."
Structural Investigation and Optical Properties of Dysprosium (Dy3+) Ions Doped Oxyfluoro Antimony Borate Glasses for Photonics Applications,"Dysprosium oxide-doped glasses with a composition of 60B2O3-10Sb2O3-10Al2O3-10NaF-(10-x) LiF-xDy2O3 (x = 0.1,0.5, 1.0,1.5,2.0,2.5 mol%) were prepared using a conventional melt-quenching technique. The glasses were characterized through various analytical investigations, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, refractive index, density, optical absorption, excitation, photoluminescence (PL) studies, decay measurements and radiation shielding parameters. The XRD and FT-IR confirms the glassy nature and functional groups present in the titled glass. The absorption spectra were used to determine the oscillator strength of the Dy3+ absorption transitions as well as the bond created with the O−2 ion in the titled glass network. The degree of the suitability of developed glasses for lasing applications was demonstrated by radiative parameters determined using Judd–Ofelt theory. In the prepared glass samples, the optical bandgap measurements indicate the presence of non-bridging oxygen (NBOs), localization of charges and donor centers in the titled glasses. Due to the de-excitation of 4F9/2 to the corresponding 6H15/2,6H13/2 and 6H11/2 states, the PL emission spectrum shows two main strong emissions at blue(480nm), yellow (575nm) and one less emission at red (663nm). The CIE coordinates determined using PL emission spectra reveal the coordinates that are falling within the white light region. Various shielding parameters such as mass attenuation coefficient, mean free path, effective atomic number were estimated to understand the radiative shielding nature of the titled glasses. Within the addition of Dy2O3, it was found that the shielding parameters values of the titled glass samples are increasing. The Mass Attenuation Coefficient, Half Value Layer and Mean Free Path of the as prepared glasses has been compared with different types of concretes to understand the shielding effectiveness of prepared glass."
Synthesis of Yellow Fluorescence Carbon Dots for the Applications of Vitamin B12 Detection and Cell Imaging,"In this work, bright yellow fluorescent and multifunctional carbon dots (N-CDs) were prepared by hydrothermal method from O-phenylenediamine and 4-aminobenzoic acid. The fluorescence characterization showed that the N-CDs possessed good optical properties (QY = 32%) and excitation dependent multi-color emission. By exciting with 390 nm, the strong selective interaction of VB12 with N-CDs could result in a sharp decrease in the luminescence of N-CDs at 567 nm. An efficient fluorescence sensor in aqueous solution was constructed which could linearly respond VB12 in wide concentration ranges of 0–90 μM and 140–250 μM. The linear correlation coefficients of N-CDs and VB12 were 0.9950 and 0.9968, respectively, and the detection limit was 0.119 μM. N-CDs were performed for sensitive determination of VB12 in real samples. Moreover, the N-CDs were exploited to image cell. This N-CDs was a sensitive fluorescence probe to monitor VB12 and presented prospective potential in living cells imaging."
Fluorescent and Electrochemical Sensor Based on Basic Red 9 Dye Functionalised Graphene Oxide-Montmorillonite Composite for Selective Detection of Cerium (III) Ion,"In this work, graphene oxide (GO) has been prepared from used dry cells using modified Hummer’s method and encapsulated with montmorillonite clay. To enhance its electrical property, the GO-MMT composite has been functionalised with Basic Red 9 dye. The sensor was characterized by various spectroscopic techniques like FT-IR spectroscopy, PXRD, SEM analysis, etc. Basic Red 9 dye functionalised GO-MMT composite has been employed for fluorescent and electrochemical detection of Ce3+ ion. The fluorescent turn-on sensing is sensitive, reversible and free from interference from other metal ions. The detection of Ce3+ ion by the sensor was also conducted in bovine serum albumin (BSA) medium. Pt electrode modified with the hybrid sensor produces excellent electrochemical change in presence of Ce3+ ion through cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry technique. The limit of detection (LOD) from fluorescence spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry were calculated to be 0.6556 × 10− 9 M, 1.232 × 10− 9 M and 1.923 × 10− 9 M respectively."
"Prevalence, reasons for use, perceived benefits, and awareness of health risks of cannabis use among cancer survivors – implications for policy and interventions","There is increasing discourse on the use of cannabis as a palliative for cancer/cancer-treatment-related symptoms.

Improvement in mechanical and microstructural properties of novel TA7/Nb/Cu/SS304 composite joints by reducing intermetallic compounds,"The joining of titanium and stainless steel is challenging with conventional filler metals due to the formation of Fe-Ti intermetallic compounds (IMCs). Therefore, a filler that is compatible with both metals is necessary to avoid these IMCs and enhance the mechanical properties of Ti-SS joint. This research aims to investigate the effect of novel Nb-Cu composite filler on mechanical and microstructure properties of TA7-SS304 dissimilar hybrid composite joints using gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process. The mechanical properties: ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and micro hardness have been analyzed and assessed through the microstructure of weld interfaces and fracture zones. Results revealed that welding current (I) affects the UTS significantly whereas micro hardness is greatly influenced by welding speed (Ws). The maximum UTS of 293 MPa and micro hardness of 100 HV as well as minimum tensile residual stresses of 180 MPa and 170 MPa on SS 304 and TA7 sides, respectively have been attained at optimal parameters of I = 40 A, Ws = 150 mm/min and GFR = 18 lit/min. SEM and EDS analysis showed that presence of Cu and Nb solid solutions in the fusion zone contributed to improvement in UTS. Ductile fracture surface with no prominent defects is obtained at optimal combination, while brittle fracture with voids and cavities is observed for low-strength joints. X-ray diffraction analysis depicted that the formation of TiFe, Ti2Fe, and TiFe2 compounds and direct mixing of base metals have been successfully inhibited by using Nb-Cu composite filler which improved the Ti-SS bonding."

"Clinical, oral immunological and microbiological shifts during and after pregnancy","Physiological changes and shifts in the oral microbiota composition during pregnancy may affect the maternal immune system. Uncomplicated pregnancy is associated with a T-helper (Th) 2 predominant cytokine regulation (anti-inflammatory), while oral health deterioration during pregnancy is reflected by severe gingival inflammation, a primarily Th1 cytokine phenotype (pro-inflammatory), and oral microbiome alterations. This prospective observational study aimed to evaluate Th cytokine shifts and changes in the oral microbiota composition in saliva of women before and after birth."
Co-metabolic degradation and metabolite detection of hexabromocyclododecane by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1,"Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) is a widely used brominated flame retardant; however, it is a persistent organic pollutant as well as affects the human thyroid hormones and causes cancer. However, the degradation of HBCD has received little attention from researchers. Due to its bioaccumulative and hazardous properties, an appropriate strategy for its remediation is required. In this study, we investigated the biodegradation of HBCD using Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 under optimized conditions. The Box-Behnken design (BBD) was implemented for the optimization of the physical degradation parameters of HBCD. S. oneidensis MR-1 showed the best degradation performance at a temperature of 30 °C, pH 7, and agitation speed of 115 rpm, with an HBCD concentration of 1125 μg/L in mineral salt medium (MSM). The strain tolerated up to 2000 μg/L HBCD. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis identified three intermediates, including 2-bromo dodecane, 2,7,10-trimethyldodecane, and 4-methyl-1-decene. The results provide an insightful understanding of the biodegradation of HBCD by S. oneidensis MR-1 under optimized conditions and could pave the way for further eco-friendly applications."
Cardiac Biomarkers Aid in Differentiation of Kawasaki Disease from Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with COVID-19,"Kawasaki disease (KD) and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 show clinical overlap and both lack definitive diagnostic testing, making differentiation challenging. We sought to determine how cardiac biomarkers might differentiate KD from MIS-C. The International Kawasaki Disease Registry enrolled contemporaneous KD and MIS-C pediatric patients from 42 sites from January 2020 through June 2022. The study population included 118 KD patients who met American Heart Association KD criteria and compared them to 946 MIS-C patients who met 2020 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition. All included patients had at least one measurement of amino-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) or cardiac troponin I (TnI), and echocardiography. Regression analyses were used to determine associations between cardiac biomarker levels, diagnosis, and cardiac involvement. Higher NTproBNP (≥ 1500 ng/L) and TnI (≥ 20 ng/L) at presentation were associated with MIS-C versus KD with specificity of 77 and 89%, respectively. Higher biomarker levels were associated with shock and intensive care unit admission; higher NTproBNP was associated with longer hospital length of stay. Lower left ventricular ejection fraction, more pronounced for MIS-C, was also associated with higher biomarker levels. Coronary artery involvement was not associated with either biomarker. Higher NTproBNP and TnI levels are suggestive of MIS-C versus KD and may be clinically useful in their differentiation. Consideration might be given to their inclusion in the routine evaluation of both conditions."
Dune Blowouts as Microbial Hotspots and the Changes of Overall Microbial Activity and Photosynthetic Biomass Along with Succession of Biological Soil Crusts,"Biological soil crust (BSC) constitutes a consortium of cyanobacteria, algae, lichen, mosses, and heterotrophic microorganisms, forming a miniature ecosystem within the uppermost soil layer. The biomass of different organisms forming BSC and their activity changes along with succession. Previous studies focused primarily on BSC in hyper-arid/arid regions, whereas the ecophysiology of BSC in temperate climates is still not well recognized. In order to determine changes in overall microbial activity and photosynthetic biomass in BSC at different stages of the succession of inland sandy grasslands, we analyzed dehydrogenase activity and determined the content of photosynthetic pigments. We also compared these parameters between BSC developed on the dune ridges and aeolian blowouts in the initial stage of succession. Our study revealed a significant increase in both photosynthetic biomass and overall microbial activity in BSC as the succession of inland shifting sands progresses. We found that chl a concentration in BSC could be considered a useful quantitative indicator of both the presence of photoautotrophs and the degree of soil crust development in warm-summer humid continental climates. The photosynthetic biomass was closely related to increased microbial activity in BSC, which suggests that photoautotrophs constitute a major BSC component. Dune blowouts constitute environmental niches facilitating the development of BSC, compared to dune ridges. High biomass of microorganisms in the dune blowouts may be associated with a high amount of organic material and more favorable moisture conditions. We conclude that deflation fields are key places for keeping a mosaic of habitats in the area of shifting sands and can be a reservoir of microorganisms supporting further settlement of dune slopes by BSC."

Strong Two and Three-Photon Absorption Coefficients of Gold-Doped Titanium Di-Oxide Nanoparticles Achieved by Femtosecond Z-Scan Technique,"Titanium dioxide (TiO2) semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) have promising applications in many fields of science. In particular, as photocatalysts TiO2 NPs are unique for their special optical and electronic properties. Plasmonic metal doping of TiO2 NPs modifies the optical bandgaps of the composite NPs, due to which their applications will be extended in the visible spectral range. In the present study, gold (Au) doped TiO2 NPs (in powder form) were synthesized in the deposition–precipitation method at two different concentrations of Au (25% and 50%). Subsequently, dispersions were prepared by dispersing the Au-TiO2 NPs in ethanol. Nonlinear optical (NLO) studies of the Au-doped TiO2 dispersions (0.25 Au-TiO2, 0.50 Au-TiO2NPs) were carried out by employing the laser pulses of duration ~ 150 fs at a repetition rate ~ 76 MHz, in open aperture (OA) and closed aperture (CA) Z-scan methods. Wavelength-dependent NLO studies of Au-TiO2 NPs (0.25 Au-TiO2, 0.50 Au-TiO2 NPs) have been carried out at different input wavelengths 700 nm, 750 nm, 800 nm, 850 nm, 900 nm, and 950 nm. It was observed that the recorded OA data fit well to three-photon absorption (3PA) for the 0.25 of Au doping, whereas for 0.50 Au-TiO2NPs data fitting was pretty good for two-photon absorption (2PA), for the input wavelengths starting from 800 nm, 850 nm, 900 nm, and 950 nm. At 700 nm, 0.25 Au-TiO2 NPs demonstrated reverse saturable absorption (RSA) in saturable absorption (SA), and 750 nm normalized transmittance exhibited a W-shaped signature (saturation in 2PA). Similarly, 700 nm, 750 nm, and 0.50 Au-TiO2 NPs have illustrated very strong 3PA at the input wavelengths. However, the pure TiO2 NPs in ethanol have demonstrated pure 2PA. CA traces recorded for both 0.25 Au and 0.50 Au TiO2 NPs in ethanol at all mentioned incident wavelengths, demonstrated a negative signature for the intensity dependent refractive index  (n2)."
Comparison between stapled hemorrhoidopexy and harmonic scalpel hemorrhoidectomy in the management of third- and fourth-degree piles: a randomized clinical trial,"This study compared the results of stapled hemorrhoidopexy (SH) and harmonic scalpel hemorrhoidectomy (HSH) in the management of grade III and grade IV piles regarding the time of the procedure, postoperative pain, patient satisfaction, wound infection, bleeding, incontinence, and recurrence within 1 year."
Probing the Interaction Between Red Blood Cells and Gold Nanoparticles by Optical Tweezer,"In nanomedicine, efficiency of nano-medical drugs requires basic study of interactions between nanoparticles and red blood cell (RBC). The mechanical properties of RBC are important for blood microcirculation, which may get affected by nanoparticles. The main focus of the study is to probe gold nanoparticles (AuNP) interaction with single RBC using optical tweezer technique. AuNPs were selected due to their wide application in nanomedicine. In the present work, RBCs were suspended in the controlled volume of AuNP solution at different nanoparticle concentrations and incubated at 37 °C for different time periods. After the incubation, mechanical properties of RBC were investigated using single-beam optical tweezer. Additional information about RBC-AuNP interaction was obtained by UV-visible spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Optical tweezer measurements results demonstrated that force required to trap RBC increases with increase in concentration of AuNP. Up to 40 nM concentration of AuNP, there were no significant effects on Soret band (409–413 nm), oxygenation state, and deformability properties of RBC. Folding time (the time required to trap the RBC completely when the trapping laser switches on) and unfolding time (the time required to recover the initial shape of RBC after the trapping laser switches off) of RBC did not change in the presence of AuNP. The UV-visible and Raman spectroscopy data are complementing with the optical trapping results. Gold nanoparticles do not affect the physiology of RBC up to 40 nM concentration of AuNP. Optical tweezer provides real-time insight which is a useful tool in nanomedicine, nanorobotic, and biomedical applications."
Solar Light-Responsive ZnS/Reduced Graphene Oxide Photocatalysts for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution,"The photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution process under solar-light irradiation is a crucial fundamental step for solar energy exploitation. In our study, the ZnS/reduced graphene oxide (ZnS/rGO) composites were prepared using a simple solvothermal approach. The combination of detailed theoretical simulation calculations and comprehensive characterizations indicates that the rGO can greatly increase the capture of light, reduce the band gap, accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, and provide more photo-induced carriers to participate in photocatalytic reactions. The as-formed optimized ZnS/rGO composites exhibit a remarkably superior photocatalytic H2 production capacity of 0.30 mmol/g/h, up to 4.29 times over bare ZnS nanoparticles. The enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of the ZnS/rGO composites was ascribed to the intimated hetero-interface between components and the efficient transfer of photo-generated electrons from ZnS to rGO. This work provides new insights into the semiconductor-graphene heterojunction photocatalyst for enhancing photocatalytic activity."
Hydrometallurgical Processing of a Manganese Concentrate by Acid Digestion–Leaching Method,"In the following study, acid digestion of a manganese concentrate followed by water leaching was investigated. Sulfuric acid was used for digestion due to its cheapness and availability. The concentrate was composed of pyrolusite, manganite, quartz, goethite, and lime. Manganese and iron contents of the concentrate were 39.25% and 4.01%, respectively. First, the thermodynamics of the digestion process was studied. Then, the effects of digestion temperature, digestion time, and weight ratio of sulfuric acid to concentrate (S/C) on extraction efficiency were investigated. The optimal digestion conditions were determined as follows: temperature of 300 °C, time of 3 h, and S/C of 4.5. Some 97% of manganese and 66% of iron were extracted by digestion–leaching under these conditions. The concentrations of manganese and iron in the optimal leach liquor were 32.3 and 3.4 g/L, respectively. These results were achieved using sulfuric acid, which is a cheap digestive agent. More expensive reagents and higher temperatures are required to obtain such high efficiencies by reductive leaching and roasting–leaching methods, respectively, which are the other methods of manganese extraction. Therefore, this research showed that digestion–leaching is a suitable method for processing of manganese concentrates and can be efficiently used instead of reductive leaching which is the most common method."
The Acute Effects of Focused Attention and Open Monitoring Meditations on Prospective Memory in Older Adults,"This study explored the acute effects of meditation on prospective memory (PM) in older adults. Study 1 evaluated whether focused attention (FA) meditation improves PM, while Study 2 investigated whether open monitoring (OM) meditation can facilitate PM under the influence of a negative mood."
Genome-wide identification of simple sequence repeats and development of polymorphic SSR markers in brown trout (Salmo trutta),"In China, the brown trout is a second-level key aquatic wildlife protection animal in the Tibet Autonomous Region. In order to protect the brown trout germplasm resources in the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Institute of Aquatic Sciences of the Academy of Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Sciences of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Heilongjiang Institute of the Chinese Academy of Aquatic Sciences collaborated on research on the key technologies of brown trout family construction. A fast in silico simulation method was employed in this study to discover numerous polymorphic SSRs. A total of 1,115,563 SSR loci with two to six nucleotide repeat motifs were mined from 40 chromosomes of the brown trout reference genome by GMATA. The whole genome sequences (30×) of 30 brown trout samples were compared to the reference genome’s chromosome sequence. Then, the HipSTR program was employed to carry out in silico genotyping through comparisons and enumerations of repeat count variants on the motifs of the SSR loci among the samples. The loci with monomorphism and high deletion in the SSR genotype data were removed, and the loci with more than one non-reference allele were retained. The final set of polymorphic SSR loci screened was 106,194. Forty-three SSR markers were randomly selected for characteristic analysis. The range of alleles per locus was 3 to 9 (mean = 5). Observed heterozygosity was in the ranged from 0.167 to 1.000. Expected heterozygosity was in the ranged from 0.155 to 0.823. Twenty-three loci significantly deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These SSR markers will provide valuable information for assessing the genetic diversity of constructed brown trout families and for the genetic improvement of brown trout."
Immobilization of oligo DNA strands on TEMPO-oxidized pulp fibers and evaluation of duplex formation,"Paper fiber functionalization by modification with DNA molecules expands the applicability and specificity of paper-substrate analytical devices such as microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (µPADs). In this study, a simple amide condensation reaction was performed on 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-oxidized pulp fibers to covalently immobilize oligo DNA chains. The fluorescently labeled DNA with confocal laser scanning microscopy, revealed DNA immobilization on the pulp fiber surface and inside the pulp fiber wall. This immobilized DNA sequence-selectively recognized the complementary strand at concentrations of 10−8 M and above. This DNA duplex formation was also explored in terms of the negative charges on the pulp surface. With greater concentrations of carboxyl groups on the pulp material, DNA duplex formation efficiency was lowered. This is proposed to be due to the negatively charged surface imposing a repulsive electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged DNA. In addition, duplex formation and melting on the pulp surface was shown to be temperature-dependent and reversible."
A neighborhood-aware multi-Markovian switching particle swarm optimization technique for solving complex and expensive problems,"Particle swarm optimization approach (PSO) has illustrated promising performance on a variety of optimization problems. The critical issues that must be addressed in PSO research are how to balance conflicts around exploration, exploitation, and reasonably distribute computational resources. In this paper, a neighborhood-aware N states Markovian Switching PSO algorithm (NS-MJPSOloc) is proposed, where we have employed a local search based approach. The neighborhood of PSO algorithm is a single particle itself in the early stages of optimization. The neighborhood will eventually expand to include all particles as the amount of generations increases. The search space is segmented into N potential states according to the size of problem. The value of N is dependent on the dimension of problem space. Every iteration serves a transition probability-based Markovian switching technique to estimate the acceleration coefficients in an adaptable way. The transition probability determines the next state and adequate values for acceleration coefficients. Through adopting a local search strategy while interacting with all other particles in the group, every particle possesses a chance of improving itself. Moreover, new features have been incorporated to accomplish accuracy and stability. The primary contributions of the proposed work are to enhance the topological structure of a recently developed PSO variant by using a local search (loc) mechanism rather than a global (gbest) approach. The purpose of this idea is to develop a more adaptable and less sensitive novel version of PSO that can handle multi-modal and highly challenging problems. The proposed algorithm was then tested using a variety of uni-modal, multi-modal and rotated benchmark functions. The experimental findings show that the proposed NS-MJPSOloc outperformed most of the current versions in terms of accuracy and convergence time, notably for multi-modal problems."
A load balancing method for avionics systems via artificial bee colony and simulated annealing algorithms,"Avionics systems are a crucial part of aircraft, and the heterogeneity of resources also leads to load differentials within these systems. Inefficient load balancing technology faces the dual challenge of over-utilization and under-utilization of resources, which results in the decline of service performance (in the case of over-utilization) or the waste of resources (in the case of under-utilization). However, it is necessary to control avionics systems via an efficient load balancing method under time constraints and resource states. Therefore, this paper proposes a load balancing method for avionics systems using both artificial bee colony and simulated annealing algorithms. First, the load balancing model of avionics systems is established; this model can reflect the demands of the tasks for the resources in detail. Then, the load balancing of avionics systems is realized by artificial bee colony and simulated annealing algorithms, the hybrid algorithm not only retains the advantages of simple and easy implementation of ABC algorithm, but also utilizes the probability jump of SA algorithm to jump out of the local extreme and achieve the effect of global optimization. Finally, compared with the existing algorithms, the experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper produces a good and stable load balance performance."
Dual-stream framework for image-based heart infarction detection using convolutional neural networks,"Heart infarction has become one of the major causes of global death in recent decades. As the aging society intensifies, many elderly people living alone are facing life-threatening situations brought on by sudden heart attacks or infarctions. Researchers have been investigating vision-based, economical, and effective ways to monitor health status in real time in recent years. Motivated by this, this work presents a dual-stream network framework that takes into account both facial features and general whole image features and employs the feature interaction strategies in the framework structure. Furthermore, to cope with the lack of relevant datasets, we propose a novel image dataset for the detection of chest pain and falls which are the significant vital signs of myocardial infarction. With an accuracy of 88.98\(\%\), our approach validates the viability of identifying cases of myocardial infarction in practical situations. Numerous experiments demonstrate our proposed framework’s effectiveness and its extensibility to be deployed on mobile smart platforms."
Low-Dose CT Image Denoising with a Residual Multi-scale Feature Fusion Convolutional Neural Network and Enhanced Perceptual Loss,"Computed tomography (CT) stands as a pivotal medical imaging technique, delivering timely and reliable clinical evaluations. Yet, its dependence on ionizing radiation raises health concerns. One mitigation strategy involves using reduced radiation for low-dose CT (LDCT) imaging; however, this often results in noise artifacts that undermine diagnostic precision. To address this issue, a distinctive CT image denoising technique has been introduced that utilizes deep neural networks to suppress image noise. This advanced CT image denoising network employs an attention mechanism for the feature extraction stage, facilitating the adaptive fusion of multi-scale local characteristics and channel-wide dependencies. Furthermore, a novel residual block has been incorporated, crafted to generate features with superior representational abilities, factoring in diverse spatial scales and eliminating redundant features. A unique loss function is also developed to optimize network parameters, focusing on preserving structural information by capturing high-frequency components and perceptually important details. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network in enhancing the quality of LDCT images."
Local image segmentation model via Hellinger distance,"Highly accurate active contour models are widely used in various image segmentation methods. In this paper, we propose an image segmentation model based on Hellinger distance for local region intensity fitting (HD-LRIF). The method defines two different metrics based on the Hellinger distance and constructs a new data fitting term to segment the image efficiently by minimizing the energy function. In addition, our method is independent of the initial contour and the segmentation results consistently obtain high accuracy. The experimental results show that the HD-LRIF model is far superior to state-of-the-art segmentation methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, it can effectively filter the noise interference, thus enhancing robustness and improving the accuracy of image segmentation in general."
Optimization of film-type optical fiber wiring design using mixed-integer programming problem,"Optical fibers are among the most widely used tools in information communication today, and they have had an active development trajectory. Film interconnection is among the methods applied to optical fibers. However, due to its characteristics, the interconnection design must be done well so that each fiber satisfies several design requirements. In this study, we developed a mathematical model for automatic wiring design using film optical fiber interconnections. To design optical fiber routing from the top to the bottom of the film, we propose an exact solution method using a mixed-integer programming problem and a heuristic method based on the exact solution method. In this paper, we compare the results of our methods with rule-based methods and confirm that our methods are superior. For the experiments, we created sample data based on a previous joint research project with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. and used it. Additionally, we investigated conditions for wiring design, and this paper discusses conditions for obtaining more efficient wiring methods."
The Effect of the Global Health Crisis on Organizational Marketing and Culture of Innovation,"The study examined how SME’s particularly in emerging economies should choose and implement marketing innovation strategies based on external factors, internal advantages, and their own characteristics, enriching crisis management literature and providing new scenarios for research on marketing innovations, consumer behavior and patterns during and after the global crises. The survey included 217 SME’s in Nigeria. The ‘A’ priori sample size calculator for structural equation models determines the sample size. Data was analyzed using PLS-SEM to appropriately estimate study latent construct relationships. The findings of the study indicated that the global health crisis has affected organizational innovation, consumption, and behavior. Due to technological adoption and complexity, market innovation methods have not been severely impacted by the epidemic. This study also examines how organizations might develop and execute pandemic strategies and concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical consequences that may guide future research. Using the global health crisis to understand shifts in the culture of innovation, consumer behaviors, and market innovation strategies in an organization to improve performance and ensure firm continuity, this study identified several business performance options, a suitable path to explore, and the impact of using it to retain market space in line with consumption patterns. This research examines how the global health crisis affects organizational cultures of innovation and performance. This is accomplished in light of the significance of SMEs’ creative efforts in Nigeria in achieving the goals of idea-driven enterprises. Finally, the study recommended four marketing innovation strategies for SME’s and organizations to choose from for crisis management and control in the pandemic and post pandemic crisis."
The application of 5E rehabilitation management mode in the nursing of patients with aortic dissection complicated by obstructive sleep apnea,"This study was designed to explore the effect of 5E rehabilitation mode (encouragement, education, exercise, employment, and evaluation) in patients with aortic dissection (AD) complicated by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)."
Marine debris facilitates the long-distance dispersal of fish species,"Drifting marine debris has been shown to host associated biological communities and facilitate their dispersal. Little is known about how biota engage with, and are transported by, this debris. This study characterizes debris-associated communities and explores the role of plastics in transferring fishes to new geographic regions. ~ 1500 underwater photographs were reviewed from five cruises during 2018–2020: one between Japan and Hawaii encompassing the Western and Eastern Pacific Ocean (Group I), and four passing through the North Pacific Garbage Patch in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (Group II). Debris properties were recorded and 13 associated fish species from 43 debris items were identified. Fish communities around marine debris have low diversity, individual debris items have highly dissimilar species compositions, and species composition is affected by horizontal debris item size. Debris items in Group I have significantly higher fish species diversity and differ in community composition from Group II. Four taxa (Abudefduf vaigiensis, Histrio histrio, Oplegnathus punctatus, and Petroscirtes spp.) were observed surviving east of the Hawaiian Islands, where they have not been previously reported. Marine debris is found to be a mobile natural habitat substitute that can facilitate long-distance species dispersal. While natural flotsam has long been a potential vector, long-lived and increasingly abundant plastic debris may set the stage for altering fish biogeography."
Two-dimensional directed lamellar assembly in silicon- and fluorine-containing block copolymer with identical surface energies,"A block copolymer (BCP) with specific monomer structures of fluoroacrylate polymers was designed by exploiting the inorganic superhydrophobicity and low glass transition temperature of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). With the use of a fluorine-containing block providing a surface tension as low as that of PDMS (19.9 < \(\gamma\) < 21.5 mN/m), PDMS-b-poly(2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl acrylate) (PDMS-b-PPeFPA) copolymer was synthesized to create a volume-symmetric lamellar structure. The compositional randomness of the BCP chains adsorbed onto the substrates provided well-balanced interfacial interactions toward the overlaid PDMS-b-PPeFPA (\(\gamma\)PDMS-ads ≈ \(\gamma\)PPeFPA-ads). Under this symmetric confinement with simultaneous dual neutral interfaces, lamellar microdomains with a sub-10 nm half-pitch feature size were successfully oriented perpendicular to the interfaces at room temperature. We showed the response of the BCP films to a lateral electric field, demonstrating that the perpendicular lamellae were adaptively aligned along the electric vector within a short treatment period. Furthermore, the PDMS-b-PPeFPA system exhibited a remarkable etch contrast for O2 reactive ion etching, yielding unidirectionally aligned air–inorganic nanoarrays emanating from the perpendicular lamellae between the electrodes. This study reports a system engineering approach for conceiving highly immiscible, silicon- and fluorine-containing BCP whose components exhibit identical surface tensions (\(\gamma\)PDMS ≈ \(\gamma\)PPeFPA) and for generating perpendicularly oriented lamellar microdomains due to substrate neutrality."
The Impacts of Policy Uncertainty on Asset Prices: Evidence from China’s Market,"We employ the ""Two Sessions,"" comprising the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, as a proxy for measuring policy uncertainty. In our analysis, we utilize a regression model, the three-path mediated effect framework, and the Campbell and Shiller decomposition method to delve into the influence of policy uncertainty on asset pricing within China’s financial market. Our findings reveal an increase in stock returns during the months leading up to the ""Two Sessions,"" evident at both the market and firm levels. Notably, the extent to which stock returns respond to policy uncertainty is contingent on various firm-specific characteristics, including ownership structure, company size, and profitability. Furthermore, our investigation confirms that investor sentiment serves as a complete mediator in the relationship between policy uncertainty and its impact on asset prices. Additionally, we identify future cash flow as the primary conduit through which policy uncertainty directly exerts its influence on asset prices."
Spillover Effect of Green Bond with Metal and Bullion Market,"This paper examines the spillover of green bond with metal market and bullion market using the daily observation from 16/06/2014 to 25/02/2022. The S&P Green Bond (GBD) is used to measure the Green bond while Copper (CPR) and Aluminium (ALM) are used to represent the metal market; the bullion market is measured by Silver (SLV) and Gold (GLD). The result reveals that there is spillover from Green bond to Aluminium, Silver and Gold both in the short run and long while the spillover of Green bond with Copper is only spotted in long run. It furnishes diversification opportunities considering Green bond and Copper in short run due to its absence of spillover. This study offers an implication to various stakeholder of the metal and bullion market."
From Chosen to Forced: A Qualitative Exploration of Nurses’ Experiences With Overtime,"Overtime is a hot issue in the nursing profession. Despite much debate around this topic in North America, few research has questioned how overtime is perceived by nurses. Using a qualitative research design, this paper offers an in-depth analysis of nurses’ perceptions of overtime in the province of Quebec, Canada. We drew on data from 42 semi-directive interviews, led by one of the authors with nurses in various healthcare establishments between March 2020 and February 2021. It emerged from our content analysis that (1) nurses’ experiences of overtime are dependent on both contextual (ie. workplace, department, position, general context) and individual (ie. negotiation, time management skills) factors; (2) despite important differences in how much and how often they were required to do so, most participants reported having been in the obligation to do overtime either from their own sense of professional duty or by submission to persuasive tactics by the employer; and (3) there were reports of negative outcomes resulting from being forced to work overtime, for nurses and healthcare institutions alike. These findings contribute to the literature by mapping out the ways in which nurses may experience overtime and identifying the most vulnerable cases. Practical implications are discussed in an effort to think of solutions for nurse well-being and retention in the profession."
Two-Phase Numerical Simulation for the Heat and Mass Transfer Evaluation Across a Vertical Deformable Sheet with Significant Impact of Solar Radiation and Heat Source/Sink,"The growing need for industrial development, limited availability of non-renewable energy resources, minimizing energy consumption, and ecosystem concerns has prompted researchers to explore the practical applications of two-phase nanofluid materials processing and electromagnetic energy emitted via the sun. Therefore, using two-phase nanofluids in solar thermal technology systems can enhance system performance by improving heat absorption and transfer efficiency. Owing to its usage, this study examines the magnetized two-phase nanofluid flow on a two-dimensional laminar mixed convective boundary layer with the impact of multiple slips. The flow contains an electrically conducting non-Newtonian nanofluid over a deformable (stretching/shrinking) sheet with a solar radiation effect. Also, the study utilizes a nonlinear Roseland diffusion flux approximation to incorporate the solar radiation effect, which is valid for nanofluid media with high optical density. This work utilizes similarity variables to simplify the partial derivative model into ordinary differential equations. These equations are then solved using the wavelets and Chebyshev wavelets scheme with the help of MATHEMATICA 11.3 software. According to the findings, the nanoparticle volume fraction is increased for high electrical conductivity (M = 2) and decreased for the electrically non-conducting case (M = 0)."
"Identification of Locations in Mecca using Image Pre-Processing, Neural Networks and Deep Learning","Every year, more than two million Muslim pilgrims from all over the world visit Mecca to perform Hajj worship. The challenge of location identification in dense crowds is significant, leading to dangerous consequences such as injury or loss. Existing works for person localization remain challenged, especially in crowded places like Mecca during Hajj. In this work, we propose a novel location identification method using image pre-processing and different machine learning classifiers, with the creation of a new image dataset for hotspot locations in Mecca. Image pre-processing algorithms are applied to enhance the geographic information present in the images, and the obtained features are classified using CNN, ANN, and SVM classifiers. Extensive evaluations reveal that the proposed pre-processing algorithm with CNN achieves the best localization performance with an accuracy of 90%, followed by ANN with an accuracy of 84%, and SVM with an accuracy of 80.50%. Without pre-processing, the accuracies are significantly lower: 63% for CNN, 73% for ANN, and 71.50% for SVM. In addition, the proposed approach was compared with other deep learning models, VGG16, AlexNet and ResNet50 on our dataset achieving an accuracy of 61%, 65% and 62%, respectively. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in comparison with other deep transfer learning methods on a small dataset, offering promising solutions for crowded place navigation."
Wetting deformation characteristics of soil–rock mixture considering the water-disintegration of red stratum soft rock,"The red stratum soft rock, contained extensively in the deep soil–rock mixture (SRM) backfill area of southwest China, exhibits significant water-disintegrating properties that greatly impact the foundation's bearing capacity and deformation failure in this region. This study introduced the large-scale triaxial test to investigate the mechanical deformation characteristics of clay-red stratum soft rock mixture before and after wetting. Simultaneous, combined with the results of test, the law of water disintegration of red stratum soft rock was revealed, and its effects were analyzed in detail. The results show that: (1) Wetting intensified the crushing of rock blocks, resulting in the reduction of shear strength and critical strain of the samples, the decrease of critical internal friction angle and secant modulus, and the significant increase of the relative crushing rate of rock blocks; (2) The most significant increase and decrease of the content before and after the test occur in the particles with the particle size of 0.5–2 mm and 20–40 mm, respectively; (3) Wetting-induced breakage of the red stratum soft rock mainly occurs during the first two hours after encountering water; (4) An increase in confining pressure exacerbates the influence of wetting. Additionally, based on the theory of non-linear elasticity, with the assuming that the reduction of secant modulus causes the wetting deformation, a theoretical calculation model of the wetting axial strain was proposed. Through comparing the calculated results with the measured values obtained by using the “double-line method” and “single-line method” test, it is found that the calculation method can accurately predict the wetting axial strain of SRM and be used for quantitative analysis of wetting deformation."
Understanding the effect of differences in prior knowledge on middle school students’ collaborative interactions and learning,"We investigated how the level of variance in students’ prior knowledge may have influenced their collaborative interactions and science learning in small groups. We examined learning outcomes from 102 groups from seven science teachers’ classes and discourse from two contrasting groups: Homogeneous versus heterogeneous. We examined individual and group outcomes using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to explore the effect of membership in a homogeneous or heterogeneous group on students’ learning. We then used social network analyses (SNA) to identify any differences in interaction patterns between the two contrasting groups as they conducted multiple compost simulations. Finally, we examined students’ discussions in these groups to better understand their interactions. In our HLM analysis, we found that students in homogeneous groups made significantly greater learning gains than students in heterogeneous groups. The SNA and thematic analysis of the discussions in our contrasting groups helped us identify that the interactions in the homogeneous group were more distributed, while the interactions in the heterogeneous group were more centralized around the member with the greatest prior knowledge, and that these patterns were stable over time. We also found that the students in the homogenous group engaged in richer discussions that were more supportive and built upon one another’s ideas, which may have influenced their group and individual learning outcomes. While our findings indicate that students in homogeneous groups learn more and collaborate better, we discuss how some heterogeneity may be helpful, and group formation should focus on avoiding extreme cases of heterogeneity and provide students with scaffolding for collaboration."
"Design a novel 1-bit full adder with hybrid logic for full-swing, area-efficiency and high-speed","In this research work, a novel full adder (FA) circuit is designed based on a hybrid full-swing logic with 20 transistors. The 20-transistor hybrid full-swing adder (HFSA) circuit is designed and measured based on a 12-transistor XOR–XNOR circuit, which can efficiently use chip area and power dissipation. We developed a novel 12-transistor XOR–XNOR circuit that provides glitch-free full-swing outputs. This circuit integrates 2-to-1 multiplexers, pass transistor logic, and inverters. Due to its minimum power consumption and maximum area efficiency, it is a critical component of hybrid full-swing adder circuits. This research aims to measure the efficiency and practicality of novel and eleven existing methods by considering several factors, including performance and measuring key characteristics. As a result, our novel XOR–XNOR circuit offers superior performance compared to its peers—it has a smaller chip area of 7.35 µm2, an average power of 2.44 µW, and a propagation delay (25.88 and 24.87) ps, respectively.

"Small and medium-sized enterprises as technology innovation intermediaries in sustainable business ecosystem: interplay between AI adoption, low carbon management and resilience","Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a critical role as innovation intermediaries (IIs) in supply chains (SCs) by adopting emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), which drives smart data-driven decision making. However, there is a paucity of empirical evidence on the role of intangible organisational capabilities to drive AI adoption within SMEs that will lead to SC productivity, low carbon management, and resilience. To bridge this gap in the literature, our research employs perceived organisational support (POS) as the theoretical lens to develop a theoretical model that is tested by surveying 375 Vietnamese managers of manufacturing SMEs. Our findings from structural equation modelling analysis demonstrate that organisational change capacity will facilitate AI adoption, which will lead to SC productivity, resilience, and low carbon management because of SMEs’ ability to leverage AI for data-driven decision making. Based on POS theory, our research highlights the role of intangible SME resources in implementing sustainable digital SCs’ transformation, an essential strategy for acting as IIs in business ecosystems. Our findings will help SMEs to develop strategies that will enhance skills, competencies, expertise, and organisational creativity conducive to the needs of the human workforce. This will enhance the capacity and capability of SMEs to innovate, manage, and efficiently adapt to change in a technologically turbulent, dynamic, uncertain, and volatile business environment."
Local entropy-based feature-preserving simplification and evaluation for large field point cloud,"With the development of point cloud-based telemetry technology in recent years, the point cloud data of large field scenes acquired by various sensors have been applied to farmland boundary division, crop growth monitor, area surveying, etc. However, the large field point cloud will cost huge amounts of computational resources in the following transmission, storage and processing, which make it more important to simplify the field point cloud appropriately. In light of limitation of existing algorithms in point cloud simplification of large field scenes, we propose a novel feature-preserved simplification algorithm for large field point cloud data. By introducing the average local entropy as the threshold for area division, our algorithm effectively solves the problem of fuzzy boundary division, as well as preserving the field features and reducing the simplification errors. In view of the problem that the evaluation of current simplification algorithm is mainly focused on qualitative assessment, a quantitative evaluation index for the point cloud simplification is proposed by employing the point-average local entropy, which takes both model retention and simplification efficiency into account. Finally, comparable experiments are performed on four sets of point clouds. The results show that, compared with the statistics of six typical algorithms, the proposed algorithm increases the local entropy by 0.029%, 0.146% and 0.088% on our datasets, and increases 0.029% on the public dataset. The method accurately evaluates the simplification effect. Additionally, the surface area change rate is also used to further evaluate the performance of proposed algorithm, and the quantitative evaluation index is lower than others, which verify the advantages of proposed algorithm in feature protection and large field simplification."

Failure Analysis of Fuel-Film Cooling Assembly of Reaction Control System for Satellite,"The present case study discusses the failure investigation conducted on fuel-film cooling assembly (FFCA) of prototype reaction control system (RCS), which was failed prematurely during static hot-fire test after 15 s of operation. The kerosene fuel is injected from small holes on to the nozzle convergent for cooling. Upon dismantling, circumferential cracks were observed in the weld joint of austenitic stainless steel. Stainless steel grade 304 is known for its satisfactory weld joint with grade 308 stainless steel filler, and no cracks were observed during dye penetrant test on weld. However, unexpected, and sudden failure of this component warrants detailed analysis to identify the root cause of the failure. Visual inspection, macro/micro examination via optical and scanning electron microscope, optical emission spectroscopy and microhardness survey were carried out on both failed weld joint as well as on samples taken from un-cracked weld for comparison. Visual observations show signs of heat tint near the cracked region, which indicates that the assembly was exposed to high temperatures. Macroscopic examination revealed weld metal cracking, which was found to be brittle transgranular fracture upon microscopic examination. Research findings established that the high welding heat input in manual TIG welding and non-equilibrium cooling conditions resulted in poor weld quality containing high delta ferrite content in the weld metal. Although limited amount of delta ferrite is considered beneficial for avoiding hot cracking in austenitic stainless steel weld joints, weld containing higher delta ferrite content is prone to embrittlement at elevated temperatures. During the hot-fire test of RCS, the FFCA was heated to high temperature, which caused transformation of delta ferrite into hard sigma phase. SEM–EDS analysis and microhardness measurements have confirmed the formation of sigma phase and extensive carbide network in weld deposit. Thermal stresses combined with metastable delta ferrite to sigma phase transformation resulted in weld metal embrittlement, which eventually fractured in brittle manner."
Mechanical property heterogeneity in Inconel 718 superalloy manufactured by directed energy deposition,"Powder-based laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED) enables rapid prototyping and production of complex geometry Inconel 718 parts for structural applications. However, the heterogeneous microstructure obtained by the L-DED could lead to non-uniform mechanical properties at room temperature. Therefore, evaluating the local heterogeneity in mechanical properties of L-DED manufactured Inconel 718 superalloy is important. The mechanical properties in terms of hardness and local tensile properties of Inconel 718 superalloy have been investigated within the sample volume manufactured by L-DED to determine the local variations in properties. The mechanical properties were compared under the as-deposition and standard solution treatment and aging (STA) conditions. The average hardness and tensile strength properties of L-DED Inconel 718 in as-deposition conditions were significantly lower, while the strain-to-failure is significantly higher than that of its wrought counterparts. STA leads the average mechanical properties of L-DED Inconel 718, which is equivalent to its wrought counterpart. The hardness varied along the deposition direction in as-deposited L-DED Inconel 718. Interestingly, the local variability in the hardness along the deposition direction in L-DED Inconel 718 was eliminated after STA. The tensile strength properties varied along the deposition direction and were found to be lowest near the surface. The local variation trend in tensile strength properties was the same even after STA. The local ductility followed a trend relative to the strength in L-DED Inconel 718. A careful assessment shows that local variation in the mechanical properties was significant along the deposition direction, while it was minimal along the scanning direction of L-DED Inconel 718 under as-deposition and STA conditions. The local heterogeneity in the mechanical properties in L-DED Inconel 718 is explained in terms of the respective microstructure and deformation characteristics."
Production and Characterization of B4C Content-Dependent Aluminum Matrix Composites Fabricated via Hot Pressing,"In this study, Al/B4C composites were fabricated by a vacuum hot pressing process with various B4C contents. Microstructure, corrosion behavior, physical and tribological properties of the produced samples were investigated. The samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction analyses, microstructural investigations, and Archimedes tests. The microstructure properties were studied with light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry analyses. Also, dry sliding wear tests, corrosion tests, hardness and electrical conductivity measurements were performed to reveal the effect of B4C particles on the properties of the commercial pure aluminum matrix. Microstructural analysis revealed that composite production was achieved up to 15 wt.% B4C content without forming intermetallic phases. The wear resistance of the aluminum was improved by increasing B4C content. Also, the corrosion rate of the aluminum was reduced from 0.1698 to 0.0587 mm/year by adding 15 wt.% B4C. On the other hand, the electrical conductivity of the aluminum was decreased with the increasing reinforcement content and porosity. Results showed that Al/B4C composite production was achieved, and the corrosion and tribological properties of the aluminum were improved by the existence of the B4C particles."
The influence mechanism of mg doping on the thermoelectric properties of ZnO electronic materials for cable channels,"ZnO is one of the most promising oxide electronic thermoelectric materials in the medium and high-temperature range. The influence mechanism of Mg doping on the thermoelectric properties of ZnO was studied using powder synthesis method combined with first principles. It was found that the doping of Mg can effectively affect the Fermi level of ZnO, increase the bandgap width and density of states. The doping of Mg would introduce impurity energy levels (mainly composed of s orbitals and p orbitals), while contributing an increase in the hybridization effect between Zn/O/Mg atoms and the corresponding density of states. The electrical conductivity increases with the increase of Mg doping content throughout the entire temperature range, reaching a maximum of ∼ 141 Scm−1 at 873 K. The power factor significantly increases in the medium and high temperature range, reaching a maximum of ∼ 6.51 μWcm−1 K−2. Mg doping can cause a decrease in the Young's modulus of ZnO, and the thermal conductivity decreases due to the decrease in lattice thermal conductivity. The ZT value has significantly increased in the medium and high temperature range, reaching a maximum of ∼ 0.26, which is ∼ 2.65 times that of undoped sample."

Accounting Information Systems and Strategic Performance: The Interplay of Digital Technology and Edge Computing Devices,"With the rapid development of digital technologies, scholars and industries are pushing into the information age, where data processing is the accounting industry's major challenge. This study aimed to analyze the use of these digital technologies for strategic performance attainment and mediating the accounting information system (AIS). Further, this study also explores the moderation of the DT and strategic performance linkage. In this rapid change, the business organization is crucial to competition. Hence, technology is the key factor for maintaining the competitiveness of the industrialists, specifically where information plays a vital role in making management decisions. Accounting software is a significant tool that efficiently collects data and makes timely decisions to declare the business strategy to respond quickly to the market. However, the available accounting software is costly, and small-scale businesses cannot afford it. Therefore, this paper developed a digital accounting system using artificial intelligence (AI) and edge computing (EC) to process and store the accounting data. This article introduces novel edge framework for digital data processing with advanced data processing methods. The with the growth of IoT, the data sizes have increased significantly. Moreover, the traditional cloud platforms are enriched with EC to process the vast amount of data where it is collected. Therefore, the business can adapt to new size data and raise its standards in terms of technical content. It will define the distributed storage in the cloud and test the cluster performance of the system once the system design and its effects on the system. In the end, the system operation time, load balancing and rows of data is tested experimentally. The results and its analysis demonstrated that the data processing with EC for AIS utilized is improved acceleration rate, operational efficiency and execution rate."
An extended 2D Gao beam model,"This work derives and simulates a two-dimensional extension of the nonlinear Gao beam, by adding the cross-sectional shear variable, similarly to the extension of the usual Bernoulli–Euler beam into the Timoshenko beam. The model allows for oscillatory motion about a buckled state, as well as adds vertical shear of the cross sections, thus reflecting better nonlinear thick beams. The static model is derived from the principle of virtual elastic energy, and is in the form of a highly nonlinear coupled system for the beams transverse vibrations and the motion of the cross sections. The model allows for general distributive transversal and longitudinal loads and a compressive horizontal load acting on its edges. The model is simulated numerically, using the dynamic version for better insight into the steady solutions. The terms that distinguish our numerical solutions from the solutions of the Gao beam, described in the literature, are highlighted. The numerical scheme and its characteristic finite element matrices allow us to obtain simulation results that demonstrate the type of vibrations of our extended and modified beam, and also the differences between these solutions and those of the Gao beam model."
Ammonia scavenger and glutamine synthetase inhibitors cocktail in targeting mTOR/β-catenin and MMP-14 for nitrogen homeostasis and liver cancer,"The glutamine synthetase (GS) facilitates cancer cell growth by catalyzing de novo glutamine synthesis. This enzyme removes ammonia waste from the liver following the urea cycle. Since cancer development is associated with dysregulated urea cycles, there has been no investigation of GS’s role in ammonia clearance. Here, we demonstrate that, although GS expression is increased in the setting of β-catenin oncogenic activation, it is insufficient to clear the ammonia waste burden due to the dysregulated urea cycle and may thus be unable to prevent cancer formation. In vivo study, a total of 165 male Swiss albino mice allocated in 11 groups were used, and liver cancer was induced by p-DAB. The activity of GS was evaluated along with the relative expression of mTOR, β-catenin, MMP-14, and GS genes in liver samples and HepG2 cells using qRT-PCR. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of the NH3 scavenger phenyl acetate (PA) and/or GS-inhibitor L-methionine sulfoximine (MSO) and the migratory potential of cells was assessed by MTT and wound healing assays, respectively. The Swiss target prediction algorithm was used to screen the mentioned compounds for probable targets. The treatment of the HepG2 cell line with PA plus MSO demonstrated strong cytotoxicity. The post-scratch remaining wound area (%) in the untreated HepG2 cells was 2.0%. In contrast, the remaining wound area (%) in the cells treated with PA, MSO, and PA + MSO for 48 h was 61.1, 55.8, and 78.5%, respectively. The combination of the two drugs had the greatest effect, resulting in the greatest decrease in the GS activity, β-catenin, and mTOR expression. MSO and PA are both capable of suppressing mTOR, a key player in the development of HCC, and MMP-14, a key player in the development of HCC. PA inhibited the MMP-14 enzyme more effectively than MSO, implying that PA might be a better way to target HCC as it inhibited MMP-14 more effectively than MSO. A large number of abnormal hepatocytes (5%) were found to be present in the HCC mice compared to mice in the control group as determined by the histopathological lesions scores. In contrast, PA, MSO, and PA + MSO showed a significant reduction in the hepatic lesions score either when protecting the liver or when treating the liver. The molecular docking study indicated that PA and MSO form a three-dimensional structure with NF-κB and COX-II, blocking their ability to promote cancer and cause gene mutations. PA and MSO could be used to manipulate GS activities to modulate ammonia levels, thus providing a potential treatment for ammonia homeostasis."
"PERSIAN trial (NCT05717660): an ongoing randomized trial testing androgen deprivation therapy, apalutamide and stereotactic body radiotherapy. An alternative “triplet” for oligometastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer patients","Earlier treatment intensification with systemic potent androgen receptor inhibition has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer. Nonetheless, oligometastatic patients may benefit from local treatment approaches such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Aiming to explore the benefit of SBRT in this scenario, we designed this trial to specifically test the hypothesis that SBRT will improve clinical outcomes in select population affected by metachronous oligometastatic HSPC treated with androgen deprivation therapy + apalutamide. Enrolled patients will be randomized to receive the standard systemic treatment alone or in combination with SBRT on all metastatic sites of disease. Here we report the protocol design and an overview of the ongoing trials testing different integration strategies between RT and systemic therapies."
Therapeutic efficacy and pharmacological mechanism of Yindan Xinnaotong soft capsule on acute ischemic stroke: a meta-analysis and network pharmacology analysis,"Yindan Xinnaotong soft capsule (YDXNT), a traditional Chinese medicine preparation, has shown a promising effect in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The goal of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects and pharmacological mechanisms of YDXNT on AIS. Randomized controlled trials were searched and screened. Review Manager 5.4 was used for a meta-analysis. Active ingredients and targets of YDXNT were extracted from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database, Bioinformatics Analysis Tool for Molecular mechANism of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Encyclopaedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine. AIS-related targets were retrieved from GeneCards, OMIM, and DrugBank databases. We constructed PPI and ingredient-target networks, performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses, and conducted molecular docking. The YDXNT group had a higher total effective rate and a higher Barthel Index score. YDXNT reduced the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the whole blood viscosity at high and shear rates. Our study identified 313 ingredients and 1196 common targets. The key ingredients were mainly quercetin, neocryptotanshinone II, miltionone I, neotanshinone C, and tanshiquinone B, and the key targets were mainly SRC, MAPK3, AKT1, MAPK1, and JUN. GO analysis showed that the core targets mainly involved in atherosclerosis and neural apoptosis. The core pathways were lipid and atherosclerosis, PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and other pathways. Key ingredients exhibited robust binding interactions with core targets. YDXNT could effectively improve the total effective rate, ability of daily life, blood lipids, and blood viscosity. Antiatherosclerotic and neuroprotective effects are the main pharmacological mechanisms."
"The Feeling Rules of Peer Review: Defining, Displaying, and Managing Emotions in Evaluation for Research Funding","Punctuated by joy, disappointments, and conflicts, research evaluation constitutes an intense, emotional moment in scientific life. Yet reviewers and research institutions often expect evaluations to be conducted objectively and dispassionately. Inspired by the scholarship describing the role of emotions in scientific practices, we argue instead, that reviewers actively define, display and manage their emotions in response to the structural organization of research evaluation. Our article examines reviewing practices used in the European Research Council’s (ERC) Starting and Consolidator grants and in the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action’s (MSCA) Individual Fellowships. These two European funding mechanisms offer different perspectives on the organization of grant evaluation. We conducted interviews with review panel members and analyzed various institutional documents. By drawing on the sociological concepts of feeling rules and emotional work, we demonstrate that reviewers define rules concerning how emotions should be experienced and expressed to ensure the proper functioning of evaluation, and that reviewers experience the need to actively regulate their emotions to comply with these rules. We present four feeling rules concerning the experience and expression of: (1) excitement for novelty during individual evaluation; (2) respect for others’ opinions and the absence of anger in review panels; (3) attentiveness and interest, which are seen as missing in online evaluations. Reviewers also expect ERC candidates to (4) avoid pride and manifest modesty during interviews. These rules demonstrate that proposal peer review is governed by emotional norms, and show the influence of organizational settings and moral requirements on research evaluation."
A video codec based on background extraction and moving object detection,"Cameras are the primary data sources in video surveillance systems and produce massive data every second. Video surveillance is an extremely beneficial functionality brought to us by modern technology. An essential application of video surveillance in public security is facilitating the observation and analysis of events. Video surveillance systems require high-bandwidth media to transfer, high-capacity media to store, and high-performance hardware to process data. Consequently, these systems impose many costs on organizations. Video compression techniques can reduce the amount of data transferred or stored by surveillance systems and, as a result, lower the costs. Fixed CCTV cameras are the largest category of surveillance cameras. Backgrounds in these videos are typically constant and saving them for every frame is redundant. Therefore, a background-aware approach can achieve a higher compression rate in compressing these cameras’ videos than conventional approaches. This paper proposes a video codec for fixed cameras based on background extraction and moving-object detection algorithms. By background extraction, the pure backgrounds of the video are generated and stored in JPEG format for consecutive time intervals. By moving-object detection, the objects, and their coordinates are extracted in each frame using YOLOv7 and stored in JPEG format separately from the backgrounds. At the decoder side, each frame is built up using the generated background and detected objects which have been stored and transmitted as JPEG files. The evaluation of the proposed method on an appropriate set of videos from CDnet2014 and EWAP datasets shows that the proposed method can compress the videos effectively by significant compression ratios up to 46.76x, while the worst quality loss resulting from the compression is 0.99 according to the SSIM measure."
Exploring the potential of Radiomics in identification and treatment of lung cancer: A systematic evaluation,"Lung cancer is one of the most serious and life-threatening diseases in the world. Imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT) and Positron emission tomography (PET) play a crucial role in cancer diagnosis. Radiomics is an emerging field in medical imaging that uses advanced computational algorithms to extract quantitative features from medical images. Machine learning makes radiomics method of cancer diagnosis easier and more efficient by automating the process of feature selection and classification, which can save time and reduce the risk of human error in the diagnosis. It has the potential to revolutionize cancer detection by providing clinicians with valuable insights into tumour biology that can help in clinical decision-making and improve patient care outcomes. In this review paper, we primarily summarize the workflow of radiomics studies in the context of lung cancer and discussed the practical uses of radiomics in lung cancer, such as malignant tumour identification, classification of histologic subtypes, identification of tumour genotypes, and prediction of treatment response. Additionally, the paper addresses the key challenges associated with the clinical transition of radiomics, the limitations of current approaches, and potential future directions in this field."
Integrating multimodal features by a two-way co-attention mechanism for visual question answering,"Existing VQA models predominantly rely on attention mechanisms that prioritize spatial dimensions, adjusting the importance of image regions or word token features based on spatial probabilities. However, these approaches often struggle with relational reasoning, treating objects independently, and failing to fuse their features effectively. This hampers the model's ability to understand complex visual contexts and provide accurate answers. To address these limitations, our innovation introduces a novel co-attention mechanism in the VQA model. This mechanism enhances Faster R-CNN's feature extraction by emphasizing image regions relevant to the posed question. This, in turn, improves the model's ability for visual relationship reasoning, making it more adept at analyzing complex visual contexts. Additionally, our model incorporates feature-wise multimodal two-way co-attentions, enabling seamless integration of image and question representations, resulting in more precise answer predictions. Our model achieves impressive results on VQA 1.0, surpassing the best existing model, Re-attention model by 1.14% on test-std. Moreover, on VQA 2.0, our model outperforms the best model, IAHOT model by a significant margin of 2.98% on test-std. These findings demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms earlier models but also establishes a new state-of-the-art performance level in Visual Question Answering."
Various pseudo random number generators based on memristive chaos map model,"The telecommunications industry has made huge strides, and multimedia information transmission is exploding. Text, sound, and video can all be used to create multimedia data. As a result, having systems in place to protect private or sensitive data and keep its security is critical. In this article, completely random numbers were generated in two different ways, and the extent of their randomness was tested in many ways to ensure their suitability for use in different cryptographic applications. The proposed models in this article depend on a chaos based Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). PRNGs, which create bit sequences, have evolved into a critical component in many industries, including encrypted communication, Wireless communication using a spread spectrum, computational simulations, RF identification networks, and coding for error correction. The PRNGs is designed by combining the memristor that is discrete with the logistic map and the memristor that is discrete with sine map both separately to construct the novel algorithms called a two-dimensional memristive logistic map (2D-MLM) and two dimensional memristive sine map (2D-MSM) and each cycle yields a sequence of 32 random bits. The binary64 dual precision format is employed for arithmetic using floating-point in accordance with the IEEE 754-2008 standard. To assess the generator's performance, several statistical analyses are utilized. The results of the tests that evaluated the presented algorithms showed that the space key was improved and increased by 3.2% compared to other generators, and the performance speed was increased by 12.22%. The findings reveal that the sequences that are created have an elevated degree of unpredictability and a high level of security, which renders them excellent for cryptographic use in terms of the speed, the large key space, and high data rate."
An improved ensemble deep belief model (EDBM) for pap-smear cell image classification,"Applications of deep learning models for medical image analysis have been concentrated in recent years. This study presents an improved automatic Deep Learning Ensemble model to detect cervical cancer. The proposed model takes advantage of the Deep Belief Network and Ensemble classification model called EDBM to improve the accuracy of the prediction. In this method, a new classification layer using Belief Network with Dempster combinational rule combines the evidence to handle uncertainty. An ensemble classifier was applied to address the issue of sample rejection in previous classification models. This method used three classifiers, including Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Fuzzy classifier, to improve the model's performance. Experimental results on the Herlev dataset and the SIPaKMeD dataset revealed the superiority of the proposed EDBM model. The EDBM On the Herlev dataset with an accuracy of 99%, specificity of 98%, the sensitivity of 98%, and AUC of 99.98%, and the SIPaKMeD dataset with an accuracy of 97.2%, specificity of 98.79%, the sensitivity of 98.70%, and AUC of 99.89%, outperformed counterpart Deep learning methods and showed promising achievements in the early detection of Cervical Cancer."
"Electronic, optical, magnetic, and magnetocaloric properties of double perovskites Sr2CrOsO6: first principles approach and Monte Carlo simulation","Employing the Quantum Espresso computational tool and Monte Carlo simulation, we conducted an extensive investigation into the electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of the \({\mathbf{S}\mathbf{r}}_{2}{\mathbf{C}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{O}\mathbf{s}\mathbf{O}}_{6}\) (SCOsO) compound. Our analysis revealed its semiconductor nature with a direct band gap and the presence of spin-down states at the Fermi level. Notably, the Hubbard parameter (U) significantly influenced the magnetic states, illustrating its role in modulating the magnetic moments within the material. The computed exchange interactions using the Ising model unveiled distinct magnitudes for \({\text{Cr}}-{\text{Cr}}\), Os-Os, and Os-Cr interactions, reflecting variations in electronic interactions within the compound. The temperature-dependent magnetization and susceptibility demonstrated a critical temperature of \(634 \, {\text{K}}\), marking a significant ferrimagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition. SCOsO exhibited a significant magnetocaloric properties, displaying substantial values of maximum magnetic entropy change \(\left({\varvec{\Delta}}{{\varvec{S}}}_{{\varvec{M}}}\right)\) and Relative Cooling Power (RCP) under an applied magnetic field of \(2\mathbf{T}\), outperforming various other compounds in this category. Regarding optical properties, our analysis using Quantum Espresso revealed SCOsO's strong reflectivity for green light, indicating its potential for solar light storage. The refractive index displayed distinct variations, suggestive of electronic transitions influenced by the spin–orbit coupling of \(\mathbf{C}\mathbf{r}\) and \(\mathbf{O}\mathbf{s}\) ions within the compound."
Quantum-enhanced OFDM signal processing: advancing 5G mobile network and IoT communication for healthcare application,"The advent of 5G technology has transformed the way that wireless networks and Internet of Things devices communicate, offering new opportunities in healthcare applications. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) offers high data rates, low latency and robust communication in difficult settings, is one of the main 5G technologies. Healthcare applications face many difficulties despite 5G and OFDM's potential. The previously mentioned factors include reduced latency, dependability, energy conservation, data protection and privacy. To overcome this, we proposed wavelet-enhanced multiple input multiple outputs-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM). This study uses a variety of modulation schemes, including binary phase shift keying, quadrature phase shift keying, 8-PSK, quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), 8-QAM and 16-QAM across additive white Gaussian noise channels. To simulate the proposed method by using MATLAB. The proposed systems in healthcare applications with limited resources may be restricted by the complexity of their implementation. To improve data transmission performance for healthcare applications, its viability depends on resolving complex difficulties and customizing it to particular medical applications."
Quantum splitting of multi-qubit gates,"In this study, a novel technique for the quantum splitting of multi-qubit gates is presented. This brings innumerable advantages for the analysis of quantum circuits, the design of simulators, and back-ends, which are fundamentally needed in quantum computing development environments. This technique can be applied to any gate that involves two or more qubits, facilitating its treatment during its application in configurations of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type for more than two entangled photons, or protocols where CNOT or Toffoli gates connect qubits that are not close, which implies the intensive use of SWAP gates. The study is completed with the application of the new technique to quantum teleportation, quantum secret sharing, and entanglement swapping."
Spectral changes of radial array beams in inhomogeneous atmospheric turbulence,"Based on the generalized Huygens-Fresnel principle, an analytical expression for the spectral intensity of the radial array Gaussian Schell mode beam (RAGSM) in inhomogeneous atmospheric turbulence is derived using the theory of partially coherent light. The variation of the normalized spectral intensity and the on-axis relative spectral shift are investigated. The effects of beam parameters and turbulent parameters on the spectra are numerically calculated. The results show that there is a critical position where a rapid transition of the spectrum takes place. The critical position becomes greater with an increase in the number of sub-beams, the radial distance, initial coherence length. At the longer propagation distance, the effect of structural constants of refractive index is weaker. The spectral transition distances are proportional to the turbulence parameters."
Simulation of optical fiber sensor in motion training image analysis system based on human posture tracking algorithm,"In sports training, the traditional image analysis method has the problems of low precision and easy to be disturbed by the environment. The aim of this research is to simulate the motion training image analysis by using optical fiber sensor based on human posture tracking algorithm.

Design and analysis of a dual-broadband microwave metasurface absorber with flexibility and transparency,"A flexible, transparent and polarization-insensitive metasurface absorber (MA) with dual-broadband feature is proposed. The MA consists of absorption layer, transparent flexible polyvinyl chloride (PVC) dielectric layer, and indium tin oxide (ITO)/polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottom plate. The dual-broadband characteristics are studied by transmission-line theory, numerical simulation and experiment.

Moreover, the analysis of the impedance matching theory, surface current, magnetic field and electric field distributions and power loss density are given to explain the dual-band absorption mechanism. The proposed dual-broadband MA maintains good angular stability whether in planar (30°) or conformal (20°) cases. The MA has simple structure, high optical transparency and flexibility, it promises to be a good candidate for electromagnetic (EM) shielding room observation windows, touch panel controls, radio-frequency identification systems and transparent radio-frequency devices."
New analytic wave solutions to (2 + 1)-dimensional Kadomtsev–Petviashvili–Benjamin–Bona–Mahony equation using the modified extended mapping method,"In this study, the (2 + 1)-dimensional Kadomtsev–Petviashvili–Benjamin–Bona–Mahony equation (KP-BBME) is examined.

To illustrate the physical characteristics of the established solutions, 3D, 2D and contour plots are depicted for many selected solutions."
Enhancement of electron-bunch quality in bubble domain utilizing plasma ramp profile with various density-hill widths in laser wakefield acceleration,"The laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) scheme is now a superb and potent instrument for industry, medicine, fusion, and other uses. With the aid of this technique, high-quality electron beams can be generated, which might eventually be employed to create small, portable X-ray sources. Using a linearly polarized Gaussian laser pulse, the present work focuses on examining electron acceleration in an under-dense plasma having a ramp profile with different density-hill widths. Two-dimensional Fourier–Bessel Particle-In-Cell simulation (2D-FBPIC) code shows that optimizing the laser parameters and plasma density profile maximizes the energy gain and minimizes the normalized rms emittance in the x, y directions inside the plasma bubble. For 10  and 90 \({\upmu\text{m}}\) density-hill widths, respectively, the optimal emittance value is reported to be \({\epsilon }_{x}\sim 3.10\) mm.mrad in the x-direction and \({\epsilon }_{y}\sim 2.63\) mm.mrad in the y-direction. At a density-hill width of 90 \({\upmu\text{m}}\), it is also observed that the charge trapped inside the bubble is 44.91 pC. With this density-hill width and a plasma channel length of 3.84 mm, our simulation findings show an energy gain of 0.38 GeV to the electron-bunch accelerated inside the bubble."
"New analytical and numerical solutions to the (2+1)-dimensional conformable cpKP–BKP equation arising in fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and nonlinear optics","This study investigates the \((2+1)\)-dimensional conformable combined potential Kadomtsev–Petviashvili-B-type Kadomtsev–Petviashvili (cpKP–BKP) equation. It is a linear combination of potential KP and BKP systems. This equation sheds light on hydrodynamics, plasma physics, and nonlinear optics. Firstly, conformable derivative definitions and their characteristics are provided. Next, using the modified extended tanh-function approach, accurate analytical solutions to this problem are obtained. The residual power series method (RPSM) was then used to investigate the approximate solutions to the model. A table compares the obtained findings with absolute errors. The 3D and 2D surfaces and the corresponding contour plot surfaces of specifically gathered data illustrate the obtained findings’ physical aspect. The physical activity of the problem can only be tracked with explicit solutions that have been accomplished. The results illustrate how the under-investigation and other nonlinear physical models from mathematical physics are applied in real life. All of the solutions obtained are new and do not exist in the literature. Consequently, these methods might produce notable outcomes in obtaining the exact and approximate solutions of fractional differential equations (FDEs) in various circumstances."
Exploring optical soliton solutions of a self-focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation by two effective techniques,"In this manuscript, we have conducted a comprehensive investigation of the self-focusing Schrödinger equation with fourth-order dispersion, yielding closed-form results for crucial optical soliton solutions. To achieve this, we have employed two distinct methodologies. Firstly, we harnessed the power of the generalized Kudryashov method to derive novel solutions for the Schrödinger equation, expanding the landscape of possible solutions. To further enrich our understanding of optical solitons, we incorporated the \(\left( \frac{1}{\mathscr {G}^{\prime }}\right)\) expansion technique, uncovering additional soliton solutions. The behavior of these solutions is vividly illustrated through 2D and 3D graphical representations, shedding light on the characteristics of bright, breather-type, and combined M-W-shaped optical solitons. Moreover, we have meticulously examined the influence of specific parameters on the dynamics of soliton solutions obtained via the \(\left( \frac{1}{\mathscr {G}^{\prime }}\right)\) method, providing valuable insights into the interplay between these parameters and the soliton behavior."
"Investigation of the effects of grating length, Bragg wavelength and wavelength shift on temperature sensitivity in fiber Bragg grating-based sensing systems","In optical fiber sensing systems based on fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs), there are numerous parameters that significantly limit the overall sensing performance. In this study, the effects of FBG parameters such as grating length, Bragg wavelength, and reflection rate on temperature sensitivity have been investigated considering there are no strain effects along the length of the grating. For this purpose, the OptiSystem program has been utilized to design an FBG-based sensing system, which is a relevant approach for simulating and analyzing the performance of FBGs. For temperature variations in the range of 1–120 °C, variations of wavelength shift and grating length have been obtained between 14 and 1680 pm and between 0.1 and 100 mm, respectively. It has been observed that the grating length changes have no direct impact on the temperature sensitivity. On the other hand, a 1 °C variation in temperature causes a wavelength change of ~ 14 pm. Furthermore, temperature sensitivities have been found to be   3.66 pm/°C, 4.58 pm/°C, 5.50 pm/°C, 9.2 pm/°C, 14 pm/°C and 18.4 pm/°C for the Bragg wavelengths of 400 nm, 500 nm, 600 nm, 1000 nm, 1550 nm and 2000 nm, respectively. Moreover, the change in temperature sensitivity depending on Bragg wavelength has been computed as ~ 9.15 × 10–3 pm/°C(nm)−1. For the reflection rate variations in the range of 0.001–0.99%, temperature sensitivity has taken the value of ~ 14 pm/°C at 100 °C whilst the reflected powers have varied from 11.1 to 42 dBm. Moreover, a change in temperature sensitivity with reflection rate has been acquired as ~ 0.021 pm/°C(%)−1."
Application of image optical detection based on dynamic time warping algorithm in dance teaching,"With the continuous development of computer technology and the deepening of mathematical theory research, the combination of mathematics and computer pattern recognition technology has penetrated into various fields of scientific research and social production. In order to accurately detect and analyze students’ movements in dance teaching, a new optical detection method is proposed in this study, which uses dynamic time distortion algorithm to accurately identify and analyze dance movements. The dynamic time warping algorithm is used to compare two time series and is applied to the detection of dance movements to realize the accurate identification and analysis of students’ movements. The dance video data is collected and pre-processed into time series data, and then each time series is compared and analyzed using a dynamic time warping algorithm, and key movement features are extracted. Finally, the machine learning model is trained to classify and evaluate the students’ movements. The experimental results show that the optical detection method based on dynamic time distortion algorithm can achieve high accuracy and precision in dance teaching. When applied to dance teaching, it has high accuracy and precision in detecting dance movements, which is expected to provide effective tools and support for dance teaching."
InSe/CrSe Interfaces Performed as Resistive Switches and Band Filters for Gigahertz/Terahertz Communication Technology Applications,"Herein chromium selenide (n-CrSe) nanosheets are deposited onto amorphous indium selenide (n-InSe) thin films by the thermal evaporation technique under a vacuum pressure of 10−5 mbar. The formed InSe/CrSe heterojunctions are structurally, optically and electrically investigated. InSe/CrSe heterojunctions exhibited a band structure discontinuities at the InSe/CrSe interfaces presented by a conduction and valence band offsets of 0.50 eV and 0.65 eV, respectively. The isotype InSe/CrSe heterojunctions exhibited resistive switching property under a forward and reverse biasing voltages of 1.5 V and 0.3 V, respectively. In addition computer assisted fittings which were carried out on the current–voltage characteristics of the InSe/CrSe devices have shown the existence of large barrier height of 1.75 eV at the InSe/CrSe interfaces. Moreover, low amplitude ac signal analyses have shown that the device under study performed as negative conductance sources with increased negative conductance values with increasing signal frequency. The negative conductance effect resulted from the deficiency of selenium atoms in InSe and CrSe as confirmed by the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Furthermore combination of the analysis of the picofarad level- capacitance with the conductance allowed determining the cutoff limits of the InSe/CrSe devices when treated as signal filters. The cutoff frequency of the InSe/CrSe devices varied in the range of 10M-1.1 THz assuring the suitability of the devices for megahertz/gigahertz/terahertz technology applications."
Off-axis vortex Gaussian beams in strongly nonlocal nonlinear media with oblique incidence,"The off-axis vortex Gaussian beam (OavGB) in strongly nonlocal nonlinear media (SNNM) with oblique incidence showed novel transmission characteristics. When the off-axis vortex parameters were not equalled to the intensity distribution parameters, the analytical expression for the propagation of the OavGB in SNNM was obtained by using the ABCD matrix method. The expression for the second-order moment beamwidth and the trajectory equation for the center of the beam’s mass were obtained by analytical method. According to numerical simulations, the projection of the mass’s center on the cross-section was found to be an ellipse, a line segment, or a circle, with the direction of rotation of the projected trajectory around the z-axis depending on the direction of the orbital angular momentum, and the direction of rotation of the beam depending on the sign in front of the imaginary part of the vortex point. The direction of the OavGB’s rotation and the direction of revolution of the mass’s center may be the same or opposite, But the rotation period of the beam and the revolution period of the mass’s center were equated. The projected trajectory of the mass’s center of the beam on the cross-section can be controlled by the magnitude of the parameters a, b, c, d, \(\zeta\), f. These laws can be used to control beam transmission paths and information encoding."
Effect of adding methyl orange/silver (MO–Ag) nanoparticles on the optical and structural properties of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA),"This study analyses the effect of adding an equal amount of methyl orange/silver nanoparticles (MO–Ag) on the optical and structural properties of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The X-ray diffraction reveals nearly the same behavior of all spectra with a main broad peak centered at 2θ = 23.43°, which is due to the semi-crystalline nature of the PVA/(MO–Ag) nanocomposite samples related to the (110) plane. FT-IR spectroscopy showed increased intensity of some bands, indicating a strong interaction between the functional groups in PVA, MO, and Ag nanoparticles. Raman spectroscopy provides information about the molecular structure and vibrations, which is important for understanding properties of the samples. UV–visible absorption spectra showed that the MO–Ag doped PVA films had higher absorbance and a red-shift in absorption edge, indicating a decreased optical band gap. The Tauc relation was used to estimate the direct and indirect band gaps, which decreased with increasing MO–Ag content, showing the band gap was reduced upon doping. As Ag content increased, optical conductivity also increased due to charge transfer between PVA and MO–Ag molecules. The real and imaginary parts of the optical dielectric function showed a sharp absorption band that red-shifted and increased in intensity with higher MO–Ag content. UV–Vis further showed molecular structure changes leading to increased refractive index n with increasing MO–Ag doping. Moreover, doping PVA films with MO–Ag decreased the optical band gap and increased absorbance, optical conductivity, and refractive index, modifying the optical and structural properties."

Enhanced photodetection performance of vanadium pentoxide nanostructures deposited on porous silicon substrate via pulsed laser deposition,"The combination of common semiconductors with porous materials has the potential to augment the splitting of electrons and holes, hence increasing the efficiency of photodetectors. In the current study, we present the efficient fabrication of photodetectors consisting of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) and macroporous structures via the pulsed laser deposition technique. The structure, surface morphology, and optical properties of V2O5 nanostructures embedded in porous silicon were examined using an X-ray diffractometer, a field emission scanning electron microscope, and a UV–Vis–NIR diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer, photoluminescence emission spectra, and Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy. The findings indicate that the V2O5 nanostructure exhibits an orthorhombic crystal structure, which tends to align along the (001) plane. These nanostructures were distributed on porous silicon surfaces, mainly within the pores, which range in size from 52.4 nm to 106.5 nm. The level of pore filling varies depending on the laser energy used, ranging from partial to almost complete filling. The room-temperature photoluminescence peaks of V2O5 nanostructure/porous silicon possess four distinct spectra characterized by their maximum emission wavelengths of around 461 nm and 664 nm.However, the electrical and spectral responsivity properties were measured before and after introducing V2O5 nanostructures into porous silicon. The ideality factor of porous silicon has decreased after embedding V2O5 nanostructure in porous silicon. The deposition of V2O5 nanostructures into porous silicon resulted in a significant rise in spectrum responsivity, particularly at a wavelength of 471 nm. Moreover, the spectral responsivity exhibited a rising trend with increasing laser energy, reaching a maximum value of 0.31 A/W. The external quantum efficiency found its highest value at 78.93% when more incredible laser energy was used. The V2O5 nanostructure/porous silicon device fabricated in this work, consisting of a V2O5 nanostructure integrated with porous silicon, has remarkable potential as a high-efficiency photodetector in several photoelectronic technologies."
Early social experiences and later psychopathology: the role of OXTR rs53576 genotype,"Although previous research has established a link between the variant rs53576 of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and social behaviors, our understanding of its long-term impact on mental health from early childhood to adolescence remains limited. This study aimed to explore the potential link between children’s involvement in recreational activities with parents during early childhood, their OXTR rs53576 genotype, and the subsequent development of psychopathology. It involved gathering data during three different stages: early childhood (T1), middle childhood (T2), and adolescence (T3). During T1, the parents of 144 Chinese participants aged 4 to 6 years (48.6% boys) completed a scale on frequency of parent-child recreational activities. Three years later (T2), parents were re-surveyed about the participant’s conduct problems, which was assessed using the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Seven years later (T3), the participants completed the Depression scale of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale – 21 to evaluate their levels of depressive symptoms. Additionally, buccal swab samples were collected and genotyped for OXTR rs53576. OXTR rs53576 genotypes were found to interact with the frequency of parent-child recreational activities to predict future conduct problems (β=-1.38, p = 0.028). Increased conduct problems were in turn associated with a higher level of subsequent depressive symptoms during adolescence (r = 0.22, p < 0.05). Engaging in recreational activities with parents during early childhood is important for the overall well-being of children, particularly for those who demonstrate a tendency of being sociable. Early childhood interventions should educate and assist parents in designing unstructured play based on their young children’s sociability."
A Cross-Sectional Comparative Study Analyzing the Quality of YouTube Videos as a Source of Information for Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction in English and Hindi Language,"This study aimed to evaluate and compare the quality of information in YouTube videos on erectile dysfunction (ED) treatment in English and Hindi language. The English and Hindi terms for erectile dysfunction treatment were searched on YouTube, and the first 100 videos were screened. Of them, 148 videos were eligible for analysis. Quality of health information was assessed using: a modified 5-item DISCERN tool; and the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) for Audio/Visual Materials. The analyzed videos had cumulative views of more than 70 million. Only 8.8% of videos had DISCERN score ≥ 4 indicating good content quality. About 46% and 40% of videos presented information in an easy-to-understand and actionable manner based on PEMAT sub-scale scores ≥ 70% respectively. The three most common treatments suggested for ED were lifestyle modification-based advice (41.2%), oral Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors (37.8%), and penile prosthetic implantation (28.4%).Herbal/ over-the-counter medicines, and specific diet/ food item(s) were more frequently suggested in Hindi videos. Whereas, intra-cavernosal injections, MUSE suppositories, and shock wave therapy were more commonly suggested in English videos. A substantial number of videos suggested treatment strategies that were not concordant with the American Urological Association guidelines. Healthcare professionals need to be mindful of this while counseling patients and advocate for the creation of more reliable and accurate online sources of information in English and other vernacular languages like Hindi."
Dynamic modeling and vibration analysis of double row cylindrical roller bearings with irregular-shaped defects,"Defects in the bearings greatly affect vibrations and performances of rotating transmission systems. Moreover, most previous works estimated the defect shape as a regular shape. However, the actual defect shape is not actually regular. To obtain more accurate vibration characteristics of a defective double row cylindrical roller bearing, an irregular-shaped defect modeling method and a dynamic model of double row cylindrical roller bearing with irregular-shaped defects are proposed in this paper. The dynamic model includes all components and their interactions. A test verification is proposed to validate the established model. The effects of the bearing load, rotating speed, and different independent shape defect sizes on the double row cylindrical roller bearing vibrations are investigated. The comparisons of vibrations between the irregular defect shape and simplified defect shape are studied. The results show that the simplified defect shape model will cause the vibrations to be overestimated. The established dynamic model with the actual defect is more reasonable than the simplified defect model. Moreover, this paper can provide a comprehensive analytical method for double row cylindrical roller bearing vibrations."
An improved ensemble deep belief model (EDBM) for pap-smear cell image classification,"Applications of deep learning models for medical image analysis have been concentrated in recent years. This study presents an improved automatic Deep Learning Ensemble model to detect cervical cancer. The proposed model takes advantage of the Deep Belief Network and Ensemble classification model called EDBM to improve the accuracy of the prediction. In this method, a new classification layer using Belief Network with Dempster combinational rule combines the evidence to handle uncertainty. An ensemble classifier was applied to address the issue of sample rejection in previous classification models. This method used three classifiers, including Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Fuzzy classifier, to improve the model's performance. Experimental results on the Herlev dataset and the SIPaKMeD dataset revealed the superiority of the proposed EDBM model. The EDBM On the Herlev dataset with an accuracy of 99%, specificity of 98%, the sensitivity of 98%, and AUC of 99.98%, and the SIPaKMeD dataset with an accuracy of 97.2%, specificity of 98.79%, the sensitivity of 98.70%, and AUC of 99.89%, outperformed counterpart Deep learning methods and showed promising achievements in the early detection of Cervical Cancer."
A taxonomy of critical factors towards sustainable operations and supply chain management 4.0 in developing countries,"Supply chain disruptions, intensified by black swan events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, have increased the interest in resilient supply chains, which can be achieved by adopting sustainable Industry 4.0 (I4.0) practices. However, the critical success factors (CSFs) for sustainable I4.0 in operations and supply chain management (S-OSCM4.0) are unclear, and there is a lack of a holistic and empirically validated taxonomy of CSFs from multiple stakeholders' perspectives to guide organizations in this transition. Moreover, developing countries face specific challenges that require prioritizing the proper set of CSFs for sustainable digitalization. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a CSFs-based taxonomy for S-OSCM4.0 to help organizations stay current in I4.0 adoption and integrate sustainability in OSCM. We first conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 131 papers using bibliometric and content analyses and synthesized the theoretical findings into an alpha taxonomy of CSFs following an inductive approach. Then, we employed a Delphi survey technique combining fuzzy logic to solicit experts' perceptions from a developing country to analyze and validate the taxonomy and determine the most pertinent CSFs, resulting in a beta taxonomy of CSFs for S-OSCM4.0. The developed taxonomy represents a pioneering managerial artefact that can guide sustainable development through an inclusive digital transformation with less environmental impact, contributing to decision-making in S-OSCM4.0, especially for operations in developing countries."
Green Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles by Fusarium oxysporum and its Function Against Aspergillus and Fusarium Fungi,"(NPs) can be produced by various methods such as physical and chemical processes. However, environmentally friendly ways are increasingly requested. In this research, (Ag-NPs) were produced by Fusarium oxysporum, and its antifungal effect on Aspergillus and Fusarium was investigated. Nanoparticles were produced by silver nitrate salt and Fusarium oxysporum native to Isfahan city. In order to optimize the synthesis conditions, optimization of some factors such as volume, concentration, time, temperature, and pH of the extract was performed. The structural and physical properties of NPs were determined by spectrophotometer, XRD, FTIR FESEM, SEM, and TEM microscopy. For the study of the inhibitory effect of NPs on Fusarium and Aspergillus growth, the fungi were cultured in media containing various concentrations of NPs from 50 to 1500 ppm. Then, the colony diameter was measured for over 10 days and the growth inhibition percentage was estimated. For statistical analysis, the 600 Mann–Whitney tests have been applied.The NPs were produced after mixing the powdered fungal mass and silver nitrate salt in optimum conditions which were 2 mM of salt, triple fungal mass volume proportion relative to the salt, pH of 9, and temperature of 28 °C. The existence of a peak at 420 nm in FTIR was due to nanoparticle production. Based on the XRD, the synthesized NPs had suitable properties similar to the standard NPs reported in the studies. Images from TEM, SEM, and FESEM microscopes displayed uniform NPs in variable sizes between 25 and 100 nm. According to the results, the maximum growth inhibition percentage of Ag-NPs on Fusarium was approximately 60% at 1500 ppm, and 88% on Aspergillus at 800 ppm. Biosynthesized Ag-NPs with Fusarium oxysporum have desirable structural traits and can inhibit the growth of Fusarium and Aspergillus at significant levels."
Rapid Discrimination of Pork Contaminated with Different Pathogens by Using SERS,"Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Listeria monocytogenes are three of the most common foodborne pathogens found in pork. SERS technology enables the rapid acquisition of molecular information by harnessing the synergistic effect of Raman scattering and enhanced substrate surface plasmonics. However, because of the similar chemical composition between bacteria and between pathogens and pork, it is difficult to discriminate pork contaminated with different pathogens. In view of this problem, Raman spectra of three bacteria, bacteria mixtures, and fresh pork contaminated with three pathogens were obtained by using Au @Ag NPs as the enhancement substrate. After data pretreatment, Raman characteristics of pathogens were analyzed by the PCA. PLS-DA and SVM-DA classifiers were employed to discriminate the feature data. To reduce the impact of sample variations on the modeling results, the influence of three data standardization methods, SNV, max-normalization, and area-normalization, on the predictive ability of the models was discussed. The predicted results demonstrated that SVM-DA, combining with SNV, achieved superior discrimination for bacteria mixtures. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of prediction validation were all above 0.93. When PLS-DA was combined with normalization techniques, better results were obtained for discriminating pork contaminated with different bacteria. In the predictive discriminant analysis, the classification accuracy reached 0.85. This work not only achieved rapid discrimination of biological cells in complex environments but also improved the accuracy of the classification model, providing a feasible idea for the analysis of pork contaminated with microorganism based on SERS by incorporating stoichiometric methods."
Analysis of the Wound-Healing Activity of Sodium Carboxymethyl Cellulose (1%) with Metronidazole (0.25%) and Chlorhexidine (0.025%) in the Ultraviolet Erythema Model in Guinea Pigs as Compared with Levomekol Gel,"The plasticization of jelly obtained by structuring a sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution with a complex salt of aluminum and citric acid was studied. Jelly base containing 1% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and 15% glycerol had a dynamic viscosity of 4.7 Pa∙s, retained its shape, and was well lubricated. Stability studies of the gel base after storage for 24 months at 25 ± 10°C showed that the appearance, color, and smell did not change. The base remained uniform and stable. The pH value did not exceed the established limits. The thermal stability of gel samples was visually assessed in a thermostat at 40 – 42°C for 24 h. Phase separation was not observed in any of the gel samples. Gel samples met the requirements of bacteriological analysis. The inclusion of antibacterial (metronidazole, 0.25%) and antiseptic drugs (chlorhexidine, 0.025%) in the developed base statistically significantly increased the wound healing activity to 92 ± 4.5% (p < 0.05) as compared to the drug Levomekol (78 ± 3.8%, p < 0.05) in the ultraviolet erythema model."
Modeling Long-Term Budgetary Impacts of Prevention: An Overview of Meta-analyses of Relationships Between Key Health Outcomes Across the Life-Course,"Budget analysis entities often cannot capture the full downstream impacts of investments in prevention services, programs, and interventions. This study describes and applies an approach to synthesizing existing literature to more fully account for these effects. This study reviewed meta-analyses in PubMed published between Jan 1, 2010 and Dec 31, 2019. The initial search included meta-analyses on the association between health risk factors, including maternal behavioral health, intimate partner violence, child maltreatment, depression, and obesity, with a later health condition. Through a snowball sampling-type approach, the endpoints of the meta-analyses identified became search terms for a subsequent search, until each health risk was connected to one of the ten costliest health conditions. These results were synthesized to create a path model connecting the health risks to the high-cost health conditions in a cascade. Thirty-seven meta-analyses were included. They connected early-life health risk factors with six high-cost health conditions: hypertension, diabetes, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, mental disorders, heart conditions, and trauma-related disorders. If confounders could be controlled for and causality inferred, the cascading associations could be used to more fully account for downstream impacts of preventive interventions. This would support budget analysis entities to better include potential savings from investments in chronic disease prevention and promote greater implementation at scale."
Silencing HE4 alleviates the renal fibrosis in lupus nephritis mice by regulating the C3/MMPs/prss axis,"To explore the regulatory effect of human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) on renal fibrosis in mice with lupus nephritis (LN) and the underlying mechanism. Ten-week old MRL/LPR mice were injected with HE4 shRNA adenovirus vector through the renal pelvis for 5 days. Renal tissues were extracted for HE and Masson staining to evaluate pathological changes and fibrosis in lupus nephritis mice. The level of urine protein was measured using a biochemical analyzer, while the expression level of HE4 and p-NF-κB p65 in renal tissues was visualized using an immunofluorescence assay. The level of β2-microglobulin (β2-MG), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and kidney injury molecule 1 (Kim-1) was determined by the immunohistochemical assay. Western blotting was used to determine the levels of C3, HE4, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), MMP9, p-p65, prss23, and prss35 in renal tissues. Compared to wild-type C57BL/6 mice, MRL/LPR mice showed a marked increase in the number of glomeruli, hyperplasic basement membrane, severe infiltration of inflammatory cells in renal tubules and glomeruli, obvious necrosis in glomeruli, elevated fibrosis levels, and increased levels of urine protein, β2-MG, NGAL, Kim-1, C3, HE4, MMP2, MMP9, and p-p65; and decreased levels of prss23 and prss35 were observed in MRL/LPR mice. After the administration of the HE4 shRNA adenovirus vector, the repaired structure of renal tubules and glomeruli improved infiltration of inflammatory cells, reduced collagen fiber and urine protein, suppressed levels of C3, HE4, MMP2, MMP9, and p-P65, and facilitated the expression of prss23 and prss35 which were observed. Silencing HE4 improved renal fibrosis and inhibited inflammation in mice with lupus nephritis, which may play a role in inhibiting C3/MMPs and promoting prss-related protein expression."
The role of beta-adrenoreceptors in postoperative ileus in rats,"The aim of the research was to evaluate the influence of antagonists of specific beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes on bowel motility following abdominal surgery in rat model of postoperative ileus. Bowel motility was measured by the intestinal transit of Evans blue introduced via orogastric tube after surgical procedures of skin incision, laparotomy and laparotomy with gut manipulation. Male rats were given individual adrenergic receptor subtypes antagonists intraperitoneally, and the influence of administered agents on intestinal transit of Evans blue was then evaluated. No statistically significant differences in the length of intestine in tested rats were observed. Propranolol administered prior to surgical procedure has shown protective effect on Evans blue migration in rats undergoing laparotomy and gut manipulation. Intestinal dye transit for propranolol doses of 10, 30 and 45 mg/kg was 18.00 ± 1.88c m, 23.75 ± 1.71 cm and 22.5 ± 2.43 cm, respectively, and for last two doses, statistically significant increase of dye passage was noted, compared to Evans blue transit of 11.00 ± 2.43 cm in the control group. No acceleration of dye migration was seen following administration of beta1-, beta2- and beta3-selective adrenergic receptor antagonist metoprolol, ICI 118.551 and SR58894A, respectively. Our research confirmed that propranolol at high doses, as seen by other researchers, improved bowel motility in early phase of postoperative ileus. That slight acceleration of intestinal dye transit after surgery with gut manipulation is rather connected with membrane-stabilizing action, than the receptor blocking effect, as this effect was not observed after the application of selective antagonists of respective subtypes of beta-adrenergic receptor."
Preparation and characterization of mussel-inspired dual-crosslinked hydrogels based on hydroxypropyl chitosan,"Marine mussels can adhere to various surfaces in a liquid environment by utilizing pedicle filaments, with the adhesive properties primarily attributed to the structure of catechol, the main component of the filament. To overcome the challenges associated with the complex preparation process, high cost, and potential biological rejection of naturally extracted or recombinantly expressed mussel proteins, researchers drew inspiration from mussels and utilized an oxidative crosslinking approach to prepare adhesive hydrogel materials. However, the hydrogels prepared using this method exhibited inferior mechanical properties and low viscosity. To address these limitations, in this study, a kind of mussel-inspired dual-crosslinked hydrogel was prepared by dual cross-linking with hydroxypropyl chitosan (HPCS) and hyaluronic acid (HA), based on catechol, an adhesion component in marine mussel pedicle filaments. Comparative analysis revealed that the mussel-inspired dual-crosslinked hydrogel exhibited significantly higher adhesion strength (up to 33.96 kPa) and improved mechanical properties (energy storage modulus ranging from 489 to 1032 Pa) compared to the mussel-inspired oxidatively cross-linked hydrogel. In addition, the mussel-inspired dual-crosslinked hydrogel demonstrated favorable swelling (up to 136.54 ± 0.22%), degradation, sustained-release, bacteriostatic and biocompatible properties. These findings suggest a promising potential for future applications in the field of biomedical materials."
The Effect of Physical and Virtual Inquiry-Based Experiments on Students’ Attitudes and Learning,"Involving students in laboratory and inquiry-based activities can help them understand the concepts of physics. However the learning process should not only focus on the concepts. Moreover, the advantages of using virtual or physical labs are still under examination. The purpose of this study is to analyse which of the two modes (virtual or physical) is the most effective for high-school students, in terms of conceptual understanding and attitudes. The criteria for this comparison are (a) the contribution of these two modes to the improvement of conceptual understanding and (b) the students’ attitudes towards both modes of laboratory. The participants were high-school students of 3rd grade in two different groups. For the purpose of the study, four educational scenarios were created: two in the field of Mechanics and two in that of Electricity. The study revealed no statistically significant difference regarding students’ experimenting in either lab mode. Moreover, students’ attitudes towards both virtual and physical labs were similarly positive. We assume that these results may contribute to a broader perspective on choosing the lab mode when designing activities, given the fact that both the understanding and attitudes of the students are similar in the cases examined. Thus, the final choice of modality should be based on other factors, such as the adequacy of equipment, the educational conditions (e.g. distance education) and the specific learning goals set by the teacher."
An all-optical 1*2 de-multiplexer based on two-dimensional nonlinear photonic crystal ring resonators,"In this work, a new configuration of an all-optical nonlinear de-multiplexer gate based on two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystals (PhC) is proposed. The gate is considered in the double-ring resonator shaped structure of silicon rods. In order to have a more functional structure, some defect rods made of nonlinear materials were positioned in the structure. Considering the functionality of the structure, photonic band gap (PBG), field distribution and transmitted power spectra are investigated. Plane wave expansion and finite difference time domain (FDTD) methods are utilized for extracting the PBG and field distribution diagrams. The remarkable dimension, bit rate, maximum intensity and contrast ratio of 116.64 µm2, 3.125 Tbit/s, 97% and 40.2 dB are obtained, respectively, which make the gate an appropriate candidate for utilization in optical integrated circuits."
Research and analysis of Brillouin distributed sensing system based on quasi-single-mode few-mode fiber,"A distributed fiber sensor was fabricated by splicing two single-mode fibers (SMFs) using the few-mode fiber (FMF) technique. A Brillouin optical time domain analysis (BOTDA) system was developed to measure the sensor’s temperature and bending performance. Two-mode and four-mode step FMFs were combined to splice the few-mode segment. The results indicate that the temperature response coefficients of the few-mode segment are only slightly higher than those of the connected single-mode segment, measuring at 1.13 MHz/°C and 1.12 MHz/°C, respectively. The minimum bending radius for the sensor is 0.9 cm, and the four-mode bending response curve is superior to that of the two-mode one, proving that 4-SI-FMF offers better bending sensitivity."
"Investigation of the Optimal Recovery of Sn, Pb, Cu, and Ni from E-waste Generated Type of Slags in the Black Copper Processing Route","Electronic waste (e-waste) is the fastest-growing type of solid waste stream with increasing environmental concern. Fortunately, the presence of valuable metals in the e-waste make its recycling a feasible option. The black copper processing route is one of the most suitable for e-waste recycling. The slag-cleaning part of the process is important in separating certain metals like Sn from the generated slag. In this work, a synthetic e-waste slag was used in reduction experiments to obtain a better understanding of Cu, Ni, Sn, and Pb distribution in the metallic and slag phases in a slag-cleaning unit. Two master slags were synthesized: SiO2-Fe2O3-CaO-Al2O3 and SiO2-Fe2O3-CaO-Al2O3-Na2O. The master slags were doped with oxides of Cu, Ni, Sn, and Pb followed by the reduction experiments. The experimental conditions were highly reductive, resulting in the metals being highly distributed to the metallic phase. Amounts of < 2% Cu and Ni remained in the slag of the Na-free slag, while up to 6% Cu and 21% Ni remained in the Na-containing slag. High material loss was also observed, which was attributed to the volatilization of Pb and Sn. The material loss of Pb was significant, in the range 62–78%."
The Effects of Core–Shell Structure on the Magnetic Properties of Nd-Ce-Fe-B Magnets After Dy Diffusion by Micromagnetic Simulation,"In this work, the influences of core–shell structure and cerium (Ce) content on magnetic properties of Nd-Ce-Fe-B permanent magnets were investigated by the finite difference micromagnetic (FDM) simulation method, and the process of magnetization reversals was systematically discussed. For the (Nd1-xCex)2Fe14B-(Dy2Fe14B) core–shell grains with different core sizes, the coercivity (Hcj) dramatically increases with the shell thickness from 0 to 2 nm and then increases slightly with shell thickness increase to 20 nm; for the grains with the same shell thickness, the Hcj decreases with the increase of core size, and it is due to the increase of demagnetization energy. Moreover, the Hcj remarkably deteriorates as the Ce content increases, which is caused by the lower magnetic crystal anisotropy field (HA). The hysteresis loops of core–shell models exhibit excellent squareness with a shell thickness of 2 nm at different Ce proportions. However, a significant two-step demagnetization feature for the model with the thicker shell sizes and higher Ce content results from the different demagnetization abilities of the shell and core. In addition, in the angular distributions of magnetization, the reversal of the core region is later than that of the outer shell, and the applied field required to inverse increases with the shell thickness. The abnormal two-step demagnetization was caused by the twice abrupt changes that occurred in the Zeeman energy (Eext) and total energy (Etot)."
Impact of printing parameters on in-plane tensile and fracture toughness of fused filament fabricated PEEK,"In this study, we explore the effect of various FFF parameters on the in-plane tensile properties and fracture toughness of 3D-printed poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK). In particular, tensile test of dog bone specimens produced with different zone heater temperatures was conducted to determine the values of elastic modulus and tensile strength. Whereas, three point bending of single-edge notched beam (SENB) printed with different printing configuration, and zone heater temperatures were used to evaluate the mode-I critical strain energy release rate. Crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) and strain fields induced in SENB specimens by crack propagation were captured with digital image correlation (DIC) technique. It was concluded that increasing zone heater temperature improved the tensile strength of the 3D-printed PEEK samples while the elastic modulus reduced. Moreover, zone heater temperature exhibits a ductile behavior with improving the interlaminar fracture toughness compared to high zone heater temperature. Instead, the on-edge printing pattern results in a low interlaminar toughness with transverse crack propagation as shown by the DIC images."
Discrete double factors of a family of odd Weibull-G distributions: features and modeling,"Recently, an increasing volume of complex bivariate data has been generated from diverse sources, particularly within applied sciences. These datasets demand a flexible probabilistic framework for comprehensive analysis and discussion of their characteristics. Consequently, this article introduces and extensively explores a novel bivariate discrete distribution. Various distributional properties, including the joint probability mass function, joint survival function, joint hazard rate function, conditional expectation, and joint probability generating function, are derived and thoroughly discussed. Within this general class, two specific models of the new bivariate distribution are investigated in depth. It is demonstrated that the underlying distribution within this proposed discrete bivariate framework is suitable for modeling both asymmetric and symmetric bivariate data. Furthermore, the joint hazard rate function is employed as a statistical tool for analyzing diverse patterns in failure rates across different surfaces. The maximum likelihood approach is employed to estimate the parameters of this bivariate distribution, yielding the most accurate estimators for fitting real datasets. A comprehensive simulation study is conducted to assess the bias and mean squared errors of these maximum likelihood estimators across various sample sizes. Finally, the utility and significance of this novel bivariate discrete distribution class are exemplified through the analysis of two distinct real-world datasets."
Improvement and protection of olive mill waste-contaminated soils using low-cost natural additives,"Over the last few decades, the use of olive oil has been one of the world's most popular dietary trends, especially in the Mediterranean region. Nevertheless, the olive oil production sector causes serious environmental problems because of the high levels of phenolic compounds in the waste it produces. Managing this olive mill wastewater (OMWW) has always been a challenge. One cost-effective disposal method for such wastewater involves using open evaporation ponds. However, these basins have prompted environmental concerns due to the possibility of leaks and OMWW infiltrating the soil, resulting in the contamination of both soil and groundwater. Remarkably, limited attention has been given to the management of soil contaminated by OMWW. In order to address this environmental issue and conserve soil quality, this study focuses foremost on an examination of the potential benefits of using diatomaceous earth, gypsum and lime as soil additives to remediate the contaminated soil and to reduce environmental harm stemming from uncontrolled OMWW disposal. Additives were applied at various percentages (0, 7.5, 15, 30 w/w) to olive mill waste-contaminated soil collected from the evaporation pond in Agareb, Sfax, Tunisia. Several soil parameters, including electrical conductivity, pH, water-soluble potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, copper, chloride, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and polyphenols, were measured in leachates from the contaminated soil and after mixing this soil with additives. Results showed that olive mill waste-contaminated soil displayed elevated levels of these parameters, including rises in pH, electrical conductivity, potassium, iron, COD and polyphenols such that they often surpassed acceptable limits. However, after applying additives, particularly lime at a ratio of 15%, most of these issues were successfully mitigated, except for high potassium concentrations. Notably, water-soluble polyphenols were reduced by 70%, COD by 35%, copper by 25%, iron by 80%, magnesium by 85% and chloride by 70%, reaching acceptable levels. On the other hand, gypsum yielded mixed results, effectively reducing some elements (polyphenols, COD, copper, iron and chloride) but proving to be less efficient at reducing potassium, calcium and magnesium leaching. Unfortunately, diatomaceous earth (DE) did not significantly reduce most elements, possibly due to the presence of impurities. That is why additives need to be modified or combined before use to achieve higher efficiency. In general, these findings are promising and have the potential to be applied to full-scale remediation applications."
Assessment of the impact of climate change on the use of aeration for the storage of cereal grains in the northwest of Tunisia,"Grain aeration is an environmentally friendly technique commonly used to preserve the grains of cereals. However, this technique could be disrupted by climate change, due to anomalies of the air temperature and relative humidity, which would impact its effectiveness, especially in hot climate regions, such as northern Tunisia. This study examines the future potential of grain aeration over a 30-year projection period (2041–2070), comparing it with the current state (2015–2020) and focusing on the critical storage period (from July to October) in northwestern Tunisia. To assess the effectiveness of the aeration technique, we used the global climate models CNRM-CM5.1 and ESM2M, in combination with the regional climate model SMHI, considering two projection scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 to predict ambient air temperature and relative humidity. The grain aeration simulator AERO was coupled with two process control strategies, AERO2 and the timer controller, to predict grain moisture content, temperature, and suitable aeration times. The results show that the current state, as well as projections based on the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, allow for safe grain storage with moisture levels between 12% and 13% relative humidity throughout the storage period. However, simulations indicate that climate change could reduce the favorable aeration hours, with an average decrease of 23.44 h compared with the current situation with high variability of suitable hours, reflecting the warming trend and prolonged warm periods. This reduction varies significantly due to global warming and the extended warm period. During the 2645 h of storage, the projection shows an average standard deviation of 34.12 h. However, reality indicates an average standard deviation of less than 1. The impact of climate change will reduce the use of ambient air aeration, necessitating careful short-term and long-term planning. To prevent the deterioration of grain quality during storage, it is essential to incorporate the climate change component into expert grain stock management systems and harness the potential of sunlight for grain preservation through chilling aeration."
Optimize the solid waste collection route in construction using the POA algorithm,"This study provides an in-depth exploration of the urban municipal solid waste (MSW) collection issue in the urban context, where there is a continuous rise in individual waste production levels and vulnerability to climate change, particularly in developing countries. The research focuses on a specialized vehicle routing model to optimize the solid waste transportation system within the city, aiding civil engineers and urban planners in strategically locating waste collection station positions for efficient waste collection routes. To enhance the model’s efficiency, a novel combined method is proposed, integrating with the Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA). Experimental evaluations, conducted using real-world data, unequivocally demonstrate that the proposed combined method outperforms alternative approaches, including the current manual MSW collection process in the city. This research makes a significant contribution to the fields of waste management and urban sustainability, with the ultimate goal of mitigating the social, economic, and environmental consequences associated with urban solid waste collection."
ANN modeling of mechanical properties in high-volume fly ash concrete: multi-objective cost optimization using NSGA-II for sustainable construction,"The present study utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to develop a comprehensive model for predicting the mechanical properties of High-Volume Fly Ash (HVFA) concrete, encompassing compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, flexural, and splitting tensile strength. Eight concrete mixes with different fly ash content (0–60%) were taken for the present investigation. Experimental data encompassing compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, flexural strength, and splitting tensile strength, recorded over 180 days, were utilized to train the ANN model. The dataset underwent thorough analysis to yield a statistically robust model capable of estimating diverse mechanical properties of concrete containing any proportion of fly ash at any given concrete age. The strengths projected by the unified ANN model were compared with actual values, revealing remarkable proximity between the anticipated and experimental compressive strength values. Thus, the ANN-based model presents a dependable approach for assessing the strength of fly ash concrete. Moreover, a comprehensive multi-objective cost optimization model was developed using NSGA-II to ascertain the most cost-effective and economical mix of HVFA concrete with maximum compressive strength. This research offers valuable insights for designers and practicing engineers involved in sustainable construction endeavors, particularly when considering the incorporation of fly ash within concrete structures."
Quaternion Hyperbolic Fourier Transforms and Uncertainty Principles,"The present study introduces the two-sided and right-sided Quaternion Hyperbolic Fourier Transforms (QHFTs) for analyzing two-dimensional quaternion-valued signals defined in an open rectangle of the Euclidean plane endowed with a hyperbolic measure. The different forms of these transforms are defined by replacing the Euclidean plane waves with the corresponding hyperbolic plane waves in one dimension, giving the hyperbolic counterpart of the corresponding Euclidean Quaternion Fourier Transforms. Using hyperbolic geometry tools, we study the main operational and mapping properties of the QHFTs, such as linearity, shift, modulation, dilation, symmetry, inversion, and derivatives. Emphasis is placed on novel hyperbolic derivative and hyperbolic primitive concepts, which lead to the differentiation and integration properties of the QHFTs. We further prove the Riemann–Lebesgue Lemma and Parseval’s identity for the two-sided QHFT. Besides, we establish the Logarithmic, Heisenberg–Weyl, Donoho–Stark, and Benedicks’ uncertainty principles associated with the two-sided QHFT by invoking hyperbolic counterparts of the convolution, Pitt’s inequality, and the Poisson summation formula. This work is motivated by the potential applications of the QHFTs and the analysis of the corresponding hyperbolic quaternionic signals."
Synthesis of Yellow Fluorescence Carbon Dots for the Applications of Vitamin B12 Detection and Cell Imaging,"In this work, bright yellow fluorescent and multifunctional carbon dots (N-CDs) were prepared by hydrothermal method from O-phenylenediamine and 4-aminobenzoic acid. The fluorescence characterization showed that the N-CDs possessed good optical properties (QY = 32%) and excitation dependent multi-color emission. By exciting with 390 nm, the strong selective interaction of VB12 with N-CDs could result in a sharp decrease in the luminescence of N-CDs at 567 nm. An efficient fluorescence sensor in aqueous solution was constructed which could linearly respond VB12 in wide concentration ranges of 0–90 μM and 140–250 μM. The linear correlation coefficients of N-CDs and VB12 were 0.9950 and 0.9968, respectively, and the detection limit was 0.119 μM. N-CDs were performed for sensitive determination of VB12 in real samples. Moreover, the N-CDs were exploited to image cell. This N-CDs was a sensitive fluorescence probe to monitor VB12 and presented prospective potential in living cells imaging."
Structural Investigation and Optical Properties of Dysprosium (Dy3+) Ions Doped Oxyfluoro Antimony Borate Glasses for Photonics Applications,"Dysprosium oxide-doped glasses with a composition of 60B2O3-10Sb2O3-10Al2O3-10NaF-(10-x) LiF-xDy2O3 (x = 0.1,0.5, 1.0,1.5,2.0,2.5 mol%) were prepared using a conventional melt-quenching technique. The glasses were characterized through various analytical investigations, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, refractive index, density, optical absorption, excitation, photoluminescence (PL) studies, decay measurements and radiation shielding parameters. The XRD and FT-IR confirms the glassy nature and functional groups present in the titled glass. The absorption spectra were used to determine the oscillator strength of the Dy3+ absorption transitions as well as the bond created with the O−2 ion in the titled glass network. The degree of the suitability of developed glasses for lasing applications was demonstrated by radiative parameters determined using Judd–Ofelt theory. In the prepared glass samples, the optical bandgap measurements indicate the presence of non-bridging oxygen (NBOs), localization of charges and donor centers in the titled glasses. Due to the de-excitation of 4F9/2 to the corresponding 6H15/2,6H13/2 and 6H11/2 states, the PL emission spectrum shows two main strong emissions at blue(480nm), yellow (575nm) and one less emission at red (663nm). The CIE coordinates determined using PL emission spectra reveal the coordinates that are falling within the white light region. Various shielding parameters such as mass attenuation coefficient, mean free path, effective atomic number were estimated to understand the radiative shielding nature of the titled glasses. Within the addition of Dy2O3, it was found that the shielding parameters values of the titled glass samples are increasing. The Mass Attenuation Coefficient, Half Value Layer and Mean Free Path of the as prepared glasses has been compared with different types of concretes to understand the shielding effectiveness of prepared glass."
Improvement in mechanical and microstructural properties of novel TA7/Nb/Cu/SS304 composite joints by reducing intermetallic compounds,"The joining of titanium and stainless steel is challenging with conventional filler metals due to the formation of Fe-Ti intermetallic compounds (IMCs). Therefore, a filler that is compatible with both metals is necessary to avoid these IMCs and enhance the mechanical properties of Ti-SS joint. This research aims to investigate the effect of novel Nb-Cu composite filler on mechanical and microstructure properties of TA7-SS304 dissimilar hybrid composite joints using gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process. The mechanical properties: ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and micro hardness have been analyzed and assessed through the microstructure of weld interfaces and fracture zones. Results revealed that welding current (I) affects the UTS significantly whereas micro hardness is greatly influenced by welding speed (Ws). The maximum UTS of 293 MPa and micro hardness of 100 HV as well as minimum tensile residual stresses of 180 MPa and 170 MPa on SS 304 and TA7 sides, respectively have been attained at optimal parameters of I = 40 A, Ws = 150 mm/min and GFR = 18 lit/min. SEM and EDS analysis showed that presence of Cu and Nb solid solutions in the fusion zone contributed to improvement in UTS. Ductile fracture surface with no prominent defects is obtained at optimal combination, while brittle fracture with voids and cavities is observed for low-strength joints. X-ray diffraction analysis depicted that the formation of TiFe, Ti2Fe, and TiFe2 compounds and direct mixing of base metals have been successfully inhibited by using Nb-Cu composite filler which improved the Ti-SS bonding."
Attention-based multi-scale recursive residual network for low-light image enhancement,"Aiming at the problems of color distortion, low image processing efficiency, rich context information, spatial information imbalance in the current low-light image enhancement algorithm based on a convolutional neural network. In this paper, an Attention-based multi-scale recursive residual network for low-light image enhancement (AMR-Net) is proposed based on high-resolution, single-scale image processing. First, shallow features are extracted using convolution and channel attention. In the recursive residual unit, a parallel multi-scale residual block is constructed, and the image features are extracted from the three scales: original image resolution, 1/2 resolution, and 1/4 resolution. Then, the deep features and shallow features are connected by selective kernel feature fusion to obtain rich context information and spatial information. Finally, the residual image is obtained by convolution processing of the deep features, and the enhanced image is obtained by adding the original image to the residual image. The experimental results on LOL, LIME, DICM, MEF datasets show that the proposed method has achieved good results in multiple indicators, and reasonably restored the brightness, contrast, and details of the image, thereby intuitively improving the perceived quality of the image."
Small object detection model for UAV aerial image based on YOLOv7,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) aerial image target detection mainly faces the problems of small targets and target occlusion. In order to improve detection accuracy while maintaining efficiency, this work introduces a UAV aerial image small object detection model based on the real-time detector YOLOv7(SOD-YOLOv7). To address the challenge of small object detection, we have designed a module that combines Swin Transformer and convolution to better capture the global context information of small objects in the image. Additionally, we have introduced the Bi-Level Routing Attention (BRA) mechanism to enhance the model's focus on small objects. To improve the model's detection capabilities at multiple scales, we have added detection branches. For the issue of detecting occluded objects, we have incorporated a dynamic detection head with deformable convolution and attention mechanisms to enhance the model's spatial awareness of targets. The experimental results on the VisDrone and CARPK unmanned aerial vehicle image datasets show that the average precision (mAP@0.5) of our model reaches 53.2% and 98.5%, respectively. Compared to the original YOLOv7 method, our model achieves an improvement of 4.3% and 0.3%, demonstrating better performance in detecting small objects. The code will be soon released at https://github.com/Gentle-Hui/SOD-YOLOv7."
Advance application of liquid scintillation counter to estimate radon concentration in groundwater,"Radon (222Rn) is radium’s immediate radioactive decay product (226Ra) in the uranium decay series. Radon is classified as a group 1 carcinogen due to its hazard to human health, and the evaluation of radon concentrations has become essential. Therefore, an advanced method was applied to a liquid scintillation counter (Hidex 300SL) to measure the radon concentration in groundwater. The estimated radon concentration was between 0.1 and 3.20 Bq/L, with an average of 0.96 Bq/L and with a standard deviation of 0.82 Bq/L. The estimated radon concentrations are in the safe range recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC). However, the values are far below the safe range set by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCARE), European Commission (EC), and World Health Organization (WHO) standards. Nevertheless, the estimated radon concentration by this advanced application ensured no risk of radon exposure from the groundwater of the tested area."
Petrological features of stream sediments in two watersheds from the Nyong catchment (Southern Cameroon): implications for the titanium and zirconium exploration,"The Nyong catchment is the second major catchment in Cameroon. Twenty-six (26) stream sediment samples collected from two watersheds (Nlong Mefok and Mbem) from the Nyong catchment to determine the weathering intensity, the provenance of sediments, and the titanium and zirconium (Zr) potentialities. The region is under an equatorial climate of four seasons. This zone is located within the Pan-African Orogeny. The X-ray diffraction results of bulk stream sediments encompass quartz, rutile, ilmenite, muscovite, illite, zircon, and feldspars. The heavy mineral fractions highlight the presence of andalusite and tourmaline, and confirm that of rutile, zircon, and ilmenite. The X-ray fluorescence data present dominance of silica dioxide, iron oxide, and titanium dioxide (TiO2). Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry data also present abundance of vanadium, chromium, copper (Cu), Zr, niobium, tin, hafnium, and light rare earth element. These samples revealed high weathering intensity of source rocks. The high depletion of alkali and alkaline earth elements is also linked to the weathering of rocks as well as the fluvial transport. The thorium/Cu (2.7, 1.73, upper continental crust = 0.61) and lanthanum/scandium (1.15, 0.30) values highlight mixed provenance of the source rocks. TiO2 and Zr contents and the grain sizes found in our samples could be used as reference indices for future exploitation for rutile and zircon."
Velocity-Dependent Effect on the Peak Shear Strength of Rock Joints Considering the Distribution Characteristics of Contact Joint Surface,"This study aims to elucidate the mechanism of velocity-dependent peak shear strength (PSS) for rock joints by examining the three-dimensional distribution characteristics of actual contact joint surface. Shear tests are conducted on saw-cut joints (SCJs) and natural rough rock joints under varying shear velocities (v) but a constant normal stress. The test results reveal that the PSS of SCJs decreases with increasing shear velocity, whereas the PSS of rough joints increases with v. Through analysis of the impact of v on the contact area, a PSS model is developed. The model demonstrates that for SCJs, the contact area decreases with increasing v, resulting in a reduction in the basic friction angle. Conversely, for rough joints, the contact area decreases with increasing v. However, it is observed that, considering the distribution characteristics of the apparent dip angle of asperities on the joint surface, the average roughness of joint surface increases as the contact area decreases. It is the increase in roughness that subsequently leads to an increase in the PSS of rock joints. The new model incorporates the influence of v on both the basic friction angle and peak dilation angle, and the interplay between these factors determines the PSS of rock joints."
Investigation of Corrosion Behavior of Stir-Cast Hybrid Aluminum Composite Reinforced with CeO2 and GNPs Nanoparticles,"This study investigates the corrosion behavior of stir-cast hybrid aluminum composite reinforced with CeO2 and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) nanoparticles used as cylinder liner material in the engines (Automotive, aerospace, and aircraft industries). The composites were prepared using the stir-casting technique, and their microstructure and corrosion behavior was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Potentiodynamic polarization test, respectively. The results showed that the addition of CeO2 and GNPs improved the corrosion resistance of the composites, and the optimal combination of these two nanoparticles was found to be 3 wt % CeO2 and 3 wt % GNPs. The enhanced corrosion resistance was attributed to the formation of a protective layer on the surface of the composite, as well as the effective dispersion and uniform distribution of nanoparticles in the matrix. The 0.031362 was noted as the lowest corrosion rate (mmpy) was noticed in V04 sample at room temperature and at elevated temperatures, the corrosion rate (mmpy) was observed as 0.060081 and 0.063627 at 45 and 75°C, respectively. In the vast majority of the published research publications, either cerium oxide or graphene nanoplatelets were utilized as a single reinforcement or in conjunction with other types of reinforcement such as alumina, silicon carbide, carbon nano-tubes, tungsten carbide, etc, but on the combination of the CeO2 and GNPs as reinforcements have very-2 less literature, with 2 wt % each only. The prepared hybrid aluminum composite (with reinforcing 1 to 3 wt % in Al-6061 alloy) was considered for replacing the cylinder liner material in the piston-cylinder arrangement."
Effects of Different Zn/Mg Ratio and Ti Content on Hot Extruded 7xxx series Aluminum Alloy,"The effects of alloy composition (Zn/Mg ratio and Ti content) on the microstructure and properties of Al–3.5Mg–xZn–1.22Cu–0.2Zr–yTi aluminum alloy were studied in this paper. The results show that after solution treatment at 450°C × 2h + 460°C × 2h + 470°C × 2h + 475°C × 2h, when the Zn/Mg ratio of the alloy increases from 3.55 to 3.85, the grain size of the alloy increases, the insoluble phase increases, the dislocation decreases, and the intergranular corrosion resistance decreases gradually. Under the condition of T6 aging, the hardness and electrical conductivity of the alloy decreased at first and then increased, and the compressive strength at room temperature also decreased at first and then increased, and the hardness and compressive strength reached the maximum when the Zn/Mg ratio was 3.85. When Zn/Mg is constant, with the increase of Ti content (0–0.88 wt %), the recrystallization degree of the alloy decreases, the insoluble phase increases, the dislocation density and strengthening value gradually decrease, the inter-granular corrosion resistance decreases gradually, and the hardness, electrical conductivity and compressive strength of the alloy decrease gradually under T6 aging."
Molecular Dynamics Simulation of the Effect of GO Structure on the Interaction between Alkaline Solution and Ag/GO/C Composite Electrode,"A molecular model of the interaction between alkaline NaCl solution (Sol) and carbon-supported silver/graphene oxide (Ag/GO/C) composite electrode during oxygen reduction reaction was designed and constructed, and the Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the model was carried out. Based on the calculation and analysis of interaction energy (ΔE), diffusion coefficient (D) and radial distribution function (RDF), depending on the type and number of oxygen-containing functional groups of GO, the interaction law between alkaline solution and Ag/GO/C composite electrode was found out, and the interaction mechanism was revealed. The results showed that the interaction force between Sol and Ag/GO/C composite electrodes with 4 different GO structures (GO1, GO2, GO3 and GO4) is mutual attraction at 353 K. The interaction energy between the Sol and the Ag/GO2/C electrode is the highest in numerical terms, and the diffusion capacity of Na+ and Cl– in the Sol is the weakest in the electrode system, indicating that the interaction between the Sol and the Ag/GO2/C electrode prevents the diffusion of solution molecules or ions on the surface of the electrode. The results of RDF showed that O2, Na+ and Cl– in solution within 3.5 Å have no obvious bonding effect with the electrode, while Sol has obvious bonding effect. When the interaction distance is 5–8 Å, O2, Na+, Cl–, Sol in the system and Ag atoms in different composite electrodes all have obvious non-bond interaction, indicating that Sol and the electrode are prone to bond interaction in the short-range region and non-bond interaction in the remote region, while O2, Na+, Cl–, and the electrode are only prone to non-bond interaction in the remote region. In other words, Ag/GO/C composite electrode has bonding and non-bonding effects in the formation of ORR system in alkaline NaCl solution, and it is mainly provided by non-bonding effects. When the number of –O–, –OH, –COOH in GO is 5 : 5 : 2 (GO2), that is, Ag/GO2/C composite electrode is most prone to ORR. This further proved that adding GO to the composite electrode can improve the catalytic performance of the electrode. These results are helpful to provide theoretical support for the research and development of electrodes in electrolytic chlor-alkali industry."
Corrosion Behaviour of 17-4 PH Stainless Steels Produced by Adding Different Amounts of Alloying Element and Aged at Different Times,"In this study the corrosion behaviour of 17-4 PH (precipitation hardening) stainless steel alloys, produced by adding Ta different amounts with the method of powder metallurgy, and aged at different times was investigated. Four different amounts tantalum (0.15, 0.30, 0.45 and 0.60% weight) was added to the alloy. The prepared powders were produced green compacts at ∅10 × 6 mm dimensions (800 MPa) after mixing with turbule for 2 hours. Green compacts produced were sintered for 1 h at 1300°C under a vacuum of 10–6 mbar. The sintered samples were aged 1, 4 and 8 hours at 480°C after being in solution at 1050°C. Polarization measurements were performed in a corrosion cell, using three different electrode technique. In the corrosion tests, 0.1 M H2SO4 was used as the electrolyte medium. As a result of the studies, the alloy the hardness and densities were increased with increasing Ta amount. Similarly, the hardness and densities of produced samples were with increasing aging time. The corrosion tests revealed that increasing the amount of Ta added to the alloy increased the alloy’s resistance to corrosion. The alloy’s corrosion resistance decreased as aging time increased. The active corrosion mechanism was seen to be pitting corrosion in all alloys."
Corrosion Inhibition Efficiency of Ghars Date Extract on API 5L X70 Pipeline Steel in Hydrochloric Acid,"The inability to produce raw materials in sufficient quantities, such as fruits, plants, pigments and resins, to manufacture green inhibitors is considered one of the biggest reasons that hinder the commercial use of these eco-friendly inhibitors. In Asia and Africa, date fruit is produced in large quantities. This fruit contains polysaccharides (primarily galacturonic acid) that can be used as a green inhibitor. The inhibition effect of Ghars date extract (GDE) on the corrosion of API 5L X70 pipeline steel in 0.5 M HCl solution was studied for the first time using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, potentiodynamic polarization curves, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The results show that GDE is an excellent inhibitor. The inhibition efficiency was 94 % at 2 g/L GDE. The GDE follows the Langmuir adsorption isotherm and involves physical adsorption. The GDE acts as a mixed-type inhibitor."
"Synthesis, Experimental Characterization, DFT and Theoretical Anticorrosion Study for 1-(4-(3-Methyl-3-phenylcyclobutyl)thiazol-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)thiourea","In this work, 1-(4-(3-methyl-3-phenylcyclobutyl)thiazol-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)thiourea was synthesized by alcohol-mediated condensation of 4-(3-methyl-3-phenylcyclobutyl)thiazol-2-amine and isothiocyanatobenzene. The molecule results were experimentally characterized using FT-IR, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Density functional theory (B3LYP/6-311G) was used to investigate the ideal molecule structure, vibrational frequencies, and 1H with 13C NMR (theoretically) chemical shifts. Theoretical and experimental spectroscopy results were compared and agreed with each other, which indicated the validity of the used developed molecular structure. The Dipole moment, hardness, softness, electronegativity, electrophilicity index, nucleophilicity index, and chemical potential as electronic structural parameters linked to corrosion inhibition efficacy were investigated for the prepared compound. Furthermore, the fraction of transferred electrons was calculated to determine the interaction between the iron surface and organic molecules. The results indicated a favorable relationship between organic-based corrosion inhibitors and quantum chemical parameters processes. The corrosion inhibitors’ behavior can be predicted without the need for experimental investigation."
Trace Element Сontent in the Pink Salmon from the Rivers of the Basins of the Barents Sea and Sea of Okhotsk,"The concentrations of Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu, and Zn were determined in the invasive pink salmon that came to spawn into the Kola and Tuloma rivers of the Kola Peninsula, flowing into the Barents Sea, in July 2019. The content of trace elements in the organs and tissues of pink salmon introduced in the Euro-Arctic waters of Russia was compared to those of the pink salmon from its native range, which returned to spawn in the rivers of the Sakhalin and Iturup islands in 2016–2018. It has been established that concentrations of Zn, Cu, and Ni noticeably predominate in all organs and tissues of introduced pink salmon, whereas Pb and Cd predominate in the Sea of Okhotsk pink salmon. Obviously, the differences in the microelement composition in fish are caused by environmental conditions. In the Barents Sea, they are formed under the influence of the Gulf Stream, as well as the anthropogenic impact of the Kola Peninsula, which is characterized by the extraction, processing, and smelting of a number of metals, primarily Ni and Cu, as well as Zn. In the Sakhalin-Kuril basin, the specificity of the environment and the microelement composition of salmon are due to the influence of natural factors—volcanism and upwellings. Schools of pink salmon during feeding and migration in the Pacific Ocean cross a high-nutrient and at the same time geochemically impact natural zone formed by the Kuril Ridge and the Kuril-Kamchatka Depression, which supplies chemical elements to surface waters. Here, the concentration of Pb is most markedly increased in fish. The development of the introduced pink salmon in the new area is facilitated by the recent increase in temperature in the waters of the North Atlantic, so the amount of fish production in it will increase. The mastering of pink salmon in new feeding places sets before scientists the task of monitoring the dynamics of its abundance and taking adequate measures for fishery regulation and fish quality control."
Two Life Strategies in Copepod Cryptic Species: Coexistence and Displacement,"Among invasive species there is a special group so named cryptic species for which morphological identification is very difficult. This review is devoted to analysis of the dispersal routes of two copepod cryptic species complexes into aquatic ecosystems. Eurytemora carolleeae introduction was revealed in 2007 with bar-code. The species was described as a new taxon; its distribution was also studied using morphology. Biological invasions of two other Copepod species Acanthocyclops americanus and Eurytemora caspica were mainly studied using morphological methods since the species have already been described. At the same time, to confirm their distinctions from local forms molecular genetic tools were also used. Two scenarios resulting from cryptic species’ invasions and their competitions with native species were the partly (E. carrolleeae) or full displacement (A. americanus). When assessing the possible negative impact of invasive species on competitors, the most attention should be paid to predator species. Identification of cryptic species significantly complicates the situation with the assessment of bioinvasion and needs the use of molecular methods."
"American Mink (Neovison vison) in Yakutia: Morphology, Distribution, Abundance","The article presents data on the morphology, range, and number of the American mink in Yakutia, gives materials on its morpho- and craniometry. Data on the dynamics of the range and number of the American mink in Yakutia from the moment of its introduction in the early 1960s to the present time are shown. The range of the mink has expanded in the northeast direction from Southern Yakutia to Central Yakutia for half a century, and new mink settlement sites on the eastern side of Yakutia from Magadan Region have been noted. After naturalization of the American mink for 25 years, there was a gradual increase in its number from 686 individuals to 4000–5000 individuals. Over the next 35 years, the number of the species stabilized and has remained at this level with some fluctuations over the years, excluding 2005–2006, when there was a sharp increase in the number of mink."
Integrated Approach to Accounting for Environmental Factors in Models of the Current Distribution and Climatic Dynamics of Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. in the Caucasus,"Current climate change, habitat degradation, and road network development contribute to the invasion of alien plant species in areas of more northern latitudes and higher altitudes. Using the maximum entropy method (Maxent), we built spatial distribution models of Ambrosia artemisiifolia, considering abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic factors and accessibility to the area. Maps of the species current distribution in the Caucasus and its range dynamics according to the climate change scenarios were constructed. The most important variables determining A. artemisiifolia spatial localization in the region were as follows: distance to roads (not more than 0–5 m), terrain roughness (gentle areas), and humidity (climate from semiarid to perhumid). The distance of 0–5 m is also characterized by the area accessibility factor (species dispersal capacity), which contributed about 47% to the final model. Species dispersal beyond roadsides was hindered by forests and meadows with the probability of A. artemisiifolia occurrence not exceeding 0.01%. The species core ranges were predicted in foothills and low mountains of the Western and Central Caucasus, Western and Central Transcaucasia, the northwestern Lesser Caucasus, and the Caspian Sea coast. The species invasion in highlands could occur along the gentle river valleys that concentrate the main mountain roads. According to the pessimistic and optimistic climate change scenarios, by 2100, the decline in optimal A. artemisiifolia habitats will be 87 and 27%, respectively, and will affect mainly the plain areas of the currently most humid regions. The main core ranges were predicted in the middle mountains and highlands of the Caucasus."
Dual-state dual emission from precise chemically engineered bi-ligand MOF free from encapsulation and functionalization with self-calibration model for visual detection,"Synthesis of dual-state dual emitting metal–organic frameworks (DSDE-MOFs) is uncommon and challenging. Additionally, DSDE-MOFs can fulfil the expanding need for on-site detection due to their stability and self-reference for a variety of non-analyte variables. In the present work, a novel intrinsic DSDE of chemically engineered bi-ligand Eu-based MOF (UoZ-1) was designed. The prepared UoZ-1 spherical particles were small-sized  around 10–12 nm and displayed blue (425 nm) and red fluorescence (620 nm) at both states, dispersed in liquid and in solid state, when excited at 250 nm. A ratiometry platform was developed since the red emission was quenched by the addition of folic acid and the blue emission was almost remained unaffected. In the fluorometric ratiometric-mode, a dynamic linear range was recorded from 10 to 200 µM with LOD about 0.4 µM. Visual-based detection with assistance of smartphone was developed for quantification based on RGB analysis using Color Grab App. In the visual-mode, LOD as small as 2.3 µM was recorded. By utilizing the intrinsic dual-emitting UoZ-1, highly stable, recyclable, sensitive, and selective on-site visual detection of folic acid can be achieved. UoZ-1, a DSDE-MOF with no encapsulation or functionalization requirements, exhibits great potential for diverse applications."
Corrosion Behaviour of 17-4 PH Stainless Steels Produced by Adding Different Amounts of Alloying Element and Aged at Different Times,"In this study the corrosion behaviour of 17-4 PH (precipitation hardening) stainless steel alloys, produced by adding Ta different amounts with the method of powder metallurgy, and aged at different times was investigated. Four different amounts tantalum (0.15, 0.30, 0.45 and 0.60% weight) was added to the alloy. The prepared powders were produced green compacts at ∅10 × 6 mm dimensions (800 MPa) after mixing with turbule for 2 hours. Green compacts produced were sintered for 1 h at 1300°C under a vacuum of 10–6 mbar. The sintered samples were aged 1, 4 and 8 hours at 480°C after being in solution at 1050°C. Polarization measurements were performed in a corrosion cell, using three different electrode technique. In the corrosion tests, 0.1 M H2SO4 was used as the electrolyte medium. As a result of the studies, the alloy the hardness and densities were increased with increasing Ta amount. Similarly, the hardness and densities of produced samples were with increasing aging time. The corrosion tests revealed that increasing the amount of Ta added to the alloy increased the alloy’s resistance to corrosion. The alloy’s corrosion resistance decreased as aging time increased. The active corrosion mechanism was seen to be pitting corrosion in all alloys."
Corrosion Inhibition Efficiency of Ghars Date Extract on API 5L X70 Pipeline Steel in Hydrochloric Acid,"The inability to produce raw materials in sufficient quantities, such as fruits, plants, pigments and resins, to manufacture green inhibitors is considered one of the biggest reasons that hinder the commercial use of these eco-friendly inhibitors. In Asia and Africa, date fruit is produced in large quantities. This fruit contains polysaccharides (primarily galacturonic acid) that can be used as a green inhibitor. The inhibition effect of Ghars date extract (GDE) on the corrosion of API 5L X70 pipeline steel in 0.5 M HCl solution was studied for the first time using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, potentiodynamic polarization curves, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The results show that GDE is an excellent inhibitor. The inhibition efficiency was 94 % at 2 g/L GDE. The GDE follows the Langmuir adsorption isotherm and involves physical adsorption. The GDE acts as a mixed-type inhibitor."
Molecular Dynamics Simulation of the Effect of GO Structure on the Interaction between Alkaline Solution and Ag/GO/C Composite Electrode,"A molecular model of the interaction between alkaline NaCl solution (Sol) and carbon-supported silver/graphene oxide (Ag/GO/C) composite electrode during oxygen reduction reaction was designed and constructed, and the Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the model was carried out. Based on the calculation and analysis of interaction energy (ΔE), diffusion coefficient (D) and radial distribution function (RDF), depending on the type and number of oxygen-containing functional groups of GO, the interaction law between alkaline solution and Ag/GO/C composite electrode was found out, and the interaction mechanism was revealed. The results showed that the interaction force between Sol and Ag/GO/C composite electrodes with 4 different GO structures (GO1, GO2, GO3 and GO4) is mutual attraction at 353 K. The interaction energy between the Sol and the Ag/GO2/C electrode is the highest in numerical terms, and the diffusion capacity of Na+ and Cl– in the Sol is the weakest in the electrode system, indicating that the interaction between the Sol and the Ag/GO2/C electrode prevents the diffusion of solution molecules or ions on the surface of the electrode. The results of RDF showed that O2, Na+ and Cl– in solution within 3.5 Å have no obvious bonding effect with the electrode, while Sol has obvious bonding effect. When the interaction distance is 5–8 Å, O2, Na+, Cl–, Sol in the system and Ag atoms in different composite electrodes all have obvious non-bond interaction, indicating that Sol and the electrode are prone to bond interaction in the short-range region and non-bond interaction in the remote region, while O2, Na+, Cl–, and the electrode are only prone to non-bond interaction in the remote region. In other words, Ag/GO/C composite electrode has bonding and non-bonding effects in the formation of ORR system in alkaline NaCl solution, and it is mainly provided by non-bonding effects. When the number of –O–, –OH, –COOH in GO is 5 : 5 : 2 (GO2), that is, Ag/GO2/C composite electrode is most prone to ORR. This further proved that adding GO to the composite electrode can improve the catalytic performance of the electrode. These results are helpful to provide theoretical support for the research and development of electrodes in electrolytic chlor-alkali industry."
Investigation of Corrosion Behavior of Stir-Cast Hybrid Aluminum Composite Reinforced with CeO2 and GNPs Nanoparticles,"This study investigates the corrosion behavior of stir-cast hybrid aluminum composite reinforced with CeO2 and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) nanoparticles used as cylinder liner material in the engines (Automotive, aerospace, and aircraft industries). The composites were prepared using the stir-casting technique, and their microstructure and corrosion behavior was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Potentiodynamic polarization test, respectively. The results showed that the addition of CeO2 and GNPs improved the corrosion resistance of the composites, and the optimal combination of these two nanoparticles was found to be 3 wt % CeO2 and 3 wt % GNPs. The enhanced corrosion resistance was attributed to the formation of a protective layer on the surface of the composite, as well as the effective dispersion and uniform distribution of nanoparticles in the matrix. The 0.031362 was noted as the lowest corrosion rate (mmpy) was noticed in V04 sample at room temperature and at elevated temperatures, the corrosion rate (mmpy) was observed as 0.060081 and 0.063627 at 45 and 75°C, respectively. In the vast majority of the published research publications, either cerium oxide or graphene nanoplatelets were utilized as a single reinforcement or in conjunction with other types of reinforcement such as alumina, silicon carbide, carbon nano-tubes, tungsten carbide, etc, but on the combination of the CeO2 and GNPs as reinforcements have very-2 less literature, with 2 wt % each only. The prepared hybrid aluminum composite (with reinforcing 1 to 3 wt % in Al-6061 alloy) was considered for replacing the cylinder liner material in the piston-cylinder arrangement."
Effects of Different Zn/Mg Ratio and Ti Content on Hot Extruded 7xxx series Aluminum Alloy,"The effects of alloy composition (Zn/Mg ratio and Ti content) on the microstructure and properties of Al–3.5Mg–xZn–1.22Cu–0.2Zr–yTi aluminum alloy were studied in this paper. The results show that after solution treatment at 450°C × 2h + 460°C × 2h + 470°C × 2h + 475°C × 2h, when the Zn/Mg ratio of the alloy increases from 3.55 to 3.85, the grain size of the alloy increases, the insoluble phase increases, the dislocation decreases, and the intergranular corrosion resistance decreases gradually. Under the condition of T6 aging, the hardness and electrical conductivity of the alloy decreased at first and then increased, and the compressive strength at room temperature also decreased at first and then increased, and the hardness and compressive strength reached the maximum when the Zn/Mg ratio was 3.85. When Zn/Mg is constant, with the increase of Ti content (0–0.88 wt %), the recrystallization degree of the alloy decreases, the insoluble phase increases, the dislocation density and strengthening value gradually decrease, the inter-granular corrosion resistance decreases gradually, and the hardness, electrical conductivity and compressive strength of the alloy decrease gradually under T6 aging."

Ammonia scavenger and glutamine synthetase inhibitors cocktail in targeting mTOR/β-catenin and MMP-14 for nitrogen homeostasis and liver cancer,"The glutamine synthetase (GS) facilitates cancer cell growth by catalyzing de novo glutamine synthesis. This enzyme removes ammonia waste from the liver following the urea cycle. Since cancer development is associated with dysregulated urea cycles, there has been no investigation of GS’s role in ammonia clearance. Here, we demonstrate that, although GS expression is increased in the setting of β-catenin oncogenic activation, it is insufficient to clear the ammonia waste burden due to the dysregulated urea cycle and may thus be unable to prevent cancer formation. In vivo study, a total of 165 male Swiss albino mice allocated in 11 groups were used, and liver cancer was induced by p-DAB. The activity of GS was evaluated along with the relative expression of mTOR, β-catenin, MMP-14, and GS genes in liver samples and HepG2 cells using qRT-PCR. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of the NH3 scavenger phenyl acetate (PA) and/or GS-inhibitor L-methionine sulfoximine (MSO) and the migratory potential of cells was assessed by MTT and wound healing assays, respectively. The Swiss target prediction algorithm was used to screen the mentioned compounds for probable targets. The treatment of the HepG2 cell line with PA plus MSO demonstrated strong cytotoxicity. The post-scratch remaining wound area (%) in the untreated HepG2 cells was 2.0%. In contrast, the remaining wound area (%) in the cells treated with PA, MSO, and PA + MSO for 48 h was 61.1, 55.8, and 78.5%, respectively. The combination of the two drugs had the greatest effect, resulting in the greatest decrease in the GS activity, β-catenin, and mTOR expression. MSO and PA are both capable of suppressing mTOR, a key player in the development of HCC, and MMP-14, a key player in the development of HCC. PA inhibited the MMP-14 enzyme more effectively than MSO, implying that PA might be a better way to target HCC as it inhibited MMP-14 more effectively than MSO. A large number of abnormal hepatocytes (5%) were found to be present in the HCC mice compared to mice in the control group as determined by the histopathological lesions scores. In contrast, PA, MSO, and PA + MSO showed a significant reduction in the hepatic lesions score either when protecting the liver or when treating the liver. The molecular docking study indicated that PA and MSO form a three-dimensional structure with NF-κB and COX-II, blocking their ability to promote cancer and cause gene mutations. PA and MSO could be used to manipulate GS activities to modulate ammonia levels, thus providing a potential treatment for ammonia homeostasis."
"PERSIAN trial (NCT05717660): an ongoing randomized trial testing androgen deprivation therapy, apalutamide and stereotactic body radiotherapy. An alternative “triplet” for oligometastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer patients","Earlier treatment intensification with systemic potent androgen receptor inhibition has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer. Nonetheless, oligometastatic patients may benefit from local treatment approaches such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Aiming to explore the benefit of SBRT in this scenario, we designed this trial to specifically test the hypothesis that SBRT will improve clinical outcomes in select population affected by metachronous oligometastatic HSPC treated with androgen deprivation therapy + apalutamide. Enrolled patients will be randomized to receive the standard systemic treatment alone or in combination with SBRT on all metastatic sites of disease. Here we report the protocol design and an overview of the ongoing trials testing different integration strategies between RT and systemic therapies."
An extended 2D Gao beam model,"This work derives and simulates a two-dimensional extension of the nonlinear Gao beam, by adding the cross-sectional shear variable, similarly to the extension of the usual Bernoulli–Euler beam into the Timoshenko beam. The model allows for oscillatory motion about a buckled state, as well as adds vertical shear of the cross sections, thus reflecting better nonlinear thick beams. The static model is derived from the principle of virtual elastic energy, and is in the form of a highly nonlinear coupled system for the beams transverse vibrations and the motion of the cross sections. The model allows for general distributive transversal and longitudinal loads and a compressive horizontal load acting on its edges. The model is simulated numerically, using the dynamic version for better insight into the steady solutions. The terms that distinguish our numerical solutions from the solutions of the Gao beam, described in the literature, are highlighted. The numerical scheme and its characteristic finite element matrices allow us to obtain simulation results that demonstrate the type of vibrations of our extended and modified beam, and also the differences between these solutions and those of the Gao beam model."
An Intelligent System of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Using Synovial Motor Control and PID Motor Control for EoT Computing: a Comparative Simulation Study,"Developing intelligent control models for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) is crucial from both a theoretical and practical standpoint due to the growing use of these motors in industrial production, agriculture, and edge computing applications. The standard proportional integral derivative (PID) control is inadequate for Edge of Things (EoT) applications with high requirements and demands when operating a PMSM because of its poor anti-disturbance capacity. To increase the robustness of a PMSM, this study proposes a controller that integrates the existing synovial control method with our newly introduced sliding mode control-based fuzzy control theory. Furthermore, we compare the performance of synovial and fuzzy sliding mode control with the conventional PID control system for the PMSM control system. To evaluate the control strategies proposed in this study in terms of different performance measures such as robustness, dynamic steady-state control, and stability, we performed multiple experiments. The experimental results illustrate that intelligent control strategies have better resilience and performance as compared to the PID control method, making them more suitable for edge computing applications. Further, this study also provides insight into the potential of intelligent control algorithms for improving the performance of PMSM in an EoT computing context."
"Numerous insertions of mitochondrial DNA in the genome of the northern mole vole, Ellobius talpinus","Ellobius talpinus is a subterranean rodent representing an attractive model in population ecology studies due to its highly special lifestyle and sociality. In such studies, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is widely used. However, if nuclear copies of mtDNA, aka NUMTs, are present, they may co-amplify with the target mtDNA fragment, generating misleading results. The aim of this study was to determine whether NUMTs are present in E. talpinus."

Association between vitamin D receptor gene FokI polymorphism and mortality in patients with sepsis,"Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction as a result of the host’s dysregulated immune response to infection. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene FokI polymorphism influences immune cell behavior. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the association between VDR FokI polymorphism and mortality in sepsis and non-sepsis patients in the intensive care unit (ICU)."
Understanding the bacterial community structure associated with the Eichhornia crassipes rootzone,"Plant microbiome acts as an interface between plants and their environment, aiding in the functioning of the ecosystem, such as protection against abiotic and biotic stress along with improving nutrient uptake. The rhizosphere is an essential interface for the interaction between plants and microbes and plays a substantial part in the removal as well as uptake of heavy metals and antibiotics from contaminated locations. Eichhornia crassipes is a promising plant that contains a rich community of microbes in its rhizosphere. Microorganism’s association with plants embodies a crucial pathway via which humans can also be exposed to antibiotic-resistant genes and bacteria."
"The Feeling Rules of Peer Review: Defining, Displaying, and Managing Emotions in Evaluation for Research Funding","Punctuated by joy, disappointments, and conflicts, research evaluation constitutes an intense, emotional moment in scientific life. Yet reviewers and research institutions often expect evaluations to be conducted objectively and dispassionately. Inspired by the scholarship describing the role of emotions in scientific practices, we argue instead, that reviewers actively define, display and manage their emotions in response to the structural organization of research evaluation. Our article examines reviewing practices used in the European Research Council’s (ERC) Starting and Consolidator grants and in the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action’s (MSCA) Individual Fellowships. These two European funding mechanisms offer different perspectives on the organization of grant evaluation. We conducted interviews with review panel members and analyzed various institutional documents. By drawing on the sociological concepts of feeling rules and emotional work, we demonstrate that reviewers define rules concerning how emotions should be experienced and expressed to ensure the proper functioning of evaluation, and that reviewers experience the need to actively regulate their emotions to comply with these rules. We present four feeling rules concerning the experience and expression of: (1) excitement for novelty during individual evaluation; (2) respect for others’ opinions and the absence of anger in review panels; (3) attentiveness and interest, which are seen as missing in online evaluations. Reviewers also expect ERC candidates to (4) avoid pride and manifest modesty during interviews. These rules demonstrate that proposal peer review is governed by emotional norms, and show the influence of organizational settings and moral requirements on research evaluation."
The Effects of Core–Shell Structure on the Magnetic Properties of Nd-Ce-Fe-B Magnets After Dy Diffusion by Micromagnetic Simulation,"In this work, the influences of core–shell structure and cerium (Ce) content on magnetic properties of Nd-Ce-Fe-B permanent magnets were investigated by the finite difference micromagnetic (FDM) simulation method, and the process of magnetization reversals was systematically discussed. For the (Nd1-xCex)2Fe14B-(Dy2Fe14B) core–shell grains with different core sizes, the coercivity (Hcj) dramatically increases with the shell thickness from 0 to 2 nm and then increases slightly with shell thickness increase to 20 nm; for the grains with the same shell thickness, the Hcj decreases with the increase of core size, and it is due to the increase of demagnetization energy. Moreover, the Hcj remarkably deteriorates as the Ce content increases, which is caused by the lower magnetic crystal anisotropy field (HA). The hysteresis loops of core–shell models exhibit excellent squareness with a shell thickness of 2 nm at different Ce proportions. However, a significant two-step demagnetization feature for the model with the thicker shell sizes and higher Ce content results from the different demagnetization abilities of the shell and core. In addition, in the angular distributions of magnetization, the reversal of the core region is later than that of the outer shell, and the applied field required to inverse increases with the shell thickness. The abnormal two-step demagnetization was caused by the twice abrupt changes that occurred in the Zeeman energy (Eext) and total energy (Etot)."
"Investigation of the Optimal Recovery of Sn, Pb, Cu, and Ni from E-waste Generated Type of Slags in the Black Copper Processing Route","Electronic waste (e-waste) is the fastest-growing type of solid waste stream with increasing environmental concern. Fortunately, the presence of valuable metals in the e-waste make its recycling a feasible option. The black copper processing route is one of the most suitable for e-waste recycling. The slag-cleaning part of the process is important in separating certain metals like Sn from the generated slag. In this work, a synthetic e-waste slag was used in reduction experiments to obtain a better understanding of Cu, Ni, Sn, and Pb distribution in the metallic and slag phases in a slag-cleaning unit. Two master slags were synthesized: SiO2-Fe2O3-CaO-Al2O3 and SiO2-Fe2O3-CaO-Al2O3-Na2O. The master slags were doped with oxides of Cu, Ni, Sn, and Pb followed by the reduction experiments. The experimental conditions were highly reductive, resulting in the metals being highly distributed to the metallic phase. Amounts of < 2% Cu and Ni remained in the slag of the Na-free slag, while up to 6% Cu and 21% Ni remained in the Na-containing slag. High material loss was also observed, which was attributed to the volatilization of Pb and Sn. The material loss of Pb was significant, in the range 62–78%."
Group 13 metal compounds as catalyst for the homopolymerization of epoxides,"The ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of epoxides, namely cyclohexene oxide (CHO), propylene oxide (PO), and tert-butyl glycidyl ether (tBuGE) catalyzed by Group 13 (Al, Ga, In) metal initiators is reported. These polymerization reactions were performed under solvent-free conditions and in the presence of chloroform (CHCl3) and toluene. InCl3 was the most efficient catalyst for the polymerization in the presence of CHCl3, and monomer loading up to 10,000 equivalents. It was observed that though the polymerization rate was slow in the presence of a solvent, the polymerization was much more controlled than in solvent-free conditions, producing exceptionally high molecular weights with narrow dispersities. The highest molecular weight of the polymer attained was 136.3 kg/mol, with CHO as the monomer. The order of reactivity for the epoxides was found to be CHO > tBuGE > PO. The polymerization reaction proceeds through an activated chain-end mechanism as established from the MALDI-TOF analysis of the polymer. These polymers were found to be atactic."
Preparation and characterization of deproteinized natural rubber/graphene oxide composite,"This study aims to prepare and characterize a composite of graphene oxide (GO) and deproteinized natural rubber (DPNR/GO). The GO was synthesized using the modified Hummer method, and characterized with XRD, Raman, TEM, and water contact angle measurements. The results showed that GO was succesfully exfoliated from graphite with XRD diffraction peak shifted from 11° to 26°, the Raman D/G band intensity increased from 0.11 to 0.93 and the water contact angle increased from 67° to 85°. Then, DPNR/GO composite was prepared via graft copolymerization using tetraethylenepentaamine/tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TEPA/TBHPO) as redox initiators and the composites with GO content of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 phr were studied. The XRD pattern for DPNR/GO showed no significant difference to that for DPNR. However, there is a slightly shift in IR absorption peaks at 3461 and 1747 cm−1 for DPNR/GO composite compared to DPNR/GO blend. The Tg of DPNR at -65.2 °C was also shifted to -64.1 °C after formation of DPNR/GO composite. The DPNR/GO composite with 1.0 phr of GO exhibited the highest gel content (60.9%) and tensile strength (9.74 MPa) among the samples. While the storage modulus of DPNR/GO composite (0.99 MPa) was lower than that of DPNR/GO blend (3.31 MPa), DPNR/GO composite exhibited both energetic and entropic elasticity compared to the blend."
Filial Piety and the Development of Independence and Interdependence During Emerging Adulthood: A Longitudinal Study of Taiwanese Adolescents,"While filial piety has been widely studied in Confucian-influenced societies, little is known about how it may influence the development of emerging adults’ independence and interdependence. Using a population-based longitudinal study in Taiwan (N = 3,149; 49.5% females), this study examined the association between filial piety in adolescence (aged 13–15) and independence and interdependence in emerging adulthood (aged 22). Results show that greater adherence to filial piety in adolescence predicts higher independence in emerging adulthood. Additionally, greater adherence to filial piety predicts higher interdependence for females, but not males, when parents hold traditional gender-role attitudes. This study underscores the significance of cultural norms and parental gender-role attitudes in shaping individuals’ development during emerging adulthood."

Study on Nucleation and Growth of Columnar Grains in Non-Oriented Steel by Phase Transformation,"The nucleation and growth of {100}-textured and “toothed” columnar grains in Fe–0.5% Mn non-oriented electrical steels were analyzed by considering the factors like cooling rate and flowing rate of the hydrogen through phase transformation. The results demonstrate that the formation of {100}-textured and “toothed” columnar grains with high grain orientation spread (GOS) values mainly involved the nucleation of {100}-oriented nuclei with high GOS values on the surface region in the incipient stage of the γ (austenite) → α (ferrite) transformation and the growth of them caused by both directed growth along normal direction (ND) and faceted growth on the rolling surface (RS) during solid-state transformation. The morphology, size and structure characteristics of columnar grains are explained in terms of the competitions between the nucleation rate and the rate of directed growth along ND or faceted growth on RS of ferrite nuclei. When the nucleation rate of ferrite nuclei is equal to their directed growth rate along ND during the γ → α transformation, {100}-textured and “toothed” columnar grains with high GOS values are obtained. With a higher nucleation rate of ferrite nuclei than the directed growth rate of {100}-oriented nuclei along ND, three-layer sandwiched structure is formed, including few {100}-textured and “toothed” columnar grain layers with high GOS values on the surface, whereas large numbers of {111}-textured equiaxed grains with low GOS values in the inner layer. In addition, when the faceted growth on the RS of {100}-oriented nuclei is dominant, heavy and coarse “toothed” columnar grains with high GOS values are obtained."

Digital-Public Spaces and the Spiral of Silence: Hyperliberal Illiberalism and the Challenge to Democracy,"The digital space has created a new form of public space: one which provides a dangerous blending of public protest, mob justice, and acquiescence. It offers transformative beliefs a voice while mob justice encourages sanctions against (and the erasure of) detractors. This article argues that the digital is not antithetical to the public sphere but has instead generated a ‘false public.’ It argues that hyperliberal illiberalism acts as a form of social control that triggers a Spiral of Silence, an intolerance of opposing ideologies and a fracturing of the public sphere into macro- and micropublics. This article argues for a return to both free expression and meaningful debate which are fundamental to the proper exercise of democracy."
Observing the Interaction between a Socially-Assistive Robot and Residents in a Nursing Home,"Due to demographic change and transformations in domestic structures as well as working environments, the need for formal care continues to increase. This process leads to a significantly greater number of care workers that will be needed in the future. Concurrently, the demands on caregivers concerning the amount of care and quality of care are increasing. Socially-assistive robots (SARs) are a promising resource in this regard. At the same time, research that directly addresses the target group of elderly persons with cognitive impairments is underrepresented. This study reports observations regarding the interaction between a SAR and elderly people with cognitive impairments. Seven observational and behavioural measures were conducted during the interaction between residents of a nursing home and the SAR named “James”. Twelve participants from two residential homes took part in the study. Data were analysed by using content analysis and interpreted along a technology acceptance model. Verbal comments and observable emotions of the SAR were predominantly positive, only a few participants reacted negatively to the SAR “James”. There was also hardly any shyness to touch the robot. The participants made eye contact and responded adequately to the robot’s requests. Tasks which were set by the SAR in group settings led to a higher communication between the participants than tasks in single-user settings. The mainly upbeat emotions and interaction with the SAR indicates a positive attitude towards the system. Long-term studies are needed to investigate the sustainability of robot acceptance."
Effect of Platinum Addition on Microstructure and Oxidation Behavior of Ni3Al-Base Alloys,"In order to study the effect of Pt on bond coat in thermal barrier coating, the corresponding Pt modified Ni3Al-base alloys were fabricated using arc melting. The microstructure and the oxidation behavior of the Ni–25Al–xPt (x = 0, 10, 20 and 30 at %) alloys at 1100°C were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The experimental results showed that the Ni–25Al–xPt alloys kept a single γ′-Ni3Al phase structure when Pt content up to 20 at %, while Ni–25Al–30Pt alloy consisted of two-phase structures of γ-Ni and γ′-Ni3Al, which may be caused by the phase deviation resulting from the volatilization loss of Al. Isothermal oxidation test indicated that the addition of Pt in Ni3Al-base alloys promoted Al2O3 scale formation, affected the oxidation surface morphology, reduced oxidation weight gain and the thickness of the oxide layer."
Influence of Friction Stir Welding Speed on Barkhausen Noise Emission from Steel,"In the present work, the influence of traverse speed on microstructure, induced residual stress, microhardness and on the micro-magnetic response of friction stir welded steel has been studied. Steel plates (IS2062 of grade B with 0.165% carbon) of 3 mm thickness were welded using the friction stir welding process at different welding speeds using a tungsten carbide tool. Rest process parameters like tool spindle speed, tool tilt angle and tool geometry were kept constant. Steel plates before and after friction stir welding were characterized using the Barkhausen Noise analysis technique for assessing its applicability for the characterization of welded samples. Metallographic inspection and microhardness testing of welded samples were also carried out to correlate the results obtained by Barkhausen Noise analysis with the microstructure and mechanical properties. Changes in peak amplitude and peak position of Barkhausen Noise signal profiles demonstrated generation of compressive residual stress of different magnitudes and grain refinement in the stir zone. Changes in band pass filter frequencies of Barkhausen Noise analysis enable to assess microhardness depth profile of welded samples. Different degree of grain refinement along the depth affects the amplitude of Barkhausen Noise signal profile."
Microstructure and Properties of Cu–Ti Alloys Prepared by Aluminothermic Reaction and Subsequent Rolling,"By studying the effect of preparation technology and plastic deformation on the microstructure and property evolution of Cu–Ti alloys with a larger composition range, its application scope can be further expanded. In present paper, Cu–Ti alloys with Ti content of 1.0, 4.5 and 10.0 wt % were prepared by aluminothermic reaction and their microstructures and properties were regulated by rolling deformation. The results show that Cu–1.0 wt % Ti alloy is in the solid solution state, Cu–4.5 wt % Ti alloy has a small number of punctate precipitates, and Cu–10.0 wt % Ti alloy has a large number of Cu4Ti precipitate distributed in a network at grain boundaries. For the as-cast Cu–Ti alloys, they consist of a large number of equiaxed micron crystals and a few nanocrystals. With the increase of Ti content, the relative density and grain size of the alloys decrease, the strength and hardness increase, but the elongation and electrical conductivity decrease. Compared with the as-cast alloys, the phase composition of the rolled alloy does not change, but the relative density increases, the grains are elongated along the deformation direction and some grains are crushed into nanocrystals. The precipitated phases are broken and the distribution in the matrix is more uniform and dispersed. For the rolled alloys with the same composition, with the increase of rolling deformation, the strength and hardness increase sharply, but the plasticity decreases significantly, and the electrical conductivity increases slightly at first and then decreases."
Rate-Dependent Compressive Behaviour of SiC−B4C−Al Hybrid Composites,"Effect of hybridization on the rate-dependent behaviour of Aluminum metal matrix composites (MMCs) comprising (0, 10, 20, and 30%) monolithic and hybrid SiC–B4C were prepared by powder metallurgy technique and tested under quasi-static and dynamic compression. Split Hopkinson pressure bar results revealed diverse strain rates attained by MMCs. 30% SiC reinforcement of Al matrix resulted in 16.9% higher stress and 13.5% higher toughness compared to 30% B4C reinforced MMC. Hybridizing 20% SiC–10% B4C with Al-matrix resulted in 18.9% higher stress and 29.7% higher toughness compared to 30% B4C reinforced MMC. Damage studies revealed how inverting hybrid particle reinforcement leads to improved mechanical performance."
"Effect of Minor Sb Additions on Thermal Properties, Microstructure and Microhardness of Sn–Ag–Cu High-Temperature Solder Alloys","In the present study, changes in thermal properties, microstructure and microhardness were investigated when 0.5, 1, 1.5 wt % Sb were added to Sn–1 wt % Ag–0.5 wt % Cu (SAC105) solder alloy system. The addition of Sb caused a significant improvement in microhardness while decreasing the melting temperature range, thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity. Addition of 0.5, 1, 1.5 wt % Sb to SAC105 alloy system decreased the thermal conductivity by 48% and electrical conductivity by 27%. The addition of Sb at the same rate increased the microhardness by 27%."
Effect of Nb Doping on Thermoelectric Properties of TiNiSn Half-Heusler Alloy Prepared by Microwave Method,"The inherent high thermal conductivity of TiNiSn half-Heusler (HH) alloy, as well as the long preparation cycle time and high cost of conventional preparation methods limited its commercial application. Herein, Ti1 – xNbxNiSn half-Heusler alloys with low lattice thermal conductivity were successfully prepared by microwave synthesis combined with rapid hot-pressing sintering, which significantly shortened the preparation cycle and ensured high density of TiNiSn half-Heusler alloys. The effects of Nb substitution at Ti sites on the composition distribution, thermal and electrical transport properties of Ti1 – xNbxNiSn half-Heusler samples were studied. The maximum ZT value of Ti0.9Nb0.1NiSn sample was 0.39 at 725 K due to the increase of power factor (PF) and the decrease of lattice thermal conductivity caused by the enhanced phonon scattering, which was about 204% higher than that of undoped TiNiSn."
Precipitation Behavior of Primary Carbide in H13 Bloom Die Steel,"To analyze the solidification and precipitation behaviors of primary carbides in H13 bloom die steel, the size, morphology, distribution, and type of carbides from the chilling edge to the center of bloom H13 steel are studied by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), an X-ray diffractometer and a Thermo-Calc thermodynamic software, and both formation time of carbides under equilibrium and non-equilibrium solidification are discussed. Results show that the primary carbides are distributed in the final solidification of steel, mainly including MC type V–Ti PC, V PC and M7C3 type Mo–Cr PC. From the edge to the center, the average area of primary carbide increases by 620.22 μm2, with an increase of 3.53%. From the edge to 1/4 position, V-rich and Mo–Cr-rich carbides mainly exist; at the 1/4 position, V-rich and Mo–Cr-rich carbides are interconnected; from 1/4 position to center, three kinds of interconnected V–Ti PC, V‑rich PC and Mo–Cr PC carbides exist. Oxides promote the precipitation of MC type while sulfides promote the precipitation of M7C3 type. Thermodynamics show that the primary carbide MC will not be formed in the equilibrium solidification, but will precipitate in non-equilibrium, with the precipitation temperature of 1108°C at the solidification fraction of 0.9987."
"Synthesis, Crystal Structure, and Thermal Behavior of the [Fe(bpy)3]2[Ba(NO3)6] Ionic Complex","Interaction of Fe(III) pivalate, barium(II) nitrate, and 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy) in acetonitrile leads to the formation of the ionic heteronuclear complex [Fe(bpy)3]2[Ba(NO3)6] (1). The structure of the complex is determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). According to the XRD data, each [Ba(NO3)6]4– anion in the packing of 1 is surrounded by twelve [Fe(bpy)3]2+ cations, and its additional stabilization due to non-covalent interactions leads to the formation of a strong supramolecular framework. Thermal behavior of 1 is studied by simultaneous thermal analysis (STA)."
Structure and Thermal Properties of Tris-(methylcyclopentadienyl)Scandium,"Crystal structure, thermal stability, and the process of scandium tris-methylcyclopentadienyl Sc(MeCp)3 evaporation are studied. It is shown by XRD that crystals of this compound with the C2/c space group and the following parameters at 150 K are formed from the gas phase and from the solution: a = 7.9568(4) Å, b = 13.7620(6) Å, c = 28.239(2) Å, β = 107.4860(10)°, V = 2949.3(3) Å3, Z = 8, Dcalc = 1.217 g/cm3. The violation of the crystal packing order is manifested as diffuse scattering accompanied by single-crystal Bragg diffraction. The obtained data suggest that the complex has the Sc(η5-MeCp)2(η1-MeCp) structure with Sc–Z distances equal to 2.26-2.37 Å, where Z is the center of the η5-MeCp species or the C atom (for η1-MeCp). The NMR data obtained for the Sc(MeCp)3 samples, which were kept for 7 days at 423 K, 453 K, and 483 K, indicate that the substance undergoes noticeable decomposition only at the highest temperature. Temperature dependences of the saturated vapor pressure of the complex are measured independently by the flow method (transpiration) (392-469 K) and by the static method (441-514 K). As  a result of joint processing of the tensimetry data, the following thermodynamic parameters of Sc(MeCp)3 evaporation are determined: ΔevH0(458.5) = 82.5±1.1 kJ/mol, ΔevS0(458.5) = 135±2 J/(mol·K)."

Spin-outs’ knowledge legacies and parent hostility: a competitive dynamics view,"This study adopts a competitive dynamics perspective to illuminate how and when different types of knowledge transferred by a spin-out trigger parent hostility. Specifically, I propose based on the awareness-motivation-capability framework that (1) transfers of market-related and technology-related knowledge will yield hostility and that (2) market commonality, resource similarity, and competitive intensity will exacerbate this effect. Findings from 207 spin-outs support several of my hypotheses. The study contributes to the extant literature by providing a more nuanced view on knowledge legacies, in particular regarding their interplay with a spin-out’s competitive positioning."
A transversal reconceptualization of entrepreneurship education: applying insights from the lean social launch framework to the entrepreneurial university,"Entrepreneurship education has long been framed as a crucial component of the entrepreneurial university and its corresponding economic impact. The predominantly commercial focus of academic entrepreneurship, however, potentially limits theorizing about how academic units not otherwise involved in entrepreneurship contribute to the entrepreneurial university. Following recent calls for scholars to conceptualize transversal approaches to entrepreneurship education, this paper examines the design and delivery of lean social launch (LSL), a socially oriented derivative of the emerging lean launch method. We find that by broadening the context in which opportunities are identified and value is created, LSL attracts individuals who might not otherwise participate in entrepreneurial activities. Further, LSL provides participants with pathways to social and commercial value creation and serves as a venue for socially focused entrepreneurial identity play, an important antecedent to entrepreneurial behavior. Implications for the conceptualization of the entrepreneurial university and its policy and programmatic supports are explored."
"Zn(II), Cd(II), and Pd(II) Complexes with a 1,10-Phenanthroline Derivative Bearing Diisopropylidene Glucose: Synthesis, Structure, Properties","Complexes [Cd4L4Cl8]·2H2O (I), ZnLCl2 (II), and PdLCl2·CH2Cl2 (III) (L = chiral derivative of 1,10-phenanthroline bearing diisopropylidene glucose) are synthesized. Single crystals of [Cd4L4Cl8] (IV) are prepared. According to the XRD data, the crystal structure of IV consists of molecules of the tetranuclear complex; the coordination number of two terminal and two central Cd2+ ions is 5 (Cl2N3) and 6 (Cl4N2), respectively. In the structure of IV, the L ligand is a bidentate cyclic ligand; Cl atoms exhibit both bridging and monodentate ligand functions. Complexes I–III are characterized by powder XRD and IR spectroscopy. According to the powder XRD data, I is isostructural to IV. Photophysical properties of solid samples of L, I, II are studied. Compound L exhibits excitation-wavelength dependent emission, the excited state lifetimes varying within nano- and microsecond regions. Complexes I and II exhibit ligand-centered photoluminescence. The luminescence quantum yields are as high as 15%. Cytotoxic properties of L, cadmium chloride, and I–III solutions are studied on the human laryngeal carcinoma cell line Hep2."
"Tin(IV) Complexes Based on Diimines and 3,5-Di-Tert-Alkyl Substituted Pyrocatechols","New tin(IV) complexes based on various pyrocatechols containing tert-butyl and tert-octyl substituents in the aromatic ring are synthesized and structurally characterized. Reduction of spatially hindered o-quinones with tin amalgam in tetrahydrofuran allows the preparation of compounds with the trans-position of catecholate ligands in the metal coordination sphere. In the further reaction of synthesized tin(IV) biscatecholates with N-donor ligands (pyridine (Py), α,α′-dipyridyl (dipy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), pyrazino-[2,3-f][1-10]-phenanthroline (DPQ), dipyrido-[3,2-a:2′3′-c]-phenazine (DPPZ)) the respective six-coordinated complexes are obtained. The introduction of bidentate ligands naturally results in the cis-position of dioxolene ligands in the tin coordination sphere. The possibility of intramolecular ligand–ligand charge transfer (LL′CT) between catecholate and diimine moieties in the synthesized octahedral metal derivatives is shown by electronic absorption spectroscopy. The effect of substituents in catecholate ligands and acceptor properties of diimines on the shift of a long-wave absorption band is determined. The electronic transition corresponding to LL′CT is revealed to undergo a bathochromic shift in the electronic absorption spectrum with a decrease in the polarity of the solvent used."
Bromination of Pyrazole and Pyrazolate Ligands in [Mo5S5(pz)4(pzH)5]Br2,"The ligand environment of the \([\{\text{Mo}_{5}\text{S}_{5}^{\text{i}}(\text{pz})_{4}^{\text{i}}\}(\text{pzH})_{5}^{\text{t}}]\text{Br}_{2}\) cluster complex is modified by a reaction of the cluster with Br2 in N,N-dimethylformamide at room temperature, which results in bromination of all pyrazole and pyrazolate ligands at the fourth position and in bromide ligand substitution for apical pyrazole. The solvent effect on ligand bromination is considered. The \([\{\text{Mo}_{5}\text{S}_{5}^{\text{i}}(4\text{-Br-pz})_{4}^{\text{i}}\}(4\text{-Br-pzH})_{4}^{\text{bs}}\text{B}{{\text{r}}^{\text{a}}}]\text{Br}\cdot \text{E}{{\text{t}}_{2}}\text{O}\cdot \text{5DMF}\) cluster complex crystallizes in the tetragonal symmetry (space group P4/n) and forms infinite layers via hydrogen bonds between the terminal 4-bromopyrazole ligands and the bromine anion. The complex also demonstrates reversible one-electron reductions of the cluster core shifted relative to the initial compound by 30 mV and 90 mV towards larger potentials."
"Molecular and Crystal Structures of Pyrrolo[3,2-b]lup-20(29)-ene-28-Carbonitrile","Molecular and crystal structures of pyrrolo[3,2-b]lup-20(29)-ene-28-carbonitrile are determined. At 100 K single crystals of the C32H46N2 compound are orthorhombic: a = 11.5659(17) Å, b = 14.173(2) Å, c = 16.038(2) Å, V = 2629.1(7) Å3, dcalc = 1.159 g/cm3, Z = 4, space group P212121, dcryst = 1.339 g/cm3."
"High-Efficiency Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence of a Copper(I) Complex Based on Octachloro-1,10-Phenanthroline","A [Cu(phen-Cl8)(Xantphos)]PF6·2CH2Cl2 (1·2CH2Cl2) complex based on octachloro-1,10-phenanthroline (phen-Cl8) and 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene (Xantphos) is prepared and studied. At 298 K, the crystalline form of the complex exhibits intense thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in the orange-red region with a quantum yield of 67% and a decay time of 2 µs. Upon cooling down to 77 K, the emission maximum exhibits a bathochromic shift from 622 nm to 650 nm, and the decay time increases up to 550 µs. Photoluminescence of the synthesized complex is additionally studied in the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix and in a CH2Cl2 solution; the complex is shown to be X-ray luminescent. The spectral data and quantum chemical calculations show that the observed TADF is due to the charge transfer from the metal and phosphine ligand to the diimine group."
Nano-Sized Copper Films Prepared by Magnetron Sputtering,"Copper films with a thickness varying from 6 nm to 100 nm are prepared by magnetron sputtering. The films are characterized by homogeneous and fine-grained microstructure. The X-ray diffraction data confirm formation of a copper fcc phase orientated predominantly in the (111) direction. Depending on the growth conditions, the size of Cu grains in the films varies from 7 nm to 20 nm. The refractive index of the films increases from 0.52 to 1.22 with decreasing copper film thickness. The transmittance of the films decreases as their thickness increases from 6 nm to 62 nm, and the transparency of the films with the same thickness decreases with increasing sputtering power and decreasing argon flow rate. The surface resistivity of the films decreases from 8.89±0.06 Ω/sq to 1.47±0.01 Ω/sq as their thickness increases from 20 nm to 70 nm."
Determination of the Stress-Strain State of the Rock Mass Surrounded with Points Lying on a Surface or Inside an Area,"During the operation of certain structures, two questions arise: about the stress-strain state (SSS) at a point and in its neighborhood on the surface of the object under study and in its bulk, and about the remaining material strength in the considered area. The values of stresses and strains not at a point, but in a neighborhood, make it possible to use the results of the proposed research to test existing numerical and analytical calculation schemes, to find the direction of growth or decrease of the quantities under consideration, and to predict catastrophic events. It is proposed to assess the state of the material using classical formulations and methods of solid mechanics, which guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the solution and continuous dependence on the input data. To determine the SSS of the material in the neighborhood of the point, we start with the full unload of the latter in order to determine the unloading displacements at the boundary. The SSS within the area, including stresses at the boundary, is found from the known boundary displacements. When studying the SSS inside the body, it is proposed to install elongated reference elements with their ends reaching the surface. To measure unloading displacements, the existing optical, mechanical, and tensometric systems are used. The uniqueness of the proposed approach is in considering not only radial displacements, but also tangential ones. The aim of the work is experimental and analytical determination of the SSS at any point of the structure and at any time of its non-stop operation."
Wideband TEM-TM01 Mode Transducer,"An approach to widening the band of a TEM-TM01 mode transducer and the results of numerical simulations of two transducers, whose designs involve the concepts of this approach, are presented. One operates in the Ka-band and the other covers the S-band and partially the C-band. The efficiency level to define the operating band is assigned as 0.95. It is shown that the operating band could be extended up to 100% by properly choosing the coaxial line impedance and the inner conductor shape of the coaxial line at its end."
Heat Resistance of Vacuum Arc Deposited TiAl Coatings on VTI-4 Alloy,"The paper studies intermetallic coatings based on the Ti–Al system obtained by plasma-assisted vacuum-arc deposition. The coatings are deposited by three different techniques to gain the different elemental and phase compositions. The study of the oxidation kinetics shows that the coating with the gradient aluminum distribution possesses the best oxidation resistance. It is found that after 500 hours of oxidation, its structure and weight remain unchanged."
Dislocation Nucleation Centers of Surface Martensite Formation with Habit Planes in the Vicinity of {12 14 17},"The first stage of the surface martensite formation with a habit plane close to {12 14 17} is interpreted in terms of the dynamic theory of martensitic transformations. Based on the analysis of the elastic field calculations, the dislocation centers of crystal nucleation are identified. The principal role is attributed to the dislocation loop segments oriented along the <12 1> directions."
Some Inequalities for the Fourier Transform and Their Limiting Behaviour,"We identify a one-parameter family of inequalities for the Fourier transform whose limiting case is the restriction conjecture for the sphere. Using Stein’s method of complex interpolation, we prove the conjectured inequalities when the target space is \(L^2\), and show that this recovers in the limit the celebrated Tomas-Stein theorem."
Spherical cationic polymer networks with porphyrin photosensitizer for sustainable and efficient photocatalysis,"The continuous and sustainable photo-activity on micro- or nano-carriers has always been a key stepping stone in the industrialization of photo-catalysis, photo-synthesis, and photo-degradation. Herein, we report a new series of positively charged hollow microspheres carrying porphyrin moieties. Such hollow spheres are formed through crosslinking of well-ordered porous thin laminates, initiated by co-assembly of regular monomers and those decorated with porphyrin moieties. On the surface of an individual sphere, densely distributed positive sites attract anionic reactants. The superficial porphyrin decomposes the accumulated reactants under 1 Sun. After degradation and release of products, the photoactive sites are thereby renewed. We demonstrate that polymer network (1:10) exhibited superior sustainable photocatalytic performance with complete degradation of methyl orange (MO) in 40 min with no observable performance deterioration after six cycles. The established close loop of adsorption–reaction–release cycle makes possible many efficient and continuous photo-catalytic processes."
Fabrication of MXene-Bi2WO6 heterojunction by Bi2Ti2O7 hinge for extraordinary LED-light-driven photocatalytic performance,"Heterojunction composites with intimate interfaces can shorten the diffusion distance, which leads to a shorter path for photogenerated carriers, thereby increasing photocatalytic activity. Herein, we report the fabrication of Ti3C2-Bi2WO6 (TC-BW) heterojunctions hinged by Bi2Ti2O7 joints via an in situ hydrothermal reaction of Ti3C2 in the presence of Na2WO4 and Bi(NO3)3. The TC-BW was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and Raman spectroscopy. TC-BW showed superior photocatalytic activity (productivity over 15TC-WB reaches up to 5.0 mmolreacted BA·gcat.−1·h−1) in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol using light-emitting diode (LED) light, arising from the surface defects and intimate heterojunction interface between the Ti3C2 MXene and Bi2WO6 nanosheets. TC-BW heterojunctions provide an enhanced separation efficiency of photogenerated charges, which in turn yields superior photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, it is well substantiated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In summary, this study elucidates the preparation of heterojunction composites with intimate interfaces for highly efficient photooxidation."
"Identification of Locations in Mecca using Image Pre-Processing, Neural Networks and Deep Learning","Every year, more than two million Muslim pilgrims from all over the world visit Mecca to perform Hajj worship. The challenge of location identification in dense crowds is significant, leading to dangerous consequences such as injury or loss. Existing works for person localization remain challenged, especially in crowded places like Mecca during Hajj. In this work, we propose a novel location identification method using image pre-processing and different machine learning classifiers, with the creation of a new image dataset for hotspot locations in Mecca. Image pre-processing algorithms are applied to enhance the geographic information present in the images, and the obtained features are classified using CNN, ANN, and SVM classifiers. Extensive evaluations reveal that the proposed pre-processing algorithm with CNN achieves the best localization performance with an accuracy of 90%, followed by ANN with an accuracy of 84%, and SVM with an accuracy of 80.50%. Without pre-processing, the accuracies are significantly lower: 63% for CNN, 73% for ANN, and 71.50% for SVM. In addition, the proposed approach was compared with other deep learning models, VGG16, AlexNet and ResNet50 on our dataset achieving an accuracy of 61%, 65% and 62%, respectively. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in comparison with other deep transfer learning methods on a small dataset, offering promising solutions for crowded place navigation."
Two-Phase Numerical Simulation for the Heat and Mass Transfer Evaluation Across a Vertical Deformable Sheet with Significant Impact of Solar Radiation and Heat Source/Sink,"The growing need for industrial development, limited availability of non-renewable energy resources, minimizing energy consumption, and ecosystem concerns has prompted researchers to explore the practical applications of two-phase nanofluid materials processing and electromagnetic energy emitted via the sun. Therefore, using two-phase nanofluids in solar thermal technology systems can enhance system performance by improving heat absorption and transfer efficiency. Owing to its usage, this study examines the magnetized two-phase nanofluid flow on a two-dimensional laminar mixed convective boundary layer with the impact of multiple slips. The flow contains an electrically conducting non-Newtonian nanofluid over a deformable (stretching/shrinking) sheet with a solar radiation effect. Also, the study utilizes a nonlinear Roseland diffusion flux approximation to incorporate the solar radiation effect, which is valid for nanofluid media with high optical density. This work utilizes similarity variables to simplify the partial derivative model into ordinary differential equations. These equations are then solved using the wavelets and Chebyshev wavelets scheme with the help of MATHEMATICA 11.3 software. According to the findings, the nanoparticle volume fraction is increased for high electrical conductivity (M = 2) and decreased for the electrically non-conducting case (M = 0)."
Wetting deformation characteristics of soil–rock mixture considering the water-disintegration of red stratum soft rock,"The red stratum soft rock, contained extensively in the deep soil–rock mixture (SRM) backfill area of southwest China, exhibits significant water-disintegrating properties that greatly impact the foundation's bearing capacity and deformation failure in this region. This study introduced the large-scale triaxial test to investigate the mechanical deformation characteristics of clay-red stratum soft rock mixture before and after wetting. Simultaneous, combined with the results of test, the law of water disintegration of red stratum soft rock was revealed, and its effects were analyzed in detail. The results show that: (1) Wetting intensified the crushing of rock blocks, resulting in the reduction of shear strength and critical strain of the samples, the decrease of critical internal friction angle and secant modulus, and the significant increase of the relative crushing rate of rock blocks; (2) The most significant increase and decrease of the content before and after the test occur in the particles with the particle size of 0.5–2 mm and 20–40 mm, respectively; (3) Wetting-induced breakage of the red stratum soft rock mainly occurs during the first two hours after encountering water; (4) An increase in confining pressure exacerbates the influence of wetting. Additionally, based on the theory of non-linear elasticity, with the assuming that the reduction of secant modulus causes the wetting deformation, a theoretical calculation model of the wetting axial strain was proposed. Through comparing the calculated results with the measured values obtained by using the “double-line method” and “single-line method” test, it is found that the calculation method can accurately predict the wetting axial strain of SRM and be used for quantitative analysis of wetting deformation."
Anomalous diffusion limit for a kinetic equation with a thermostatted interface,"We consider the limit of solutions of scaled linear kinetic equations with a reflection-transmission-killing condition at the interface. Both the coefficient describing the probability of killing and the scattering kernel degenerate. We prove that the long-time, large-space limit is the unique solution of a version of the fractional in space heat equation that corresponds to the Kolmogorov equation for a symmetric stable process, which is reflected, or transmitted while crossing the interface and is killed upon the first hitting of the interface. The results of the paper are related to the work in Komorowski et al. (Ann Prob 48:2290–2322, 2020), where the case of a non-degenerate probability of killing has been considered."
The impact of fast-growing eucalypt plantations on C emissions in tropical soil: effect of belowground and aboveground C inputs,"Planted forest soils can have great potential for CO2-C sequestration, mainly due to belowground C inputs, which impact deep soil C (DSC) accumulation. However, there are still gaps in understanding the CO2 emission dynamics in eucalypt plantations. Therefore, we used isotopic techniques to investigate the dynamics of the soil surface CO2-C flux and CO2-C concentration with depth for a eucalypt plantation influenced by different C inputs (above- and belowground). The gas evaluations were carried in depth the root to valuation of root priming effect (RPE) was calculated. In addition, measurements of the plant (C-fine root and C-litterfall) and soil (total organic carbon – TOC, total nitrogen – TN, soil moisture – SM, and soil temperature – ST) were performed. After planting the eucalypt trees, there was an increase in the soil surface CO2-C flux with plant growth. Root growth contributed greatly to the soil surface CO2-C flux, promoting greater surface RPE over time. In comparison to the other factors, SM had a greater influence on litterfall decomposition and root respiration. It was not possible to detect losses in TOC and TN in the different soil layers for the 31-month-old eucalypt. However, the 40-month-old eucalypt showed a positive RPE with depth, indicating possible replacement of DSC (“old C”) by rhizodeposition-C (“new C”) in the soil. Thus, in eucalyptus plantations, aboveground plant growth influences CO2 emissions on the soil surface, while root growth and activity influence C in deeper soil layers. This information indicates the need for future changes in forest management, with a view to reducing CO2 emissions."
From Chosen to Forced: A Qualitative Exploration of Nurses’ Experiences With Overtime,"Overtime is a hot issue in the nursing profession. Despite much debate around this topic in North America, few research has questioned how overtime is perceived by nurses. Using a qualitative research design, this paper offers an in-depth analysis of nurses’ perceptions of overtime in the province of Quebec, Canada. We drew on data from 42 semi-directive interviews, led by one of the authors with nurses in various healthcare establishments between March 2020 and February 2021. It emerged from our content analysis that (1) nurses’ experiences of overtime are dependent on both contextual (ie. workplace, department, position, general context) and individual (ie. negotiation, time management skills) factors; (2) despite important differences in how much and how often they were required to do so, most participants reported having been in the obligation to do overtime either from their own sense of professional duty or by submission to persuasive tactics by the employer; and (3) there were reports of negative outcomes resulting from being forced to work overtime, for nurses and healthcare institutions alike. These findings contribute to the literature by mapping out the ways in which nurses may experience overtime and identifying the most vulnerable cases. Practical implications are discussed in an effort to think of solutions for nurse well-being and retention in the profession."
Data-driven development of an oral lipid-based nanoparticle formulation of a hydrophobic drug,"Due to its cost-effectiveness, convenience, and high patient adherence, oral drug administration normally remains the preferred approach. Yet, the effective delivery of hydrophobic drugs via the oral route is often hindered by their limited water solubility and first-pass metabolism. To mitigate these challenges, advanced delivery systems such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) have been developed to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs and enhance their bioavailability. However, traditional design methodologies for these complex formulations often present intricate challenges because they are restricted to a relatively narrow design space. Here, we present a data-driven approach for the accelerated design of SLNs/NLCs encapsulating a model hydrophobic drug, cannabidiol, that combines experimental automation and machine learning. A small subset of formulations, comprising 10% of all formulations in the design space, was prepared in-house, leveraging miniaturized experimental automation to improve throughput and decrease the quantity of drug and materials required. Machine learning models were then trained on the data generated from these formulations and used to predict properties of all SLNs/NLCs within this design space (i.e., 1215 formulations). Notably, formulations predicted to be high-performers via this approach were confirmed to significantly enhance the solubility of the drug by up to 3000-fold and prevented degradation of drug. Moreover, the high-performance formulations significantly enhanced the oral bioavailability of the drug compared to both its free form and an over-the-counter version. Furthermore, this bioavailability matched that of a formulation equivalent in composition to the FDA-approved product, Epidiolex®."
"Magnetic targeting of lornoxicam/SPION bilosomes loaded in a thermosensitive in situ hydrogel system for the management of osteoarthritis: Optimization, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies in rat model via modulation of RANKL/OPG","Osteoarthritis is a bone and joint condition characterized pathologically by articular cartilage degenerative damage and can develop into a devastating and permanently disabling disorder. This investigation aimed to formulate the anti-inflammatory drug lornoxicam (LOR) into bile salt–enriched vesicles loaded in an in situ forming hydrogel as a potential local treatment of osteoarthritis. This was achieved by formulating LOR-loaded bilosomes that are also loaded with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) for intra-muscular (IM) administration to improve joint targeting and localization by applying an external magnet to the joint. A 31.22 full factorial design was employed to develop the bilosomal dispersions and the optimized formula including SPION (LSB) was loaded into a thermosensitive hydrogel. Moreover, in vivo evaluation revealed that the IM administration of LSB combined with the application of an external magnet to the joint reversed carrageen-induced suppression in motor activity and osteoprotegerin by significantly reducing the elevations in mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa beta/osteoprotegerin expressions. In addition, the histopathological evaluation of knee joint tissues showed a remarkable improvement in the injured joint tissues. The results proved that the developed LSB could be a promising IM drug delivery system for osteoarthritis management."
"Influence of sea-land breeze on the formation and dissipation of severe dense fog and its burst reinforcement in the Yellow Sea coastal area, China","Based on the global reanalysis data of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research, the surface meteorological observation data, sounding data and satellite observation data, this paper comprehensively analyzes the evolution process and formation mechanism of a persistent severe dense fog process occurred on February 15–17, 2015 in Yancheng, eastern China. Through the numerical simulation experiment of Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model, we further analyze the impact of sea-land breeze on the formation and burst reinforcement of fog. Results show that the precipitation caused by the southwesterly airflow in front of the upper-level trough and the low-pressure inverted trough are conducive to the formation of early rain fog, while the nighttime clear radiance under the control of surface cold high and the infiltration of weak cold advection are conducive to the formation and development of later radiation-advection fog. The WRF model simulates the fog evolution process, which is basically consistent with the actual fog area, and the simulation results are credible to a certain extent. The simulation results show that the establishment of sea breeze has an advection cooling effect on the near surface layer, which is conducive to the formation and development of the inversion layer on the near surface, providing stable stratification conditions for the formation and burst reinforcement of fog. On one hand, the strengthening of sea breeze circulation can continuously transport water vapor to the study area. On the other, the occurrence of ultra-low level jet is favorable for the accumulation of low-level water vapor. At the same time, the inversion intensity further strengthens, which is in favor of the burst reinforcement and long-term maintenance of fog."
Long-term outcomes and early recurrence after resection for metachronous pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer,Properly selecting patients for aggressive curative resection for pulmonary metastases (PMs) from colorectal cancer (CRC) is desirable. We purposed to clarify prognostic factors and risk factors for early recurrence after metachronous PM resection.
Understanding the effect of differences in prior knowledge on middle school students’ collaborative interactions and learning,"We investigated how the level of variance in students’ prior knowledge may have influenced their collaborative interactions and science learning in small groups. We examined learning outcomes from 102 groups from seven science teachers’ classes and discourse from two contrasting groups: Homogeneous versus heterogeneous. We examined individual and group outcomes using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to explore the effect of membership in a homogeneous or heterogeneous group on students’ learning. We then used social network analyses (SNA) to identify any differences in interaction patterns between the two contrasting groups as they conducted multiple compost simulations. Finally, we examined students’ discussions in these groups to better understand their interactions. In our HLM analysis, we found that students in homogeneous groups made significantly greater learning gains than students in heterogeneous groups. The SNA and thematic analysis of the discussions in our contrasting groups helped us identify that the interactions in the homogeneous group were more distributed, while the interactions in the heterogeneous group were more centralized around the member with the greatest prior knowledge, and that these patterns were stable over time. We also found that the students in the homogenous group engaged in richer discussions that were more supportive and built upon one another’s ideas, which may have influenced their group and individual learning outcomes. While our findings indicate that students in homogeneous groups learn more and collaborate better, we discuss how some heterogeneity may be helpful, and group formation should focus on avoiding extreme cases of heterogeneity and provide students with scaffolding for collaboration."
Computational and experimental assessment of efficient dye adsorption method from aqueous effluents by halloysite and palygorskite clay minerals,"The removal of dyes from effluents of textile industries represents a technological challenge, due to their significant environmental impact. The application of halloysite (Hal) and palygorskite (Pal) clay minerals as adsorbents for the removal of Congo red (CR) and methylene blue (MB) was evaluated in this work. The materials were applied both in natural and acid-treated forms, and characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM–EDS, FTIR, and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm techniques to identify their properties and main active sites. The adsorbents showed potential to remove CR (> 98%) and MB (> 85%) within 180 min, using 0.3 g adsorbent and initial dye concentration of 250 mg L−1. Semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations (SQM) confirmed the interaction mechanism between dyes and the adsorbents via chemisorption (− 69.0 kcal mol−1 < Eads <  − 28.8 kcal mol−1), which was further observed experimentally due to the high fit of adsorption data to pseudo-second order kinetic model (R2 > 0.99) and Langmuir isotherm (R2 > 0.98). The use of Pal and Hal to remove dyes was proven to be economically and environmentally viable for industrial application."
Assessment of herbaceous community structure for identifying metal-tolerant species at different land uses in and around Varanasi city,"Plant community structure under different land uses provides an important understanding of vegetation dynamics to safeguard future restoration programmes and balance ecosystem services. Therefore, this study was carried out to estimate the alterations in soil properties and contamination by potentially toxic metals at different land uses (industrial, brick kiln, highway, and residential areas) compared to the reference (botanical garden area) site coupled with their subsequent influence on herbaceous community structure, bioconcentration, translocation, and extraction amount of metals in different plant species. Most of the total and phytoavailable metals (Co, Cr, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Mn, and Zn) were higher at the contaminated sites compared to the reference site. The number of herbaceous species was highest at the reference site and minimum at the industrial site. Dominant and tolerant species were Cyanodon dactylon, Croton bonaplandianus, Achyranthus aspera, Malvestrum coromendelianum, Dicanthium annulatum, Nicotiana hindostana, Sporobolus virginicus, and Parthenium hysterophorus, found at the industrial, brick kiln, and highway sites. Based on transfer coefficients, C. bonaplandianus, D. annulatum, and Eleusine indica were recognized as potential accumulators, whereas C. dactylon, Commelina benghalensis, A. aspera, Amaranthus sessilis, and M. coromendelianum were found as excluder species for different metals. The identified tolerant herbaceous species could be used for future phytoremediation strategies and the prevention of hazardous risks to living components of contaminated sites."
Performance evaluation of gravity-driven bioreactor (GDB) for simultaneous treatment of black liquor and domestic wastewater,"A lab-scale gravity-driven bioreactor (GDB) was designed and constructed to evaluate the simultaneous treatment of black liquor and domestic wastewater. The GDB was operated with a mixture of black liquor and domestic wastewater at a ratio of 1:1 and maintained at an average organic loading rate of 1235 mg-COD/L-Day. The wastewater was fed to the primary sedimentation tank at a flow rate of approximately 12 mL/min and subsequently passed through serially connected anaerobic and aerobic chambers with the same flow rate. Each wastewater sample was allowed to undergo a hydraulic retention time of approximately 72 h, ensuring effective treatment. The GDB was actively operated for nine samples (W1–W9) at a weekly frequency. The entire process was conducted within the workstation’s ambient temperature range of 30–35 °C to sustain microbial activity and treatment efficiency in an open environment. The performance of the GDB was evaluated in terms of various pollution indicators, including COD, BOD5, lignin removal, TDS, TSS, EC, PO43−, SO42−, microbial load (CFU/mL and MPN index), total nitrogen, and color reduction. The results showed that the GDB achieved promising treatment efficiencies: 84.5% for COD, 71.80% for BOD5, 82.8% for TDS, 100% for TSS, 74.71% for E.C., 67.25% for PO43−, 81% for SO42−, and 69.36% for TN. Additionally, about 80% reduction in lignin content and 57% color reduction were observed after the treatment. The GDB substantially reduced microbial load in CFU/mL (77.98%) and MPN (90%). This study marks the first to report on wastewater treatment from two different sources (black liquor and domestic wastewater) using a simple GDB design. Furthermore, it highlights the GDB’s potential as a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and efficient solution for wastewater treatment, with no need for supplementary chemical or physical agents and zero operational costs."
Does industrial co-agglomeration promote green energy efficiency? Evidence from spatial panel data of 284 cities in China,"Industrial co-agglomeration (IC) plays a pivotal role in the development of local and adjacent green energy efficiency across 284 Chinese cities, encompassing both resource-based and non-resource-based urban centers. Based on the panel data of 284 cities in China from 2005 to 2020, this study employs spatial econometric methods to empirically assess the influence of IC and its spillover effects on green energy efficiency, employing a spatial Durbin model. Additionally, the study categorizes the 284 Chinese cities into resource-based and non-resource-based categories, utilizing spatial econometric methods to delve into the heterogeneity of their effects and spillover impacts. The key findings are as follows: (1) The average green energy efficiency across the 284 Chinese cities from 2005 to 2020 stands at 0.5834. The trend in IC indicates growth and concentration towards the central areas, increasing from 2.7396 in 2005 to 2.7658 in 2020. (2) The IC, with a coefficient of 0.0918, promotes the local green energy efficiency. (3) There are spillover effects of local IC on the green energy efficiency in adjacent areas with a coefficient of 0.2550 and an Indirect Effect of 0.4567. (4) In resource-based cities, IC positively impacts local green energy efficiency with a coefficient of 0.1056 but negatively affects green energy efficiency in adjacent areas with a coefficient of −0.1368. In non-resource-based cities, IC enhances green energy efficiency in adjacent cities with a coefficient of 0.1335. Consequently, the study offers pertinent policy recommendations aimed at improving energy efficiency in light of these findings."
A system dynamics model and analytical hierarchy process: an integrated approach for achieving sustainable solid waste management system,"Waste management in low-income countries faces challenges with an average cost of $35/ton approximately 51% collection efficiency. Despite investments in treatment, processing, and recycling, the system remains unsustainable owing to poor planning and policies. The current analysis of Lahore’s solid waste management (SWM) system, selected as a major city of a low-income country as a case study, focuses on collection efficiency and waste generation. However, it neglects the complex and dynamic nature of SWM systems. To capture the complexities and dynamic nature of the SWM system, system dynamic (SD) modeling is proposed for its effectiveness in modeling complex and dynamic systems. Unlike previous attempts at SD modeling that mostly consider only some components of the SWM system with varying success, this study attempts to use a holistic approach by considering all aspects of an integrated SWM system. In addition, this study explores different financial and management policies, highlighting the weaknesses of the system through a quantitative comparison of three scenarios: (1) business-as-usual (BAU) which considers the current trends in waste generation and practices of collection and disposal to landfill, (2) waste treatment system (WTS) in which various waste treatment systems are included to reduce burden on landfill, and (3) introduction of user fee with awareness campaigns (UFAC) which encourages community participation towards reduction in waste generation and financially supports the SWM. All three scenarios use four indices: waste generation, waste ending up in landfill, uncollected waste, and annual budget deficit as performance indices. These scenarios were simulated over a 25-year period using an SD model, covering all six components of the SWM system. The BAU scenario shows a 16% increase in waste generation, a 173% increase in landfill waste, an 11% reduction in uncollected waste, and a 64% increase in the budget deficit over the simulation period, indicating an unsustainable SWM system. The WTS scenario exhibits a 16% increase in waste generation, a 155% increase in landfill waste, an 11% reduction in uncollected waste, and a 61% increase in the budget deficit, showing a significant reduction in landfill waste and a slight reduction in deficit but it remains unsustainable. The UFAC scenario, however, results in a 40% reduction in waste generation, a 67% decrease in uncollected waste, an 8% decrease in landfill waste, and a 59% decrease in the budget deficit. These results demonstrate that instituting user fees for SWM services and incentivizing community participation towards waste reduction and segregation can make the SWM system of Lahore sustainable. This SD model provides insights for policymakers, aiding what-if analyses and long/short-term waste management plans for metropolitan cities in low-income countries. To validate the sustainability judgments based on performance indices, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool commonly used for ranking policy decisions based on competing criteria, was employed. It considered the same four criteria as in the SD model. The results of the AHP analysis aligned with those of the SD model, ranking the UFAC scenario as the most sustainable option."
Reducing nitrogen leaching using wood vinegar treated in urea-fertilized soil,"Wood vinegar (WV) is known to retard the release of ammonium (NH4+) from urea by inhibiting urea hydrolysis. However, the effect of WV on nitrogen leaching in soil is not known, and there are few studies on the effect of WV on microbial activity although WV exhibits antibacterial properties against pathogens in agriculture. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of WV on controlling nitrogen leaching and soil microbial activity. Soils were treated with urea and WV, and the available inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the soil were compared with those from soils treated with N-(n-butyl)thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT), a commonly used urease inhibitor. The nitrate concentration in the soil was significantly decreased in the WV treatment, although the ammonium concentration was not affected by the WV treatment. Basal soil respiration was significantly increased in the WV and NBPT treatments although the microbial biomass was increased in the urea only treatment. The ammonium nitrogen concentration in the leachate was not significantly different in the WV and urea-treated soil compared to the urea-only treatment. However, the nitrate leaching increased in the soil treated only with urea at 16 days after the treatment although there was no statistically significant difference in the total leached nitrate. Therefore, WV can be used to reduce nitrogen leaching and enhance soil microbial activity."
How ESG reporting is effected by sustainable finance and green innovation: moderating role of sales growth,"In light of the conflicting findings within the existing empirical literature regarding the factors influencing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures in the context of sustainable investment and firms’ green innovation performance (GIP), our current study stands out as a distinctive research endeavor that examines how the relationship is influenced by the moderating effects of sales growth. Non-financial trade manufacturing companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges between 2015 and 2020 were selected for this study. For data estimation, panel regression estimations using OLS and fixed effects models have been used. The results demonstrate a significant moderation of manufacturing industry’s sales growth in China on the relationship between ESG disclosures and sustainable finance (operationalized by green credit, and green investment), and green innovation (operationalized by R&D intensity and green patents). Several practical takeaways are offered to boost green innovation performance among ESG reporting enterprises and increase the effectiveness of R&D intensity. These findings, including policy recommendations, will benefit all stakeholders."
"Effect of alkali pretreatment time on kitchen waste anaerobic digestion performance enhanced by alkali pretreatment combined with bentonite: performance enhancement, microbial community structure, and functional gene analysis","Kitchen waste was mainly composed of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Anaerobic digestion (AD) of kitchen waste usually occurred acidification and further deteriorated. In our previous study, alkali pretreatment combined with bentonite (AP/Be) treatment was proved to enhance high solid AD of kitchen waste. However, effects of AP time on AP/Be were not yet studied. This study investigated the effects of AP time on AP/Be treatment on enhancing high solid AD. The results showed that compared with the control group, the cumulative methane production rate could be increased by 3.30 times (149.7 mL CH4/g VS) and the volatile solids (VS) reduction rate increased by 63.36%. Microbial community analysis showed that the relative abundance of Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta were increased from 6.49 and 7.83% to 47.14 and 16.39% respectively. Predictive functional analysis showed that AP/Be treatment increased the abundance of energy production and conversion, coenzyme transport, and metabolism. This study revealed the potential mechanism of AP/Be enhanced kitchen waste AD performance and AP/Be was a potential strategy to strengthen AD."
"Spatio-temporal evolutionary analysis of surface ecological quality in Pingshuo open-cast mine area, China","The open-pit mining area is highly affected by human activities, which aggravate soil erosion and disturb surface ecology, bringing many problems and challenges to its environmental management and restoration, which has received widespread attention. The establishment of an objective, timely and quantitative remote sensing monitoring, and evaluation system for the spatio-temporal evolution of the surface ecological environment in the open-pit mining area is of great significance for its environmental protection, management decisions, and sustainable social development. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, this paper uses Landsat images to construct and calculate the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) of the Pingshuo open-cast mine area (POMA) from 1990 to 2020 and monitor and evaluate its surface ecological environment. Combined with the Theil-Sen median, Mann–Kendall test, and Hurst index, the spatio-temporal process was analyzed. The results showed that the ecological environmental quality of the mining area first decreased and then increased from 1990 to 2020. 1990–2000 was a period of serious ecological degradation, followed by improvement. The overall improvement area reached 87.03%, and the degradation was concentrated in the coal mining area. Between 1990 and 2020, the Hurst index of the mining area was 0.452, indicating that the region has a fragile ecological environment and has difficult maintaining its stability. The global Moran’s I mean value of the RSEI of the study area is 0.92, which combined with Moran’s scatter plot to indicate that there is a strong positive spatial correlation rather than a random distribution of its ecological environment. During the study period, the impact on the climate of the ecological environmental change of POMA was weak, and human factors such as coal mining, land reclamation, and social construction were the main driving forces for the change in ecological quality. The results of this study reveal the changing trend of surface ecology in the mining area over the past 30 years, which is helpful for understanding its impact mechanism on ecological quality and provides support for the management of the region."
Endoscopic and trans-anal local excision vs. radical resection in the treatment of early rectal cancer: A systematic review and network meta-analysis,The management of early-stage rectal cancer in clinical practice is controversial. The aim of this network meta-analysis was to compare oncological and postoperative outcomes for T1T2N0M0 rectal cancers managed with local excision in comparison to conventional radical resection.

Development and evaluation of a vacuum impregnation system for enhancement of biochemical properties of food materials,"Vacuum impregnation is a novel methodology for adding various substances to porous foods. This study aimed to develop a cost effective automate system for vacuum impregnation of food materials to enhance their nutritional, functional and sensory properties depending on the functionality of the impregnation solution. The developed vacuum impregnation system includes a vacuum chamber, vacuum pump and an automation setup for creating and maintaining vacuum conditions, feeding impregnated solutions to the samples and releasing vacuum. Fresh-cut spinach leaves were impregnated with ascorbic acid (AsA) and calcium chloride (Cacl2) (10% concentration) in the setup in order to test the effect of the process on some biochemical properties. Statistical analysis revealed significant effect of vacuum impregnation on the biochemical properties (total soluble solids, total phenolic content, flavonoid content and free radical scavenging activity) and color of spinach leaves during storage up to 4 days. Impregnation process showed significant increase in the total phenolic and flavonoid content of the spinach leaves. Increment up to 78% in antioxidant activity was seen for the uncoated impregnated leaves as compared to 59% activity in untreated samples. Thus, products with desired parameters can be produced with this process with minimal impact on their properties at a lower cost and in a shorter time period."
Pre-prandial plasma liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2) concentration in humans is inversely associated with hunger sensation in a ghrelin independent manner,"The liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2) is a newly recognized peptide hormone that acts via the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) blunting the effects of ghrelin and displaying ghrelin-independent actions. Since the implications of LEAP2 are beginning to be elucidated, we investigated if plasma LEAP2 concentration varies with feeding status or sex and whether it is associated with glucose metabolism and appetite sensations."

The impact of fast-growing eucalypt plantations on C emissions in tropical soil: effect of belowground and aboveground C inputs,"Planted forest soils can have great potential for CO2-C sequestration, mainly due to belowground C inputs, which impact deep soil C (DSC) accumulation. However, there are still gaps in understanding the CO2 emission dynamics in eucalypt plantations. Therefore, we used isotopic techniques to investigate the dynamics of the soil surface CO2-C flux and CO2-C concentration with depth for a eucalypt plantation influenced by different C inputs (above- and belowground). The gas evaluations were carried in depth the root to valuation of root priming effect (RPE) was calculated. In addition, measurements of the plant (C-fine root and C-litterfall) and soil (total organic carbon – TOC, total nitrogen – TN, soil moisture – SM, and soil temperature – ST) were performed. After planting the eucalypt trees, there was an increase in the soil surface CO2-C flux with plant growth. Root growth contributed greatly to the soil surface CO2-C flux, promoting greater surface RPE over time. In comparison to the other factors, SM had a greater influence on litterfall decomposition and root respiration. It was not possible to detect losses in TOC and TN in the different soil layers for the 31-month-old eucalypt. However, the 40-month-old eucalypt showed a positive RPE with depth, indicating possible replacement of DSC (“old C”) by rhizodeposition-C (“new C”) in the soil. Thus, in eucalyptus plantations, aboveground plant growth influences CO2 emissions on the soil surface, while root growth and activity influence C in deeper soil layers. This information indicates the need for future changes in forest management, with a view to reducing CO2 emissions."
Long-term outcomes and early recurrence after resection for metachronous pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer,Properly selecting patients for aggressive curative resection for pulmonary metastases (PMs) from colorectal cancer (CRC) is desirable. We purposed to clarify prognostic factors and risk factors for early recurrence after metachronous PM resection.
Data-driven development of an oral lipid-based nanoparticle formulation of a hydrophobic drug,"Due to its cost-effectiveness, convenience, and high patient adherence, oral drug administration normally remains the preferred approach. Yet, the effective delivery of hydrophobic drugs via the oral route is often hindered by their limited water solubility and first-pass metabolism. To mitigate these challenges, advanced delivery systems such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) have been developed to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs and enhance their bioavailability. However, traditional design methodologies for these complex formulations often present intricate challenges because they are restricted to a relatively narrow design space. Here, we present a data-driven approach for the accelerated design of SLNs/NLCs encapsulating a model hydrophobic drug, cannabidiol, that combines experimental automation and machine learning. A small subset of formulations, comprising 10% of all formulations in the design space, was prepared in-house, leveraging miniaturized experimental automation to improve throughput and decrease the quantity of drug and materials required. Machine learning models were then trained on the data generated from these formulations and used to predict properties of all SLNs/NLCs within this design space (i.e., 1215 formulations). Notably, formulations predicted to be high-performers via this approach were confirmed to significantly enhance the solubility of the drug by up to 3000-fold and prevented degradation of drug. Moreover, the high-performance formulations significantly enhanced the oral bioavailability of the drug compared to both its free form and an over-the-counter version. Furthermore, this bioavailability matched that of a formulation equivalent in composition to the FDA-approved product, Epidiolex®."
"Magnetic targeting of lornoxicam/SPION bilosomes loaded in a thermosensitive in situ hydrogel system for the management of osteoarthritis: Optimization, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies in rat model via modulation of RANKL/OPG","Osteoarthritis is a bone and joint condition characterized pathologically by articular cartilage degenerative damage and can develop into a devastating and permanently disabling disorder. This investigation aimed to formulate the anti-inflammatory drug lornoxicam (LOR) into bile salt–enriched vesicles loaded in an in situ forming hydrogel as a potential local treatment of osteoarthritis. This was achieved by formulating LOR-loaded bilosomes that are also loaded with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) for intra-muscular (IM) administration to improve joint targeting and localization by applying an external magnet to the joint. A 31.22 full factorial design was employed to develop the bilosomal dispersions and the optimized formula including SPION (LSB) was loaded into a thermosensitive hydrogel. Moreover, in vivo evaluation revealed that the IM administration of LSB combined with the application of an external magnet to the joint reversed carrageen-induced suppression in motor activity and osteoprotegerin by significantly reducing the elevations in mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa beta/osteoprotegerin expressions. In addition, the histopathological evaluation of knee joint tissues showed a remarkable improvement in the injured joint tissues. The results proved that the developed LSB could be a promising IM drug delivery system for osteoarthritis management."
Anomalous diffusion limit for a kinetic equation with a thermostatted interface,"We consider the limit of solutions of scaled linear kinetic equations with a reflection-transmission-killing condition at the interface. Both the coefficient describing the probability of killing and the scattering kernel degenerate. We prove that the long-time, large-space limit is the unique solution of a version of the fractional in space heat equation that corresponds to the Kolmogorov equation for a symmetric stable process, which is reflected, or transmitted while crossing the interface and is killed upon the first hitting of the interface. The results of the paper are related to the work in Komorowski et al. (Ann Prob 48:2290–2322, 2020), where the case of a non-degenerate probability of killing has been considered."
Recombination map tailored to Native Hawaiians may improve robustness of genomic scans for positive selection,"Recombination events establish the patterns of haplotypic structure in a population and estimates of recombination rates are used in several downstream population and statistical genetic analyses. Using suboptimal maps from distantly related populations may reduce the efficacy of genomic analyses, particularly for underrepresented populations such as the Native Hawaiians. To overcome this challenge, we constructed recombination maps using genome-wide array data from two study samples of Native Hawaiians: one reflecting the current admixed state of Native Hawaiians (NH map) and one based on individuals of enriched Polynesian ancestries (PNS map) with the potential to be used for less admixed Polynesian populations such as the Samoans. We found the recombination landscape to be less correlated with those from other continental populations (e.g. Spearman’s rho = 0.79 between PNS and CEU (Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry) compared to 0.92 between YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria) and CEU at 50 kb resolution), likely driven by the unique demographic history of the Native Hawaiians. PNS also shared the fewest recombination hotspots with other populations (e.g. 8% of hotspots shared between PNS and CEU compared to 27% of hotspots shared between YRI and CEU). We found that downstream analyses in the Native Hawaiian population, such as local ancestry inference, imputation, and IBD segment and relatedness detections, would achieve similar efficacy when using the NH map compared to an omnibus map. However, for genome scans of adaptive loci using integrated haplotype scores, we found several loci with apparent genome-wide significant signals (|Z-score|> 4) in Native Hawaiians that would not have been significant when analyzed using NH-specific maps. Population-specific recombination maps may therefore improve the robustness of haplotype-based statistics and help us better characterize the evolutionary history that may underlie Native Hawaiian-specific health conditions that persist today."
Improved bioimpedance spectroscopy tissue classification through data augmentation from generative adversarial networks,"Bioimpedance spectroscopy is a tissue classification technique with many clinical applications. Similarly to other data-driven methods, it requires large amounts of data to accurately distinguish similar classes of tissue. Classifiers trained on small datasets typically suffer from over-fitting and lack the ability to generalise to previously unseen data. However, a large in or ex vivo spectral database is difficult to attain. Data collection is usually limited to studies that occur infrequently, and publicly available data is often not available. A solution to this problem is to artificially increase the training dataset by creating modified, yet accurate, copies of the original dataset. The most common techniques in spectral classification are to add noise to copies of the original data, over-sample it, or randomly interpolate pairs of the original data. However, simply perturbing or interpolating the data does not guarantee that the new dataset captures the key features of the original data needed for accurate classification. This study proposes a novel way to augment bioimpedance spectral data. It uses generative adversarial networks (GAN)—a model in which two neural networks (NN) compete with each other: while one NN artificially manufactures data that could be mistaken for real data, the role of the second NN is to identify which data it receives has been artificially created. The first NN then interactively adapts its output until the second NN can no longer flag artificially created data. The result is a new dataset that truly represents the features of the original data. In this study, three GAN architectures are used, i.e., the vanilla GAN, the deep convolutional GAN, and the Wasserstein GAN. Then, the generated data is used to train five classification methods, and their results are compared to a baseline that only uses the original data. The results from a dataset of 13 different tissue classes show that the deep convolutional GAN is most statistically similar to the original data and improves classification accuracy by 15% when compared to the same model trained only on the original data. The Wasserstein-GAN architecture also provides significant improvements of up to 24% better accuracy."
Fresh-Keeping Decision and Coordination of Fresh Agricultural Product Supply Chain Considering Carbon Cap-and-Trade under Different Dominance,"In the context of low carbon, this paper discussed the impact of the carbon cap-and-trade policy on the fresh-keeping decision-making of two-echelon fresh agricultural product supply chains under different dominance, and designed cost-sharing contracts to coordinate the supply chain of fresh agricultural products dominated by suppliers and retailers respectively. The results showed that: dominance has no effect on the fresh-keeping decision and total revenue of fresh agricultural product supply chain, but it affects the internal income distribution, and dominance does not always bring more benefits; the implementation of carbon cap-and-trade reduces the fresh-keeping decision-making of fresh agricultural products supply chain and reduces the free-rider income of followers; the role of higher carbon trading price is twofold, which not only brings about the speculation of leading enterprises, but also promotes the application of low-carbon technologies; consumers’ high preference for freshness, low-cost and high-efficiency low-carbon technology are all conducive to improving the fresh-keeping efforts and benefits of the supply chain; cost-sharing contracts can coordinate the supply chain of fresh agricultural products."
Prevalence of Pentatrichomonas hominis in foxes and raccoon dogs and changes in the gut microbiota of infected female foxes in the Hebei and Henan Provinces in China,"Pentatrichomonas hominis (P. hominis) is a zoonotic parasite that affects a wide range of hosts, causing gastrointestinal diseases. The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of P. hominis among caged foxes and raccoon dogs and the effect of P. hominis on the gut microbiota in female foxes. A total of 893 fresh fecal samples were collected from the Hebei and Henan Provinces in China. P. hominis was screened based on 18S rRNA gene expression via nested PCR. The difference in the gut microbiota between nine P. hominis-positive and nine P. hominis-negative samples was investigated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The total prevalence of P. hominis infection in foxes and raccoon dogs was 31.7% (283/893). The prevalence rates of P. hominis infection were 28.2% (88/312) and 33.6% (195/581) in foxes and raccoon dogs, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all P. hominis strains detected in foxes and raccoon dogs in the present study were the zoonotic genotype CC1. Moreover, compared with those in the P. hominis-negative group, the diversity of the gut microbiota in the P. hominis-positive group was lower, and the abundance of Firmicutes and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) in the P. hominis-positive group were lower than those in the P. hominis-negative group. We speculate that these differences may be due to indigestion and diarrhea in infected female foxes. Overall, the present study evaluated the prevalence of P. hominis in foxes and raccoon dogs in the Henan and Hebei Provinces and revealed that P. hominis infection interrupted the diversity of the gut microbiota in female foxes."
Strong Two and Three-Photon Absorption Coefficients of Gold-Doped Titanium Di-Oxide Nanoparticles Achieved by Femtosecond Z-Scan Technique,"Titanium dioxide (TiO2) semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) have promising applications in many fields of science. In particular, as photocatalysts TiO2 NPs are unique for their special optical and electronic properties. Plasmonic metal doping of TiO2 NPs modifies the optical bandgaps of the composite NPs, due to which their applications will be extended in the visible spectral range. In the present study, gold (Au) doped TiO2 NPs (in powder form) were synthesized in the deposition–precipitation method at two different concentrations of Au (25% and 50%). Subsequently, dispersions were prepared by dispersing the Au-TiO2 NPs in ethanol. Nonlinear optical (NLO) studies of the Au-doped TiO2 dispersions (0.25 Au-TiO2, 0.50 Au-TiO2NPs) were carried out by employing the laser pulses of duration ~ 150 fs at a repetition rate ~ 76 MHz, in open aperture (OA) and closed aperture (CA) Z-scan methods. Wavelength-dependent NLO studies of Au-TiO2 NPs (0.25 Au-TiO2, 0.50 Au-TiO2 NPs) have been carried out at different input wavelengths 700 nm, 750 nm, 800 nm, 850 nm, 900 nm, and 950 nm. It was observed that the recorded OA data fit well to three-photon absorption (3PA) for the 0.25 of Au doping, whereas for 0.50 Au-TiO2NPs data fitting was pretty good for two-photon absorption (2PA), for the input wavelengths starting from 800 nm, 850 nm, 900 nm, and 950 nm. At 700 nm, 0.25 Au-TiO2 NPs demonstrated reverse saturable absorption (RSA) in saturable absorption (SA), and 750 nm normalized transmittance exhibited a W-shaped signature (saturation in 2PA). Similarly, 700 nm, 750 nm, and 0.50 Au-TiO2 NPs have illustrated very strong 3PA at the input wavelengths. However, the pure TiO2 NPs in ethanol have demonstrated pure 2PA. CA traces recorded for both 0.25 Au and 0.50 Au TiO2 NPs in ethanol at all mentioned incident wavelengths, demonstrated a negative signature for the intensity dependent refractive index  (n2)."
Assessment of eggshell powder in natural fiber composite: a sustainable bio-concrete,"Utilization and valorization of egg-shell powder (ESP) and natural fiber in concrete have increased significantly due to their solitary characteristics that enhance the properties of the emanating composite. Concrete cracks are predestined. Ingress of chemicals leads to deterioration and affects their service life. In this work, Bacillus tropicus was isolated from suitable environment and used in concrete along with sufficient nutrient source and bacteria immobilized natural fibers ensuring improved strength and durability. In this work, ESP was replaced with cement at 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% as weight in bacterial concrete with constant dosage of 5% jute fiber. Mechanical and durability properties like compressive strength, compressive strength regain, split tensile, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), sorptivity, and crack healing were studied at 7, 14, and 28 days. Results indicate that ESP replacement should not exceed 5% to achieve improved values in the aforementioned properties. Surface cracks in bacterial ESP specimens showed 94.7% healing and 14.46% higher than internal crack healing. Microstructure studies like scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) analysis revealed the existence of calcium carbonate compounds generated by the biological activity of Bacillus tropicus in ESP fiber composite concrete"
Adsorption of methylene blue from textile industrial wastewater using activated carbon developed from H3PO4-activated khat stem waste,"The need for sustainable treatment technology was driven by the major environmental issue and health-related problems caused by untreated dye-containing wastewater generated from textile industries. Therefore, this study was conducted with the objective of removing methylene blue (MB) dye from textile industrial wastewater using activated carbon developed from khat stem waste through the adsorption technique. Acid impregnation followed by thermal activation was used to synthesize the adsorbent material and the developed adsorbent was characterized using various characterization techniques. The response surface methodology coupled with Box-Behnken approach was used to optimize the removal efficiency. The characterization techniques revealed the adsorbent to be highly irregular and porous (scanning electron microscope) amorphous structural properties (X-ray diffraction) composed of various functional groups (Fourier transform infrared) and specific surface area of 1323.3 m2/g (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller). The highest removal efficiency of 99.86% was obtained at pH 6, 150 mg/L of initial dye concentration, 0.2 g/100 mL of adsorbent dosage, and at contact time of 90 min. The kinetic and isotherm studies revealed that the Langmuir (R2 = 0.992) and pseudo-second-order (R2 = 0.999) models accurately fit the adsorption data. Additionally, the spontaneity and feasibility of the adsorption process were confirmed by a thermodynamic study. Moreover, the adsorbent was found to demonstrate a remarkable reusability with removal efficiencies ranging from 99.86 to 94.19% for five consecutive cycles. This study highlights the potential of khat-based activated carbon as an effective and eco-friendly adsorbent for the removal of MB dye from the textile wastewater, providing a promising solution for industrial wastewater treatment."
"Tobacco exposure, but not aging, shifts the frequency of peripheral blood B cell subpopulations","Several disturbances in T-cell mediated immunity have been described during aging, but immunosenescence of the B-cell compartment is less well elucidated. The peripheral blood B-cell compartment (CD19+) can be split into six main subpopulations according to the cell surface markers IgD, CD27, CD24, and CD38: Transitional, naïve, unswitched, switched, double negative and plasmablasts. We thus aimed to verify whether shifts in these subsets occur during healthy and pathological aging. We recruited three groups of aged people (> 60 years old), healthy, COPD patients, and smokers without altered pulmonary function test, and a fourth group of individuals 18–40 years old (youngs). Total B-cells percentage and absolute number were similar among the healthy aged, COPD patients, and youngs, but the smokers showed significantly higher absolute numbers. While all six B-cell subset percentages were comparable among the healthy aged, COPD patients, and youngs, smokers showed significantly higher percentages of switched B-cells and reduced naïve B-cells than the other three groups, resulting in an inverted naive:switched ratio. Analysis of the cell subset absolute numbers showed a similar trend. Overall, our results suggest that aging drives milder alterations in the distribution of peripheral blood B-cell subpopulations than in the T-cell compartment. We suggest that it is the T-cell immunosenescence that most contributes to the poor humoral immune responses in the elderly, vaccine responses included. Surprisingly it was the smokers who showed significant alterations when compared with the youngs, healthy aged, and aged COPD patients, probably as a result of the chronic immune stimulation described in active smoking subjects."
On a theorem of Kanold on odd perfect numbers,"We shall prove that if \(N=p^\alpha q_1^{2\beta _1} q_2^{2\beta _2} \cdots q_{r-1}^{2\beta _{r-1}}\) is an odd perfect number such that \(p, q_1, \ldots , q_{r-1}\) are distinct primes, \(p\equiv \alpha \equiv 1\ \left( \textrm{mod}\ 4\right) \) and t divides \(2\beta _i+1\) for all \(i=1, 2, \ldots , r-1\), then \(t^5\) divides N, improving an eighty-year old result of Kanold."
Terminology for future-oriented life cycle assessment: review and recommendations,"Some future-oriented life cycle assessment (LCA) terms, particularly prospective and ex-ante, show notable increase in use in publications over the last decade. However, scholars have pointed out that it is currently unclear exactly what these terms mean and how they are related. This paper aims to explain defining differences between future-oriented LCA terms and provide terminology recommendations."

Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Lacks Intrasurgeon and Intersurgeon Agreement in Technical Key Points That May Affect Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease After the Procedure,Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) may be related to surgical technique. The fact that there is a lack of technical standardization may explain large differences in GERD incidence. The aim of this study is to evaluate auto- and hetero-agreement for SG technical key points based on recorded videos.
Mechanical property heterogeneity in Inconel 718 superalloy manufactured by directed energy deposition,"Powder-based laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED) enables rapid prototyping and production of complex geometry Inconel 718 parts for structural applications. However, the heterogeneous microstructure obtained by the L-DED could lead to non-uniform mechanical properties at room temperature. Therefore, evaluating the local heterogeneity in mechanical properties of L-DED manufactured Inconel 718 superalloy is important. The mechanical properties in terms of hardness and local tensile properties of Inconel 718 superalloy have been investigated within the sample volume manufactured by L-DED to determine the local variations in properties. The mechanical properties were compared under the as-deposition and standard solution treatment and aging (STA) conditions. The average hardness and tensile strength properties of L-DED Inconel 718 in as-deposition conditions were significantly lower, while the strain-to-failure is significantly higher than that of its wrought counterparts. STA leads the average mechanical properties of L-DED Inconel 718, which is equivalent to its wrought counterpart. The hardness varied along the deposition direction in as-deposited L-DED Inconel 718. Interestingly, the local variability in the hardness along the deposition direction in L-DED Inconel 718 was eliminated after STA. The tensile strength properties varied along the deposition direction and were found to be lowest near the surface. The local variation trend in tensile strength properties was the same even after STA. The local ductility followed a trend relative to the strength in L-DED Inconel 718. A careful assessment shows that local variation in the mechanical properties was significant along the deposition direction, while it was minimal along the scanning direction of L-DED Inconel 718 under as-deposition and STA conditions. The local heterogeneity in the mechanical properties in L-DED Inconel 718 is explained in terms of the respective microstructure and deformation characteristics."
Failure Analysis of Fuel-Film Cooling Assembly of Reaction Control System for Satellite,"The present case study discusses the failure investigation conducted on fuel-film cooling assembly (FFCA) of prototype reaction control system (RCS), which was failed prematurely during static hot-fire test after 15 s of operation. The kerosene fuel is injected from small holes on to the nozzle convergent for cooling. Upon dismantling, circumferential cracks were observed in the weld joint of austenitic stainless steel. Stainless steel grade 304 is known for its satisfactory weld joint with grade 308 stainless steel filler, and no cracks were observed during dye penetrant test on weld. However, unexpected, and sudden failure of this component warrants detailed analysis to identify the root cause of the failure. Visual inspection, macro/micro examination via optical and scanning electron microscope, optical emission spectroscopy and microhardness survey were carried out on both failed weld joint as well as on samples taken from un-cracked weld for comparison. Visual observations show signs of heat tint near the cracked region, which indicates that the assembly was exposed to high temperatures. Macroscopic examination revealed weld metal cracking, which was found to be brittle transgranular fracture upon microscopic examination. Research findings established that the high welding heat input in manual TIG welding and non-equilibrium cooling conditions resulted in poor weld quality containing high delta ferrite content in the weld metal. Although limited amount of delta ferrite is considered beneficial for avoiding hot cracking in austenitic stainless steel weld joints, weld containing higher delta ferrite content is prone to embrittlement at elevated temperatures. During the hot-fire test of RCS, the FFCA was heated to high temperature, which caused transformation of delta ferrite into hard sigma phase. SEM–EDS analysis and microhardness measurements have confirmed the formation of sigma phase and extensive carbide network in weld deposit. Thermal stresses combined with metastable delta ferrite to sigma phase transformation resulted in weld metal embrittlement, which eventually fractured in brittle manner."
Sodium caseinate active film loaded clove essential oil based on konjac glucomannan and xanthan gum: physical and structural properties,"In recent years, proteins and polysaccharides have been widely used to prepare environmentally friendly functional food packaging materials. However, films based only on proteins or polysaccharides perform poorly and are often used as polymer matrices blended with biologically active ingredients to prepare films. In this paper, sodium caseinate (CAS), xanthan gum (XG), and konjac glucomannan (KGM) were used as raw materials, and clove oil (CEO) was added for the development of reactive biopolymer films, with the aim of exploring the effect of CEO on the structure and physical properties of films. The morphology, rheological behavior, optical properties, thermodynamic properties and mechanical properties of the composite films were investigated. The interaction between clove oil and film matrix was determined by Fourier infrared spectroscopy, and the distribution of CEO in the network structure of the films and the compatibility properties with the film matrix were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and laser confocal microscopy. It was found that with the increase of CEO content, the film color deepened, the optical properties were modulated, the surface hydrophobicity was enhanced and the thermodynamic properties did not change significantly. The study showed how the combination of konjac glucomannan and xanthan gum colloids with clove essential oil and sodium caseinate can affect the properties of bioactive films."
Development and application of packaging using chitosan-whey protein composite film functionalized with persimmon (Diospyros kaki L. f.) leaf extract,"A novel chitosan-whey protein composite film containing persimmon leaf extract (PLE) was prepared, and its application for the preservation of chicken breast meat was investigated. The results showed that, all fillers, including whey protein, PLE, and glycerol were well mixed and homogeneously dispersed in the chitosan-polymer substrate, forming a uniform composite film material. The intermolecular interactions between the fillers involved hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. Notably, the incorporation of PLE significantly improved the mechanical properties, water and light barrier properties, and antioxidant activity of chitosan-whey protein based film. Among them, the chitosan-whey protein composite film incorporated with 0.2% (w/v) PLE (CWP-4) had a lower solubility, water content, water vapor permeability, and higher mechanical properties, light barrier properties, and antioxidant activity. Moreover, the actual application of composite films on chicken breast meat preservation indicated that this novel composite film can effectively delay chicken breast meat spoilage and the lipid oxidation process, and thus, prolong the shelf life of chicken breast meat."
Numerical Understanding of Electromagnetic Influence on Fluctuation Behavior at Slag/Steel Interface During LF Refining Process,"The objective of this study was to create a novel 3D coupled numerical model that explores the impact of electromagnetism on the fluctuation of the slag/steel interface during the LF refining process. To evaluate the effects of alternating current power, an AC phasor was introduced to examine the Lorentz force and Joule heating phenomena. Turbulent motion was represented using the large eddy simulation technique, while the volume-of-fluid approach was utilized to illustrate the deformation of the air/slag/steel interface. The discrete phase model and the two-way coupled Euler–Lagrange technique were employed to track the motion of gas bubbles, accounting for bubble collision, coalescence, and breakup. By comparing the simulated results with experimental data, the model’s fundamental validity was confirmed. The findings emphasized the importance of concurrently considering both the electromagnetic field and the bubbly flow in the investigation of the LF refining process. It was observed that the Lorentz force played a crucial role in promoting the fluctuation of the slag/steel interface, potentially leading to the absorption of carbon by the molten steel."
Multiply Robust Estimation of Quantile Treatment Effects with Missing Responses,"Causal inference and missing data have attracted significant research interests in recent years, while the current literature usually focuses on only one of these two issues. In this paper, we develop two multiply robust methods to estimate the quantile treatment effect (QTE), in the context of missing data. Compared to the commonly used average treatment effect, QTE provides a more complete picture of the difference between the treatment and control groups. The first one is based on inverse probability weighting, the resulting QTE estimator is root-n consistent and asymptotic normal, as long as the class of candidate models of propensity scores contains the correct model and so does that for the probability of being observed. The second one is based on augmented inverse probability weighting, which further relaxes the restriction on the probability of being observed. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed method, and the motivated CHARLS data are analyzed, exhibiting different treatment effects at various quantile levels."

An optimized convolutional neural network for speech enhancement,"Speech enhancement is an important property in today’s world because most applications use voice recognition as an important feature for performing operations in it. Perfect recognition of commands is achieved only by recognizing the voice correctly. Hence, the speech signal must be enhanced and free from background noise for the recognition process. In the existing approach, a recurrent convolutional encoder/decoder is used for denoising the speech signal. It utilized the signal-to-noise ratio property for enhancing the speech signal. It removes the noise signal effectively by having a low character error rate. But it does not describe the range of SNR of the noise added to the signal. Hence, in this, optimized deep learning is proposed to enhance the speech signal. AI function deep learning mimics the human brain's ability to analyze data and create patterns for use in making decisions. An optimized convolutional neural network was proposed for enhancing the speech for a different type of signal-to-noise ratio value of noises. Here, the particle swarm optimization process performs tuning the hyper-parameters of the convolutional neural network. The tuning of value is to minimize the character error rate of the signal. The proposed method is realized using MATLAB R2020b software and evaluation takes place by calculating the character error rate, PESQ, and STOI of the signal. Then, the comparison of the proposed and existing method takes place using evaluation metrics with − 5 dB, 0 dB, + 5 dB and + 10 dB."
On-Site Calibration Procedure and Uncertainty Contributions on Air Temperature Sensors,"Due to the increasing demand of climate change studies, traceability of measurements according to the International System of Units (SI) becomes fundamental to establish data quality and comparability in time. With the aim of guaranteeing the traceability, in October 2022, an on-site calibration of three thermometers operated by the Osservatorio meteorologico di Moncalieri was assessed. The calibration by comparison against traceable travelling standards was performed in a transportable thermal chamber manufactured by the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM). Results showed that the main uncertainty contributions to the expanded uncertainty were the interpolation method, the chamber inhomogeneity and the repeatability of the sensors under calibration. This current calibration was compared with previous calibration in 2012 (on-site calibration) and in 2016 (laboratory calibration). The comparison analysis evidenced the drift effect on the thermometers and the importance of having an active calibration program to reduce this effect. Regarding the expanded uncertainty, both on-site calibrations presented the same order of magnitude and smaller than the correction values. This paper points out the advantage of performing an on-site calibration: since the calibration involves the same dataloggers and cables in the same environmental conditions, the calculated calibration curve represents more convincingly the real measurement conditions."
3D super-resolution reconstruction of porous media based on GANs and CBAMs,"Porous media reconstruction is quite significant in the fields of environmental supervision, oil and natural gas engineering, biomedicine and material engineering. The traditional numerical reconstruction methods such as multi-point statistics (MPS) are based on the statistical characteristics of training images (TIs), but the reconstruction quality may be unsatisfactory and the process is time-consuming. Recently, with the rapid development of deep learning, its powerful ability in predicting features has been used to reconstruct porous media. Generative adversarial network (GAN) is one of the generative methods of deep learning, which is derived from the two-person zero-sum game through the confrontation between the generator and discriminator. However, the traditional GAN cannot pay special attention to the effective features in learning, and the degradation problem easily occurs with the increase of layer numbers. Besides, high-resolution (HR) and large FOV (field of view) are usually contradictory for physical imaging equipment. Therefore, in practical experiments, due to the limitations of the resolution of imaging equipment and the sample size, it is difficult to obtain large-scale HR images of porous media physically. At this point, numerical super-resolution (SR) reconstruction seems to be a cost-efficient way. In this paper, residual networks and attention mechanisms are combined with single-image GAN (SinGAN), which can learn the structural characteristics of porous media from a low-resolution (LR) 3D image, and then reconstruct 3D HR or large-scale images of porous media. Comparison to some other numerical methods has proved that our method can reconstruct high-quality HR images with practicability and effectiveness."
Mg2+ ion-conducting ceramic solid electrolytes based on Moringa oleifera seed and magnesium nitrate for secondary magnesium battery applications,"The increasing demand for the replacement of Li-ion batteries places Mg-based batteries in prime research focus. Development of highly efficient Mg2+ ion conducting electrolyte has been demanded to overcome the drawbacks of Li-ion conducting electrolytes. An attempt is made to develop Mg2+ ion conducting electrolyte using biomaterial Moringa oleifera seed. In this study, Moringa oleifera (MO) seed–based biomaterial membranes, utilizing ZnO as ceramic filler, and Mg(NO3)2 ·6H2O as an ionic donor, are prepared using simple solution casting method and a secondary Mg battery coin cell is constructed. The XRD results shows the membrane MOZM3 has high amorphous nature than other prepared membranes. Furthermore, the above membrane also shows lowest glass transition temperature (41.03 °C) as measured by differential scanning calorimetry technique. The AC impedance spectroscopy indicates that the membrane MOZM3 gives the highest ionic conductivity of 6.53 × 10−3 S/cm at room temperature. The transport parameters such as charge carrier value (N), diffusion coefficient (D), mobility (µ), and relaxation time (τ) are calculated by using equivalent circuit fitting method. By utilizing the highest ion conducting membrane as a solid membrane electrolyte, a magnesium battery has been constructed and the open circuit voltage of 1.72 V is observed. The secondary Mg CR2032 coin cell is fabricated, and its charge/discharge properties are studied using GCD technique."
Rigidity of quasi-Einstein metrics: the incompressible case,"As part of a programme to classify quasi-Einstein metrics (M, g, X) on closed manifolds and near-horizon geometries of extreme black holes, we study such spaces when the vector field X is divergence-free but not identically zero. This condition is satisfied by left-invariant quasi-Einstein metrics on compact homogeneous spaces (including the near-horizon geometry of an extreme Myers–Perry black hole with equal angular momenta in two distinct planes) and on certain bundles over Kähler–Einstein manifolds. We find that these spaces exhibit a mild form of rigidity: they always admit a one-parameter group of isometries generated by X. Further geometrical and topological restrictions are also obtained."
NMDA Receptor Modulation in COVID-19-Associated Acute Respiratory Syndrome in both In Silico and In Vitro Approach,"The normal function of the N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) in human lungs depends on precisely regulated synaptic glutamate levels. Pathophysiology of the lungs is brought on by the changes in homeostasis of glutamate in the synapsis that leads to abnormal NMDAR activity. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) primarily results in lung infections, particularly lung muscle stiffening, and NMDA receptor potentiation may increase calcium ion influx and support downstream signaling mechanisms. Hence, NMDAR modulators that depend on glutamate levels could be therapeutically useful medications with fewer unintended side effects. A compound called THP (tetrahydropalmatine) that amplifies Ca2+ influx and potentiates NMDA receptors has been identified in the current study. In asthmatic human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells, THP regulates the NMDA receptor and helps in asthmatic ASM contraction, and the pharmacological stimulation of ASM depends on both brain and respiratory NMDA receptors. Glutamate potency is altered by this substance without any voltage-dependent side effects. Additionally, a GGPP (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate)-dependent mechanism of THP reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in ASM. THP is distinctive in terms of its chemical makeup, functioning, and agonist concentration–dependent and allosteric modulatory activity. To treat COVID-19-related SARS, THP, or any future-related compounds will make good drug-like molecule candidates."
Air quality monitoring in Ukraine during 2022 military conflict using Sentinel-5P imagery,"Air quality assessment is an important task, due to the adverse effects of air pollution on human health. This importance is more highlighted when it comes to exceptional events such as war. Early 2022 witnessed the start of a military conflict between Ukraine and Russia. As with any similar event, this war influences the environment in different aspects. The objective of this study is air quality monitoring in Ukraine using Sentinel-5P imagery and Google Earth Engine. To this end, the monthly concentration of four gaseous pollutants including ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde (HCHO), and carbon monoxide (CO) in 2022 is compared to 2019 and 2021 as business-as-usual (BAU) periods. Further statistical focus of this evaluation is on five major cities, namely Kiev, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Kherson, and Lviv. According to the results, the general trend of the O3 concentration is found to be increasing, whereas NO2, HCHO, and CO follow mostly a decreasing trend. However, the records of Lviv in terms of NO2 and HCHO indicate significant discrepancies with other cities that are deemed warfronts. Moreover, based on the applied t-test, the differences between the 2022 concentrations and BAU years in most cases are statistically significant. In summary, this study revealed evident effects of the ongoing war on the anthropogenic activities in Ukraine and, consequently, changes in air pollution."
Filial Piety and the Development of Independence and Interdependence During Emerging Adulthood: A Longitudinal Study of Taiwanese Adolescents,"While filial piety has been widely studied in Confucian-influenced societies, little is known about how it may influence the development of emerging adults’ independence and interdependence. Using a population-based longitudinal study in Taiwan (N = 3,149; 49.5% females), this study examined the association between filial piety in adolescence (aged 13–15) and independence and interdependence in emerging adulthood (aged 22). Results show that greater adherence to filial piety in adolescence predicts higher independence in emerging adulthood. Additionally, greater adherence to filial piety predicts higher interdependence for females, but not males, when parents hold traditional gender-role attitudes. This study underscores the significance of cultural norms and parental gender-role attitudes in shaping individuals’ development during emerging adulthood."
Preparation and characterization of deproteinized natural rubber/graphene oxide composite,"This study aims to prepare and characterize a composite of graphene oxide (GO) and deproteinized natural rubber (DPNR/GO). The GO was synthesized using the modified Hummer method, and characterized with XRD, Raman, TEM, and water contact angle measurements. The results showed that GO was succesfully exfoliated from graphite with XRD diffraction peak shifted from 11° to 26°, the Raman D/G band intensity increased from 0.11 to 0.93 and the water contact angle increased from 67° to 85°. Then, DPNR/GO composite was prepared via graft copolymerization using tetraethylenepentaamine/tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TEPA/TBHPO) as redox initiators and the composites with GO content of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 phr were studied. The XRD pattern for DPNR/GO showed no significant difference to that for DPNR. However, there is a slightly shift in IR absorption peaks at 3461 and 1747 cm−1 for DPNR/GO composite compared to DPNR/GO blend. The Tg of DPNR at -65.2 °C was also shifted to -64.1 °C after formation of DPNR/GO composite. The DPNR/GO composite with 1.0 phr of GO exhibited the highest gel content (60.9%) and tensile strength (9.74 MPa) among the samples. While the storage modulus of DPNR/GO composite (0.99 MPa) was lower than that of DPNR/GO blend (3.31 MPa), DPNR/GO composite exhibited both energetic and entropic elasticity compared to the blend."
Group 13 metal compounds as catalyst for the homopolymerization of epoxides,"The ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of epoxides, namely cyclohexene oxide (CHO), propylene oxide (PO), and tert-butyl glycidyl ether (tBuGE) catalyzed by Group 13 (Al, Ga, In) metal initiators is reported. These polymerization reactions were performed under solvent-free conditions and in the presence of chloroform (CHCl3) and toluene. InCl3 was the most efficient catalyst for the polymerization in the presence of CHCl3, and monomer loading up to 10,000 equivalents. It was observed that though the polymerization rate was slow in the presence of a solvent, the polymerization was much more controlled than in solvent-free conditions, producing exceptionally high molecular weights with narrow dispersities. The highest molecular weight of the polymer attained was 136.3 kg/mol, with CHO as the monomer. The order of reactivity for the epoxides was found to be CHO > tBuGE > PO. The polymerization reaction proceeds through an activated chain-end mechanism as established from the MALDI-TOF analysis of the polymer. These polymers were found to be atactic."
"Assessment of genetic diversity among sago palms (Metroxylon sagu Rottb.) in Bengkulu, Indonesia using simple sequence repeats","Sago palm (Metroxylon sagu Rottb.) is a carbohydrate-producing plant. It produces a starchy, edible pith or core within its trunk, which is the primary portion used for human consumption. To date, little has been investigated about the diversity of sago palm plants in Bengkulu, Indonesia. In this study, DNA was extracted from young leaves collected from nine locations in Bengkulu and amplified using 10 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers. Data analysis was conducted using NTSYs and POPGEN32 software. This study shows that the Sentot (B5), Damri (B7), and Merapi (B9) accessions had the highest expected heterozygosity (He), thereby indicating high genetic diversity. The largest genetic distances were observed for Lagan (B2) and Makmur Swamp (B4) compared with Dendam Lake (B3), while the smallest genetic distances were between the Sentot (B5) and Damri (B7) areas. We found two groups using phylogenetic analysis, GenAlEx and STRUCTURE. This result is consistent with two types of habitats and leaf morphologies among sago palm plants; i.e., plants in permanent swampy areas with a soil pH of 5.0–5.3 showing spines in the middle of the midrib extending up to the leaf tip and plants in wet peat areas with a soil pH of 5.3–6.0 showing spines only on the edge of the leaf. The results of our research provide information on genetic similarities between populations to assist in plant breeding."
On-Site Calibration Procedure and Uncertainty Contributions on Air Temperature Sensors,"Due to the increasing demand of climate change studies, traceability of measurements according to the International System of Units (SI) becomes fundamental to establish data quality and comparability in time. With the aim of guaranteeing the traceability, in October 2022, an on-site calibration of three thermometers operated by the Osservatorio meteorologico di Moncalieri was assessed. The calibration by comparison against traceable travelling standards was performed in a transportable thermal chamber manufactured by the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM). Results showed that the main uncertainty contributions to the expanded uncertainty were the interpolation method, the chamber inhomogeneity and the repeatability of the sensors under calibration. This current calibration was compared with previous calibration in 2012 (on-site calibration) and in 2016 (laboratory calibration). The comparison analysis evidenced the drift effect on the thermometers and the importance of having an active calibration program to reduce this effect. Regarding the expanded uncertainty, both on-site calibrations presented the same order of magnitude and smaller than the correction values. This paper points out the advantage of performing an on-site calibration: since the calibration involves the same dataloggers and cables in the same environmental conditions, the calculated calibration curve represents more convincingly the real measurement conditions."
Mg2+ ion-conducting ceramic solid electrolytes based on Moringa oleifera seed and magnesium nitrate for secondary magnesium battery applications,"The increasing demand for the replacement of Li-ion batteries places Mg-based batteries in prime research focus. Development of highly efficient Mg2+ ion conducting electrolyte has been demanded to overcome the drawbacks of Li-ion conducting electrolytes. An attempt is made to develop Mg2+ ion conducting electrolyte using biomaterial Moringa oleifera seed. In this study, Moringa oleifera (MO) seed–based biomaterial membranes, utilizing ZnO as ceramic filler, and Mg(NO3)2 ·6H2O as an ionic donor, are prepared using simple solution casting method and a secondary Mg battery coin cell is constructed. The XRD results shows the membrane MOZM3 has high amorphous nature than other prepared membranes. Furthermore, the above membrane also shows lowest glass transition temperature (41.03 °C) as measured by differential scanning calorimetry technique. The AC impedance spectroscopy indicates that the membrane MOZM3 gives the highest ionic conductivity of 6.53 × 10−3 S/cm at room temperature. The transport parameters such as charge carrier value (N), diffusion coefficient (D), mobility (µ), and relaxation time (τ) are calculated by using equivalent circuit fitting method.

The secondary Mg CR2032 coin cell is fabricated, and its charge/discharge properties are studied using GCD technique."
Solution of infinite system of third-order three-point nonhomogeneous boundary value problem in weighted sequence space \({{\varvec{bv}}}_{{{\varvec{p}}}}^{\omega }\),"We introduce the concept of weighted sequence space \(bv_p^\omega \) and we construct a Hausdorff measure of noncompactness (MNC) in this space. Then, by applying this MNC we study the existence of solutions of infinite systems of third-order three-point nonhomogeneous boundary value problem in \(bv_p^{\omega }\). Finally, we present two examples to show the usefulness of our results."
Normalized Solutions of Nonhomogeneous Mass Supercritical Schrödinger Equations in Bounded Domains,"This paper aims to consider normalized solutions of Schrödinger equations in bounded domains, that is, find \((\lambda ,u)\in \mathbb R\times H_0^1(\Omega )\) such that"
Planar Pseudo-geodesics and Totally Umbilic Submanifolds,"We study totally umbilic isometric immersions between Riemannian manifolds. First, we provide a novel characterization of the totally umbilic isometric immersions with parallel normalized mean curvature vector, i.e., those having nonzero mean curvature vector and such that the unit vector in the direction of the mean curvature vector is parallel in the normal bundle. Such characterization is based on a family of curves, called planar pseudo-geodesics, representing a natural extrinsic generalization of both geodesics and Riemannian circles: being planar, their Cartan development in the tangent space is planar in the ordinary sense; being pseudo-geodesics, their geodesic and normal curvatures satisfy a linear relation. We study these curves in detail and, in particular, establish their local existence and uniqueness. Moreover, in the case of codimension-one immersions, we prove the following statement: an isometric immersion \(\iota :M \hookrightarrow Q\) is totally umbilic if and only if the extrinsic shape of every geodesic of M is planar. This extends a well-known result about surfaces in \(\mathbb {R}^{3}\)."
Mitigating water stress effects on Roselle production: effects of Conocarpus biochar and nitrogen fertilizer on soil nutrients and yield,"The objective of this study was to determine the effects of different levels of irrigation water depth, nitrogen fertilizer, and Conocarpus biochar on the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of Roselle plants and their irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) and soil nutrition."
"Nitrogen addition decreases root exudation of four temperate tree species seedlings, independent of the applied nitrogen form","Root exudations play a crucial role in plant nutrient uptake; however, studies on their response to different forms of nitrogen (N) are lacking. To bridge these gaps, we examined the effect of different N forms on the root exudation rates among tree species."
A Cross-Sectional Comparative Study Analyzing the Quality of YouTube Videos as a Source of Information for Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction in English and Hindi Language,"This study aimed to evaluate and compare the quality of information in YouTube videos on erectile dysfunction (ED) treatment in English and Hindi language. The English and Hindi terms for erectile dysfunction treatment were searched on YouTube, and the first 100 videos were screened. Of them, 148 videos were eligible for analysis. Quality of health information was assessed using: a modified 5-item DISCERN tool; and the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) for Audio/Visual Materials. The analyzed videos had cumulative views of more than 70 million. Only 8.8% of videos had DISCERN score ≥ 4 indicating good content quality. About 46% and 40% of videos presented information in an easy-to-understand and actionable manner based on PEMAT sub-scale scores ≥ 70% respectively. The three most common treatments suggested for ED were lifestyle modification-based advice (41.2%), oral Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors (37.8%), and penile prosthetic implantation (28.4%).Herbal/ over-the-counter medicines, and specific diet/ food item(s) were more frequently suggested in Hindi videos. Whereas, intra-cavernosal injections, MUSE suppositories, and shock wave therapy were more commonly suggested in English videos. A substantial number of videos suggested treatment strategies that were not concordant with the American Urological Association guidelines. Healthcare professionals need to be mindful of this while counseling patients and advocate for the creation of more reliable and accurate online sources of information in English and other vernacular languages like Hindi."
Dynamic modeling and vibration analysis of double row cylindrical roller bearings with irregular-shaped defects,"Defects in the bearings greatly affect vibrations and performances of rotating transmission systems. Moreover, most previous works estimated the defect shape as a regular shape. However, the actual defect shape is not actually regular. To obtain more accurate vibration characteristics of a defective double row cylindrical roller bearing, an irregular-shaped defect modeling method and a dynamic model of double row cylindrical roller bearing with irregular-shaped defects are proposed in this paper. The dynamic model includes all components and their interactions. A test verification is proposed to validate the established model. The effects of the bearing load, rotating speed, and different independent shape defect sizes on the double row cylindrical roller bearing vibrations are investigated. The comparisons of vibrations between the irregular defect shape and simplified defect shape are studied. The results show that the simplified defect shape model will cause the vibrations to be overestimated. The established dynamic model with the actual defect is more reasonable than the simplified defect model. Moreover, this paper can provide a comprehensive analytical method for double row cylindrical roller bearing vibrations."
Regret and repair: from coworker undermining to organizational citizenship behavior,"Unethical interpersonal interactions such as coworker undermining has been a major issue in organizations as they add stress to the workplace and make it unappealing for others. The extant research focused on the victim’s perspective; however, actor’s perspective has been overlooked so far. Based on the social identity theory (SIT), we focused on the actor’s perspective and investigated how coworker undermining transforms into organizational citizenship behavior towards individuals (OCBI). By doing so, we introduced the actor’s regret as a key mediating mechanism to explain the interactive effects of coworker undermining and organizational identity (OI) on OCBI (i.e., the mediated moderation model). The findings, based on time-lagged, dyadic data (N = 31 supervisors and 400 employees) from the textile sector, in Pakistan showed that high-OI employees who engaged in coworker undermining behavior realize their fault and are regretful for their offense, this regret then leads them to exhibit OCBI. This study contributes to the undermining and OCB literature by focusing on the actors’ perspectives."
Early social experiences and later psychopathology: the role of OXTR rs53576 genotype,"Although previous research has established a link between the variant rs53576 of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and social behaviors, our understanding of its long-term impact on mental health from early childhood to adolescence remains limited. This study aimed to explore the potential link between children’s involvement in recreational activities with parents during early childhood, their OXTR rs53576 genotype, and the subsequent development of psychopathology. It involved gathering data during three different stages: early childhood (T1), middle childhood (T2), and adolescence (T3). During T1, the parents of 144 Chinese participants aged 4 to 6 years (48.6% boys) completed a scale on frequency of parent-child recreational activities. Three years later (T2), parents were re-surveyed about the participant’s conduct problems, which was assessed using the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Seven years later (T3), the participants completed the Depression scale of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale – 21 to evaluate their levels of depressive symptoms. Additionally, buccal swab samples were collected and genotyped for OXTR rs53576. OXTR rs53576 genotypes were found to interact with the frequency of parent-child recreational activities to predict future conduct problems (β=-1.38, p = 0.028). Increased conduct problems were in turn associated with a higher level of subsequent depressive symptoms during adolescence (r = 0.22, p < 0.05). Engaging in recreational activities with parents during early childhood is important for the overall well-being of children, particularly for those who demonstrate a tendency of being sociable. Early childhood interventions should educate and assist parents in designing unstructured play based on their young children’s sociability."
Enhanced photodetection performance of vanadium pentoxide nanostructures deposited on porous silicon substrate via pulsed laser deposition,"The combination of common semiconductors with porous materials has the potential to augment the splitting of electrons and holes, hence increasing the efficiency of photodetectors. In the current study, we present the efficient fabrication of photodetectors consisting of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) and macroporous structures via the pulsed laser deposition technique. The structure, surface morphology, and optical properties of V2O5 nanostructures embedded in porous silicon were examined using an X-ray diffractometer, a field emission scanning electron microscope, and a UV–Vis–NIR diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer, photoluminescence emission spectra, and Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy. The findings indicate that the V2O5 nanostructure exhibits an orthorhombic crystal structure, which tends to align along the (001) plane. These nanostructures were distributed on porous silicon surfaces, mainly within the pores, which range in size from 52.4 nm to 106.5 nm. The level of pore filling varies depending on the laser energy used, ranging from partial to almost complete filling. The room-temperature photoluminescence peaks of V2O5 nanostructure/porous silicon possess four distinct spectra characterized by their maximum emission wavelengths of around 461 nm and 664 nm.However, the electrical and spectral responsivity properties were measured before and after introducing V2O5 nanostructures into porous silicon. The ideality factor of porous silicon has decreased after embedding V2O5 nanostructure in porous silicon. The deposition of V2O5 nanostructures into porous silicon resulted in a significant rise in spectrum responsivity, particularly at a wavelength of 471 nm. Moreover, the spectral responsivity exhibited a rising trend with increasing laser energy, reaching a maximum value of 0.31 A/W. The external quantum efficiency found its highest value at 78.93% when more incredible laser energy was used. The V2O5 nanostructure/porous silicon device fabricated in this work, consisting of a V2O5 nanostructure integrated with porous silicon, has remarkable potential as a high-efficiency photodetector in several photoelectronic technologies."
New analytic wave solutions to (2 + 1)-dimensional Kadomtsev–Petviashvili–Benjamin–Bona–Mahony equation using the modified extended mapping method,"In this study, the (2 + 1)-dimensional Kadomtsev–Petviashvili–Benjamin–Bona–Mahony equation (KP-BBME) is examined. KP-BBM is used as a water wave model to mimic the wave propagation for fluid flows and to describe bidirectional propagating water wave surface. Studying is conducted by applying the modified extended mapping method to construct various and novel solutions for the proposed model. These solutions including {dark, bright, and singular} solitons, Weierstrass elliptic, exponential and singular periodic solutions. The extracted solutions confirmed the efficacy and strength of the current technique. To illustrate the physical characteristics of the established solutions, 3D, 2D and contour plots are depicted for many selected solutions."
Enhancement of electron-bunch quality in bubble domain utilizing plasma ramp profile with various density-hill widths in laser wakefield acceleration,"The laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) scheme is now a superb and potent instrument for industry, medicine, fusion, and other uses. With the aid of this technique, high-quality electron beams can be generated, which might eventually be employed to create small, portable X-ray sources. Using a linearly polarized Gaussian laser pulse, the present work focuses on examining electron acceleration in an under-dense plasma having a ramp profile with different density-hill widths. Two-dimensional Fourier–Bessel Particle-In-Cell simulation (2D-FBPIC) code shows that optimizing the laser parameters and plasma density profile maximizes the energy gain and minimizes the normalized rms emittance in the x, y directions inside the plasma bubble. For 10  and 90 \({\upmu\text{m}}\) density-hill widths, respectively, the optimal emittance value is reported to be \({\epsilon }_{x}\sim 3.10\) mm.mrad in the x-direction and \({\epsilon }_{y}\sim 2.63\) mm.mrad in the y-direction. At a density-hill width of 90 \({\upmu\text{m}}\), it is also observed that the charge trapped inside the bubble is 44.91 pC. With this density-hill width and a plasma channel length of 3.84 mm, our simulation findings show an energy gain of 0.38 GeV to the electron-bunch accelerated inside the bubble."
"New analytical and numerical solutions to the (2+1)-dimensional conformable cpKP–BKP equation arising in fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and nonlinear optics","This study investigates the \((2+1)\)-dimensional conformable combined potential Kadomtsev–Petviashvili-B-type Kadomtsev–Petviashvili (cpKP–BKP) equation. It is a linear combination of potential KP and BKP systems. This equation sheds light on hydrodynamics, plasma physics, and nonlinear optics. Firstly, conformable derivative definitions and their characteristics are provided. Next, using the modified extended tanh-function approach, accurate analytical solutions to this problem are obtained. The residual power series method (RPSM) was then used to investigate the approximate solutions to the model. A table compares the obtained findings with absolute errors. The 3D and 2D surfaces and the corresponding contour plot surfaces of specifically gathered data illustrate the obtained findings’ physical aspect. The physical activity of the problem can only be tracked with explicit solutions that have been accomplished. The results illustrate how the under-investigation and other nonlinear physical models from mathematical physics are applied in real life. All of the solutions obtained are new and do not exist in the literature. Consequently, these methods might produce notable outcomes in obtaining the exact and approximate solutions of fractional differential equations (FDEs) in various circumstances."
Exploring optical soliton solutions of a self-focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation by two effective techniques,"In this manuscript, we have conducted a comprehensive investigation of the self-focusing Schrödinger equation with fourth-order dispersion, yielding closed-form results for crucial optical soliton solutions. To achieve this, we have employed two distinct methodologies. Firstly, we harnessed the power of the generalized Kudryashov method to derive novel solutions for the Schrödinger equation, expanding the landscape of possible solutions. To further enrich our understanding of optical solitons, we incorporated the \(\left( \frac{1}{\mathscr {G}^{\prime }}\right)\) expansion technique, uncovering additional soliton solutions. The behavior of these solutions is vividly illustrated through 2D and 3D graphical representations, shedding light on the characteristics of bright, breather-type, and combined M-W-shaped optical solitons. Moreover, we have meticulously examined the influence of specific parameters on the dynamics of soliton solutions obtained via the \(\left( \frac{1}{\mathscr {G}^{\prime }}\right)\) method, providing valuable insights into the interplay between these parameters and the soliton behavior."
Design and analysis of a dual-broadband microwave metasurface absorber with flexibility and transparency,"A flexible, transparent and polarization-insensitive metasurface absorber (MA) with dual-broadband feature is proposed. The MA consists of absorption layer, transparent flexible polyvinyl chloride (PVC) dielectric layer, and indium tin oxide (ITO)/polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottom plate. The dual-broadband characteristics are studied by transmission-line theory, numerical simulation and experiment. The experimental results indicate that over 90% absorptivity under the planar case is achieved in 10.85–26.01 GHz and 44.86–56.67 GHz, corresponding relative bandwidth are 82.23% and 23.26%, respectively. The light transmittance is 63.3%. Both theoretical analysis and simulated results are good accordance with the experiment. The influence of structural parameters on the dual-broadband absorption performance is studied. Moreover, the analysis of the impedance matching theory, surface current, magnetic field and electric field distributions and power loss density are given to explain the dual-band absorption mechanism. The proposed dual-broadband MA maintains good angular stability whether in planar (30°) or conformal (20°) cases. The MA has simple structure, high optical transparency and flexibility, it promises to be a good candidate for electromagnetic (EM) shielding room observation windows, touch panel controls, radio-frequency identification systems and transparent radio-frequency devices."
Design and numerical demonstration of a multimode interference sensor using engineered slot-waveguides,"This paper introduces a new design strategy for the development of highly sensitive Multimode Interference (MMI) sensors by employing an engineered slot-waveguide as the foundation for the device. Waveguides typically adopted in MMI sensors have the evanescent field of their modes interact with the sample in the sensing region and, by doing that, the device sensitivity is limited by how distinctly confined the propagating modes are. Even though one propagating mode has a greater interaction with the sample than the other, they both are sensitive to changes in the refractive index in the sensing area, when the ideal situation is to keep one of them virtually insensitive to such changes. A multimode slot-waveguide with a central defect was proposed to improve two aspects: first, obtain one mode that is guided through the high-index central defect of the core and that is, by construction, physically separated from the sensing region; second, utilize another high-order mode that propagates through the low-index regions of the core and not only in direct contact with the sample, but with maximum field intensity in the region of interaction. For aqueous samples (refractive index approximately 1.33), the achieved sensitivity per sensor length was \(6.0\hbox { rad} \cdot \hbox {RIU}^{-1} \cdot \mu \hbox { m}^{-1}\) and an estimated Limit-Of-Detection of \(3.5 \cdot 10^{-8}\hbox { RIU}^{-1}\), which places the slot-MMI sensor among the most sensitive devices in the current literature."
"Electronic, optical, magnetic, and magnetocaloric properties of double perovskites Sr2CrOsO6: first principles approach and Monte Carlo simulation","Employing the Quantum Espresso computational tool and Monte Carlo simulation, we conducted an extensive investigation into the electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of the \({\mathbf{S}\mathbf{r}}_{2}{\mathbf{C}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{O}\mathbf{s}\mathbf{O}}_{6}\) (SCOsO) compound. Our analysis revealed its semiconductor nature with a direct band gap and the presence of spin-down states at the Fermi level. Notably, the Hubbard parameter (U) significantly influenced the magnetic states, illustrating its role in modulating the magnetic moments within the material. The computed exchange interactions using the Ising model unveiled distinct magnitudes for \({\text{Cr}}-{\text{Cr}}\), Os-Os, and Os-Cr interactions, reflecting variations in electronic interactions within the compound. The temperature-dependent magnetization and susceptibility demonstrated a critical temperature of \(634 \, {\text{K}}\), marking a significant ferrimagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition. SCOsO exhibited a significant magnetocaloric properties, displaying substantial values of maximum magnetic entropy change \(\left({\varvec{\Delta}}{{\varvec{S}}}_{{\varvec{M}}}\right)\) and Relative Cooling Power (RCP) under an applied magnetic field of \(2\mathbf{T}\), outperforming various other compounds in this category. Regarding optical properties, our analysis using Quantum Espresso revealed SCOsO's strong reflectivity for green light, indicating its potential for solar light storage. The refractive index displayed distinct variations, suggestive of electronic transitions influenced by the spin–orbit coupling of \(\mathbf{C}\mathbf{r}\) and \(\mathbf{O}\mathbf{s}\) ions within the compound."
LncRNA RNA ROR Aggravates Hypoxia/Reoxygenation-Induced Cardiomyocyte Ferroptosis by Targeting miR-769-5p/CBX7 Axis,"Ferroptosis is a new way of cell death which is reported to participate in the pathology of myocardial ischemia–reperfusion (MI/R) injury, but it's mechanism remains unclear. The present investigation is to study the emerging role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) regulator of reprogramming (ROR) in cardiomyocyte ferroptosis after hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) administration. RT-qPCR and/or Western blot methods were performed to examine the gene/or protein levels, and CCK-8, ELISA, and DCFH-DA staining determined the cellular viability and ferroptosis. Dual-luciferase and RNA immunoprecipitation were applied to verify molecular interaction. LncRNA ROR and miR-769-5p were overexpressed and reduced in blood samples from MI patients and H/R-treated AC16 cells, respectively. Mechanistically, lncROR sponged to miR-769-5p, thus upregulating CBX7 expression. Functional experiments presented that lncRNA ROR silence mitigated H/R-stimulated inflammatory damage, oxidative stress, and ferroptosis in AC16 cells, whereas these roles could be reversed by co-downregulation of miR-769-5p or co-overexpression of CBX7. These data uncovered that lncRNA ROR prevented against H/R-induced cardiomyocyte ferroptosis by modulating miR-769-5p/CBX7 signaling, emphasizing the therapeutic value of lncRNA ROR in MI/R injury."
Supervisory Alliance as a Moderator of the Effects of Behavioral Rehearsal on TF-CBT Fidelity: Results from a Randomized Trial of Supervision Strategies,"Exposure is an important element of treatment for many evidence-based treatments but can be challenging to implement. Supervision strategies to support exposure delivery may be an important tool to facilitate the use of exposure techniques; however, they must be considered and used in the context of the supervisory alliance. The present study examined relations between supervisory alliance and fidelity to the trauma narrative (TN; i.e., imaginal exposure) component of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. We also examined how supervisory alliance moderated the effect of behavioral rehearsal use in supervision on TN fidelity. We analyzed data from a randomized controlled trial, in which forty-two supervisors and their clinicians (N = 124) from 28 Washington State community-based mental health offices participated. Clinicians were randomized to receive one of two supervision conditions—symptom and fidelity monitoring (SFM) or SFM with behavioral rehearsal (SFM + BR). Supervisory alliance alone did not predict delivery (i.e., occurrence) or extensiveness of delivery of the trauma narrative. Client-focused supervisory alliance moderated the effectiveness of behavioral rehearsal—as client-focused alliance increased, the odds of delivering the TN also increased significantly. Future research should further investigate how to appropriately match supervision techniques with supervisory dyads and explore the interplay of alliance with supervision techniques a supervisor might employ."
On the Ambiguity of Images and Particularity of Imaginings,"It is often observed that images—including mental images—are in some sense representationally ambiguous. Some, including Jerry Fodor, have added that mental images only come to have determinate contents through the contribution of non-imagistic representations that accompany them. This paper agrees that a kind of ambiguity holds with respect to mental imagery, while arguing (pace Fodor) that this does not prevent imagery from having determinate contents in the absence of other, non-imagistic representations. Specifically, I argue that mental images can represent determinate types of outlays of properties without help from any non-imagistic representations, yet can only become involved in the representation of particular objects through pairing with a non-imagistic representation of the right sort. These points are defended through reflection on the “Picture Principle,” the nature of depiction, and general principles for typing and individuating mental states."
The positive impact of the NtTAS14-like1 gene on osmotic stress response in Nicotiana tabacum,NtTAS14-like1 enhances osmotic tolerance through coordinately activating the expression of osmotic- and ABA-related genes.
A prospective randomized study of multimodal analgesia combined with single injection transversus abdominis plane block versus epidural analgesia against postoperative pain after laparoscopic colon cancer surgery,"Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a safe, effective, and promising analgesic procedure, but TAP block only cannot overcome postoperative pain. We conducted a prospective randomized study to evaluate postoperative pain control using multimodal analgesia (MA) combined with a single injection TAP block compared with epidural analgesia (EA) after laparoscopic colon cancer surgery."
Endoscopic and trans-anal local excision vs. radical resection in the treatment of early rectal cancer: A systematic review and network meta-analysis,The management of early-stage rectal cancer in clinical practice is controversial. The aim of this network meta-analysis was to compare oncological and postoperative outcomes for T1T2N0M0 rectal cancers managed with local excision in comparison to conventional radical resection.
Power law slip boundary condition for Navier-Stokes equations: Discontinuous Galerkin schemes,"This study deals with the numerical analysis of several discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for the resolution of the Navier-Stokes equations with power law slip boundary condition. The physical context corresponding to this problem is the description of a flow when a position and the direction slip boundary condition is taken into consideration. The main goal in this work is to examine the solvability, convergence of several DG methods, and to discuss their practical resolution by means of fixed point iterative algorithm. Theoretical findings are backed up by solid computational results."
Development and evaluation of a vacuum impregnation system for enhancement of biochemical properties of food materials,"Vacuum impregnation is a novel methodology for adding various substances to porous foods. This study aimed to develop a cost effective automate system for vacuum impregnation of food materials to enhance their nutritional, functional and sensory properties depending on the functionality of the impregnation solution. The developed vacuum impregnation system includes a vacuum chamber, vacuum pump and an automation setup for creating and maintaining vacuum conditions, feeding impregnated solutions to the samples and releasing vacuum. Fresh-cut spinach leaves were impregnated with ascorbic acid (AsA) and calcium chloride (Cacl2) (10% concentration) in the setup in order to test the effect of the process on some biochemical properties. Statistical analysis revealed significant effect of vacuum impregnation on the biochemical properties (total soluble solids, total phenolic content, flavonoid content and free radical scavenging activity) and color of spinach leaves during storage up to 4 days. Impregnation process showed significant increase in the total phenolic and flavonoid content of the spinach leaves. Increment up to 78% in antioxidant activity was seen for the uncoated impregnated leaves as compared to 59% activity in untreated samples. Thus, products with desired parameters can be produced with this process with minimal impact on their properties at a lower cost and in a shorter time period."
Accounting Information Systems and Strategic Performance: The Interplay of Digital Technology and Edge Computing Devices,"With the rapid development of digital technologies, scholars and industries are pushing into the information age, where data processing is the accounting industry's major challenge. This study aimed to analyze the use of these digital technologies for strategic performance attainment and mediating the accounting information system (AIS). Further, this study also explores the moderation of the DT and strategic performance linkage. In this rapid change, the business organization is crucial to competition. Hence, technology is the key factor for maintaining the competitiveness of the industrialists, specifically where information plays a vital role in making management decisions. Accounting software is a significant tool that efficiently collects data and makes timely decisions to declare the business strategy to respond quickly to the market. However, the available accounting software is costly, and small-scale businesses cannot afford it. Therefore, this paper developed a digital accounting system using artificial intelligence (AI) and edge computing (EC) to process and store the accounting data. This article introduces novel edge framework for digital data processing with advanced data processing methods. The with the growth of IoT, the data sizes have increased significantly. Moreover, the traditional cloud platforms are enriched with EC to process the vast amount of data where it is collected. Therefore, the business can adapt to new size data and raise its standards in terms of technical content. It will define the distributed storage in the cloud and test the cluster performance of the system once the system design and its effects on the system. In the end, the system operation time, load balancing and rows of data is tested experimentally. The results and its analysis demonstrated that the data processing with EC for AIS utilized is improved acceleration rate, operational efficiency and execution rate."
Improved bioimpedance spectroscopy tissue classification through data augmentation from generative adversarial networks,"Bioimpedance spectroscopy is a tissue classification technique with many clinical applications. Similarly to other data-driven methods, it requires large amounts of data to accurately distinguish similar classes of tissue. Classifiers trained on small datasets typically suffer from over-fitting and lack the ability to generalise to previously unseen data. However, a large in or ex vivo spectral database is difficult to attain. Data collection is usually limited to studies that occur infrequently, and publicly available data is often not available. A solution to this problem is to artificially increase the training dataset by creating modified, yet accurate, copies of the original dataset. The most common techniques in spectral classification are to add noise to copies of the original data, over-sample it, or randomly interpolate pairs of the original data. However, simply perturbing or interpolating the data does not guarantee that the new dataset captures the key features of the original data needed for accurate classification. This study proposes a novel way to augment bioimpedance spectral data. It uses generative adversarial networks (GAN)—a model in which two neural networks (NN) compete with each other: while one NN artificially manufactures data that could be mistaken for real data, the role of the second NN is to identify which data it receives has been artificially created. The first NN then interactively adapts its output until the second NN can no longer flag artificially created data. The result is a new dataset that truly represents the features of the original data. In this study, three GAN architectures are used, i.e., the vanilla GAN, the deep convolutional GAN, and the Wasserstein GAN. Then, the generated data is used to train five classification methods, and their results are compared to a baseline that only uses the original data. The results from a dataset of 13 different tissue classes show that the deep convolutional GAN is most statistically similar to the original data and improves classification accuracy by 15% when compared to the same model trained only on the original data. The Wasserstein-GAN architecture also provides significant improvements of up to 24% better accuracy."
Fresh-Keeping Decision and Coordination of Fresh Agricultural Product Supply Chain Considering Carbon Cap-and-Trade under Different Dominance,"In the context of low carbon, this paper discussed the impact of the carbon cap-and-trade policy on the fresh-keeping decision-making of two-echelon fresh agricultural product supply chains under different dominance, and designed cost-sharing contracts to coordinate the supply chain of fresh agricultural products dominated by suppliers and retailers respectively. The results showed that: dominance has no effect on the fresh-keeping decision and total revenue of fresh agricultural product supply chain, but it affects the internal income distribution, and dominance does not always bring more benefits; the implementation of carbon cap-and-trade reduces the fresh-keeping decision-making of fresh agricultural products supply chain and reduces the free-rider income of followers; the role of higher carbon trading price is twofold, which not only brings about the speculation of leading enterprises, but also promotes the application of low-carbon technologies; consumers’ high preference for freshness, low-cost and high-efficiency low-carbon technology are all conducive to improving the fresh-keeping efforts and benefits of the supply chain; cost-sharing contracts can coordinate the supply chain of fresh agricultural products."
Z3 and (×Z3)3 symmetry protected topological paramagnets,"We identify two-dimensional three-state Potts paramagnets with gapless edge modes on a triangular lattice protected by (×Z3)3 ≡ Z3 × Z3 × Z3 symmetry and smaller Z3 symmetry. We derive microscopic models for the gapless edge, uncover their symmetries and analyze the conformal properties. We study the properties of the gapless edge by employing the numerical density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulation and exact diagonalization. We discuss the corresponding conformal field theory, its central charge, and the scaling dimension of the corresponding primary field. We argue, that the low energy limit of our edge modes defined by the SUk(3)/SUk(2) coset conformal field theory with the level k = 2. The discussed two-dimensional models realize a variety of symmetry-protected topological phases, opening a window for studies of the unconventional quantum criticalities between them."
"Thrown into the World, Attached to Love: On the Forms of World-Sharing and Mourning in Heidegger","How can we understand the phenomena of loss and mourning in the Heideggerian framework? There is no established interpretation of Heidegger that gives an elaborate account of the phenomena of loss and mourning, let alone gauges its importance for our understanding and assessment of authentic existence in Heidegger. This paper attempts to do both. First, I give a detailed exposition of Heidegger’s analysis of the phenomena of mourning and loss and show that Heidegger’s analysis of mourning in his early and late work is strikingly in line with his collectivist understanding of Being-with. This demonstrates, contrary to what some of his proponents argue, that Heidegger does not follow the kind of dynamic understanding of Being-with that places the other within fine-grained spaces of possibility. Second, with reference to Heidegger’s existential philosophy, I construct a phenomenology of mourning and grief. Though Heidegger himself fails to explain the relationships in which one mourns after a close other, we can develop a unique phenomenology of mourning with reference to Heidegger, which shows that each loss is singular and can be equiprimordial with one’s own death in opening one to the possibility of an authentic existence. In this new understanding of authenticity, loss is regarded as a powerful force, akin to death, in leading one toward their self-owned existence."
"Assessment of genetic diversity among sago palms (Metroxylon sagu Rottb.) in Bengkulu, Indonesia using simple sequence repeats","Sago palm (Metroxylon sagu Rottb.) is a carbohydrate-producing plant. It produces a starchy, edible pith or core within its trunk, which is the primary portion used for human consumption. To date, little has been investigated about the diversity of sago palm plants in Bengkulu, Indonesia. In this study, DNA was extracted from young leaves collected from nine locations in Bengkulu and amplified using 10 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers. Data analysis was conducted using NTSYs and POPGEN32 software. This study shows that the Sentot (B5), Damri (B7), and Merapi (B9) accessions had the highest expected heterozygosity (He), thereby indicating high genetic diversity. The largest genetic distances were observed for Lagan (B2) and Makmur Swamp (B4) compared with Dendam Lake (B3), while the smallest genetic distances were between the Sentot (B5) and Damri (B7) areas. We found two groups using phylogenetic analysis, GenAlEx and STRUCTURE. This result is consistent with two types of habitats and leaf morphologies among sago palm plants; i.e., plants in permanent swampy areas with a soil pH of 5.0–5.3 showing spines in the middle of the midrib extending up to the leaf tip and plants in wet peat areas with a soil pH of 5.3–6.0 showing spines only on the edge of the leaf. The results of our research provide information on genetic similarities between populations to assist in plant breeding."
Prevalence of Pentatrichomonas hominis in foxes and raccoon dogs and changes in the gut microbiota of infected female foxes in the Hebei and Henan Provinces in China,"Pentatrichomonas hominis (P. hominis) is a zoonotic parasite that affects a wide range of hosts, causing gastrointestinal diseases. The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of P. hominis among caged foxes and raccoon dogs and the effect of P. hominis on the gut microbiota in female foxes. A total of 893 fresh fecal samples were collected from the Hebei and Henan Provinces in China. P. hominis was screened based on 18S rRNA gene expression via nested PCR. The difference in the gut microbiota between nine P. hominis-positive and nine P. hominis-negative samples was investigated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The total prevalence of P. hominis infection in foxes and raccoon dogs was 31.7% (283/893). The prevalence rates of P. hominis infection were 28.2% (88/312) and 33.6% (195/581) in foxes and raccoon dogs, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all P. hominis strains detected in foxes and raccoon dogs in the present study were the zoonotic genotype CC1. Moreover, compared with those in the P. hominis-negative group, the diversity of the gut microbiota in the P. hominis-positive group was lower, and the abundance of Firmicutes and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) in the P. hominis-positive group were lower than those in the P. hominis-negative group. We speculate that these differences may be due to indigestion and diarrhea in infected female foxes. Overall, the present study evaluated the prevalence of P. hominis in foxes and raccoon dogs in the Henan and Hebei Provinces and revealed that P. hominis infection interrupted the diversity of the gut microbiota in female foxes."
Adsorption of methylene blue from textile industrial wastewater using activated carbon developed from H3PO4-activated khat stem waste,"The need for sustainable treatment technology was driven by the major environmental issue and health-related problems caused by untreated dye-containing wastewater generated from textile industries. Therefore, this study was conducted with the objective of removing methylene blue (MB) dye from textile industrial wastewater using activated carbon developed from khat stem waste through the adsorption technique. Acid impregnation followed by thermal activation was used to synthesize the adsorbent material and the developed adsorbent was characterized using various characterization techniques. The response surface methodology coupled with Box-Behnken approach was used to optimize the removal efficiency. The characterization techniques revealed the adsorbent to be highly irregular and porous (scanning electron microscope) amorphous structural properties (X-ray diffraction) composed of various functional groups (Fourier transform infrared) and specific surface area of 1323.3 m2/g (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller). The highest removal efficiency of 99.86% was obtained at pH 6, 150 mg/L of initial dye concentration, 0.2 g/100 mL of adsorbent dosage, and at contact time of 90 min. The kinetic and isotherm studies revealed that the Langmuir (R2 = 0.992) and pseudo-second-order (R2 = 0.999) models accurately fit the adsorption data. Additionally, the spontaneity and feasibility of the adsorption process were confirmed by a thermodynamic study. Moreover, the adsorbent was found to demonstrate a remarkable reusability with removal efficiencies ranging from 99.86 to 94.19% for five consecutive cycles. This study highlights the potential of khat-based activated carbon as an effective and eco-friendly adsorbent for the removal of MB dye from the textile wastewater, providing a promising solution for industrial wastewater treatment."
Assessment of eggshell powder in natural fiber composite: a sustainable bio-concrete,"Utilization and valorization of egg-shell powder (ESP) and natural fiber in concrete have increased significantly due to their solitary characteristics that enhance the properties of the emanating composite. Concrete cracks are predestined. Ingress of chemicals leads to deterioration and affects their service life. In this work, Bacillus tropicus was isolated from suitable environment and used in concrete along with sufficient nutrient source and bacteria immobilized natural fibers ensuring improved strength and durability. In this work, ESP was replaced with cement at 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% as weight in bacterial concrete with constant dosage of 5% jute fiber. Mechanical and durability properties like compressive strength, compressive strength regain, split tensile, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), sorptivity, and crack healing were studied at 7, 14, and 28 days. Results indicate that ESP replacement should not exceed 5% to achieve improved values in the aforementioned properties. Surface cracks in bacterial ESP specimens showed 94.7% healing and 14.46% higher than internal crack healing. Microstructure studies like scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) analysis revealed the existence of calcium carbonate compounds generated by the biological activity of Bacillus tropicus in ESP fiber composite concrete"
Marine debris facilitates the long-distance dispersal of fish species,"Drifting marine debris has been shown to host associated biological communities and facilitate their dispersal. Little is known about how biota engage with, and are transported by, this debris. This study characterizes debris-associated communities and explores the role of plastics in transferring fishes to new geographic regions. ~ 1500 underwater photographs were reviewed from five cruises during 2018–2020: one between Japan and Hawaii encompassing the Western and Eastern Pacific Ocean (Group I), and four passing through the North Pacific Garbage Patch in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (Group II). Debris properties were recorded and 13 associated fish species from 43 debris items were identified. Fish communities around marine debris have low diversity, individual debris items have highly dissimilar species compositions, and species composition is affected by horizontal debris item size. Debris items in Group I have significantly higher fish species diversity and differ in community composition from Group II. Four taxa (Abudefduf vaigiensis, Histrio histrio, Oplegnathus punctatus, and Petroscirtes spp.) were observed surviving east of the Hawaiian Islands, where they have not been previously reported. Marine debris is found to be a mobile natural habitat substitute that can facilitate long-distance species dispersal. While natural flotsam has long been a potential vector, long-lived and increasingly abundant plastic debris may set the stage for altering fish biogeography."
"Atmospheric process factors affecting the stable isotope variations in precipitation in Guiyang, Southwest China","The research on precipitation stable isotopes is beneficial for gaining insight into the water cycle in the monsoon region. However, the variability of monsoon and lack of high-resolution collection of precipitation stable isotopes in the monsoon region has been posing a limitation on learning the controlling factors on its variations. This study collects the daily precipitation stable isotopes in Guiyang from April 2022 to March 2023. The research results show that the precipitation stable isotopes display seasonal variations with the slope and intercept of the fitted local meteoric water line (LMWL) being 8.9 and 19.69, respectively. During the year, precipitation δ18O has a weak negative correlation with precipitation amount and temperature, but the correlation between precipitation δ18O and local environmental factors is not as significant as the one between precipitation δ18O and precipitation amount and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) of the upstream area. During the monsoon season (MS), as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) migrates northward, the oceanic water vapor and upstream convective activity cause the decrease in precipitation stable isotopes. While during the non-monsoon season (NMS), the local circulation water vapor becomes the dominant water vapor source, leading to the increase in precipitation stale isotopes. The above studies demonstrate that water vapor sources and upstream convective activities play a critical role on variations of precipitation stable isotopes in Guiyang, which can provide basic information for future research on the water cycle in the monsoon region."
Surface Bragg gratings of proteins patterned on integrated waveguides for (bio)chemical analysis,"The incorporation of biomacromolecules onto silicon waveguiding microstructures constitutes a growing trend that pushes towards compact and miniaturized biosensing systems. This paper presents the integration of one-dimensional periodic nanostructures of proteins on the surface of micrometric silicon waveguides for transducing binding events between biomacromolecules. The study demonstrates this new bioanalytical principle by experimental results and theoretical calculations, and proves that rib waveguides (1-–1.6-µm width) together with protein gratings (495-–515-nm period) display suitable spectral responses for this optical biosensing system. Protein assemblies of bovine serum albumin are fabricated on the surface of silicon nitride waveguides, characterized by electron microscopy, and their response is measured by optical frequency domain reflectometry along the fabrication process and the subsequent stages of the biorecognition assays. Detection and quantification limits of 0.3 and 3.7 µg·mL−1, respectively, of specific antibodies are inferred from experimental dose–response curves. Among other interesting features, the results of this study point towards new miniaturized and integrated sensors for label-free bioanalysis."
Nucleic acid aptasensor with magnetically induced self-assembly for the detection of EpCAM glycoprotein,"A “turn-on” aptasensor for label-free and cell-free EpCAM detection was constructed by employing magnetic α-Fe2O3/Fe3O4@Au nanocomposites as a matrix for signal amplification and double-stranded complex (SH-DNA/Apt probes) immobilization through Au-S binding. α-Fe2O3/Fe3O4@Au could be efficiently assembled into uniform and stable self-assembly films via magnetic-induced self-assembly technique on a magnetic glassy carbon electrode (MGCE). The effectiveness of the platform for EpCAM detection was confirmed through differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Under optimized conditions, the platform exhibited excellent specificity for EpCAM, and a strong linear correlation was observed between the current and the logarithm of EpCAM protein concentration in the range 1 pg/mL–1000 pg/mL (R2 = 0.9964), with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.27 pg/mL. Furthermore, the developed platform demonstrated good stability during a 14-day storage test, with fluctuations remaining  below 93.33% of the initial current value. Promising results were obtained when detecting EpCAM in spiked serum samples, suggesting its potential as a point-of-care (POC) testing."
"Development of a colorimetric sensor based on the coupling of a microfluidic paper-based analytical device and headspace microextraction for determination of formaldehyde in textile, milk, and wastewater samples","A user-friendly, cost-effectively, portable, and environmentally friendly colorimetric sensor for the quantitative determination of formaldehyde was developed based on the combining of microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD), headspace microextraction (HSME), and digital image colorimetry. Coupling HSME and μPAD led to enhancements in selectivity and sensitivity of the sensor through sample cleanup and analyte enrichment. To construct the μPAD-HSME device, two pieces of paper as the sample and detection zone were placed facing each other so that a small common and sealed space was created between them. The color change occurred when the analyte in the gaseous form crossed this gap and reached the detection zone. Colorimetric sensing in the detection zone was performed based on the Hantzsch reaction. The color change in the detection zone was recorded by a smartphone and digital images were processed using image analysis software based on the RGB model. The influence of some key variables on the sensitivity of the method including derivatization reagent composition, sample volume, extraction temperature, and extraction time was studied and optimized. The linear dynamic range of the method was obtained in two ranges of 0.10–0.75 and 0.75–5.0 mg L−1 with a limit of detection of 0.03 mg L−1. The recoveries were in the range 80–126% for the quantification of formaldehyde in textile, milk, and wastewater samples."
Dual-state dual emission from precise chemically engineered bi-ligand MOF free from encapsulation and functionalization with self-calibration model for visual detection,"Synthesis of dual-state dual emitting metal–organic frameworks (DSDE-MOFs) is uncommon and challenging. Additionally, DSDE-MOFs can fulfil the expanding need for on-site detection due to their stability and self-reference for a variety of non-analyte variables. In the present work, a novel intrinsic DSDE of chemically engineered bi-ligand Eu-based MOF (UoZ-1) was designed. The prepared UoZ-1 spherical particles were small-sized  around 10–12 nm and displayed blue (425 nm) and red fluorescence (620 nm) at both states, dispersed in liquid and in solid state, when excited at 250 nm. A ratiometry platform was developed since the red emission was quenched by the addition of folic acid and the blue emission was almost remained unaffected. In the fluorometric ratiometric-mode, a dynamic linear range was recorded from 10 to 200 µM with LOD about 0.4 µM. Visual-based detection with assistance of smartphone was developed for quantification based on RGB analysis using Color Grab App. In the visual-mode, LOD as small as 2.3 µM was recorded. By utilizing the intrinsic dual-emitting UoZ-1, highly stable, recyclable, sensitive, and selective on-site visual detection of folic acid can be achieved. UoZ-1, a DSDE-MOF with no encapsulation or functionalization requirements, exhibits great potential for diverse applications."
A point-of-care aptasensor based on the upconversion nanoparticles/MoS2 FRET system for the detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection,"The rapid detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is of great significance for the diagnosis of medical infection. In view of the above, a novel aptasensor based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was developed. It contained aptamer-coupled upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs-apt) as a donor (excitation 980 nm) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets as an acceptor. The upconversion fluorescence aptamer system was investigated to obtain the optimal parameters of MoS2 concentration, the incubation time of UCNPs-apt/MoS2 and P. aeruginosa, and pH. Based on the optimal parameters, a linear calibration equation (emission 654 nm) with a wide detection range 8.7 × 10 ~ 8.7 × 107 cfu/mL, a high coefficient of determination R2 0.9941, and a low limit of determination (LOD) 15.5 cfu/mL were established. The method was validated with P. aeruginosa infected foci of mouse wound. The advantage of this aptasensor is that analysis results can be obtained  within 1.5 h, which was much faster than that of the standard method (18–24 h). Furthermore, combined with a portable instrument, it can be used as a point-of-care testing for the early detection of P. aeruginosa infection, which is useful for selecting the correct antibiotics to achieve good therapeutic effects. Additionally, it also has a broad application prospect in food and environmental areas."
Velocity-Dependent Effect on the Peak Shear Strength of Rock Joints Considering the Distribution Characteristics of Contact Joint Surface,"This study aims to elucidate the mechanism of velocity-dependent peak shear strength (PSS) for rock joints by examining the three-dimensional distribution characteristics of actual contact joint surface. Shear tests are conducted on saw-cut joints (SCJs) and natural rough rock joints under varying shear velocities (v) but a constant normal stress. The test results reveal that the PSS of SCJs decreases with increasing shear velocity, whereas the PSS of rough joints increases with v. Through analysis of the impact of v on the contact area, a PSS model is developed. The model demonstrates that for SCJs, the contact area decreases with increasing v, resulting in a reduction in the basic friction angle. Conversely, for rough joints, the contact area decreases with increasing v. However, it is observed that, considering the distribution characteristics of the apparent dip angle of asperities on the joint surface, the average roughness of joint surface increases as the contact area decreases. It is the increase in roughness that subsequently leads to an increase in the PSS of rock joints. The new model incorporates the influence of v on both the basic friction angle and peak dilation angle, and the interplay between these factors determines the PSS of rock joints."
"Breast reconstruction timing and modality in context: A cross-sectional study in Uppsala, Maastricht, and Rome","With the development and refinement of techniques most mastectomy patients nowadays are candidates for breast reconstruction. No one surgical technique fits all, however. Treatment choices are driven by patient characteristics and preferences, alongside policy and operational factors. These, in turn, might be expected to differ on several levels of aggregation, for example, countries, regions, and hospitals. The aim of this study was to compare choices for breast reconstruction timing and modality in Uppsala (Sweden), Maastricht (the Netherlands), and Rome (Italy)."
Effects of Kelvin–Voigt Damping on the Stability of (Thermo)Elastic Timoshenko System with Second Sound,"In this paper, we investigate the stabilization of Timoshenko systems with or without Kelvin–Voigt damping, in the presence of second sound. We have drawn conclusions that provide new insights into the effect of local Kelvin–Voigt damping. Our primary conclusion is that the exponential stability of the system achieved through local thermal damping will be destroyed by the local Kelvin–Voigt damping with a discontinuous coefficient at the interface. In particular, when local dissipation solely originates from the second sound, the system exhibits exponential stability. However, when Kelvin–Voigt damping is introduced into the local thermoelastic component, the system, surprisingly, loses its exponential stability. In this case, the corresponding solution decays polynomially with the rate \(t^{-2}\)."

Method of evaluating the radius of influence of a circulating well based on hydraulic head difference,"The radius of influence of a vertical circulation well was studied, taking the difference between the hydraulic head caused by the operation of the vertical circulation well and the initial state of the hydraulic head as the index. Based on the influence of well operation, the aquifer properties and technical parameters of the vertical circulation well on hydraulic head difference, an evaluation method for determining the radius of influence of the well was constructed. The software COMSOL Multiphysics was used to simulate the variation in hydraulic head and the flow field under different working conditions. The results show that increasing the operating time and flow rate, with an increased horizontal permeability, could lead to an increase of the influence radius, while an increase in the vertical permeability could lead to a decrease in the influence radius. Running time, horizontal permeability, vertical permeability, the distance between the lower screen section and the waterproof bottom plate, and the distance between the upper and lower screen sections, all have a great influence on the flow field. Thus, a calculation formula for quantitatively estimating the radius of influence of vertical circulation wells was obtained."
Ramsey Numbers of Trees Versus Multiple Copies of Books,"Given two graphs G and H, the Ramsey number R(G,H) is the minimum integer N such that any two-coloring of the edges of KN in red or blue yields a red G or a blue H. Let v(G) be the number of vertices of G and χ(G) be the chromatic number of G. Let s(G) denote the chromatic surplus of G, the number of vertices in a minimum color class among all proper χ(G)-colorings of G. Burr showed that \(R(G,H) \ge (v(G) - 1)(\chi (H) - 1) + s(H)\) if G is connected and \(v(G) \ge s(H)\). A connected graph G is H-good if \(R(G,H) = (v(G) - 1)(\chi (H) - 1) + s(H)\). Let tH denote the disjoint union of t copies of graph H, and let \(G \vee H\) denote the join of G and H. Denote a complete graph on n vertices by Kn, and a tree on n vertices by Tn. Denote a book with n pages by Bn, i.e., the join \({K_2} \vee \overline {{K_n}} \). Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau and Schelp proved that Tn is Bm-good if \(n \ge 3m - 3\). In this paper, we obtain the exact Ramsey number of Tn versus 2B2- Our result implies that Tn is 2B2-good if n ≥ 5."
Development of a shear strength model for a rock mass containing a complex fracture system based on direct shear tests: a case study,"Due to the complex geometric distribution of discontinuities, the determination of the shear strength of rock masses has become a difficult task limiting the stability analysis of surrounding rock masses in underground tunnels. This problem might be attributed not only to the size effect of fractured rock masses but also due to the difficult quantification of the geometric distribution of fracture systems. To find a solution to this problem, a series of direct shear tests were numerically simulated by utilizing the synthetic rock mass method (SRM) in the PFC3D software to estimate the shear strength of a rock mass in Qingdao Metro tunnels, located in Shandong province, China. The numerical simulation results show that the shear strength parameters vary significantly with the orientation of the fracture network contained in the rock mass. Meanwhile, it was found that the fracture tensor component in the direction z, Fzz, which is in the perpendicular direction to the shearing plane (x–y plane) of the rock mass displayed an inversely varying trend with the shear strength parameters. Accordingly, a shear strength model was established for the rock mass by introducing Fzz to reflect the effect of the geometric distribution of the complex fracture system. The developed shear strength model was verified by conducting direct shear tests in the field, and a good agreement has been achieved."
Study on shear mechanical characteristic evolution and influencing factors of rock joint surfaces under cyclic loading conditions,"Determining the shear strength of rock joint surfaces is a fundamental problem in the fields of rock mechanics and engineering geology. To obtain the cyclic shear strength of rock joint surfaces under cyclic shearing conditions, an improved formula is proposed. First, cubic splitting tests are used to fabricate joint surfaces and prepare experimental specimens with simulated materials. Second, a series of laboratory cyclic shear tests and data analysis are conducted to investigate the effects of the normal stress, the number of shearing cycles, the rock wall strength, and the surface roughness on the mechanical and morphological properties of the rock joints. The maximum shear strength of the joint surface increases with the normal stress, the rock wall strength, and the joint surface roughness. Considering morphological properties, the normalized values of the indices decrease with the normal stress, the number of shearing cycles, and the joint surface roughness increase, while they increase with increasing rock wall strength. Third, the accuracy of the Adhesive Friction Theory-Barton empirical formula is verified by fitting the experimental data to calculation results. Finally, based on the negative exponential degradation assumption, a new formula is proposed to calculate shear strength under cyclic shear conditions. The proposed calculation method can provide a theoretical reference for improved safety during engineering and design."
Psychometric properties and normative data of the Italian version of the Cognitive Function at Work Questionnaire: a screening tool for detecting subjective cognitive complaints at work,"Considering the extension of working life due to socioeconomic and political factors, many people may experience cognitive complaints (CC) at their workplace, with severe consequences on their quality of life. The identification of workers reporting significative SCC is crucial to eventually address them to an objective neuropsychological evaluation and implement cognitive interventions to guarantee workers’ well-being. Since no Italian questionnaires for detecting CC were designed for occupational settings, the aim of the study was to validate the Italian version of the Cognitive Function at Work Questionnaire (CFWQ) and to provide its normative data."
Radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer in elderly patients: analysis of the Head and Neck Cancer Registry of Japan,Whether concurrent chemotherapy with radiotherapy (CRT) is effective for elderly patients with head and neck cancer is a controversial topic. This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of CRT vs. radiation therapy (RT) among elderly patients in Japan.
Accelerated charging protocols for lithium-ion batteries: Are fast chargers really convenient?,"The accelerated charging of lithium-ion cells is proposed as a case study that will facilitate the integration of several fundamental electrochemical concepts learned during a dedicated electrochemistry course. Lithium-ion cells are ubiquitous to our everyday life, and their presence will become even more pervading with the increase in number of electric vehicles and the wider penetration of renewable energy sources in our energy matrix. In this context, understanding conventional and fast charging of lithium ion cells and most importantly being able to relate the limitations of the charging process to fundamental electrochemical phenomena at the interphase level are key. By testing the charge and discharge of graphite/lithium cobalt oxide single cells at different C rates, a large array of experimental data is generated which will trigger the discussion. The applied current is interpreted as the imposed kinetics on the system. The voltage vs. time profiles are highly dependent on the applied current. Surprisingly, whilst during the CV regime the same voltage value is applied in all experiments, the resulting current vs. time profiles are different for experiments at varying C rates. The different profiles are interpreted in terms of activation, diffusion, and concentration overpotentials. The kinetics related both to electrochemical reactions and mass transport phenomena limit the maximum current that can be imposed to the system."
Preparation of the Edible Fragrant Antibacterial Sodium Caseinate–Based Nanocomposite Containing Rosa damascena Essential Oil and Halloysite Nanotube,"This study is focused on the preparation of active packaging based on sodium caseinate (SC) and Rosa damascena essential oil (REO) reinforced by halloysite (Hal, 1 and 3 wt%) and bacterial cellulose (BC, 2 wt%). Based on FE-SEM images, the simultaneous incorporation of Hal and BC (BC2H3) could decrease a porosity of SC film and generate a homogenous surface, ascertaining well dispersion of reinforcements through the protein matrix. The porosity and non-homogeneity of the REO-loaded composites decreased in comparison with unloaded films due to the establishment of hydrogen bonding interactions. EDX mapping of Al and Si atoms proved the well distribution of halloysite into the SC film. While for REO-loaded nanocomposites, the aggregated regions enhanced by increasing the Hal content. XRD patterns of REO-bearing nanocomposites showed that the intensities of reflections belonging to Hal and BC decreased, indicating their increased amorphous structure. TG analysis indicated the improved thermal resistance of Hal-reinforced nanocomposites in comparison with the SC film. The thermal stability of nanocomposites showed insignificant change after addition of REO due to the presence of halloysite which could retard or delay the escape of EO molecules. Hal exhibited a more significant influence on tensile strength (TS) of the film as compared to BC. BC exhibited a more significant influence on barrier properties. The simultaneous incorporation of BC and Hal could compensate the decreased TS of REO-loaded films. The inclusion of REO into nanocomposites amplified their barrier and antibacterial properties. BC2H3/EO and BC2H1/EO nanocomposites satisfied the criteria of an ideal food packaging."
Sex-Specific Associations of Five Serum Essential Metal Elements with Thyroid Nodules in Euthyroid Adults: a Cross‑sectional Study,"The association between the serum essential metal elements (magnesium, iron, copper, zinc, and calcium) and thyroid nodules is still inconsistent. The current study aims to investigate the relationship of metal elements with thyroid nodules and their malignant tendency. A total of 6480 Chinese euthyroid adults were included in our study. We collect basic information through questionnaires and medical checkups. We diagnose thyroid nodules by ultrasound and detect serum trace metal concentrations by using an automatic biochemical analyzer. Binary and multinomial logistic regressions were used to investigate the associations. As a result, we found that serum copper concentrations were positively associated with thyroid nodules in the second, third, and fourth quartiles, compared to the first quartile (P = 0.024, P = 0.016, P = 0.032) in women and P for trend is 0.038. There is a significant sex-specific association between copper concentrations and thyroid nodules (P for interaction = 0.009). The results of the multinomial logistic regression analyses indicate high serum calcium and magnesium concentrations emerged as consistent risk factors for thyroid nodules in both genders, whereas low zinc was a sex-specific factor. We also observed significant sex interactions in the relationships of magnesium (P for interaction = 0.043) with thyroid nodules with malignant tendency among participants with thyroid nodules. In conclusion, our study suggests that gender is an important factor when studying the association between serum metals and thyroid nodules. The imbalance of selected metal elements (calcium, copper, zinc, and magnesium) may relate to thyroid nodules and their malignant tendency, and future prospective studies are needed to further confirm the associations."
Association Between the Serum Copper Levels and Environmental Tobacco Exposure on the Risk of Overweight and Obesity in Children: a Study Based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,"This study was to assess the individual effects of serum copper levels and environmental tobacco exposure and their joint effects on the risk of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents of 6 to 19 year olds. We analyzed cross-sectional data from 1849 children and adolescents participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collected between 2011 and 2016. Environmental tobacco exposure was determined by cotinine levels. The serum copper level was divided into < median group and ≥ median groups according to the median of 109.81 µg/dL. The outcome was overweight/obese in children and adolescents. Weighted multinomial multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the association of serum copper and cotinine levels, with the risk of overweight/obesity, and the joint effects on the risk of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents. The subgroup analyses based on age, gender, and household smoking status were conducted. Among 1849 children and adolescents, 332 children and adolescents had overweight BMI, and 450 children and adolescents had obese BMI. Higher serum copper levels were associated with the risk of obesity in children and adolescents (odds ratio (OR) 2.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39–6.31, P = 0.006). A positive association between increasing levels of cotinine levels and the risk of overweight (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.16–2.87, P = 0.010) and obesity (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.03–6.40, P = 0.044) in children and adolescents was observed. A remarkable association was found between higher serum copper in combination with higher cotinine levels and the risk of overweight (OR 3.23, 95% CI 1.19–8.83, P = 0.023) and obesity (OR 8.76, 95% CI 2.14–35.87, P = 0.003) in children and adolescents. The subgroup analyses revealed positive associations between high serum copper levels in combination with high cotinine levels and overweight and obesity in children and adolescents aged ≥ 12 years, of female sex, and without smoking family members. There may exist a joint effect of serum copper levels and environmental tobacco exposure on overweight/obesity among children and adolescents. These findings offer an insight that early weight control and reduction of tobacco exposure and the detection of serum copper levels may be important in reducing the risk of obesity in children."
Intersectional coalitions towards a just agroecology: weaving mutual aid and agroecology in Barcelona and Seville,"Although in theory social justice is considered as a core dimension of agroecological transitions, alternative food initiatives related to agroecology have been criticised for their exclusionary practices based on important social and economic biases. In this article, we adopt the lens of political intersectionality to study two cases of Agroecology-oriented Food Redistribution Coalitions in Spain that emerged to address the rising levels of food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that the coalitions represent a convergence of diverse social struggles, placing intersectionally marginalized groups at the centre of their activism. However, we also uncover that coalition members participate in different ways depending on their socioeconomic profiles, which could perpetuate inequalities in organizational practices. One major point of tension is the need to balance the goal of providing access to healthy and sustainable food with the affordability of such produce. This leads to the adoption of hybrid food networks that include conventionally produced food. We also highlight that while the predominance of women in these coalitions reflects the unequal distribution of food-related care work in society, the collectivization of such work through AFRCs practices points to a transformation of gender relations. Territorialized alliances between actors from urban and rural settings and between urban centers and peripheries are established through the coalitions. However, such networks fall short on involving large numbers of agroecology-oriented initiatives and providing direct encounters between consumers and producers. Overall, the article underscores the importance of addressing intersecting inequalities within alternative food initiatives and argues that intersectional coalitions offer an intriguing example of how to promote such understanding and pave the way towards (more) just agroecological transitions."
More than meat? Livestock farmers’ views on opportunities to produce for plant-based diets,"Promoting plant-based diets as a response to climate crisis has clear implications for producers of animal derived foods, but surprisingly little research considers their perspectives on this. Our exploration focused on farming strongly associated with meat production in Wales, UK. Mindful of polarised debates around plant-based diets, we considered dietary transition as an opportunity to produce for new markets. The first aim was to identify whether transition towards plant-based diets might trigger transformation of livestock agriculture. Findings indicate a potential trigger event once livestock farmers are certain that consumer trends and climate mitigation require change. Livestock farmers who regard their meat as climate-friendly might resist transitions felt to unfairly disadvantage them. We then considered livestock farmers’ likely capacity to produce plant crops, and how this transformational capacity might be enhanced. Participants highlighted forms of financial and environmental inflexibility, plus social norms regarding “good” Welsh farmers, combining to make transformation risky. Transformational capacity might be enhanced through levering occupational and place attachments by portraying plant crops as a revival of historic practices from traditional farming landscapes. Improved linking capacity will also be beneficial, as producing for new markets requires connections to new supply chains, and learning across divisions within rural communities. We present these preliminary insights to livestock farmers’ attitudes and transformational capacity to inform future research with them to advance just agricultural transitions. Our study indicates potential to avoid confrontational discussion of dietary transition and we hope that others will pursue its focus on opportunities for farmers."
Bayesian sequential designs in studies with multilevel data,"In many studies in the social and behavioral sciences, the data have a multilevel structure, with subjects nested within clusters. In the design phase of such a study, the number of clusters to achieve a desired power level has to be calculated. This requires a priori estimates of the effect size and intraclass correlation coefficient. If these estimates are incorrect, the study may be under- or overpowered. This may be overcome by using a group-sequential design, where interim tests are done at various points in time of the study. Based on interim test results, a decision is made to either include additional clusters or to reject the null hypothesis and conclude the study. This contribution introduces Bayesian sequential designs as an alternative to group-sequential designs. This approach compares various hypotheses based on the support in the data for each of them. If neither hypothesis receives a sufficient degree of support, additional clusters are included in the study and the Bayes factor is recalculated. This procedure continues until one of the hypotheses receives sufficient support. This paper explains how the Bayes factor is used as a measure of support for a hypothesis and how a Bayesian sequential design is conducted. A simulation study in the setting of a two-group comparison was conducted to study the effects of the minimum and maximum number of clusters per group and the desired degree of support. It is concluded that Bayesian sequential designs are a flexible alternative to the group sequential design."
"Bulk geochemistry, Rb–Sr, Sm–Nd, and stable O–H isotope systematics of the Metzimevin high-grade iron ore deposit, Mbalam iron ore district, southern Cameroon","Bulk geochemistry, Sr, Nd, and O–H isotope systematics are reported for the first time on banded iron formation (BIF)-hosted high-grade iron ore at the north-western segment of Congo Craton (CC). Located in Mbalam iron ore district, Southern Cameroon, Metzimevin iron ore deposit is a hematite-magnetite BIF system, dominated by SiO2 + Fe2O3 (97.1 to 99.84 wt%), with low concentrations of clastic elements e.g., Al2O3, TiO2, and HFSE, depicting a nearly pure chemical precipitate. The REE + Y signature of the iron deposit displays strong positive Eu anomaly, strong negative Ce anomaly, and chondritic to superchondritic Y/Ho ratios, suggestive of formation by mixed seawater-high temperature hydrothermal fluids in oxidising environment. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the BIF are higher than the maximum 87Sr/86Sr evolution curves for all Archean reservoirs (bulk silicate earth, Archean crust and Archean seawater), indicating involvement of continentally-derived components during BIF formation and alteration. The ƐNd(t) (+ 2.26 to + 3.77) and Nd model age indicate that chemical constituents for the BIF were derived from undifferentiated crustal source, between 3.002 and 2.88 Ga. The variable and diverse O and H isotope data (− 1.9‰ to 17.3‰ and − 57‰ to 136‰ respectively) indicate that the Metzimevin iron ore formed initially from magmatic plumes and later enriched by magmatic-metamorphic-modified meteoric fluids. Mass balance calculations indicate mineralisation by combined leaching and precipitation, with an average iron enrichment factor of > 2.67 and SiO2 depletion factor of > 0.99. This is associated with an overall volume reduction of 28.27%, reflecting net leaching and volume collapse of the BIF protholith."
Broadening participation in STEM through equity-minded high-impact practices: a multimodal systematic review,"High-impact practices (HIPs), such as undergraduate research, first-year seminars, and learning communities, have been shown to generally advance college student success. However, there are often disparities in access, participation, and outcomes between white and racially/ethnically minoritized students. While scholars have critiqued HIPs and provided alternative approaches to better serve minoritized students, we know little about how federally funded programs aiming to broaden participation can serve as a mechanism advance equity. Drawing on the literature, we developed an equity-minded HIP framework to critically examine the prominence and characteristics of 38 programs aiming to broaden participation in undergraduate US STEM education funded by the National Science Foundation. We conducted a systematic examination of multimodal data from the STEM for All Multiplex repository. Findings reveal most programs included only one to two HIPs, with undergraduate research being most prominent followed by internships. Most programs included only a few elements of equity-minded design, such as providing students additional resources and faculty training, and implemented HIPs to include peer and faculty interactions. Last, most programs utilized cognitive, psychosocial, or sociocultural measures to assess the benefits to students. Only a few measured equity-mined outcomes pertaining to institutional change such as policies, resources, and practices. We highlight two exemplar programs and offer recommendations for researchers and funders to more effectively implement equity-minded HIPs to broaden participation in undergraduate STEM education."
Mechanical support for bridge to transplant in an infant with post-cardiotomy end-stage heart failure and complete heart block: report of a case,"The patient was diagnosed with perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD). She underwent VSD closure and muscle bundle resection across right ventricular outflow tract at the age of 3 months. Since then, she had suffered from severe heart failure and complete heart block. Permanent pacemaker generator was implanted in the left hypochondrium. She was depended on continuous catecholamine administration, so transferred to our hospital for further management. On arrival, her body weight was 5686 g (− 2.7 SD). She underwent Excor pediatric left ventricular assist device implantation at the age of 9 months. Because the position of the left ventricular assist device cannula interfered with the pacemaker, herein, the pacemaker pocket was newly created in the left thoracic cavity. An 1 mm in thickness of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene sheet was trimmed and sutured under the anterolateral wall of left thoracic cavity as a pacemaker pocket. Bipolar ventricular lead was sutured on left ventricular apex and basal wall to face each other, mimicking cardiac regeneration therapy. Even though she unfortunately required right diaphragmatic plication for iatrogenic phrenic nerve palsy, her respiratory function was well maintained; therefore, secondary right heart failure was not observed. Her cardiopulmonary function was quite stable until post-operative day 275 when the patient was transferred to another hospital for heart transplantation."
The transnational prosocial activities of elite African footballers: an exploratory study of the costs and the benefits,"This paper explored the costs and the benefits of elite African players’ prosocial activities in their home countries. Through the players’ Twitter and Instagram posts and qualitative interviews, their prosocial activities were examined with regard to the costs and benefits for their career and life courses. The findings show that African players’ transnational prosocial acts are both altruistic (placing costs) and mutualistic (generating benefits). This exploratory paper adds to the existing literature by pointing out both the material and non-material consequences of players’ transnational social responsibility activities. Further, it reveals the complex implications of these practices. For example, while participation in the national team is often viewed primarily from the perspective of positive and beneficial contributions to players’ careers, it may also pose a very significant cost to African players, as they risk jeopardising their club careers. The practical implication of this study is that football governing bodies need to do more to eliminate administrative practices that discriminate against players based on their nationality and also ensure that African players who choose to honour national team duties are protected from undue disadvantages at their clubs arising from their international duties."
Effects of spectators on the performance of a dance routine,"Sports like dancing and gymnastics are often performed in front of an audience. It is therefore an important question whether spectators help or hinder movement execution. Previous research suggests that the influence of spectators on motor performance depends on the type of task, with condition-based tasks being facilitated, and coordination-based tasks being inhibited (for a recent review, see van Meurs, Greve, & Strauss, 2022). We tested a group of female carnival dancers (N = 15, Mage = 19; age range between 15 and 35 years) over the course of a competitive season. The same dance choreography was performed at four timepoints, each time with and without spectators. Dance performances were videotaped and afterwards rated by 7 qualified raters, who were blinded concerning the experimental condition. Raters noted an increased quality of the dance with increasing practice (linear and cubic trend). Concerning social facilitation effects, dance performance was either improved (timepoint 2) or unchanged (timepoints 1, 3, and 4) in front of the audience. Our results indicate that a complex coordination task like the carnival dance may be facilitated when being watched. Future research should address whether these findings can be replicated in other aesthetic sports (like gymnastics), whether they are influenced by gender, and how individual performances influence the group outcome."

Self-adjuvant Astragalus polysaccharide-based nanovaccines for enhanced tumor immunotherapy: a novel delivery system candidate for tumor vaccines,"The study of tumor nanovaccines (NVs) has gained interest because they specifically recognize and eliminate tumor cells. However, the poor recognition and internalization by dendritic cells (DCs) and insufficient immunogenicity restricted the vaccine efficacy. Herein, we extracted two molecular-weight Astragalus polysaccharides (APS, 12.19 kD; APSHMw, 135.67 kD) from Radix Astragali and made them self-assemble with OVA257−264 directly forming OVA/APS integrated nanocomplexes through the microfluidic method. The nanocomplexes were wrapped with a sheddable calcium phosphate layer to improve stability. APS in the formed nanocomplexes served as drug carriers and immune adjuvants for potent tumor immunotherapy. The optimal APS-NVs were approximately 160 nm with uniform size distribution and could remain stable in physiological saline solution. The FITC-OVA in APS-NVs could be effectively taken up by DCs, and APS-NVs could stimulate the maturation of DCs, improving the antigen cross-presentation efficiency in vitro. The possible mechanism was that APS can induce DC activation via multiple receptors such as dectin-1 and Toll-like receptors 2 and 4. Enhanced accumulation of APS-NVs both in draining and distal lymph nodes were observed following s.c. injection. Smaller APS-NVs could easily access the lymph nodes. Furthermore, APS-NVs could markedly promote antigen delivery efficiency to DCs and activate cytotoxic T cells. In addition, APS-NVs achieve a better antitumor effect in established B16-OVA melanoma tumors compared with the OVA+Alum treatment group. The antitumor mechanism correlated with the increase in cytotoxic T cells in the tumor region. Subsequently, the poor tumor inhibitory effect of APS-NVs on the nude mouse model of melanoma also confirmed the participation of antitumor adaptive immune response induced by NVs. Therefore, this study developed a promising APS-based tumor NV that is an efficient tumor immunotherapy without systemic side effects."
An empirical study of task infections in Ansible scripts,"Despite being beneficial for managing computing infrastructure at scale, Ansible scripts include security weaknesses, such as hard-coded passwords. Security weaknesses can propagate into tasks, i.e., code constructs used for managing computing infrastructure with Ansible. Propagation of security weaknesses into tasks makes the provisioned infrastructure susceptible to security attacks. A systematic characterization of task infection, i.e., the propagation of security weaknesses into tasks, can aid practitioners and researchers in understanding how security weaknesses propagate into tasks and derive insights for practitioners to develop Ansible scripts securely."
Right portal vein ligation is still relevant for left hemi-liver hypertrophy: results of a comparative study using a propensity score between right portal vein ligation and embolization,"In two-stage hepatectomy for bilobar liver metastases from colorectal cancer, future liver remnant (FLR) growth can be achieved using several techniques, such as right portal vein ligation (RPVL) or right portal vein embolization (RPVE). A few heterogeneous studies have compared these two techniques with contradictory results concerning FLR growth. The objective of this study was to compare FLR hypertrophy of the left hemi-liver after RPVL and RPVE."
Risk factors that impact long-term outcomes in sigmoid colon cancer with urinary bladder involvement,This study aimed to identify the risk factors impacting long-term outcomes in patients diagnosed with sigmoid colon cancer with urinary bladder involvement.
Determinants of farmers’ choice for agricultural output marketing channels of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum): an empirical evidence from north-western Himalayan region,"The production of marketable vegetables like tomato is regarded to be a significant income source for farmers in the northwest Himalayan region. The contributory factors that affect tomato crop production and marketing as well as farmer livelihood are the output market channels selection. Therefore, considering the significance of this, the present study focuses on the factors which affects farmers choice of marketing. A multi-stage stratified random sampling procedure was used to select 400 farmers, and the data were collected using a well-structured questionnaire. The multinomial logistic regression model (MNL) was employed to determine the factors influencing farmers’ choice for agricultural output marketing channels of tomato crop. The results revealed that most of the tomato produce transacted through output marketing channels, namely producer—wholesaler—retailer—consumer (44.0%) and producer—commission agent—retailer—consumer (35.5%). The empirical results of MNL indicated that education, farm income, farming experience, distance to market, payment at the time of sale, payment in advance and slow sale were the major factors which are positively significant at 1% significant level influences the farmers choice to sell their tomato produce to wholesaler. Relying on the survey observations, to increase market participation in other channels study indicated that there is a need to improve market infrastructure, such as storage facility, market near farmgate and market information. Therefore, we suggest that the government and related stakeholders should focus on strengthening and promoting collective action through cooperative societies, farmers producer organisations, and development of competitive market in the study area."
Using knowledge units of programming languages to recommend reviewers for pull requests: an empirical study,"Determining the right code reviewer for a given code change requires understanding the characteristics of the changed code, identifying the skills of each potential reviewer (expertise profile), and finding a good match between the two. To facilitate this task, we design a code reviewer recommender that operates on the knowledge units (KUs) of a programming language. We define a KU as a cohesive set of key capabilities that are offered by one or more building blocks of a given programming language. We operationalize our KUs using certification exams for the Java programming language. We detect KUs from 10 actively maintained Java projects from GitHub, spanning 290K commits and 65K pull requests (PRs). We generate developer expertise profiles based on the detected KUs. We use these KU-based expertise profiles to build a code reviewer recommender (KUREC). We compare KUREC’s performance to that of seven baseline recommenders. KUREC ranked first along with the top-performing baseline recommender (RF) in a Scott-Knott ESD analysis of recommendation accuracy (the top-5 accuracy of KUREC is 0.84 (median) and the MAP@5 is 0.51 (median)). From a practical standpoint, we highlight that KUREC’s performance is more stable (lower interquartile range) than that of RF, thus making it more consistent and potentially more trustworthy. We also design three new recommenders by combining KUREC with our baseline recommenders. These new combined recommenders outperform both KUREC and the individual baselines. Finally, we evaluate how reasonable the recommendations from KUREC and the combined recommenders are when those deviate from the ground truth. We observe that KUREC is the recommender with the highest percentage of reasonable recommendations (63.4%). Overall we conclude that KUREC and one of the combined recommenders (e.g., AD_HYBRID) are overall superior to the baseline recommenders that we studied. Future work in the area should thus (i) consider KU-based recommenders as baselines and (ii) experiment with combined recommenders."
Acute self-myofascial release modulates cardiac autonomic function and hemodynamic parameters at rest and reduces cardiovascular stress reaction,"Self-myofascial release (SMR) is a form of self-massage aiming to release tension, improve blood flow, and alleviate muscle soreness. This study aimed to determine whether a single session of SMR could impact cardiovascular parameters at rest and during a cold pressor test (CPT)."
A robust regression analysis method to determine the significance of trends in concentrations of heavy metals in UK ambient air and improve network design and emission inventories,"A novel application of the Theil-Sen robust regression method for determining the temporal trends in the concentration of heavy metals in UK ambient air over the period 2005–2020 is presented and compared to other regression methods. We have demonstrated improvements over non-robust methods of regression, proving the ability to tease out trends that are small with respect to the variability of the concentration measurement. The method is used to identify, in general, large and significant trends in the concentrations of Ni, As, Pb and V over the period 2005–2020, either across the UK as a whole or at groupings of site classifications in the UK. These trends have been compared to trends in emission data determined in the same manner. Although the results for most metals provide confidence that the UK metal network of monitoring sites is successful in appropriately capturing changes in emissions, a key finding of this work is the disagreement between trends in measured concentrations and emissions for Cu, Mn and Ni, for which we suggest improvements in future network design. The results also indicate that UK emission data for V should be reviewed, as we propose that the rate of reduction of V emissions is likely to have been overestimated."
Ecological and health risk assessment of heavy metals in agricultural soils from northern China,"Soil pollution by heavy metals can cause continuing damage to ecosystems and the human body. In this study, we collected nine fresh topsoil samples and 18 maize samples (including nine leaf samples and nine corn samples) from agricultural soils in the Baiyin mining areas. The results showed that the order of heavy metal concentrations (mg/kg) in agricultural soils was as follows: Zn (377.40) > Pb (125.06) > Cu (75.06) > Ni (28.29) > Cd (5.46) > Hg (0.37). Cd, Cu, Zn, and Pb exceeded the Chinese risk limit for agricultural soil pollution. The average the pollution load index (4.39) was greater than 3, indicating a heavy contamination level. The element that contributed the most to contamination and high ecological risk in soil was Cd. Principal component analysis (PCA) and Pearson’s correlation analysis indicated that the sources of Ni, Cd, Cu, and Zn in the soil were primarily mixed, involving both industrial and agricultural activities, whereas the sources of Hg and Pb included both industrial and transportation activities. Adults and children are not likely to experience non-carcinogenic impacts from the soil in this region. Nonetheless, it was important to be aware of the elevated cancer risk presented by Cd, Pb, and especially Ni. The exceedance rates of Cd and Pb in corn were 66.67% and 33.3%, respectively. The results of this research provide data to improve soil protection, human health monitoring, and crop management in the Baiyin district."
"Emulsion Gels Based on Quinoa Protein Hydrolysates, Alginate, and High-Oleic Sunflower Oil: Evaluation of Their Physicochemical and Textural Properties","This study aims to assess the physicochemical and mechanical properties of O/W emulsion gels formulated with quinoa protein partial hydrolysates (QPH). The effect of varying QPH concentrations (0.5%, 1%, and 2%) on these attributes was also investigated. The QPH were obtained from quinoa protein concentrate (QPC) after treatment with alcalase. Surface hydrophobicity (S0) and emulsifying properties of QPH suspensions were determined. Microstructure, color, water holding capacity (WHC), thermal stability, as well as textural properties of the formulated emulsion gels, were also evaluated. After the hydrolysis treatment, S0 exhibited a significant increase (p = 0.006). The emulsifying activity of QPH also increased (p = 0.002), while the emulsion stability decreased (p < 0.000) as QPH concentrations increased. Confocal laser scanning microscopy images showed that in QPH-based emulsion gels, oil droplets seemed to be more associated with each other forming a three-dimensional network that was less bound to the matrix, in comparison with QPC-based emulsion gels. In addition, hydrolysis produced a significant reduction in WHC of emulsion gels (p = 0.000); however, in all samples evaluated the WHC was around 70%. Furthermore, after heat treatment, there was a decrease in this parameter (p < 0.000). The evaluation of textural properties showed that hardness was significantly lower for emulsion gels formulated with QPH (p < 0.000); whereas no differences between emulsion gels with 0.5% QPC and those with 0.5, 1, and 2% QPH were obtained. Therefore, hydrolysates have the potential to be used in emulsion gel formulation and could be applied to the development of soft-solid food products."
Measuring Impact of Lean Manufacturing Tools for Continuous Improvement on Economic Sustainability,"Using Lean Manufacturing (LM) tools in production processes is crucial for companies’ economic, environmental, and social sustainability success. This study shows a structural equation model (SEM) that shows the relationship between LM Tools like Kaizen (KAI), Gemba (GEM), Value Stream Mapping (VSM) and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) with Economic Sustainability (ECS). Seven hypotheses were evaluated with data from 179 responses to a questionnaire about the Mexican maquiladora industry, showing that these variables are linked. At a 95% confidence level, the model was evaluated using the partial least squares method. The findings indicate that the relationships between KAI and GEM and KAI and VSM have the strongest relationship, followed by VSM and ECS; however, VSM has the strongest effect on ECS. Based on these findings, it is recommended that managers adopt a continuous improvement (KAI) approach based on working directly on the shop floor (GEM and VSM) to support their decisions regarding economic growth (ECS)."

Novel Gluconobacter oxydans strains selected from Kombucha with potential postbiotic activity,"Gastric and colorectal cancer are among the most frequently diagnosed malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract. Searching for methods of therapy that complements treatment or has a preventive effect is desirable. Bacterial metabolites safe for human health, which have postbiotic effect, are of interest recently. The study aimed to preliminary assessment of the safety, antimicrobial, and anti-cancer activity of cell-free metabolites of Gluconobacter oxydans strains isolated from Kombucha beverages as an example of the potential postbiotic activity of acetic acid bacteria (AAB). The study material consisted of five AAB strains of Kombucha origin and three human cell lines (gastric adenoma—AGS, colorectal adenoma—HT-29, and healthy cells derived from the endothelium of the human umbilical vein—HUVEC). Results of the study confirms the health safety and functional properties of selected AAB strains, including their potential postbiotic properties. The best potential anticancer activity of the AAB cell-free supernatants was demonstrated against AGS gastric adenoma cells. The conducted research proves the postbiotic potential of selected acetic acid bacteria, especially the KNS30 strain."
Key factors for the survival of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum IDCC 3501 in manufacturing and storage,"Functional microbiome development has steadily increased; with this, the viability of microbial strains must be maintained not only after the manufacturing process but also at the time of consumption. Survival is threatened by various unavoidable factors during freeze-drying and shelf storage. Here, the aim was to optimize the manufacturing process of the functional strain Lactiplantibacillus plantarum IDCC 3501 after freeze-drying and storage. Explosive growth was achieved using a medium composition with two nitrogen sources and a mineral, and growth was drastically improved by neutralizing the medium pH during the culture of L. plantarum IDCC 3501. Culture optimization involved a smaller cell size, leading to less intracellular free water. Moreover, when maltodextrin (MD) powder was directly added to the harvested cells, some intracellular free water was extracted from the bacterial cells, resulting in a dramatic increase in the viability of L. plantarum IDCC 3501 after freeze-drying and subsequent storage. Furthermore, MD enhanced survival in a dose-dependent manner. Bacterial survival was correlated with lysozyme tolerance; therefore, the positive result might have been caused by the osmotic dehydration of intracellular free water, which would potentially damage the bacterial cells via ice crystallization and/or a phase transition during freeze-drying. These critical factors of L. plantarum IDCC 3501 processing provide perspectives on survival issues for manufacturing microbiome strains."
Are the estimated needs for mental health care among adolescents from different socioeconomic backgrounds met equally in Sweden? A longitudinal survey-registry linkage study,"Evidence of inequality in the utilisation of mental health care (MHC) by adolescents in Nordic countries is mixed. This study aims to investigate if there are socioeconomic differences in the utilisation of MHC, while accounting for adolescents’ mental health status. We analysed a cohort of 3517 adolescents, followed from 7 to 9th grade (ages 13–16), to examine the association between parental socioeconomic position (SEP: education and disposable income), adolescents’ estimated needs, and the utilisation of MHC (defined as visits to secondary psychiatric care or receipt of psychotropic medication). Logistic and negative binomial regression models, with mental health status as moderator, were used to predict utilisation during each grade. Lower SEP predicted higher odds of utilising MHC in adolescents with no/mild symptoms (e.g., odds ratio, OR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.04–1.72, lower vs highest education), but not in those with moderate-to-severe symptoms (estimates close to one and non-significant). This pattern was largely explained by treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder/autism spectrum disorders (ADHD/ASD) in boys. For girls with severe symptoms, lower SEP predicted reduced odds of utilising MHC for other mental disorders (OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.25–0.92, lower education), and fewer outpatient visits when in contact with such care, although non-significant (incidence rate ratio, IRR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.25–1.05, lowest vs highest income). Our findings suggest a more equitable use of MHC for treating ADHD/ASD, but not other mental disorders such as depression and anxiety, particularly among girls."
Comparative Study of Dermal Pharmacokinetics Between Topical Drugs Using Open Flow Microperfusion in a Pig Model,"Accurate methods to determine dermal pharmacokinetics are important to increase the rate of clinical success in topical drug development. We investigated in an in vivo pig model whether the unbound drug concentration in the interstitial fluid as determined by dermal open flow microperfusion (dOFM) is a more reliable measure of dermal exposure compared to dermal biopsies for seven prescription or investigational drugs. In addition, we verified standard dOFM measurement using a recirculation approach and compared dosing frequencies (QD versus BID) and dose strengths (high versus low drug concentrations)."
Dyslipidaemia is associated with Cutibacterium acnes hip and knee prosthetic joint infection,"Optimization of medical factors including diabetes and obesity is a cornerstone in the prevention of prosthetic joint infection (PJI). Dyslipidaemia is another component of metabolic syndrome which has not been thoroughly investigated as an individual, modifiable risk factor. This study examined the association of dyslipidaemia with PJI caused by the lipophilic microbe Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes)."
Extending 3D geometric file formats for geospatial applications,"This study addresses the representation and exchange of geospatial geometric 3D models, which is a common requirement in various applications like outdoor mixed reality, urban planning, and disaster risk management. Over the years, multiple file formats have been developed to cater to diverse needs, offering a wide range of supported features and target areas of application. However, classic exchange formats like the JavaScript Object Notation and the Extensible Markup Language have been predominantly favored as a basis for exchanging geospatial information, leaving out common geometric information exchange formats such as Wavefront’s OBJ, Stanford’s PLY, and OFF. To bridge this gap, our research proposes three novel extensions for the mentioned geometric file formats, with a primary focus on minimizing storage requirements while effectively representing geospatial data and also allowing to store semantic meta-information. The extensions, named GeoOBJ, GeoOFF, and GeoPLY, offer significant reductions in storage needs, ranging from 14 to 823% less compared to standard file formats, while retaining support for an adequate number of semantic features. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate the suitability of these proposed extensions for geospatial information representation, showcasing their efficacy in delivering low storage overheads and seamless incorporation of critical semantic features. The findings underscore the potential of GeoOBJ, GeoOFF, and GeoPLY as viable solutions for efficient geospatial data representation, empowering various applications to operate optimally with minimal storage constraints."
Reconstructing patterns of domestication in reindeer using 3D muscle attachment areas,"The use of reindeer has been a crucial element in the subsistence strategies of past Arctic and Subarctic populations. However, the spatiotemporal occurrence of systematic herding practices has been difficult to identify in the bioarchaeological record. To address this research gap, this study proposes a new virtual anthropological approach for reconstructing habitual physical activity in reindeer, relying on the protocols of the “Validated Entheses based Reconstruction of Activity” (VERA) method. Following blind analytical procedures, we focused on eight muscle attachment sites (“entheses”) in 36 reindeer free ranging in the wild, 21 specimens in captivity (zoo), and eight racing reindeer (habitual runners). Importantly, our analyses accounted for the effects of variation by subspecies, sex, age, and estimated body size. Our results showed clear differences across activity groups, leading to the development of discriminant function equations with cross-validated accuracies ranging from approximately 88 to 100%. The reliability of our functions was additionally confirmed using a blind test involving six zoo individuals not included in the initial dataset. Our findings support the use of the proposed approach for identifying domestication-related activities in zooarchaeological contexts, introducing a valuable tool for locating suspected domestication hotspots and elucidating the nature of past human-reindeer interactions."
"Variability of chemical, mineralogical, and morphological attributes of five soils of the Guabirotuba formation","Problematic soils, such as expansive clay-rich soils, need geological and geotechnical assessments before commencing any construction project. The mineralogical composition of the soil plays a crucial role in determining its physical and chemical behavior, ultimately affecting its stability and susceptibility to erosion. This study analyzed the variability of chemical, mineralogical, and morphological attributes of five soils of the Guabirotuba formation. Samples in different areas of Curitiba and the metropolitan region were collected. Chemical composition by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF), mineralogical composition by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and microstructure by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were determined. The results showed that the five soils have a similar chemical composition, with silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide being the main constituents. The mineralogical composition varied in all analyzed soils. However, they belong to the same geological formation, and certain conditions, such as weathering, pressure, cation exchange, and climate, may differ in their mineralogy. Four of the five soils analyzed showed low expansion capacity due to kaolinite, characterized by low swelling potential and water adsorption capacity. On the other hand, one of the soils presented expansive potential because it did not have the presence of kaolinite in its mineralogical composition. Finally, the variability of soil characteristics changes from one place to another. Although they have similar chemical compositions, the cation exchange and mineralogical composition contribute to the development of several behaviors that can be useful for decision-making about the destination of said soil."
Effect of Gravity Orientation on Flickering Characteristics of Premixed Conical Flame,"Experimental and numerical simulation methods were employed to investigate the effect of gravity orientation on the dynamics of premixed conical flames. The study focused on a typical propane-air flame established on a Bunsen burner, under normal gravity (+ g), reverse gravity (-g), and transverse gravity (⊥g). In the initial phase of the research, flame shapes were examined using flame chemiluminescence imaging. Result shows that gravity orientation has a slight impact on the flame height, and buoyancy caused flame asymmetry in ⊥g case is first discovered. In addition, flame flickering frequencies were collected through heat release signal experiments, and a wide range of data is acquired. Though being affected by the same pattern by equivalence ratio and Reynolds number, the frequencies in ⊥g case are generally lower than those in + g case. Based on this, the research also obtained the new empirical correlation for ⊥g case. For clearer explanations of the flame behavior under different gravity orientations, velocity fields were visualization using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiments and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). Results indicated that the gravity orientation mainly influences the flame through effects on shear layer between ambient air and burnt gas, which cause different forms of K-H instability and vortex shedding motions."
Efficient and accurate numerical-projection of electromagnetic multipoles for scattering objects,"In this paper, we develop an efficient and accurate procedure of electromagnetic multipole decomposition by using the Lebedev and Gaussian quadrature methods to perform the numerical integration. Firstly, we briefly review the principles of multipole decomposition, highlighting two numerical projection methods including surface and volume integration. Secondly, we discuss the Lebedev and Gaussian quadrature methods, provide a detailed recipe to select the quadrature points and the corresponding weighting factor, and illustrate the integration accuracy and numerical efficiency (that is, with very few sampling points) using a unit sphere surface and regular tetrahedron. In the demonstrations of an isotropic dielectric nanosphere, a symmetric scatterer, and an anisotropic nanosphere, we perform multipole decomposition and validate our numerical projection procedure. The obtained results from our procedure are all consistent with those from Mie theory, symmetry constraints, and finite element simulations."
Differential phosphorus acquisition strategies of nine cover crop species grown in a calcareous and a decalcified chernozem,Cover cropping is a strategy to increase soil phosphorus (P) use efficiency in agroecosystems. We investigated adaptations on P acquisition strategies of nine cover crops grown in a calcareous and a non-calcareous chernozem with low available P.
Identifying Detrital and Diagenetic Minerals in Paleosols of the Illinois Basin,"Phyllosilicates are hypothesized to be primarily of pedogenic origin in shallowly buried paleosols (≤3 km depth), regardless of the age of the paleosol. To test this hypothesis, this work evaluates the possible presence of detrital and diagenetic phyllosilicates in middle and upper Pennsylvanian paleosols, collected from three drill cores along a north–south transect in the Illinois Basin. The abundances of 2M1 muscovite, quartz, and K-feldspar are greater in a morphologically immature Protosol from the southernmost core; 1Md illite and interstratified illite-smectite with R1 and R0 stacking orders are more abundant in the more mature Vertisols of the central and northern cores. K-Ar age values of multiple clay-size fractions from each paleosol averaged ~260 Ma in the northern core, 270 Ma in the central core, and 295 Ma in the southern core. While considering the complex tectonic and thermal history of the Illinois Basin, detrital minerals are more abundant in immature paleosols that experienced relatively greater maximum burial depths and thus greater sediment supply whereas illitization in more mature paleosols was probably initiated primarily during protracted burial diagenesis. As the present study found evidence for diagenetic and detrital minerals in clay-size fractions of shallowly buried, deep-time paleosols, caution is advised when using paleosol minerals for ancient climate and environment reconstructions."
Effect of GLIS1 on the Lymph Node Metastasis of Cervical Squamous Carcinoma Based on Transcriptome Analysis,"Cervical cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among female reproductive malignancies, and lymph node metastasis (LNM) represents the major reason for its poor prognosis. In this study, we aimed to identify transcriptome differences in patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) who developed LNM or not and to outline the function of GLIS1 in determining metastatic fate in CSCC. In The Cancer Genome Atlas-endocervical adenocarcinoma project, patients with LNM had shorter overall survival than those without. Transcriptome data from CSCC patients with and without LNM were analyzed to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DEGs were enriched in metastasis-related pathways, such as extracellular matrix organization, cell-cell adhesion, and regulation of tissue remodeling. GLIS1 was overexpressed in tumor tissues of patients with LNM. COMP and ITGA11 were screened as downstream targets of GLIS1. GLIS1 promoted their transcription by binding to the promoter regions of COMP and ITGA11. GLIS1 enhanced the migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in CSCC cells, while the knockdown of COMP or ITGA11 reversed the promotion of GLIS1 on CSCC cell malignant phenotype. Together, our results demonstrate that GLIS1 might be related to the LNM of CSCC patients via COMP and ITGA11."
Nitrate stimulates adventitious rooting by increasing auxin content and regulating auxin- and root development-related genes expression in apple,"Adventitious root (AR) formation is critical for cutting survival and nutrient absorption re-establishment. This complex genetic trait involves the interplay of nitrogen, endogenous hormones, and several key genes. In this study, we treated GL-3 apple (Malus domestica) in vitro shoots with nitrate and ammonium to determine their impact on AR formation, hormonal content, and gene expression patterns. Nitrate treatment significantly promotes adventitious rooting by increasing cell division, differentiation, and AR primordia formation compared to ammonium treatment. Elevated indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), reduced abscisic acid, and zeatin riboside concentrations were consistently observed with nitrate, likely crucial for promoting ARs over ammonium. Furthermore, Malus domestica auxin resistance1  (MdAUX1) expression was induced, increasing IAA levels. MdIAA23 was upregulated. Further results indicate that the higher expression levels of Malus domestica WUSCHEL-related Homeobox gene 11 (MdWOX11), Malus domestica lateral organ boundaries domain gene 16 (MdLBD16), and MdLBD29, and increased cell cycle-related gene expressions, contribute to auxin-stimulated adventitious rooting under nitrate conditions. In conclusion, this study establishes that auxin content and associated genes related to root development and cell cycle contribute to superior ARs in response to nitrate."
"Numerical Investigation for Estimation of Behaviour of Barrier Pillars, Gateroads and Face of a Deep Longwall Mine: a Case Study","Barrier pillars and gateroads play a vital role for the safe exploitation of coal from the panel in the longwall workings. The barrier pillars and gateroads are subjected to the front abutment and side abutment loads during the retreat of the panel. These structures may fail if the developed load on them is higher than their strength. The stability of the longwall structures such as barrier, gateroads and face is paramount in extracting the coal from the panel safely. For this, a deep longwall mine in India is chosen for the study using a 3D numerical modelling technique. In this paper, three critical conditions such as scenario 1 (no side goaved-out panel), scenario 2 (with side goaved-out panel) and scenario 3 (with two side goaved-out panels) are taken. For each scenario, five retreat distances such as 100, 125, 150, 175 and 200 m are considered for detailed investigation. The development of vertical displacement in gateroads, vertical stresses on barriers, vertical stress concentration factor, abutment zone and yield zone for longwall face are extracted and analyzed. Also, the safety factor of the barrier and longwall face is estimated considering the Hoek–Brown rock mass failure criterion. From the study, it is observed that the maximum vertical displacement of 121 mm in TG3 at scenario 3 for a retreat distance of 200 m and a minimum vertical displacement of 33 mm in TG2 for a retreat distance of 100 m at scenario 2. The development of vertical stress on the barrier is found to be between 8.78 and 13.40 MPa, and the safety factor of the barrier lies in between 1.56 and 1.80. The study also revealed that the yield zone at the longwall face lies within 2 to 3 m."
Investigation on the impact of low atmospheric pressure on bubble stability in cement-based materials,"With more infrastructures being built in high-altitude regions, the impact of low atmospheric pressure on the stability of air bubbles in cementitious materials has aroused extensive attention. However, its influence is still inconclusive since it is difficult to isolate the factor of air pressure and study it. To solve this problem, the study investigated the bubble dynamic evolution in cement paste at standard atmospheric pressure (P = 0.1 MPa) and low atmospheric pressure (LAP = 0.8P, 0.6P, 0.4P, 0.2P) and revealed the mechanism of bubble instability under low atmospheric pressure. We established the bubble dynamic evolution equation in cement paste, computed the real-time bubble radius, resultant force, and critical time at different air pressure by MATLAB software. Results show that the maximum resultant force decreases by 50.0–57.7% when air pressure drops from P to 0.2P; both critical time (\(t\)) and radius increment (\(\Delta R\)) increase with the reduction of air pressure and the increase of initial radius. It indicates that when at 0.2P, the resultant force which inhibits bubble expansion is reduced, the time required to prevent bubble expansion increases by 94–137%, and \(\Delta R\) grows 122–140% larger than that at P, and the bubble is more prone to instability and rupture than that at P. The key to improving bubble stability in low atmospheric pressure is to reduce the initial radius of bubbles and increase the strength of the bubble film. This work firstly discovered the impact of low atmospheric pressure on bubble dynamic evolution in cement paste and proposed a new perspective to explore bubble stability at low atmospheric pressure."
Phase Behavior of Isobutane + CO2 and Isobutane + H2 at Temperatures Between 190 and 400 K and at Pressures Up to 20 MPa,"Mixtures containing isobutane, carbon dioxide, and/or hydrogen are found in various industrial processes, green refrigerant systems, and the growing hydrogen industry. Understanding the thermophysical properties of these mixtures is essential for these processes, and depends on reliable experimental data. Making use of an automated static-analytical apparatus, measurements were made of the phase behavior of binary mixtures of isobutane with CO2 and with H2, extending the range of available data for both mixtures. Measurements of the system isobutane + CO2 were carried out along three isotherms at temperatures of (240, 280, and 310) K with pressures from the lower limit of the sampling system (~ 0.5 MPa) to the mixture critical pressure. The results exhibit good agreement with literature data. Measurements on isobutane + H2 were carried out along nine isotherms at temperatures of (190, 240, 280, 311, 339, 363, 375, 390, and 400) K with pressures up to 20 MPa, covering a much broader range of conditions than the one prior investigation. The results have been used to optimize temperature-dependent binary parameters in the Peng–Robinson equation of state with two different mixing rules. This approach was found to perform well in comparison to alternative models."
Human pangenome: far-reaching implications in precision medicine,
"Composition and relative abundance of plastic debris along Manora and Sandspit beaches, Karachi, Pakistan","The surge in plastic debris poses a critical global concern, driven by escalated consumption, accumulation, and enduring persistence in the environment. This study sought to evaluate the composition and relative abundance of plastic debris on Manora and Sandpit beaches in Karachi, Pakistan. Employing 24 transects, each with a fixed length of 100 m and a variable width of 25 m (corresponding to beach width at the sampling site) during the lowest tides, the sampling sites were determined using GPS coordinates. Plastics exceeding 2.5 cm were meticulously collected, then subjected to thorough cleansing, washing, and drying processes. Subsequently, adhering to the OSPAR Guideline for Monitoring Marine Litter on Beaches (2010), the plastics were sorted, enumerated, and categorized into ten predetermined waste categories. The designated transects carried 57.5 ± 44.17 plastic items 100 m-1 and weighed 568.37 ± 432.76 g 100 m-1. Notably, branded plastic items predominated in terms of quantity, typically falling within the size range of 2.5 to 10 cm. The primary source of plastic pollution at these beaches stems from land-based littering, notably from local communities and beach visitors engaged in recreational activities. Contrary to the trend observed in heavily frequented global beaches, the present study unveils relatively low plastic debris on the designated Karachi beaches To safeguard Pakistan’s coastal and marine resources, the study advocates for the adoption of effective waste management practices in the area."
"Spatial–temporal changes of shoreline and Vegetation: Impacts on mangrove cover along the Sundarbans area, Bangladesh","Land use change is a global issue, and different regions of Bangladesh are experiencing land use changes at different scales. The Sundarbans is one of the largest mangrove forests that provide resources to the local communities, act as a sink for CO2, and protect the coastal zone from natural disasters. Sundarbans is also being affected by land use change and deteriorating rapidly, posing a threat to mangroves and wildlife. This is mainly driven by the unplanned expansion of open land, deforestation, and filling up the water bodies. Evaluating the shoreline food web and the interaction of water and land necessitates quantitatively assessing shoreline movement patterns over time. This study aimed to understand the spatial–temporal changes in shoreline and vegetation from 1981 to 2021 considering the mangrove cover along the Sundarbans in Bangladesh. To fulfill the objectives, the Digital Shoreline Analysis System was used to measure the shoreline change, and the vegetation changes were assessed by using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using Landsat satellite data. The analysis of NDVI revealed that the mangrove stress level is increasing rapidly. In the last 20 years, the high-level vegetation has decreased by 5.01%, the moderate level by 9.61% & the low level by 6.99%. Moreover, the shoreline change analysis found that from 1980 to 1990 the erosion was 143.95 sq. km and the accretion was 110.9 sq. km. The findings of this study may help policymakers make informed decisions, and improve their plans for the sustainable development of the region."
"The effect of intra-nasal co-treatment with insulin and growth factor-rich serum on behavioral defects, hippocampal oxidative-nitrosative stress, and histological changes induced by icv-STZ in a rat model","Impaired insulin and growth factor functions are thought to drive many alterations in neurodegenerative diseases like dementia and seem to contribute to oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Recent studies revealed that nasal growth factor therapy could induce neuronal and oligodendroglia protection in rodent brain damage induction models. Impairment of several growth factors signaling was reported in neurodegenerative diseases. So, in the present study, we examined the effects of intranasal co-treatment of insulin and a pool of growth factor-rich serum (GFRS) which separated from activated platelets on memory, and behavioral defects induced by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (icv-STZ) rat model also investigated changes in the hippocampal oxidative-nitrosative state and histology. We found that icv-STZ injection (3 mg/kg bilaterally) impairs spatial learning and memory in Morris Water Maze, leads to anxiogenic-like behavior in the open field arena, and induces oxidative-nitrosative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal/oligodendroglia death in the hippocampus. GFRS (1µl/kg, each other day, 9 doses) and regular insulin (4 U/40 µl, daily, 18 doses) treatments improved learning, memory, and anxiogenic behaviors. The present study showed that co-treatment (GFRS + insulin with respective dose) has more robust protection against hippocampal oxidative-nitrosative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal/oligodendroglia survival in comparison with the single therapy. Memory and behavioral improvements in the co-treatment of insulin and GFRS could be attributed to their effects on neuronal/oligodendroglia survival and reduction of neuroinflammation in the hippocampus."
Thermodynamic Analysis of Sulfurization of Ferronickel,"The demand for nickel for batteries is increasing rapidly with the rapid development of new energy vehicles. Currently, many companies are glad to produce ferronickel alloys from laterite nickel ore due to the gradual exhaustion of sulfide ore. However, there is still little research on the thermodynamical analysis of sulfurization from ferronickel into nickel matte to produce nickel sulfate. Therefore, the thermodynamic analysis on the sulfurization of ferronickel using FactSage was investigated in this study. The results indicate that the overall sulfurization path of iron is Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe → FeS and that of nickel is NiO → Ni → Ni3S2 under oxygen-containing smelting conditions. Nickel has a stronger affinity for S than Fe but has a weaker affinity for O than Fe. Nickel and iron can be separated by controlling the smelting conditions with about 1.0 × 10−2.5 atm < PO2 < 1.0 × 10−2.5 atm and 1.0 × 10−2.5 atm < PSO2 < 1.0 × 100.3 atm. Sulfurizing reagents FeS2, NiS, NiS2, and S2 can sulfurize ferronickel under specific condition. Nickel-rich matte can fuse ferronickel, but it can only be a transition process of sulfurizing ferronickel. This study reveals the phase transition paths of ferronickel during smelting sulfurization. It illustrates the sulfurizing behavior of different sulfurizing reagents. The results provide useful reference methods for consolidating the connection between laterite ore and the new energy industry."
Mineralization Behavior and Strengthening Mechanism of Limonitic Laterite Ore Sintering Process Enhanced by Calcined Lime Coating,"The dehydration process of limonitic laterite ore consumes a lot of heat, which seriously affects the sintering performance and increases the solid fuel consumption of sintering. In this paper, the sintering performance and mechanism of limonitic laterite ore strengthened by a coating with calcined lime was studied. The results show that, when the coating proportion of calcined lime increased from 0% to 100%, the yield, tumble strength, and utilization coefficient of the sinter increased by 14.55%, 24.17%, and 20.43%, respectively, and the solid fuel consumption decreased by 13.47%, which means that CO2 emissions were significantly down. Mineralogical analysis shows that the microstructure of the sinter was significantly improved by the calcined lime coating. The structure of the sinter changed from large-pore thin-walled to small-pore thick-walled and the porosity decreased from 43.47% to 30.12%, which means that the sinter structure was more densified. The grain size of hercynite grew markedly and the content of silico-ferrite of calcium and aluminum (SFCA) in the liquid phase increased significantly, with the SFCA expanding from the outside to the inside, forming an interwoven structure with the spinel phase, the strength of the sinter was significantly improved. This study provides an effective technology for a high-quality sintering process of limonitic laterite ore."
"Thermodynamic Behavior of the System Water/d-Sucrose/NH4H2PO4 at 298.15 K, and Salting-Out of NH4H2PO4 on d-Sucrose Solutions","The hygrometric method is used to determine new thermodynamic data on water activity and saturated aqueous solution of the water/d-sucrose/ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP) system in a wide range of NH4H2PO4 molality, ranging from 0.1 to 3 mol⋅kg−1, and for various d-sucrose contents from 0 to 4 mol⋅kg−1. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy were used to characterize the solid state. The Pitzer–Simonson–Clegg model (PSC) is used to fit the experimental data of osmotic coefficient obtained from water activities data. The predicted saturated aqueous solutions, with the PSC model, are in good agreement with experimental data. For the concentration inferior to 1 mol⋅kg−1, the negative deviation from ideality was shown with increasing the ADP concentrations. The estimated values of the activity coefficient of d-sucrose, activity coefficient of ADP, and the Gibbs energy of transfer of ADP from water to mixture (water/d-sucrose) show that both ADP and d-sucrose exert significant salting-out effects on the aqueous solution."
Development of an Automated and Scalable Virtual Assistant to Aid in PPE Adherence: A Study with Implications for Applications within Anesthesiology,"Virtual assistants (VAs) are conversational agents that are able to provide cognitive aid. We developed a VA device for donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) procedures and compared it to live human coaching to explore the feasibility of using VAs in the anesthesiology setting. An automated, scalable, voice-enabled VA was built using the Amazon Alexa device and Alexa Skills application. The device utilized voice-recognition technology to allow a touch-free interactive user experience. Audio and video step-by-step instructions for proper donning and doffing of PPE were programmed and displayed on an Echo Show device. The effectiveness of VA in aiding adherence to PPE protocols was compared to traditional human coaching in a randomized, controlled, single-blinded crossover design. 70 anesthesiologists, anesthesia assistants, respiratory therapists, and operating room nurses performed both donning and doffing procedures, once under step-by-step VA instructional guidance and once with human coaching. Performance was assessed using objective performance evaluation donning and doffing checklists. More participants in the VA group correctly performed the step of “Wash hands for 20 seconds” during both donning and doffing tests. Fewer participants in the VA group correctly performed the steps of “Put cap on and ensure covers hair and ears” and “Tie gown on back and around neck”. The mean doffing total score was higher in the VA group; however, the donning score was similar in both groups. Our study demonstrates that it is feasible to use commercially available technology to create a voice-enabled VA that provides effective step-by-step instructions to healthcare professionals."
Deep learning-based channel estimation for wireless ultraviolet MIMO communication systems,"To solve the problems of pulse broadening and channel fading caused by atmospheric scattering and turbulence, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is a valid way. A wireless ultraviolet (UV) MIMO channel estimation approach based on deep learning is provided in this paper. The deep learning is used to convert the channel estimation into the image processing. By combining convolutional neural network (CNN) and attention mechanism (AM), the learning model is designed to extract the depth features of channel state information (CSI). The simulation results show that the approach proposed in this paper can perform channel estimation effectively for UV MIMO communication and can better suppress the fading caused by scattering and turbulence in the MIMO scattering channel."
Analysis on influencing factors of detecting chemical oxygen demand in water by three-dimensional spectroscopy,"This paper focuses on the standard chemical oxygen demand (COD) liquid and studies the impact of pH, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, heavy metals, salinity, and other factors on fluorescence intensity and fluorescence peak positions during the detection of COD in water using fluorescence spectrometry. The influence mechanisms of different environmental factors on fluorescence spectra are also analyzed. Results indicate that pH value affects the fluorescence emission wavelength (Em), resulting in a red shift from 1.5 to 7.2, and a blue shift from 7.2 to 12.3. Nitrate nitrogen can react with organic matter in water to form nitro compounds, leading to a decrease in fluorescence intensity. Salinity has a negligible effect on T1 peak but a relatively large effect on T2 peak. Heavy metal ion concentration has a significant impact on T2 peak, while T1 peak position shifts with an increase in heavy metal ions. This study aims to explore the factors that can impact the detection of COD in water using three-dimensional fluorescence spectrometry, providing references to improve accuracy and practicability for COD detection based on three-dimensional fluorescence spectrometry."
A deep learning based fine-grained classification algorithm for grading of visual impairment in cataract patients,"Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have shown promising potential for the automated screening and grading of cataracts. However, the different types of visual impairment caused by cataracts exhibit similar phenotypes, posing significant challenges for accurately assessing the severity of visual impairment. To address this issue, we propose a dense convolution combined with attention mechanism and multi-level classifier (DAMC_Net) for visual impairment grading. First, the double-attention mechanism is utilized to enable the DAMC_Net to focus on lesions-related regions. Then, a hierarchical multi-level classifier is constructed to enhance the recognition ability in distinguishing the severities of visual impairment, while maintaining a better screening rate for normal samples. In addition, a cost-sensitive method is applied to address the problem of higher false-negative rate caused by the imbalanced dataset. Experimental results demonstrated that the DAMC_Net outperformed ResNet50 and dense convolutional network 121 (DenseNet121) models, with sensitivity improvements of 6.0% and 3.4% on the category of mild visual impairment caused by cataracts (MVICC), and 2.1% and 4.3% on the category of moderate to severe visual impairment caused by cataracts (MSVICC), respectively. The comparable performance on two external test datasets was achieved, further verifying the effectiveness and generalizability of the DAMC_Net."
Improvement of maximum power point tracking in photovoltaic arrays in different environments using hybrid algorithms,"When the photovoltaic (PV) system is generating PV power, the partial shading (PS) condition will cause multiple peaks in the power-voltage curve, and changes in light intensity and ambient temperature will cause the curve to shift. Traditional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods, such as the incremental conductance (INC) method, have the problem of being trapped in the local optimal solution. Biomimetic optimization algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), have problems with oscillation and low tracking efficiency near the global maximum power point (GMPP). As a result, a hybrid algorithm CS-INC based on the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm and the perturb and observe (P&O) approach is proposed in this study. The light intensity remains constant, the light intensity changes in steps, and the partial shade scenario are simulated. Simulation results show that the MPPT improves accuracy, speed, and stability."
Mental health among children with and without reading difficulties,"This study explored the relationship between mental health, i.e., depression and anxiety, and reading difficulties (RD) in Chinese elementary school children. Participants were 1535 grades 3, 4, and 5 students from three elementary schools in Xi’an, China. Children with and without RD were compared to their depression and anxiety. Additionally, children’s self-ratings, parents’ ratings, and teachers’ ratings of depression and anxiety were compared to better understand mental health issues of Chinese children with RD. The findings showed that Chinese children with RD experienced more depression but not anxiety compared to their typically developing peers across all three grade levels. Reports from all three informants consistently reflected that children with RD experienced more depression. However, some inconsistencies were found between self-reported levels of depression and anxiety and the observations made by parents and teachers. Children reported experiencing more depression than their parents and teachers observed but less anxiety than their parents reported. This study emphasizes the importance of understanding the links between RD and mental health and the need for appropriate intervention programs to help children with RD cope with the mental health challenges."
Treatment of depressed skull fractures with vacuum devices in the neonatal period: A case series,The management of depressed skull fractures in infants can be either conservative or surgical. This study aimed to examine the outcomes of management with a negative-pressure vacuum device on depressed skull fractures in newborns.
Analysis of Green Economic Efficiency and Influencing Factors: Based on the Innovation Output and Spatial Spillover Perspective,"This paper uses the Super-SBM model with undesirable outputs to calculate provincial green economic efficiency and characterize its dynamic evolution using kernel density estimation. Then, we analyze the overflow effects of innovation output on green economic efficiency by the spatial Dubin model. The green economic efficiency is rising, with the spatial feature of high in the east and south and lower in the west and north. The kernel density distribution curve is moving to the right on the whole, suggesting an improvement in green economy efficiency. The peak value first rises and then decreases, indicating that the growth rate has gone through a process of fast to slow. The double peak state is evident, indicating that the efficiency differences between provinces are increasing. The influence of innovation output on green economic efficiency is significantly positive, with an apparent spillover effect. The spatial spillover effects of economic level, industry structure, environmental regulation, openness, and government support are also significant."
Transforming Talent Development: a Reflective Analysis of the Innovative Government-School Cooperation Model Under the Paradigm of Knowledge Innovation,"In the fiercely competitive academic landscape, universities face the imperative to thrive through governmental support and cooperative models for talent development. This trilateral collaboration, involving government, enterprise, and educational institutions, synchronizes talent development with industry standards, resolves talent shortages, and fosters mutual benefits. Proactive collaboration with advanced enterprises is essential to stimulate students’ proactiveness and elevate employment rates. The deepening collaboration among government, businesses, and educational institutions enhances employment opportunities for graduates. This study advocates for talent cultivation within government-business-educational institution cooperative universities, aligning with societal development needs. It offers valuable insights into academia-industry dynamics in the knowledge economy. Our research introduces cognitive graphs as a dynamic tool for knowledge comprehension and memorization, contributing significantly to the scholarly discourse. The cognitive graph-based approach introduces a structured framework for talent cultivation, enhancing students’ learning experiences. Recommendations include raising stakeholder awareness and deeper integration of cognitive graphs into pedagogical strategies. This research enriches the existing literature and offers practical recommendations for universities and educational institutions. In the context of China’s economic restructuring, the imperative lies in the cultivation of talent through a tripartite partnership. Cognitive graphs serve as invaluable tools, guiding students along the correct learning trajectory. The talent cultivation model of government-enterprise-school cooperative universities, integrating cognitive graphs, yields students with heightened learning abilities while maintaining a cost-effective structure. Theoretical implications highlight the importance of innovative teaching methodologies and personalized learning. The successful application of cognitive graphs as a knowledge integration tool underscores their value in enhancing students’ ability to think systematically and creatively. The analysis of shortcomings in traditional cooperation models emphasizes the need for a comprehensive theoretical framework. Managerial implications stress the importance of adopting a cognitive graph-based approach in collaborative talent cultivation. Enterprises can benefit from actively participating in collaborative talent development. Enhancing cooperation awareness and commitment among stakeholders is crucial for creating a conducive environment for talent development."
The Effects of Informal Competition on Manufacturing Firm Productivity in Ethiopia,"This study investigates the effect of informal competition on labor productivity measured by value added per total fulltime workers and capacity utilization rates of manufacturing firms in Ethiopia. A combination of cross-sectional and panel regression methods are employed to investigate the relationships using the 2011 and 2015 Ethiopian Enterprise Surveys data. Both methods show that informal competition is significantly associated with lower labor productivity and capacity utilization rates. The effects are bigger in larger firms than in smaller ones which is a disincentive to firm growth. However, firms facing informal competition tend to engage in innovation practices such as improving production and marketing methods to mitigate the challenge. The findings suggest that the responsible government institutions such as Competition and Consumers’ Protection Authority, Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Industry, and Police and Justice should exert more effort to reduce the malpractices of informal competitors. Efforts to formalize informal competitors by improving access to credit access, training, working and selling places, and tax exemptions could also help to overcome the challenge sustainably. Firms should also increase advertising to decrease the demand for counterfeit products by improving consumers’ knowledge about the firms’ original product characteristics."
Decadal changes in the intraseasonal variability of intensity and location of East Asian polar-front jet around 2000 and associated mechanisms,"The East Asian jet stream is an important component of mid-high latitude circulation systems, and its intraseasonal oscillation plays a crucial role in the formation and development of persistent climate anomalies and extreme events over East Asia–Pacific region. This study examines the decadal changes in the intraseasonal variability (ISV) of the East Asian jet stream and investigates the possible reasons with reanalysis and observational datasets. It is found that the zonal winds over East Asia show notable ISV with a significant period of 10–25 days. The variance of 10–25-day filtered East Asian zonal winds exhibits a significant decrease around 2000, which is mainly contributed by the weakened ISV of westerlies within the key region of East Asian polar front jet (EAPJ). Further analysis reveals that the EAPJ experienced remarkable ISV changes in both intensity and location. The ISV of EAPJ intensity was weakened around 2000 due to decreased frequencies of both the extremely strong and weak cases, whereas the ISV of EAPJ location was evidently enhanced, with the southward shifts increased more than the northward ones. Along with the ISV increase (decrease) of EAPJ intensity (location), the dominant mode of EAPJ intraseasonal variation has changed from its intensity change to position shift since the year 2000. The decadal ISV changes and mode transition of EAPJ are closely associated with the modulation of lower-level large-scale circulation over Eurasia. The weakened ISV of meridional winds over Ural region after 2000 is favorable for an intraseasonal circulation pattern change from a continental-scale cyclonic anomalous pattern to a meridional dipole structure across the Eurasia in lower troposphere, resulting in regime shifts of East Asian temperature and its meridional gradient through temperature advection. The intraseasonal temperature gradient patterns display ISV changes parallel to those of EAPJ around 2000, indicating that the thermal anomalies are effective in leading to corresponding intensity and location variations of EAPJ via thermal wind relationship. Furthermore, the modulation of lower-level circulation is closely related to strengthened Arctic warming and weakened temperature variability over Barents sector after 2000, which may further be linked to sea ice reduction in the Barents Sea."
Electrochemical modification of the carbon material surface by hydroxyl groups,"Electrochemical pretreatment has attracted increasing attention due to its simplicity, sensitivity, efficiency, and low cost. In this work, the effect of anodic and cathodic pretreatment on the selective formation of surface oxygen functional groups (OFG) was studied on activated carbon materials based on walnut shells. The pretreatment consisted in the application of three modes — cyclic, potentiostatic, and galvanostatic. To compare the effect of the electrolyte solution nature on the formation of OFG, three strong electrolytes were used, i.e., 1 M H2SO4, 1 M Na2SO4, and 1 M NaOH, and three weak electrolytes, i.e., oxalic acid, citric acid, and EDTA. The changes in morphological characteristics and elemental composition after pre-oxidation and reduction were analyzed by SEM and EDX methods. The study by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods revealed that anodic modification of carbon materials under 1 M H2SO4, 1 M Na2SO4, and 1 M NaOH conditions leads to the formation of surface oxygen groups, while modification in cathodic regions does not increase the surface oxygen content. Electrochemical modification using weak electrolytes both at cathodic and anodic modification leads to physical and chemical adsorptions of oxidation and reduction products. During electrochemical modification in the anodic galvanostatic mode under 1 M H2SO4, 1 M Na2SO4, and 1 M NaOH, oxidation of the carbon material surface occurs, which leads to the formation of surface quinone groups, confirmed by CV and EIS methods. For quantitative and qualitative assessments of the efficiency of anodic galvanostatic mode for the formation of quinone groups on the carbon material surface, the adsorption indicator method was used for the first time, which showed an increase of 8–10 times compared to the initial carbon material."
Microstructure and Texture of Ultra-High Purity Copper under Changed Rolling Strain Paths and Subsequent Recrystallization Annealing,"For advanced integrated circuits semiconductor chip, the uniformity of microstructure and texture is increasingly required for copper target material of ultra-high purity (≥99.9999%). To this end, well-customized rolling and annealing routes for the raw material of Cu are highly needed. In the study, unidirectional rolling (UR) and cross rolling (CR) were utilized in processing the supplied Cu, both with 50, 70, and 90% thickness reduction, respectively. The rolled samples then underwent identical annealing at 300°C for 60 min. The rolled and recrystallized microstructure and texture were characterized by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Results showed that the CR samples exhibited severer grain fragmentation, more homogeneous microstructure and weaker texture than the UR samples, especially for the samples of 90% thickness reduction. Moreover, dynamically recrystallized grains were observed in both UR and CR samples with 90% thickness reduction due to the raised temperature during severe plastic deformation. Thanks to the more uniform deformation, the annealed CR samples enjoyed finer grains of more random textures than the annealed UR ones. Therefore, cross rolling is preferable for imparting Cu sputtering targets with the required uniformity."
Microstructural Evolution and Mechanical Behavior of SP-700Ti Alloy during Superplastic Deformation,"In this paper, the superplastic behavior of SP-700 alloy (Ti–4.5Al–3V–2Mo–2Fe) was investigated by hot compression tests and hot tensile tests in the temperature range of 700–950°C and strain rates of 0.001 to 1 s–1. The microstructural analysis and mechanical behavior of the alloy were studied during superplastic deformation. Although the elongation became higher than 370% at 700°C, the alloy showed a relatively high work hardening. At 750 and 800°C, the typical superplasticity was occurred and the specimens endured a large elongation of 427–440%. Microstructure of the alloy in 700–800°C was mainly consisted of globular α phase, while the globular α phase was completely removed in the tip fracture of the specimen deformed at 850°C due to deformation-induced transformation. In the temperature range of 850–950°C, the elongation was decreased to 250–325% as a consequence of the removal of α phase, significant β grain growth, and crack formation along β/β grain boundaries. The maximum elongation of 440% was obtained at 800°C where the strain-rate sensitivity is equal to 0.38 which is accommodated by the m-value distribution map of the alloy. During superplastic deformation in the single β phase region, the Rachinger grain boundary sliding (GBS) mechanism is the dominant phenomenon. However, deformation in the dual-phase α/β region is encouraged by dynamic recrystallization (DRX) and decomposition of α colonies."
Microstructure Characteristic and Evolution Mechanism of Cu–Ni–P Alloys under Different Cooling Rate,"The microstructure characteristics at different cooling rates and phase extraction treatments of Cu–34.1Ni–4.5P ingots were discussed in this paper. It was found that Cu–34.1Ni–4.5P ingots were composed of Cu and multiple Ni–P phases, including NiP, Ni5P2, Ni5P4 and Ni12P5. With the cooling rates decreasing from 1710 to 52 K/s, the growth of Ni–P dendrites during the solidification process would be gradually taken place, resulting in the coarsening of Ni–P phases to some extent. It was observed that the average ligament width of Ni–P grains was 1.64 μm with cooling rates as 1710 K/s which was 33% lower than 52 K/s, meaning that the lamellar spacings would also been significantly decreased with the increase of solidification rates. Furthermore, a bulk self-supporting porous Ni–P skeleton materials with hierarchical structure were obtained by dealloying of Cu–34.1Ni–4.5P precursor alloys. Meanwhile, the corresponding mechanism for the formation of Ni–P with skeleton structure was also disscussed."
Ti-Alloying Effect on Crystallization Behavior of Zr72.5Al10Fe17.5 Metallic Glass,"To develop metallic glass composites for practical applications, modulating the crystallization behavior of metallic glasses is an effective and important avenue, as confirmed by previous literature. Here, an obvious change in the crystallization behavior of Zr72.5Al10Fe17.5 metallic glass was demonstrated with a minor mount of Ti dopant. Specifically, when a low concentration of Ti (even as low as 0.5 at %) was doped into the Zr72.5Al10Fe17.5 base alloy, the originally single crystallization event, corresponding to the formation of α-Zr, Zr6Al2Fe, and FeZr2 phases, distinctly separated into two events, Zr6Al2Fe and α-Zr + FeZr2. As the Ti dopant concentration increased to x = 4.0, the primary phase of the Zr6Al2Fe seems to be exchanged with the α-Zr phase, accompanied by the crystallization interval of the two crystallization events gradually increasing, even up to 110 K at x = 4.0. This change in the separated crystallization event and the interval of the currently studied alloys were determined to be associated with their solidification process and the activation energy of each crystallization event."
Effect of Phase Formation on Mechanical Properties of the Joint AA6061 to AA2024 by TLP,"In this research, diffusion bonding was employed to joint AA2024 and AA6061 alloys. To select the alloy material of the interlayer, the atomic diffusion of tin, zinc, and gallium elements was modeled at a concentration of 90.1 wt % in pure aluminum. According to the modeling results, tin was selected as the main element of the interlayer alloy. Diffusion bonding was carried out in a tube furnace at a heating rate of 5°C/min under vacuum (7.5 × 10–3 Torr) and the temperature of 453°C for 210 min for Sn–5.3Ag–4.6Bi interlayer. This experiment was performed considering one interlayer with different thicknesses (20, 50, and 70 µm). Joints were assessed by SEM, and elemental mapping. Ag3Al, Mg45Al40Ag15 inter-metallic compounds, Sn-rich in solid solutions, and Sn + Cu6Sn5 phase were formed at the joint site of the interlayer. The maximum tensile strength of the samples with a joint thickness of 20 µm was 52 MPa after 210 min. By the increase of the Sn–5.3Ag–4.6Bi interlayer thickness (20–70 µm), the average unit tensile stress showed a decline. The effect of the interlayer thickness (20, 50, 70 µm) was investigated on the hardness, strength, and particle size as well as the joint phases."
Effect of Cold-Drawing Deformation on the Microstructure and Properties of AA2024-T8,"T8 treatment includes solution treatment, cold working and artificial aging treatment. T8 treatment can greatly improve the hardness and strength of 2024 aluminum alloy without reducing the corrosion resistance. The effect of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4% cold-drawing deformation on the microstructures of the alloy was observed by transmission electron microscopy, and properties of the alloy was investigated by hardness tests, tensile tests and electrochemical corrosion tests. The results show that the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of cold-drawing deformed 2024 aluminum alloy are better than those of non-deformed alloy. Compared with AA2024-T6, AA2024-T8 with 2% cold-drawing deformation has a higher hardness by 11.3%, and a higher tensile strength by 10.8%. The improvement of the properties of AA2024-T8 is mainly due to the interaction between dislocations and precipitates. With the increase in cold-drawing deformation, the nucleation points of precipitates in AA2024-T8 gradually increase, and precipitates are gradually coarsened under the same artificial aging treatment."
Effect of Self-Inoculation Treatment on Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Eutectic Al–Si Alloy,"Eutectic Al–Si alloy was self-inoculated by spheroidized Al–12.6Si alloy. The microstructure and mechanical properties of self-inoculated eutectic Al–Si alloy were observed by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and the universal tensile testing machine. The results show that the area fraction of α‑Al phase in eutectic Al–Si alloy increased first and then decreased with an increase in the added amount of the inoculant at 700°C. When the added amount of inoculant was 0.4 wt %, the area fraction of the α-Al phase in the eutectic Al–Si alloy also increased first (to a maximum of 30.9%) and then decreased with increasing temperature. Also the eutectic silicon transformed from coarse needle flakes into fine particles as inoculant was added. And when the added amount of inoculant was 0.4 wt %, the tensile strength and elongation of the alloy reached maximum values and the tensile fracture of the alloy showed ductile fracture characteristics. Therefore, the self-inoculation treatment is an effective method to improve the mechanical properties of eutectic Al–Si alloys."
The Influence of Nickel Addition on Properties of Sn–4.0Zn–0.7Cu Lead-Free Solder,"This research investigated changes in the properties of Sn–4.0Zn–0.7Cu (SZC407) solder alloy after doping with 0.5 wt % Ni. Specimens of SZC407 and SZC407–0.5Ni solder alloys were characterized in terms of chemical composition, microstructure, mechanical properties, and melting point. The results showed that the addition 0.5 wt % Ni had no significant effect on the ultimate tensile strength and elongation of SZC407 solder alloy but the formation of phases of the intermetallic compound (IMC) CuZnNi in the solder matrix increased the microhardness of the alloy. These IMC phases improved the strength of the solder matrix by the dispersion strengthening mechanism. The fracture surface of both solder alloys was typical of the ductile fracture mode. The microstructure of the solder alloy was improved by the distribution in the solder matrix of new CuZnNi IMC phases. However, the addition of 0.5 wt % Ni slightly increased the solidus and liquidus temperatures, pasty range and peak temperature of the SZC407 solder alloy."
Comparative Study of Structural and Opto-Electric Features of Environment Friendly AlSb Screen Printed and Brush Plated Films,"Aluminium antimonide (AlSb) films are an applicable material in opto-electronic and photovoltaic devices. In the present work, AlSb films were successfully coated on glass substrate via economical screen-printing and brush plating methods. Structural, optical, and electrical attributes of these films were characterized by XRD, HRSEM, EDAX, UV–Vis spectrophotometery and a two-probe technique. XRD analysis revealed that obtained AlSb films by both methods have (111) plane as favored orientation with cubic phase structure. EDAX analysis revealed the atomic proportion of Al with Sb was ~1 : 1, which is stoichiometric proportion. HRSEM analysis showed that the surface of AlSb films is layered with sphere-shaped and rough crystals. Numerous pores and large size crystals were observed in the brush plated film as compared with AlSb screen printed film. Via UV–Vis analysis AlSb was established as an indirect optical gap material; with optical band gap value of both type films was observed in close agreement to its theoretical value (1.62 eV). Electrical resistivity measurements via a two probe equipment, semiconducting nature for both types of films were found. Activation energy was also calculated by employing Arrhenius plot."
Effects of Bi Inclusion on Tensile Mechanical Property and Deformation Mechanism of Nanopolycrystalline Fe: A Molecular Dynamics study,"The effects of bismuth inclusion on the mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of nanopolycrystalline iron under uniaxial tensile loading were investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. The analysis of the stress-strain behavior of polycrystalline pure Fe and alloy containing Bi inclusion shows that the Young’s modulus of the latter is lower, the strain into the yield stage is smaller, and the yield strength is significantly decreased. Microscopic analysis of pure Fe polycrystalline and Fe–Bi polycrystalline systems with small grain size shows that the deformation mechanisms of pure Fe polycrystalline systems are mainly grain boundary migration, grain boundary slip and grain twisting, while a limited amount of twinning can be observed. The deformation of Fe–Bi system is accomplished based on the deformation mechanism of pure Fe system combined with the shear slip of atoms in Bi inclusion and adjacent region. Meanwhile, the nucleation and growth of cavity can be observed inside the inclusion."
Eco-Friendly Composite Materials: Enhancing Sustainability with Sugarcane Bagasse Biochar and Polystyrene Resin,"Composite materials play a vital role in enhancing sustainability across various industries. This study focuses on the development of eco-friendly composites through the integration of sugarcane bagasse biochar and polystyrene resin. The composites were prepared by manually mixing sugarcane bagasse biochar and polystyrene resin, followed by a hand-layup process. The composites contained varying biochar content, ranging from 10 to 40%, and were thermally cured and characterized. The hardness tests depicted the reinforcing impact of biochar on the resin matrix, with the pure polystyrene resin exhibiting a hardness value of 244 HB, while the biochar-reinforced composites display a gradual increase, culminating in peak hardness at 371 HRB in the 40% biochar composite. The elemental analysis showed increased carbon content up to 91.30% in composites with 40% biochar, with a lower oxygen content (9.70%). The silicon presence reduced and became undetectable in composites with 30 and 40% biochar, possibly due to alterations during curing. The incorporation of biochar into the resin induced significant shifts and modifications in FTIR peaks, indicating the presence of diverse functional groups, including hydroxyl, alkene, alkyne, carbonyl, and aromatic rings within the composites. Surface examinations conducted via SEM micrographs illustrate a transformation from a smooth and uniform surface in polystyrene resin to progressively rough and improved porous surfaces in composites with higher biochar content. The results from this study highlight the potential of sugarcane bagasse biochar and polystyrene resin composites in various applications, fostering a more environmentally responsible and resource-efficient path."
A New Survey Instrument for Tracking Public Opinion on Social Inclusion,"Social inclusion indicators inform policy advocacy and intervention. However, a critical piece of information is often missing: public opinion. Efforts to enhance social inclusion could backfire if they provoke opinion backlash or intergroup hostilities. In this paper, we explain the importance and nuances of inclusive attitudes and develop an easy-to-use survey instrument that tracks public opinion regarding different marginalized groups and support measures systematically. Using evidence from a representative telephone survey in Hong Kong (N = 1010), as well as a parallel online survey (N = 1000), we demonstrate the multidimensional nature of public attitudes toward social inclusion and our instrument’s excellent psychometric properties and potential for use in various research settings. Although developed in the context of Hong Kong, the survey items can be decomposed and adapted to suit diverse urban societies. By highlighting the importance and complexity of public opinion, we hope to foster a more participatory approach to promoting social inclusion."
Quasilinear Schrödinger Equations With Stein-Weiss Type Convolution and Critical Exponential Nonlinearity in \({\mathbb {R}}^N\),"In this article, we investigate the existence of positive solutions to the following class of quasilinear Schrödinger equations involving Stein-Weiss type convolution"
Brunn–Minkowski Inequality for \(\theta \)-Convolution Bodies via Ball’s Bodies,"We consider the problem of finding the best function \(\varphi _n:[0,1]\rightarrow {\mathbb {R}}\) such that for any pair of convex bodies \(K,L\in {\mathbb {R}}^n\) the following Brunn–Minkowski type inequality holds"
Riemann–Hilbert Problems for Axially Symmetric Null-Solutions to Iterated Generalised Cauchy–Riemann Equations in \(\mathbb {R}^{n+1}\),"The Riemann–Hilbert boundary value problems with Clifford-algebra valued variable coefficients for null-solutions to iterated generalised Cauchy–Riemann equations, which are also so-called poly-monogenic functions, defined over axial symmetric domains of \(\mathbb {R}^{n+1}\), are studied in this context. The integral representation solutions to such problems and their solvable conditions are given. Here, the idea of ours is to use the Fischer decomposition theorems for poly-monogenic functions considered. As an application, the solutions to a Schwarz problem are derived too. Then, the results obtained are extended to axially symmetric null-solutions to perturbed iterated generalised Cauchy–Riemann equations."
On the Dotsenko–Fateev complex twin of the Selberg integral and its extensions,"The Selberg integral has a twin (‘the Dotsenko–Fateev integral’) of the following form. We replace real variables \(x_k\) in the integrand \(\prod |x_k|^{\sigma -1}\,|1-x_k|^{\tau -1} \prod |x_k-x_l|^{2\theta }\) of the Selberg integral by complex variables \(z_k\), integration over a cube we replace by an integration over the whole complex space \({\mathbb {C}}^n\). According to Dotsenko, Fateev, and Aomoto, such integral is a product of Gamma functions. We define and evaluate a family of beta integrals over spaces \({\mathbb {C}}^m\times {\mathbb {C}}^{m+1}\times \dots \times {\mathbb {C}}^n\), which for \(m=n\) gives the complex twin of the Selberg integral (with three additional integer parameters)."
Congruences modulo powers of 2 for restricted partition triples due to Lin and Wang,"In 2018, Lin and Wang introduced two restricted partition triples, whose generating functions are related to the reciprocals of Ramanujan–Gordon identities. Let \(RG_2(n)\) denote the number of partitions triples of n, where odd parts in the first two components are distinct and the last component only contains even parts. Lin and Wang proved some congruences modulo 5 and 7 satisfied by \(RG_2(n)\). They further asked the existence of the infinite families of congruences modulo high powers of 2 for the function \(RG_2(n)\). Utilizing some q-techniques, we prove that such congruence families indeed exist."
Vacancy engineering induced reaction kinetics enhancement of cobalt metaphosphate for pH-universal hydrogen evolution,"Developing efficient pH-universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts is critical in the field of water electrolysis, however, which is severely hampered by the sluggish kinetics in alkaline media. Herein, a ruthenium (Ru) incorporation induced vacancy engineering strategy is firstly proposed to precisely construct oxygen vacancy (VO)-riched cobalt-ruthenium metaphosphate (CRPO) for high-efficiency pH-universal HER. The VO modifies the electronic structure, improves the superficial hydrophilic and gas spillover capacity, it also reduces the coordination number of Ru atoms and regulates the coordination environment. Theoretical calculations indicate that Ru tends to adsorb H2O and H*, whereas VO tends to adsorb OH−, which greatly promotes the H2O adsorption and the dissociation of HO–H bond. Ultimately, CRPO-2 exhibits remarkable HER performance, the mass activity is about 18.34, 21.73, and 38.07 times higher than that of Pt/C in acidic, neutral, and alkaline media, respectively, at the same time maintain excellent stability. Our findings may pave a new avenue for the rational design of electrocatalysts toward pH-universal water electrolysis."
TiO2 nanofiber-supported copper nanoparticle catalysts for highly efficient methane conversion to C1 oxygenates under mild conditions,"The selective oxidation of methane under mild conditions remains the “Holy Grail of Catalysis”. The key to activating methane and inhibiting over-oxidation of target oxygenates lies in designing active centers. Copper nanoparticles were loaded onto TiO2 nanofibers using the photo-deposition method. The resulting catalysts were found to effectively convert methane into C1 oxygenated products under mild conditions. Compared with previously reported catalysts, it delivers a superior performance of up to 2510.7 mmol·gCu−1·hr−1 productivity with a selectivity of around 100% at 80 °C for 5 min. Microstructure characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that TiO2 in the mixed phase of anatase and rutile significantly increases the Cu+/Cu0 ratio of the supported Cu species, and this ratio is linearly related to the formation rate of oxygen-containing species. The Cu1 site promotes the generation of active O species from H2O2 dissociation on Cu2O (111). These active O species reduce the energy barrier for breaking the C–H bond of CH4, thus boosting the catalytic activity. The methane conversion mechanism was proposed as a methyl radical pathway to form CH3OH and CH3OOH, and then the generated CH3OH is further oxidized to HOCH2OOH."
OH regulator of highly dispersed Ru sites on host Pd nanocrystals for selective ethanol electro-oxidation,"The ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) is crucial in direct alcohol fuel cells and chemical production. However, the electro-oxidation of ethanol molecules to produce acetaldehyde and carbon monoxide can poison the active sites of nanocatalysts, resulting in reduced performance and posing challenges in achieving high activity and selectivity for ethanol oxidation. In this study, we employed a dynamic seed-mediated method to precisely modify highly dispersed Ru sites onto well-defined Pd nanocrystals. The oxyphilic Ru sites serve as “OH valves”, regulating water dissociation, while the surrounding Pd atomic arrangements control electronic states for the oxidation dehydrogenation of carbonaceous intermediates. Specifically, Ru0.040@Pd nanocubes (Ru:Pd = 0.04 at.%), featuring (100) facets in Ru-Pd4 configurations, demonstrate an outstanding mass activity of 6.53 \({\rm{A}} \cdot {\rm{m}}{{\rm{g}}_{{\rm{Pd}}}}^{ - 1}\) in EOR under alkaline conditions, which is 6.05 times higher than that of the commercial Pd/C catalyst (1.08 \({\rm{A}} \cdot {\rm{m}}{{\rm{g}}_{{\rm{Pd}}}}^{ - 1}\)). Through in-situ experiments and theoretical investigations, we elucidate that the hydrophilic Ru atoms significantly promote the dynamic evolution of H2O dissociation into OHads species, while the electron redistribution from Ru to adjacent Pd concurrently adjusts the selective oxidation of C2 intermediates. This host–guest interaction accelerates the subsequent oxidation of carbonaceous intermediates (CH3COads) to acetate, while preventing the formation of toxic ⋆CHx and ⋆CO species, which constitutes the rate-determining step."
Three-dimensional porous In2O3 arrays for self-powered transparent solar-blind photodetectors with high responsivity and excellent spectral selectivity,"Transparent solar-blind ultraviolet photodetectors (SBUV PDs) have extensive applications in versatile scenarios, such as optical communication. However, it is still challenging to simultaneously achieve high responsivity, high transparency, and satisfying self-powered capability. Here, we demonstrated high-performance, transparent, and self-powered photoelectrochemical-type (PEC) SBUV PDs based on vertically grown ultrathin In2O3 nanosheet arrays (NAs) with a three-dimensional (3D) porous structure. The 3D porous structure simultaneously improves the transmittance in the visible light region, accelerates interfacial reaction kinetics, and promotes photogenerated carrier transport. The performance of In2O3 NAs photoanodes exceeds most reported self-powered PEC SBUV PDs, exhibiting a high transmittance of approximately 80% in the visible light region, a high responsivity of 86.15 mA/W for 254 nm light irradiation, a fast response speed of 15/18 ms, and good multicycle stability. The In2O3 NAs also show excellent spectral selectivity with an ultrahigh solar-blind rejection ratio of 1319.30, attributed to the quantum confinement effect induced by the ultrathin feature (2–3 nm). Furthermore, In2O3 NAs photoanodes show good capability in underwater optical communication. Our work demonstrated that a 3D porous structure is a powerful strategy to synchronously achieve high responsivity and transparency and provides a new perspective for designing high-performance, transparent, and self-powered PEC SBUV PDs."
In situ reconstruction induced oxygen-deficient multiphase Cu based species hybridized with Ni single atoms as tandem platform for CO2 electroreduction,"Tandem catalysis, capable of decoupling individual steps, provides a feasible way to build a high-efficiency CO2 electroconversion system for multicarbons (C2+). The construction of electrocatalytic materials is one of focusing issues. Herein, we fabricated a single atom involved multivalent oxide-derived Cu composite material and found it inclined to reconstruct into oxygen-deficient multiphase Cu based species hybridized with monatomic Ni on N doped C matrix. In this prototype, rapid CO generation and C–C coupling are successively achieved on NiN4 sites and surface amorphized Cu species with defects, resembling a micro-production line. In this way, the in situ formed tandem catalyst exhibited a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ∼ 78% for C2+ products along with satisfactory durability over 50 h. Particularly, the reconstruction-induced amorphous layer with abundant asymmetric sites should be favorable to improve the ethanol selectivity (FE: 63%), which is about 10 times higher than that of the non-tandem Cu-based contrast material. This work offers a new approach for manipulating tandem catalyst systems towards enhancing C2+ products."
A highoutput PDMS-MXene/gelatin triboelectric nanogenerator with the petal surface-microstructure,"Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has a promising future in the field of energy harvesting and self-powered sensing due to their simplicity in structure, low cost, and efficient energy harvesting from the surrounding environment. The output electrical performance of TENG can be improved by doping the friction material with functional materials and modifying the surface of the friction material. However, the current method of adding functional materials to friction materials is costly and wasteful, and the method of modifying the surface structure of friction materials is cumbersome and not easy to operate. In this work, we present a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-MXene/gelatin triboelectric nanogenerator (PMMG-TENG) based on petal surface-microstructures, which has the advantages of low cost, simple preparation, high output performance, and ecological friendliness. By doping 0.03 wt.% of MXene in PDMS, the output electrical performance of TENG can be significantly improved, with an output current increase of up to 139.7%. Four different petals are used as natural molds to prepare PMMG-TENG. The results show that PMMG-TENG with peony petal surface microstructure has the best electrical performance, and the output current increase of up to 228.17% compared with PMMG-TENG without structure. The PMMG-TENG with peony petal surface-microstructure exhibits excellent electrical performance, demonstrating a maximum open-circuit voltage of 417.39 V and a maximum short-circuit current of 12.01 µA at a size of 3 cm × 3 cm, and a maximum power density of 170 µW/cm2 at a load resistance of 107 Ω. The PMMG-TENG’s output performance after 10,000 cycles is consistent with the initial state, highlighting excellent output stability. The PMMG-TENG can easily light up at least 100 light emitting diodes (LEDs). (operating voltage 3V.) Gelatin film exhibits excellent degradation performance, with complete degradation time of only 150 s in water at a constant temperature of 75 °C. PMMG-TENG not only shows excellent performance in the field of energy harvesting, but also has a broad application prospect in the field of self-powered sensing. This work provides a simple, low cost, natural and green method to significantly improve the output electrical performance of TENG."
In3+-doped Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ cathode with improved performance for an intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,"Promoting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical for commercialization of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs), where Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ (SFM) is a promising cathode by working as a mixed ionic and electronic conductor. In this work, doping of In3+ greatly increases the oxygen vacancy concentration and the content of adsorbed oxygen species in Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5−xInxO6−δ (SFMInx), and thus effectively promotes the ORR performance. As a typical example, SFMIn0.1 reduces the polarization resistance (Rp) from 0.089 to 0.046 Q·cm2 at 800 °C, which is superior to those doped with other metal elements. In addition, SFMIn0.1 increases the peak power density from 0.92 to 1.47 W·cm−2 at 800 °C with humidified H2 as the fuel, indicating that In3+ doping at the Mo site can effectively improve the performance of SOFC cathode material."
Volume-complementary bipolar layered oxide enables stable symmetric sodium-ion batteries,"The commercialization of sodium-ion batteries is based on developing low-cost, highly stable, and safe cathode and anode electrodes. However, the promising hard carbon anode and layered oxide cathode suffer from low sodium-embedded potential near 0.1 V and severe phase transitions, which cause safe problem and short lifespan, respectively. Herein, we design a low-strain bipolar P2-Na0.7Ni0.25Fe0.2Ti0.55O2 to solve the mentioned obstacles, whereas (Ni, Fe) and Ti provide charge compensation when it is used as cathode and anode, respectively. It is revealed that the bipolar layered oxide undergoes solid–solution reaction when used as cathode or anode, and exhibits volume-complementary feature in a sodium-ion full-cell, as identified by in-situ X-ray diffraction. Remarkably, the safe symmetric sodium-ion full-cell exhibits excellent cyclic stability with 91.7% capacity retention after 200 cycles. This work will provide a new horizon for designing safe and stable sodium-ion batteries."
Empirical Predictions for the Mechanical Properties of Nano-Biomass Silica with Chemical and Bio-Admixture Concrete,"The mechanical and microstructural characteristics of the High-Strength Concrete (HSC) for M50 grade and 0.31 as the w/b ratio were evaluated experimentally. A total of 31 mixes were cast with various amounts of polycarboxylate ether (PCE) chemical admixture, 0.9% weight of cement, Bio-Admixture (BA) (10 ml, 20 ml, and 30 ml), and Nano Biomass-Silica (NBS) (6%, 12%, and 18%). At 25% blending, the metrics for strength were at their best. When NBS 12% + 0.9% PCE + 20 ml BA mixing was used, the compressive, split, and flexure strength was improved at all ages. Raman bonds at 709 cm−1 expand with ternary mixed bio-concrete, peaking at higher wavenumbers. These changes are caused by the cement paste's changing chemical environment, which includes broken Si–O (Silicon-oxygen) bonds, a rise in CaCO3 (Calcium carbonate), and a 1690 cm−1 peak for urethane, which is highly present in bio-concrete. The calcite precipitations of bio-admixture mixed ternary admixture blended concrete were confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Urethane presented on concrete is highly durable, and resistant to moisture, chemicals, and thermal shock. Several synergistic equations for the growth of compressive strength were derived from experimental findings. The blending of mineral, chemical, and biological admixtures resulted in differences in the strength over the short- or long-term, which the equations could explain. Regression analysis was also used to build two correlation models for compressive strength and split tensile & compressive strength and flexural strength. These models were confirmed by the anticipated errors, which showed an acceptable range."
"Improving Alkaline Stress Tolerance in Maize through Seed Priming with Silicon Nanoparticles: A Comprehensive Investigation of Growth, Photosynthetic Pigments, Antioxidants, and Ion Balance","Silicon nanoparticles (Si NPs) have long been acknowledged for their ability to enhance plant defense against various biotic and abiotic stresses. Maize (Zea mays L.), among the plants known to accumulate Si NPs, is enhanced under stress conditions like alkalinity. In Pakistan’s soils, sodium (Na+) is a dominant cation, and alkalinity (pH > 7) owing to Na+ salt is a big issue in the soil solution of agricultural soils of Pakistan. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different concentrations of Na2CO3 (0 and 75 mM) on maize seeds, along with varying levels of silicon nanoparticles (Si NPs) seed priming 0, 1.5 mM, and 3 mM over 25 days. The alkaline stress significantly impaired growth parameters, leaf relative water content (LRWC), and the concentrations of photosynthetic pigments, soluble sugars, total phenols, and potassium ions (K+), as well as the potassium/sodium ion (K+/Na+) ratio. However, this stress led to increased levels of soluble proteins, total free amino acids, proline, and sodium ions (Na+), and elevated the activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD) in the stressed plants. Conversely, applying silicon nanoparticles through seed-priming mitigated the growth impediments in stressed plants. This intervention resulted in improved LRWC, higher levels of photosynthetic pigments, soluble sugars, soluble proteins, total free amino acids, and potassium ions (K+). Moreover, Si NPs enhanced the activities of SOD, CAT, and POD enzymes. Si supplementation also led to decreased levels of proline and sodium ions (Na+), which in turn facilitated a more favorable adjustment of the K+/Na+ ratio in stressed plants."
Prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and traditional cardiovascular risk factors in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a real-life evidence from BioSTAR nationwide registry,"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have increased morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities. The association of CV diseases (CVD) and traditional CV risk factors has been debated, depending on patient and RA characteristics. This study aimed to find the prevalence of CVD and CV risk factors in patients with RA. A multi-center cross-sectional study was performed on RA patients using the BioSTAR (Biological and Targeted Synthetic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs Registry) in September 2022. Socio-demographic, clinical, and follow-up data were collected. Myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disorders, congestive heart failure, ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attack were regarded as major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). CVD was defined as the presence of at least one clinical situation of MACE. Group 1 and Group 2 included patients with and without CVD. Prevalence rates of CVD and traditional CV risk factors were the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were the differences in the clinical characteristics between patients with and without CVD. An analysis of 724 patients with a mean age of 55.1 ± 12.8 years diagnosed with RA was conducted. There was a female preponderance (79.6%). The prevalence rate of CVD was 4.6% (n = 33). The frequencies of the diseases in the MACE category were ischemic heart disease in 27, congestive heart failure in five, peripheral vascular disorders in three, and cerebrovascular events in three patients. The patients with CVD (Group 1) were significantly male, older, and had higher BMI (p = 0.027, p < 0.001, and p = 0.041). Obesity (33.4%) and hypertension (27.2%) were the two CV risk factors most frequently. Male sex (HR = 7.818, 95% CI 3.030–20.173, p < 0.001) and hypertension (HR = 4.570, 95% CI 1.567–13.328, p = 0.005) were the independent risk factors for CVD. The prevalence of CVD in RA patients was 4.6%. Some common risk factors for CVD in the general population, including male sex, older age, and hypertension, were evident in RA patients. Male sex and hypertension were the independent risk factors for developing CVD in patients with RA."
Factors Affecting Recurrence and Survival for Patients with High-Risk Stage II Melanoma,"In the current era of effective adjuvant therapies and de-escalation of surgery, distinguishing which patients with high-risk stage II melanoma are at increased risk of recurrence after excision of the primary lesion is essential to determining appropriate treatment and surveillance plans."
Preparation of a highly specific and sensitive monoclonal antibody against tilmicosin and its application in lateral flow immunoassay,"To reduce the false positive results caused by cross reactivity of the antibodies with other structural analogues, it is crucial to prepare a high specificity and sensitivity antibody against target for developing an accurate immunoassay. In this study, tilmicosin (TM) was selected as a model molecule. Firstly, two-dimensional similarity, electrostatic potential energy, mulliken atomic charges and overlapping of different haptens with TM were calculated using Gaussian 09W and Discovery studio, and the newly designed TM-HS was selected as the optimal hapten. Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody (mAb 12C8) was produced with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.36 ng/mL, and negligible cross-reactivity (CR) with other antibiotics. Finally, a lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) for the detection of TM based on amorphous carbon nanoparticles (ACNPs) labeled mAb 12C8 was developed by the reflectance value under natural light. The recoveries of TM ranged from 83.18% to 103.25% with a coefficient of variation (CV) < 12.47%. The results showed that the cut-off value of TM in milk samples was 1 ng/mL, and the limits of detection (LODs) for chicken muscle, bovine muscle, porcine muscle and porcine liver samples were 5.23, 5.98, 6.85 and 7.31 μg/kg, respectively. In addition, 40 real samples were tested by the LFA, and the detection results were consisted with that of high-performance liquid chromatography-UV detector (HPLC–UV). Those results indicated that the developed LFA is an accurate and useful tool for on-site screening of TM in milk and animal tissues."
Codon usage and evolutionary dynamics of genetic diversity of novel imported porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in China,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a problem that has significant economic impact on the global pig industry. In recent years, there has been an increased importation of pork into China, contributing to the emergence of novely imported porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) sub-types. Nevertheless, codon usage patterns and their effects on the evolution and adaptation of these new input PRRSV sub-types in hosts remain elusive. To investigate this, we employed a Bayesian approach to analyze two novel imported PRRSV sub-types, namely, NADC30-like and NADC34-like viruses. These sub-types have different codon preferences. Besides, the Effective Number of Codon (ENC) analysis revealed that both NADC30-like and NADC34-like fall within the expected curve distribution, describing a balanced codon usage for both NADC30-like and NADC34-like virus. Based on the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI), NADC30-like showed the highest similarity to the host, aligning with the main prevalence trend of the host. In contrast, NADC34-like exhibited the highest frequency of optimal codon usage; this analysis is based on Frequency of Optimal Codons (FOP). Moreover, the Relative Codon Deoptimization Index (RCDI) indicates that NADC30-like sub-types have a greater degree of inverse optimization sub-type. These findings suggest that mutational pressure affects codon usage preferences of genes in newly imported PRRSV, and that natural selection plays a vital role in determining PRRSV gene codon preferences. Our study provides new insights into the disease, origin, evolutionary patterns, and host adaptation of these newly imported PRRSV sub-types in China. It also contributes to the development of theoretical frameworks for studying genetics and the evolution of PRRSV."
Development of an Automated and Scalable Virtual Assistant to Aid in PPE Adherence: A Study with Implications for Applications within Anesthesiology,"Virtual assistants (VAs) are conversational agents that are able to provide cognitive aid. We developed a VA device for donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) procedures and compared it to live human coaching to explore the feasibility of using VAs in the anesthesiology setting. An automated, scalable, voice-enabled VA was built using the Amazon Alexa device and Alexa Skills application. The device utilized voice-recognition technology to allow a touch-free interactive user experience. Audio and video step-by-step instructions for proper donning and doffing of PPE were programmed and displayed on an Echo Show device. The effectiveness of VA in aiding adherence to PPE protocols was compared to traditional human coaching in a randomized, controlled, single-blinded crossover design. 70 anesthesiologists, anesthesia assistants, respiratory therapists, and operating room nurses performed both donning and doffing procedures, once under step-by-step VA instructional guidance and once with human coaching. Performance was assessed using objective performance evaluation donning and doffing checklists. More participants in the VA group correctly performed the step of “Wash hands for 20 seconds” during both donning and doffing tests. Fewer participants in the VA group correctly performed the steps of “Put cap on and ensure covers hair and ears” and “Tie gown on back and around neck”. The mean doffing total score was higher in the VA group; however, the donning score was similar in both groups. Our study demonstrates that it is feasible to use commercially available technology to create a voice-enabled VA that provides effective step-by-step instructions to healthcare professionals."
Deep learning-based channel estimation for wireless ultraviolet MIMO communication systems,"To solve the problems of pulse broadening and channel fading caused by atmospheric scattering and turbulence, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is a valid way. A wireless ultraviolet (UV) MIMO channel estimation approach based on deep learning is provided in this paper. The deep learning is used to convert the channel estimation into the image processing. By combining convolutional neural network (CNN) and attention mechanism (AM), the learning model is designed to extract the depth features of channel state information (CSI). The simulation results show that the approach proposed in this paper can perform channel estimation effectively for UV MIMO communication and can better suppress the fading caused by scattering and turbulence in the MIMO scattering channel."
Analysis on influencing factors of detecting chemical oxygen demand in water by three-dimensional spectroscopy,"This paper focuses on the standard chemical oxygen demand (COD) liquid and studies the impact of pH, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, heavy metals, salinity, and other factors on fluorescence intensity and fluorescence peak positions during the detection of COD in water using fluorescence spectrometry. The influence mechanisms of different environmental factors on fluorescence spectra are also analyzed. Results indicate that pH value affects the fluorescence emission wavelength (Em), resulting in a red shift from 1.5 to 7.2, and a blue shift from 7.2 to 12.3. Nitrate nitrogen can react with organic matter in water to form nitro compounds, leading to a decrease in fluorescence intensity. Salinity has a negligible effect on T1 peak but a relatively large effect on T2 peak. Heavy metal ion concentration has a significant impact on T2 peak, while T1 peak position shifts with an increase in heavy metal ions. This study aims to explore the factors that can impact the detection of COD in water using three-dimensional fluorescence spectrometry, providing references to improve accuracy and practicability for COD detection based on three-dimensional fluorescence spectrometry."
A deep learning based fine-grained classification algorithm for grading of visual impairment in cataract patients,"Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have shown promising potential for the automated screening and grading of cataracts. However, the different types of visual impairment caused by cataracts exhibit similar phenotypes, posing significant challenges for accurately assessing the severity of visual impairment. To address this issue, we propose a dense convolution combined with attention mechanism and multi-level classifier (DAMC_Net) for visual impairment grading. First, the double-attention mechanism is utilized to enable the DAMC_Net to focus on lesions-related regions. Then, a hierarchical multi-level classifier is constructed to enhance the recognition ability in distinguishing the severities of visual impairment, while maintaining a better screening rate for normal samples. In addition, a cost-sensitive method is applied to address the problem of higher false-negative rate caused by the imbalanced dataset. Experimental results demonstrated that the DAMC_Net outperformed ResNet50 and dense convolutional network 121 (DenseNet121) models, with sensitivity improvements of 6.0% and 3.4% on the category of mild visual impairment caused by cataracts (MVICC), and 2.1% and 4.3% on the category of moderate to severe visual impairment caused by cataracts (MSVICC), respectively. The comparable performance on two external test datasets was achieved, further verifying the effectiveness and generalizability of the DAMC_Net."
Improvement of maximum power point tracking in photovoltaic arrays in different environments using hybrid algorithms,"When the photovoltaic (PV) system is generating PV power, the partial shading (PS) condition will cause multiple peaks in the power-voltage curve, and changes in light intensity and ambient temperature will cause the curve to shift. Traditional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods, such as the incremental conductance (INC) method, have the problem of being trapped in the local optimal solution. Biomimetic optimization algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), have problems with oscillation and low tracking efficiency near the global maximum power point (GMPP). As a result, a hybrid algorithm CS-INC based on the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm and the perturb and observe (P&O) approach is proposed in this study. The light intensity remains constant, the light intensity changes in steps, and the partial shade scenario are simulated. Simulation results show that the MPPT improves accuracy, speed, and stability."
Enantioselective Fluorescence Recognition of Free α-Amino Acids by Ion-Type Ammonium Salt-Based Sensors,"Optically pure amino acids have extensive applications in pharmaceuticals, pesticides, food, materials, and other fields. Enantiomers recognition of chiral amino acids using optical methods with synthetic chiral sensors has attracted extensive attention. Most reported sensors typically identify guests by covalent or hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interaction with amino acids and their derivatives. In this paper, a series of ion-type quaternary ammonium salt-based enantioselective fluorescent sensors were synthesized for chiral recognition of free α-amino acids via electrostatic interaction. The fluorescence intensity ratios ID/IL (ID, IL, fluorescence intensity of sensor when treated with D- or L-amino acid) were up to 2.1 and enantioselective fluorescence enhancement ratios ef (ef=[IL−I0]/[ID−I0] or [ID−I0]/[IL−I0]. (I0, fluorescence intensity of the sensor)) were up to 5.0. Among them, sensor 3 showed best enantioselective recognition performance toward tryptophan (Trp), and L-Trp significantly quenched the fluorescence of sensor 3, but D-Trp greatly enhanced the fluorescence of sensor 3, its ID/IL was 2.11 and ef was 1.8. The mechanistic investigation by NMR spectrum revealed that a tight three-point interaction, including electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bond, and π-π stacking, between sensor 3 and D-Trp was formed."
SGLT2 Inhibitors for Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction: What Hospitalists Need to Know,
"The effect of intra-nasal co-treatment with insulin and growth factor-rich serum on behavioral defects, hippocampal oxidative-nitrosative stress, and histological changes induced by icv-STZ in a rat model","Impaired insulin and growth factor functions are thought to drive many alterations in neurodegenerative diseases like dementia and seem to contribute to oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Recent studies revealed that nasal growth factor therapy could induce neuronal and oligodendroglia protection in rodent brain damage induction models. Impairment of several growth factors signaling was reported in neurodegenerative diseases. So, in the present study, we examined the effects of intranasal co-treatment of insulin and a pool of growth factor-rich serum (GFRS) which separated from activated platelets on memory, and behavioral defects induced by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (icv-STZ) rat model also investigated changes in the hippocampal oxidative-nitrosative state and histology. We found that icv-STZ injection (3 mg/kg bilaterally) impairs spatial learning and memory in Morris Water Maze, leads to anxiogenic-like behavior in the open field arena, and induces oxidative-nitrosative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal/oligodendroglia death in the hippocampus. GFRS (1µl/kg, each other day, 9 doses) and regular insulin (4 U/40 µl, daily, 18 doses) treatments improved learning, memory, and anxiogenic behaviors. The present study showed that co-treatment (GFRS + insulin with respective dose) has more robust protection against hippocampal oxidative-nitrosative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal/oligodendroglia survival in comparison with the single therapy. Memory and behavioral improvements in the co-treatment of insulin and GFRS could be attributed to their effects on neuronal/oligodendroglia survival and reduction of neuroinflammation in the hippocampus."
Genome-wide identification of wheat ABC gene family and expression in response to fungal stress treatment,"The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family is one of the largest protein families in plants and plays an essential role in addressing biotic and abiotic stresses. Wheat, a vital global grain crop, faces multifaceted safety challenges, primarily from fungal diseases like stripe rust and powdery mildew. In the present study, we identified the whole genome of the wheat ABC family, and 463 nonredundant ABC genes were identified. The ABC family can be divided into nine evolutionary branches and eight subfamilies based on phylogenetic tree analysis. This paper delved deeper into characterizing the gene structure, promoter region, and gene expression within the TaABC family. Segmental duplication was the main reason for the expansion of the TaABC genes. Ka/Ks analysis suggested that most TaABC genes were intensely purified and selected. The collinear analysis of TaABC and other species showed that the ABC genes were conserved in evolution. RNA-seq data and qPCR data from wheat infected with powdery mildew or stripe rust showed that most TaABC genes were induced to change expression. The candidate genes TaABCB15-3B and TaABCG38 exhibited responsiveness to powdery mildew in resistant/susceptible wheat, while remaining unresponsive to stripe rust. Our findings serve as a valuable reference for gaining a deeper understanding of the function and evolution of TaABCs, aiding in the identification of enduring disease resistance genes within the TaABCs of wheat."
Genetic and transcriptomic analyses of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with poor outcomes within two years of diagnosis,"Despite the improvements in clinical outcomes for DLBCL, a significant proportion of patients still face challenges with refractory/relapsed (R/R) disease after receiving first-line R-CHOP treatment. To further elucidate the underlying mechanism of R/R disease and to develop methods for identifying patients at risk of early disease progression, we integrated clinical, genetic and transcriptomic data derived from 2805 R-CHOP-treated patients from seven independent cohorts. Among these, 887 patients exhibited R/R disease within two years (poor outcome), and 1918 patients remained in remission at two years (good outcome). Our analysis identified four preferentially mutated genes (TP53, MYD88, SPEN, MYC) in the untreated (diagnostic) tumor samples from patients with poor outcomes. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed a distinct gene expression pattern linked to poor outcomes, affecting pathways involved in cell adhesion/migration, T-cell activation/regulation, PI3K, and NF-κB signaling. Moreover, we developed and validated a 24-gene expression score as an independent prognostic predictor for treatment outcomes. This score also demonstrated efficacy in further stratifying high-risk patients when integrated with existing genetic or cell-of-origin subtypes, including the unclassified cases in these models. Finally, based on these findings, we developed an online analysis tool (https://lymphprog.serve.scilifelab.se/app/lymphprog) that can be used for prognostic prediction for DLBCL patients."
Roles of astrocytes and prions in Alzheimer’s disease: insights from mathematical modeling,"We present a mathematical model that explores the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, with a particular focus on the involvement of disease-related proteins and astrocytes. Our model consists of a coupled system of differential equations that delineates the dynamics of amyloid beta plaques, amyloid beta protein, tau protein, and astrocytes. Amyloid beta plaques can be considered fibrils that depend on both the plaque size and time. We change our mathematical model to a temporal system by applying an integration operation with respect to the plaque size. Theoretical analysis including existence, uniqueness, positivity, and boundedness is performed in our model. We extend our mathematical model by adding two populations, namely prion protein and amyloid beta-prion complex. We characterize the system dynamics by locating biologically feasible steady states and their local stability analysis for both models. The characterization of the proposed model can help inform in advancing our understanding of the development of Alzheimer’s disease as well as its complicated dynamics. We investigate the global stability analysis around the interior equilibrium point by constructing a suitable Lyapunov function. We validate our theoretical analysis with the aid of extensive numerical illustrations."

"A comprehensive energy, exergy, environmental, and economic analysis of dedicated mechanical subcooled vapor compression refrigeration system","In the modern world, the vapor compression refrigeration (VCR) system is essential in various global applications, including climate control, refrigeration, and food preservation, contributing significantly to energy consumption. The significant energy demands associated with these applications highlight the urgency for sustainable and energy-efficient alternatives that can help diminish our dependence on electrical power. To reduce energy consumption and enhance energy efficiency, a dedicated mechanical subcooled (DMS) system can be integrated with a vapor compression system (VCR) system. This study aims to evaluate and optimize the dedicated mechanical subcooled-vapor compressor refrigeration system (DMS-VCR) system using refrigerant R134a for a 100 kW commercial chiller used for water cooling application. The primary objective is to assess the system from multiple angles which include energy, exergy, environmental, economic analysis (4E’s) and optimizing it to enhance its overall effectiveness to reduce the system’s annual cost. It is thermo-economically optimized, allowing for independent optimization of the evaporator, condenser-1, condenser-2, and sub-cooler components. The proposed system reduces electrical energy consumption by 17.24% and CO2 emissions by 12.4%. The DMS-VCR system outperforms the standalone VCR system. The DMS-VCR system’s annual operating costs are 6.71% lower than an equivalent VCR system, and optimization further reduces costs by 1.88% (case-I: irate = 10%, Ny = 5 years, and toper = 4000 h) and 16.36% (case-II: irate = 2%, Ny = 10 years, and toper = 5000 h).The study underscores the importance of subcooling within the DMS-VCR system, highlighting its desirability as it varies with the recovery factor and annual operation period. As a result of the DMS-VCR system’s better efficiency, design engineers are likely to find it more attractive."
Aging effects on Magnesium–Teflon–Viton related to magnesium hydroxide formation and the weakened bond of polytetrafluoroethylene,"Magnesium (Mg) is one of the promising metal fuels used in various applications such as flares, propellants, and rocket motor igniters. In particular, Mg is often used in the form of compounds or mixtures rather than being used alone. However, Mg is vulnerable to moisture, requiring an extra care in storage. Magnesium–Teflon–Viton (MTV), one of Mg-based mixtures, is expected to lose its combustion performance when exposed to moisture. The relative humidity (RH) conditions gave rise to the formation of an oxide film composed of magnesium oxide (MgO) and magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2), while Mg(OH)2 was decomposed into MgO during the melting of polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon). The dry conditions resulted in the formation of an oxide film composed only of MgO, which did not affect the melting of Teflon as in the RH condition. Moreover, a high-temperature environment intended for accelerated aging disrupted both pre-ignition and subsequent thermal reaction of MTV. Thus, the present work identified the changes in the thermochemical characteristics of MTV and clarified the roles of heat and moisture during such hygrothermal aging."

Tangeretin enhances pancreatic beta-TC-6 function by ameliorating tunicamycin-induced cellular perturbations,"Pancreatic beta cell health and its insulin-secreting potential are severely compromised under the diabetic condition. One of the key mediators of beta cell dysfunction is endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Pharmacological intervention of ER stress and associated complications in pancreatic beta cells may be an effective strategy for the management of diabetes. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of tangeretin, a citrus pentamethoxyflavone, in the alleviation of ER stress and associated perturbations in pancreatic Beta-TC-6 cell lines."

Comparative Analysis of Inhibitor Binding to Peroxiredoxins from Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus and Its Host Citrus sinensis,"The peroxiredoxins (Prxs), potential drug targets, constitute an important class of antioxidant enzymes present in both pathogen and their host. The comparative binding potential of inhibitors to Prxs from pathogen and host could be an important step in drug development against pathogens. Huanglongbing (HLB) is a most devastating disease of citrus caused by Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLa). In this study, the binding of conoidin-A (conoidin) and celastrol inhibitor molecules to peroxiredoxin of bacterioferritin comigratory protein family from CLa (CLaBCP) and its host plant peroxiredoxin from Citrus sinensis (CsPrx) was assessed. The CLaBCP has a lower specific activity than CsPrx and is efficiently inhibited by conoidin and celastrol molecules. The biophysical studies showed conformational changes and significant thermal stability of CLaBCP in the presence of inhibitor molecules as compared to CsPrx. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies revealed that the conoidin and celastrol inhibitor molecules have a strong binding affinity (KD) with CLaBCP at 33.0 µM, and 18.5 µM as compared to CsPrx at 52.0 µM and 61.6 µM, respectively. The docked complexes of inhibitor molecules showed more structural stability of CLaBCP as compared to CsPrx during the run of molecular dynamics-based simulations for 100 ns. The present study suggests that the conoidin and celastrol molecules can be exploited as potential inhibitor molecules against the CLa to manage the HLB disease."
In Vitro and In Silico Studies on 4-Nitroacetophenone Thiosemicarbazone Potential Cytotoxicity Against A549 Cell Lines,"Lung malignancy is a major worldwide issue that occurs due to the dysregulation of various growth factors. Lung cancer has no apparent signs in the early stages, which makes it harder to catch it in time and leads to a higher fatality rate. So, the goal of this work was to create and analyze a novel chemical molecule called 4-nitro acetophenone thiosemicarbazone (4-NAPTSc) against the lung cancer cell line A549 and human non-tumorigenic lung epithelial cell line BAES-2B. The ligand was synthesized by refluxing the reaction mixture of 4-nitro acetophenone and thiosemicarbazide and was further characterized by UV, FTIR, and 1H and 13C NMR and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) study. Cytotoxicity assay/MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl))2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the compound. Epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) were chosen as the target proteins for molecular docking to find potential ligand binding sites and inhibit their function. A novel yellow-colored crystalline solid has been synthesized. 4-NAPTSc had an IC50 of 2.93 μg/mL against the A549 lung cancer cells. When the dosage is increased from 5 to 15 μg/mL along with time, the cell viability falls. Docking results showed that the compound binds with the targeted proteins’ amino acid residues, and the likeness profile of the compound is also favorable. This study reveals that the compound has the potential for further investigation and can be used in multitargeted cancer therapies."
Green Extraction of Carotenoids from Tomato By-products Using Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate,"Tomato peel by-products contain high levels of lycopene, which has traditionally been extracted using organic solvents. This research focuses on the optimisation of a sustainable method to obtain a lycopene-rich extract using the biodegradable anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). A Plackett–Burman experimental design was used to investigate the effect of seven factors on the extraction of carotenoids from tomato peels using sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS volume and concentration, homogenisation intensity and time, sonication phase, extraction time and ultracentrifugation intensity). Based on the responses of total carotenoid extraction, the SDS volume, the use of ultrasound and the extraction time significantly influenced the extraction yield and were selected for optimisation using a Box–Wilson experimental design. The final green extraction protocol (1 g sample + 11.9 ml SDS 0.3%, homogenisation at 13,500 rpm for 2 min, ultrasound phase, agitation for 8.2 h and ultracentrifugation) was selected after quantification of total carotenoids by UV–VIS and HPLC-DAD. Finally, we used nuclear magnetic resonance to demonstrate a high lycopene purity in the carotenoid extract obtained. Furthermore, using transmission electron microscopy, we observed the presence of intact chromoplasts in the extract, protecting the carotenoids from the exposure to external agents. Thus, this work reports an optimised method for the sustainable extraction of carotenoids and demonstrates the viability of the degradable solvent SDS for the extraction of liposoluble bioactive compounds, like carotenoids and mainly lycopene. The lycopene extract could be used for the technological and nutritional enrichment of new foods and/or the design of nutraceuticals."
Accurate solutions of interval linear quadratic regulator optimal control problems with fractional-order derivative,"In this study, the goal is to obtain optimal solutions for fractional interval linear quadratic regulator problems. The major contribution made in this paper is to apply an indirect approach based on the interval calculus of variations with a joint application of constrained interval arithmetic to transcribe the fractional problem under study into a system of Volterra integral equations. To do so, we present the fractional interval Pontryagin’s minimum principle for the extraction of necessary optimality conditions. The obtained conditions are first transformed into a system of Volterra integral equations and then using the Laplace transform method, we solve these equations and obtain the optimal solutions. One of the key points of this method is to keep the continuous form of the problems, which we can change to an equivalent form without discretizing it and proving the existence of its solution. Some numerical examples are carried out to confirm the standard criteria with theoretically accurate results."
TRIOBP modulates β-catenin signaling by regulation of miR-29b in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal and devastating lung disease of unknown etiology, described as the result of multiple cycles of epithelial cell injury and fibroblast activation. Despite this impressive increase in understanding, a therapy that reverses this form of fibrosis remains elusive. In our previous study, we found that miR-29b has a therapeutic effect on pulmonary fibrosis. However, its anti-fibrotic mechanism is not yet clear. Recently, our study identified that F-Actin Binding Protein (TRIOBP) is one of the target genes of miR-29b and found that deficiency of TRIOBP increases resistance to lung fibrosis in vivo. TRIOBP knockdown inhibited the proliferation of epithelial cells and attenuated the activation of fibroblasts. In addition, deficiency of Trio Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (TRIO) in epithelial cells and fibroblasts decreases susceptibility to lung fibrosis. TRIOBP interacting with TRIO promoted abnormal epithelial–mesenchymal crosstalk and modulated the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of β-catenin. We concluded that the miR-29b‒TRIOBP–TRIO–β-catenin axis might be a key anti-fibrotic axis in IPF to regulate lung regeneration and fibrosis, which may provide a promising treatment strategy for lung fibrosis."
Phase Behavior of Isobutane + CO2 and Isobutane + H2 at Temperatures Between 190 and 400 K and at Pressures Up to 20 MPa,"Mixtures containing isobutane, carbon dioxide, and/or hydrogen are found in various industrial processes, green refrigerant systems, and the growing hydrogen industry. Understanding the thermophysical properties of these mixtures is essential for these processes, and depends on reliable experimental data. Making use of an automated static-analytical apparatus, measurements were made of the phase behavior of binary mixtures of isobutane with CO2 and with H2, extending the range of available data for both mixtures. Measurements of the system isobutane + CO2 were carried out along three isotherms at temperatures of (240, 280, and 310) K with pressures from the lower limit of the sampling system (~ 0.5 MPa) to the mixture critical pressure. The results exhibit good agreement with literature data. Measurements on isobutane + H2 were carried out along nine isotherms at temperatures of (190, 240, 280, 311, 339, 363, 375, 390, and 400) K with pressures up to 20 MPa, covering a much broader range of conditions than the one prior investigation. The results have been used to optimize temperature-dependent binary parameters in the Peng–Robinson equation of state with two different mixing rules. This approach was found to perform well in comparison to alternative models."
Relative importance of VECTRI model parameters in the malaria disease transmission and prevalence,"In this study, a sensitivity analysis on a VECTRI dynamical model of malaria transmission is investigated to determine the relative importance of model parameters to disease transmission and prevalence. Apart from being most climatic prone, Odisha is a highly endemic state for malaria in India. The lack in sufficient modeling studies severely impacts the malarial process studies which further hinder the possibility of malaria early warning systems and preventive measures to be undertaken beforehand. Therefore, modeling studies and investigating the relationship between malaria transmission process studies and associated climatic factors are the need of the hour. Environmental conditions have pronounced effects on the malaria transmission dynamics and abundance of the poikilothermic vectors, but the exact relationship of sensitivity for these parameters is not well established. Sensitivity analysis is a useful tool for ascertaining model responses to different input variables. Therefore, in order to perform the requisite study, a dynamical model, VECTRI, is utilized. The study period ranges from 2000 to 2013, where several sensitivity tests are performed using different model parameters such as infiltration and evaporation rate loss of ponds, degree-days for parasite development, threshold temperature for parasite development, threshold temperature for egg development in the vector, and maximum and minimum temperature for larvae survival. The experiments suggest that the lower value of minimum temperature for larvae survival (rlarv_tmin), i.e., 16 °C, provides higher vector density and entomological inoculation rate (EIR) values. EIR reaches its maximum, when the threshold temperature for parasite development (rtsporo) is 22 °C and degree-days for parasite development (dsporo) is 8 degree-days. No change is observed in the vector density; even when rtsporo is 30 °C, values of EIR are close to 0. A successive increment of infiltration and evaporation rate loss of ponds (rwaterfrac evap126) values from 130 to 200 mm/day result in approximately 5% consistent decline in vector density and EIR. The study concludes that the most sensitive parameters are dsporo, rlarv_tmin, and rwaterfrac evap126. The VECTRI model is rather insensitive to maximum temperature for larvae survival (rlarv_tmin) for vector density and EIR variables. Further certain modifications and improvements are required in VECTRI to predict out variables like vector density and EIR more accurately in highly endemic region."
Non-Adherence to Anti-Retroviral Therapy Among Adult People Living with HIV in Ethiopia: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Human immunodeficiency virus remains a global public health problem. Despite efforts to determine the prevalence of non-adherence to ART and its predictors in Ethiopia, various primary studies presented inconsistent findings. Therefore, this review aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of non-adherence to ART and identify its predictors. We have searched PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science databases extensively for all available studies. A weighted inverse-variance random-effects model was used to compute the overall non-adherence to ART. The pooled prevalence of non-adherence to ART was 20.68% (95% CI: 17.74, 23.61); I2 = 98.40%; p < 0.001). Educational level of primary school and lower [AOR = 3.5, 95%CI: 1.7, 7.4], taking co-medications [AOR = 0.45, 95%CI: 0.35, 0.59], not using memory aids [AOR = 0.30, 95%CI: 0.13, 0.71], depression [AOR = 2.0, 95%CI: 1.05, 3.79], comorbidity [AOR = 2.12, 95%CI: 1.16, 3.09), under-nutrition [AOR = 2.02, 95%CI: 1.20, 3.43], not believing on ART can control HIV [AOR = 2.31, 95%CI: 1.92, 2.77], lack of access to health facilities [AOR = 3.86, 95%CI: 1.10, 13.51] and taking ART pills uncomfortably while others looking [AOR = 5.21, 95%CI: 2.56, 10.53] were significantly associated with non-adherence to anti-retroviral therapy. The overall pooled prevalence of non-adherence to ART was considerably high in Ethiopia. Educational status, taking co-medications, not using memory aids, depression, comorbidity, under nutrition, not believing on anti-retroviral therapy controls HIV, lack of access to health facilities and taking ART pills uncomfortably were independent predictors of non-adherence to ART in Ethiopia. Therefore, healthcare providers, adherence counselors and supporters should detect non-adherence behaviors and patients’ difficulties with ART early, and provide intensive counseling to promote adherence."
Congruences modulo powers of 2 for restricted partition triples due to Lin and Wang,"In 2018, Lin and Wang introduced two restricted partition triples, whose generating functions are related to the reciprocals of Ramanujan–Gordon identities. Let \(RG_2(n)\) denote the number of partitions triples of n, where odd parts in the first two components are distinct and the last component only contains even parts. Lin and Wang proved some congruences modulo 5 and 7 satisfied by \(RG_2(n)\). They further asked the existence of the infinite families of congruences modulo high powers of 2 for the function \(RG_2(n)\). Utilizing some q-techniques, we prove that such congruence families indeed exist."
On the Dotsenko–Fateev complex twin of the Selberg integral and its extensions,"The Selberg integral has a twin (‘the Dotsenko–Fateev integral’) of the following form. We replace real variables \(x_k\) in the integrand \(\prod |x_k|^{\sigma -1}\,|1-x_k|^{\tau -1} \prod |x_k-x_l|^{2\theta }\) of the Selberg integral by complex variables \(z_k\), integration over a cube we replace by an integration over the whole complex space \({\mathbb {C}}^n\). According to Dotsenko, Fateev, and Aomoto, such integral is a product of Gamma functions. We define and evaluate a family of beta integrals over spaces \({\mathbb {C}}^m\times {\mathbb {C}}^{m+1}\times \dots \times {\mathbb {C}}^n\), which for \(m=n\) gives the complex twin of the Selberg integral (with three additional integer parameters)."
Efficient and accurate numerical-projection of electromagnetic multipoles for scattering objects,"In this paper, we develop an efficient and accurate procedure of electromagnetic multipole decomposition by using the Lebedev and Gaussian quadrature methods to perform the numerical integration. Firstly, we briefly review the principles of multipole decomposition, highlighting two numerical projection methods including surface and volume integration. Secondly, we discuss the Lebedev and Gaussian quadrature methods, provide a detailed recipe to select the quadrature points and the corresponding weighting factor, and illustrate the integration accuracy and numerical efficiency (that is, with very few sampling points) using a unit sphere surface and regular tetrahedron. In the demonstrations of an isotropic dielectric nanosphere, a symmetric scatterer, and an anisotropic nanosphere, we perform multipole decomposition and validate our numerical projection procedure. The obtained results from our procedure are all consistent with those from Mie theory, symmetry constraints, and finite element simulations."
Comparative Study of Dermal Pharmacokinetics Between Topical Drugs Using Open Flow Microperfusion in a Pig Model,"Accurate methods to determine dermal pharmacokinetics are important to increase the rate of clinical success in topical drug development. We investigated in an in vivo pig model whether the unbound drug concentration in the interstitial fluid as determined by dermal open flow microperfusion (dOFM) is a more reliable measure of dermal exposure compared to dermal biopsies for seven prescription or investigational drugs. In addition, we verified standard dOFM measurement using a recirculation approach and compared dosing frequencies (QD versus BID) and dose strengths (high versus low drug concentrations)."
Differential phosphorus acquisition strategies of nine cover crop species grown in a calcareous and a decalcified chernozem,Cover cropping is a strategy to increase soil phosphorus (P) use efficiency in agroecosystems. We investigated adaptations on P acquisition strategies of nine cover crops grown in a calcareous and a non-calcareous chernozem with low available P.
Investigation of Antimicrobial Activities and Molecular Docking Studies of Synthesized Sulfonamide Compounds,"Sulfonamides are commonly used worldwide. In this study, several sulfonamide compounds such as N-(4-acetylphenyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide (PSASF), N-(3-acetylphenyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide (PSASF-1), 1-tosyl-1H-imidazole (PSASF-x), 4-methyl-N-(pyridin-4-yl) benzenesulfonamide (PSASF-2), and 1-ethyl-4-tosylpiperazine (PSASF-3) have been synthesized, with antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 have been evaluated. Antibacterial properties of drugs were studied in depth using molecular docking research. In addition, the synthesized compounds were characterized using spectral analysis. Antibacterial activities of synthesized derivates were determined against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by using the broth microdilution method. All prepared compounds exhibited significant antibacterial activity against S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa. The MIC value for E. coli and P. aeruginosa was determined as 256 μg/mL. MIC against S. aureus was observed to be 256 and 512 μg/mL for the PSASF compound and the other compounds respectively. Results of the current study revealed that four of the five compounds had weaker antibacterial activity against S. aureus at a concentration of 512 μg/mL. However, the MIC values from our experiments are significantly higher in comparison with the reference drugs such as amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and vancomycin in E. coli and S. aureus. On the other hand, in a comparison of the synthesized compounds with reference drugs in P. aeruginosa, no statistical difference was demonstrated. Antibacterial activity of the produced derivates was likewise an agreement with regard to the molecular docking and the laboratory results."
IN SILICO and IN VITRO Estimation of MAO-B Inhibitory Activity of Newly Synthesized Hydrazones Bearing a Pyrrole Heterocyclic System,"This paper is focused on the in silico and in vitro determination of MAO-B inhibitory activity on recombinant MAO-B enzyme (hMAOB) of newly synthesized substituted N-pyrrolyl hydrazide hydrazones. From the tested substances, only compound DI 5a has shown statistically significant inhibitory activity on human recombinant MAO-B enzyme, comparable with that of selegiline and better than that of melatonin, applied as standards. The molecular docking studies indicated formation of a stable complex in the aromatic “cage” of the enzyme and the 2-hydroxyphenyl moiety of DI 5a. An additional stable water-mediated hydrogen bond is formed with the carbonyl group located at third position in the pyrrole ring."
A highoutput PDMS-MXene/gelatin triboelectric nanogenerator with the petal surface-microstructure,"Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has a promising future in the field of energy harvesting and self-powered sensing due to their simplicity in structure, low cost, and efficient energy harvesting from the surrounding environment. The output electrical performance of TENG can be improved by doping the friction material with functional materials and modifying the surface of the friction material. However, the current method of adding functional materials to friction materials is costly and wasteful, and the method of modifying the surface structure of friction materials is cumbersome and not easy to operate. In this work, we present a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-MXene/gelatin triboelectric nanogenerator (PMMG-TENG) based on petal surface-microstructures, which has the advantages of low cost, simple preparation, high output performance, and ecological friendliness. By doping 0.03 wt.% of MXene in PDMS, the output electrical performance of TENG can be significantly improved, with an output current increase of up to 139.7%. Four different petals are used as natural molds to prepare PMMG-TENG. The results show that PMMG-TENG with peony petal surface microstructure has the best electrical performance, and the output current increase of up to 228.17% compared with PMMG-TENG without structure. The PMMG-TENG with peony petal surface-microstructure exhibits excellent electrical performance, demonstrating a maximum open-circuit voltage of 417.39 V and a maximum short-circuit current of 12.01 µA at a size of 3 cm × 3 cm, and a maximum power density of 170 µW/cm2 at a load resistance of 107 Ω. The PMMG-TENG’s output performance after 10,000 cycles is consistent with the initial state, highlighting excellent output stability. The PMMG-TENG can easily light up at least 100 light emitting diodes (LEDs). (operating voltage 3V.) Gelatin film exhibits excellent degradation performance, with complete degradation time of only 150 s in water at a constant temperature of 75 °C. PMMG-TENG not only shows excellent performance in the field of energy harvesting, but also has a broad application prospect in the field of self-powered sensing. This work provides a simple, low cost, natural and green method to significantly improve the output electrical performance of TENG."
In3+-doped Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ cathode with improved performance for an intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,"Promoting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical for commercialization of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs), where Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ (SFM) is a promising cathode by working as a mixed ionic and electronic conductor. In this work, doping of In3+ greatly increases the oxygen vacancy concentration and the content of adsorbed oxygen species in Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5−xInxO6−δ (SFMInx), and thus effectively promotes the ORR performance. As a typical example, SFMIn0.1 reduces the polarization resistance (Rp) from 0.089 to 0.046 Q·cm2 at 800 °C, which is superior to those doped with other metal elements. In addition, SFMIn0.1 increases the peak power density from 0.92 to 1.47 W·cm−2 at 800 °C with humidified H2 as the fuel, indicating that In3+ doping at the Mo site can effectively improve the performance of SOFC cathode material."
Volume-complementary bipolar layered oxide enables stable symmetric sodium-ion batteries,"The commercialization of sodium-ion batteries is based on developing low-cost, highly stable, and safe cathode and anode electrodes. However, the promising hard carbon anode and layered oxide cathode suffer from low sodium-embedded potential near 0.1 V and severe phase transitions, which cause safe problem and short lifespan, respectively. Herein, we design a low-strain bipolar P2-Na0.7Ni0.25Fe0.2Ti0.55O2 to solve the mentioned obstacles, whereas (Ni, Fe) and Ti provide charge compensation when it is used as cathode and anode, respectively. It is revealed that the bipolar layered oxide undergoes solid–solution reaction when used as cathode or anode, and exhibits volume-complementary feature in a sodium-ion full-cell, as identified by in-situ X-ray diffraction. Remarkably, the safe symmetric sodium-ion full-cell exhibits excellent cyclic stability with 91.7% capacity retention after 200 cycles. This work will provide a new horizon for designing safe and stable sodium-ion batteries."
Vacancy engineering induced reaction kinetics enhancement of cobalt metaphosphate for pH-universal hydrogen evolution,"Developing efficient pH-universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts is critical in the field of water electrolysis, however, which is severely hampered by the sluggish kinetics in alkaline media. Herein, a ruthenium (Ru) incorporation induced vacancy engineering strategy is firstly proposed to precisely construct oxygen vacancy (VO)-riched cobalt-ruthenium metaphosphate (CRPO) for high-efficiency pH-universal HER. The VO modifies the electronic structure, improves the superficial hydrophilic and gas spillover capacity, it also reduces the coordination number of Ru atoms and regulates the coordination environment. Theoretical calculations indicate that Ru tends to adsorb H2O and H*, whereas VO tends to adsorb OH−, which greatly promotes the H2O adsorption and the dissociation of HO–H bond. Ultimately, CRPO-2 exhibits remarkable HER performance, the mass activity is about 18.34, 21.73, and 38.07 times higher than that of Pt/C in acidic, neutral, and alkaline media, respectively, at the same time maintain excellent stability. Our findings may pave a new avenue for the rational design of electrocatalysts toward pH-universal water electrolysis."
TiO2 nanofiber-supported copper nanoparticle catalysts for highly efficient methane conversion to C1 oxygenates under mild conditions,"The selective oxidation of methane under mild conditions remains the “Holy Grail of Catalysis”. The key to activating methane and inhibiting over-oxidation of target oxygenates lies in designing active centers. Copper nanoparticles were loaded onto TiO2 nanofibers using the photo-deposition method. The resulting catalysts were found to effectively convert methane into C1 oxygenated products under mild conditions. Compared with previously reported catalysts, it delivers a superior performance of up to 2510.7 mmol·gCu−1·hr−1 productivity with a selectivity of around 100% at 80 °C for 5 min. Microstructure characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that TiO2 in the mixed phase of anatase and rutile significantly increases the Cu+/Cu0 ratio of the supported Cu species, and this ratio is linearly related to the formation rate of oxygen-containing species. The Cu1 site promotes the generation of active O species from H2O2 dissociation on Cu2O (111). These active O species reduce the energy barrier for breaking the C–H bond of CH4, thus boosting the catalytic activity. The methane conversion mechanism was proposed as a methyl radical pathway to form CH3OH and CH3OOH, and then the generated CH3OH is further oxidized to HOCH2OOH."
OH regulator of highly dispersed Ru sites on host Pd nanocrystals for selective ethanol electro-oxidation,"The ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) is crucial in direct alcohol fuel cells and chemical production. However, the electro-oxidation of ethanol molecules to produce acetaldehyde and carbon monoxide can poison the active sites of nanocatalysts, resulting in reduced performance and posing challenges in achieving high activity and selectivity for ethanol oxidation. In this study, we employed a dynamic seed-mediated method to precisely modify highly dispersed Ru sites onto well-defined Pd nanocrystals. The oxyphilic Ru sites serve as “OH valves”, regulating water dissociation, while the surrounding Pd atomic arrangements control electronic states for the oxidation dehydrogenation of carbonaceous intermediates. Specifically, Ru0.040@Pd nanocubes (Ru:Pd = 0.04 at.%), featuring (100) facets in Ru-Pd4 configurations, demonstrate an outstanding mass activity of 6.53 \({\rm{A}} \cdot {\rm{m}}{{\rm{g}}_{{\rm{Pd}}}}^{ - 1}\) in EOR under alkaline conditions, which is 6.05 times higher than that of the commercial Pd/C catalyst (1.08 \({\rm{A}} \cdot {\rm{m}}{{\rm{g}}_{{\rm{Pd}}}}^{ - 1}\)). Through in-situ experiments and theoretical investigations, we elucidate that the hydrophilic Ru atoms significantly promote the dynamic evolution of H2O dissociation into OHads species, while the electron redistribution from Ru to adjacent Pd concurrently adjusts the selective oxidation of C2 intermediates. This host–guest interaction accelerates the subsequent oxidation of carbonaceous intermediates (CH3COads) to acetate, while preventing the formation of toxic ⋆CHx and ⋆CO species, which constitutes the rate-determining step."
A New Survey Instrument for Tracking Public Opinion on Social Inclusion,"Social inclusion indicators inform policy advocacy and intervention. However, a critical piece of information is often missing: public opinion. Efforts to enhance social inclusion could backfire if they provoke opinion backlash or intergroup hostilities. In this paper, we explain the importance and nuances of inclusive attitudes and develop an easy-to-use survey instrument that tracks public opinion regarding different marginalized groups and support measures systematically. Using evidence from a representative telephone survey in Hong Kong (N = 1010), as well as a parallel online survey (N = 1000), we demonstrate the multidimensional nature of public attitudes toward social inclusion and our instrument’s excellent psychometric properties and potential for use in various research settings. Although developed in the context of Hong Kong, the survey items can be decomposed and adapted to suit diverse urban societies. By highlighting the importance and complexity of public opinion, we hope to foster a more participatory approach to promoting social inclusion."
Eco-Friendly Composite Materials: Enhancing Sustainability with Sugarcane Bagasse Biochar and Polystyrene Resin,"Composite materials play a vital role in enhancing sustainability across various industries. This study focuses on the development of eco-friendly composites through the integration of sugarcane bagasse biochar and polystyrene resin. The composites were prepared by manually mixing sugarcane bagasse biochar and polystyrene resin, followed by a hand-layup process. The composites contained varying biochar content, ranging from 10 to 40%, and were thermally cured and characterized. The hardness tests depicted the reinforcing impact of biochar on the resin matrix, with the pure polystyrene resin exhibiting a hardness value of 244 HB, while the biochar-reinforced composites display a gradual increase, culminating in peak hardness at 371 HRB in the 40% biochar composite. The elemental analysis showed increased carbon content up to 91.30% in composites with 40% biochar, with a lower oxygen content (9.70%). The silicon presence reduced and became undetectable in composites with 30 and 40% biochar, possibly due to alterations during curing. The incorporation of biochar into the resin induced significant shifts and modifications in FTIR peaks, indicating the presence of diverse functional groups, including hydroxyl, alkene, alkyne, carbonyl, and aromatic rings within the composites. Surface examinations conducted via SEM micrographs illustrate a transformation from a smooth and uniform surface in polystyrene resin to progressively rough and improved porous surfaces in composites with higher biochar content. The results from this study highlight the potential of sugarcane bagasse biochar and polystyrene resin composites in various applications, fostering a more environmentally responsible and resource-efficient path."
Effect of Phase Formation on Mechanical Properties of the Joint AA6061 to AA2024 by TLP,"In this research, diffusion bonding was employed to joint AA2024 and AA6061 alloys. To select the alloy material of the interlayer, the atomic diffusion of tin, zinc, and gallium elements was modeled at a concentration of 90.1 wt % in pure aluminum. According to the modeling results, tin was selected as the main element of the interlayer alloy. Diffusion bonding was carried out in a tube furnace at a heating rate of 5°C/min under vacuum (7.5 × 10–3 Torr) and the temperature of 453°C for 210 min for Sn–5.3Ag–4.6Bi interlayer. This experiment was performed considering one interlayer with different thicknesses (20, 50, and 70 µm). Joints were assessed by SEM, and elemental mapping. Ag3Al, Mg45Al40Ag15 inter-metallic compounds, Sn-rich in solid solutions, and Sn + Cu6Sn5 phase were formed at the joint site of the interlayer. The maximum tensile strength of the samples with a joint thickness of 20 µm was 52 MPa after 210 min. By the increase of the Sn–5.3Ag–4.6Bi interlayer thickness (20–70 µm), the average unit tensile stress showed a decline. The effect of the interlayer thickness (20, 50, 70 µm) was investigated on the hardness, strength, and particle size as well as the joint phases."
Effect of Cold-Drawing Deformation on the Microstructure and Properties of AA2024-T8,"T8 treatment includes solution treatment, cold working and artificial aging treatment. T8 treatment can greatly improve the hardness and strength of 2024 aluminum alloy without reducing the corrosion resistance. The effect of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4% cold-drawing deformation on the microstructures of the alloy was observed by transmission electron microscopy, and properties of the alloy was investigated by hardness tests, tensile tests and electrochemical corrosion tests. The results show that the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of cold-drawing deformed 2024 aluminum alloy are better than those of non-deformed alloy. Compared with AA2024-T6, AA2024-T8 with 2% cold-drawing deformation has a higher hardness by 11.3%, and a higher tensile strength by 10.8%. The improvement of the properties of AA2024-T8 is mainly due to the interaction between dislocations and precipitates. With the increase in cold-drawing deformation, the nucleation points of precipitates in AA2024-T8 gradually increase, and precipitates are gradually coarsened under the same artificial aging treatment."
Effect of Mg Content Change on the Production of Closed-Cell Aluminum Alloy Foam by Selective Laser Melting,"Taking advantage of the evaporation characteristics of Mg in the high-temperature molten pool formed by selective laser melting (SLM) processing, in this paper, Mg is used as a foaming agent to produce closed-cell foamed aluminum alloy by SLM technology. The influence of Mg content changes (5, 10, 15%) on the porosity, pore size, microstructure and mechanical properties of the closed-cell aluminum foam prepared by SLM was studied. The experimental results prove that the higher the Mg content, the larger the pore size of the foamed aluminum. The porosity of the sample reaches the maximum 42.39% when 10% Mg is added. In addition, the increase of the Mg content leads to more merging between the internal pores of the material. The addition of Mg can significantly improve the microhardness value of the material. Compression experiments under room temperature conditions prove that the closed-cell aluminum foam material prepared by SLM has a certain degree of energy absorption characteristics."
"An Atomistic Structure of Cementite (M3C, M = Fe, Cr, Mn) in Carbon Steel","Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) results for cementite in carbon steel suggest that the alloying elements containing Cr and Mn. In order to explore the influence of Cr and Mn on Fe3C (FC), FC and Fe6Cr4Mn2C4 (FCMC) atomic structures and their energies and properties were calculated and compared by first-principles method. The results show that Cr and Mn can easily dissolve in FC and form stable FCMC. The structures of FC and FCMC are electrically neutral, the C atoms in them can get electrons, while the metal atoms (Mn, Fe, Cr) lose electrons, it is worth noting that Cr atoms close to Mn will get a small number of electrons due to Mn atoms have the strongest ability to lose electrons. The magnetic moment results suggest that FC is ferromagnetic and FCMC is sub-ferromagnetic, their magnetic moments of them are 22.18 and 5.09 μB/cell, respectively. The C−M (M = Fe, Cr, and Mn) bonds in FC and FCMC are covalent, the covalent electrons mainly provide by metal atoms, with the increase of C-M bond length, the covalence of bonds decrease gradually. The metal bonds of Fe−Fe, Fe−Cr, Fe−Mn, and Cr−Mn have both ionic and covalent character, while Cr−Cr and Mn−Mn bonds are ionic, and bond spin of Mn−Mn is zero, indicating that the bond is paramagnetic. Compared with FC, the Poisson’s ratio and bulk modulus of FCMC structure are significantly reduced, while the Young’s modulus and shear modulus are increased, this means that FCMC has lower compressive deformation resistance and higher y-axis shear resistance capacity than FC, i.e., FCMC has a higher brittleness than FC."
Microstructure and Texture of Ultra-High Purity Copper under Changed Rolling Strain Paths and Subsequent Recrystallization Annealing,"For advanced integrated circuits semiconductor chip, the uniformity of microstructure and texture is increasingly required for copper target material of ultra-high purity (≥99.9999%). To this end, well-customized rolling and annealing routes for the raw material of Cu are highly needed. In the study, unidirectional rolling (UR) and cross rolling (CR) were utilized in processing the supplied Cu, both with 50, 70, and 90% thickness reduction, respectively. The rolled samples then underwent identical annealing at 300°C for 60 min. The rolled and recrystallized microstructure and texture were characterized by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Results showed that the CR samples exhibited severer grain fragmentation, more homogeneous microstructure and weaker texture than the UR samples, especially for the samples of 90% thickness reduction. Moreover, dynamically recrystallized grains were observed in both UR and CR samples with 90% thickness reduction due to the raised temperature during severe plastic deformation. Thanks to the more uniform deformation, the annealed CR samples enjoyed finer grains of more random textures than the annealed UR ones. Therefore, cross rolling is preferable for imparting Cu sputtering targets with the required uniformity."
Microstructural Evolution and Mechanical Behavior of SP-700Ti Alloy during Superplastic Deformation,"In this paper, the superplastic behavior of SP-700 alloy (Ti–4.5Al–3V–2Mo–2Fe) was investigated by hot compression tests and hot tensile tests in the temperature range of 700–950°C and strain rates of 0.001 to 1 s–1. The microstructural analysis and mechanical behavior of the alloy were studied during superplastic deformation. Although the elongation became higher than 370% at 700°C, the alloy showed a relatively high work hardening. At 750 and 800°C, the typical superplasticity was occurred and the specimens endured a large elongation of 427–440%. Microstructure of the alloy in 700–800°C was mainly consisted of globular α phase, while the globular α phase was completely removed in the tip fracture of the specimen deformed at 850°C due to deformation-induced transformation. In the temperature range of 850–950°C, the elongation was decreased to 250–325% as a consequence of the removal of α phase, significant β grain growth, and crack formation along β/β grain boundaries. The maximum elongation of 440% was obtained at 800°C where the strain-rate sensitivity is equal to 0.38 which is accommodated by the m-value distribution map of the alloy. During superplastic deformation in the single β phase region, the Rachinger grain boundary sliding (GBS) mechanism is the dominant phenomenon. However, deformation in the dual-phase α/β region is encouraged by dynamic recrystallization (DRX) and decomposition of α colonies."
Microstructure Characteristic and Evolution Mechanism of Cu–Ni–P Alloys under Different Cooling Rate,"The microstructure characteristics at different cooling rates and phase extraction treatments of Cu–34.1Ni–4.5P ingots were discussed in this paper. It was found that Cu–34.1Ni–4.5P ingots were composed of Cu and multiple Ni–P phases, including NiP, Ni5P2, Ni5P4 and Ni12P5. With the cooling rates decreasing from 1710 to 52 K/s, the growth of Ni–P dendrites during the solidification process would be gradually taken place, resulting in the coarsening of Ni–P phases to some extent. It was observed that the average ligament width of Ni–P grains was 1.64 μm with cooling rates as 1710 K/s which was 33% lower than 52 K/s, meaning that the lamellar spacings would also been significantly decreased with the increase of solidification rates. Furthermore, a bulk self-supporting porous Ni–P skeleton materials with hierarchical structure were obtained by dealloying of Cu–34.1Ni–4.5P precursor alloys. Meanwhile, the corresponding mechanism for the formation of Ni–P with skeleton structure was also disscussed."
Effect of Self-Inoculation Treatment on Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Eutectic Al–Si Alloy,"Eutectic Al–Si alloy was self-inoculated by spheroidized Al–12.6Si alloy. The microstructure and mechanical properties of self-inoculated eutectic Al–Si alloy were observed by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and the universal tensile testing machine. The results show that the area fraction of α‑Al phase in eutectic Al–Si alloy increased first and then decreased with an increase in the added amount of the inoculant at 700°C. When the added amount of inoculant was 0.4 wt %, the area fraction of the α-Al phase in the eutectic Al–Si alloy also increased first (to a maximum of 30.9%) and then decreased with increasing temperature. Also the eutectic silicon transformed from coarse needle flakes into fine particles as inoculant was added. And when the added amount of inoculant was 0.4 wt %, the tensile strength and elongation of the alloy reached maximum values and the tensile fracture of the alloy showed ductile fracture characteristics. Therefore, the self-inoculation treatment is an effective method to improve the mechanical properties of eutectic Al–Si alloys."
Comparative Study of Structural and Opto-Electric Features of Environment Friendly AlSb Screen Printed and Brush Plated Films,"Aluminium antimonide (AlSb) films are an applicable material in opto-electronic and photovoltaic devices. In the present work, AlSb films were successfully coated on glass substrate via economical screen-printing and brush plating methods. Structural, optical, and electrical attributes of these films were characterized by XRD, HRSEM, EDAX, UV–Vis spectrophotometery and a two-probe technique. XRD analysis revealed that obtained AlSb films by both methods have (111) plane as favored orientation with cubic phase structure. EDAX analysis revealed the atomic proportion of Al with Sb was ~1 : 1, which is stoichiometric proportion. HRSEM analysis showed that the surface of AlSb films is layered with sphere-shaped and rough crystals. Numerous pores and large size crystals were observed in the brush plated film as compared with AlSb screen printed film. Via UV–Vis analysis AlSb was established as an indirect optical gap material; with optical band gap value of both type films was observed in close agreement to its theoretical value (1.62 eV). Electrical resistivity measurements via a two probe equipment, semiconducting nature for both types of films were found. Activation energy was also calculated by employing Arrhenius plot."
The Influence of Nickel Addition on Properties of Sn–4.0Zn–0.7Cu Lead-Free Solder,"This research investigated changes in the properties of Sn–4.0Zn–0.7Cu (SZC407) solder alloy after doping with 0.5 wt % Ni. Specimens of SZC407 and SZC407–0.5Ni solder alloys were characterized in terms of chemical composition, microstructure, mechanical properties, and melting point. The results showed that the addition 0.5 wt % Ni had no significant effect on the ultimate tensile strength and elongation of SZC407 solder alloy but the formation of phases of the intermetallic compound (IMC) CuZnNi in the solder matrix increased the microhardness of the alloy. These IMC phases improved the strength of the solder matrix by the dispersion strengthening mechanism. The fracture surface of both solder alloys was typical of the ductile fracture mode. The microstructure of the solder alloy was improved by the distribution in the solder matrix of new CuZnNi IMC phases. However, the addition of 0.5 wt % Ni slightly increased the solidus and liquidus temperatures, pasty range and peak temperature of the SZC407 solder alloy."
Ti-Alloying Effect on Crystallization Behavior of Zr72.5Al10Fe17.5 Metallic Glass,"To develop metallic glass composites for practical applications, modulating the crystallization behavior of metallic glasses is an effective and important avenue, as confirmed by previous literature. Here, an obvious change in the crystallization behavior of Zr72.5Al10Fe17.5 metallic glass was demonstrated with a minor mount of Ti dopant. Specifically, when a low concentration of Ti (even as low as 0.5 at %) was doped into the Zr72.5Al10Fe17.5 base alloy, the originally single crystallization event, corresponding to the formation of α-Zr, Zr6Al2Fe, and FeZr2 phases, distinctly separated into two events, Zr6Al2Fe and α-Zr + FeZr2. As the Ti dopant concentration increased to x = 4.0, the primary phase of the Zr6Al2Fe seems to be exchanged with the α-Zr phase, accompanied by the crystallization interval of the two crystallization events gradually increasing, even up to 110 K at x = 4.0. This change in the separated crystallization event and the interval of the currently studied alloys were determined to be associated with their solidification process and the activation energy of each crystallization event."
Simulation of the Mechanical Behavior of a Dental Implant in Bone Tissue Under Shock Wave Treatment,"Dental implants are becoming an increasingly important part of modern dental treatment. Developing an optimal implant surface design can improve osseointegration. Promising to increase the rate of osseointegration is the use of extracorporeal shock wave therapy, which has proven itself for the treatment of fractures, bone defects, and bone tissue regeneration during surgery and arthroplasty. This work aims at a numerical investigation of the effects of low-energy shock wave therapy of various intensities on the mechanical behavior of dental implants and surrounding bone tissues, taking into account the physiological characteristics in the area of dental implant placement. Modeling was carried out using the method of movable cellular automata. The results of computer simulation showed that the conditions for the regeneration of bone tissues at the near-contact zone with the implant of the jaw segment are created by a shock wave with intensity greater than 0.1 mJ/mm2."
Anti-Counterfeiting Application and Temperature Sensing Characteristics of SrBi4Ti4O15:Yb3+/Er3+ Phosphor Designed by Solid State Method For Dual-Mode Upconversion Luminescence,"Rare earth ion-doped upconversion luminescent materials have found extensive utility in anti-counterfeiting applications. However, in practice, single-mode photoluminescence falls short of addressing increasingly intricate demands of contemporary anti-counterfeiting measures. This work presents successfully synthesized dual-mode excited SrBi4Ti4O15 upconversion phosphor doped with Yb3+/Er3+, designed to emit two distinctive colors, green and red under excitation at either 980 or 1550 nm. Introduction of the multi-color emission significantly enhances the security of anti-counterfeiting strategies in a variety of modes. A comprehensive investigation is conducted into potential upconversion mechanisms driven by different excitation sources, examining both 980 and 1550 nm wavelengths. Anti-counterfeiting properties are evaluated for synthesized phosphor by gauging the luminous intensity ratio between red and green light. Research findings unequivocally point to the immense potential of SrBi4Ti4O15 upconversion phosphor doped with Yb3+/Er3+ for robust multimode anti-counterfeiting applications, representing a promising development in this field."
First Report on Biometric Analysis of Red Cornetfish Fistularia petimba (Fistulariidae) from Indian Waters,"The morphometric and meristic characteristics, length-length relationships (LLRs), length-weight relationships (LWRs) and relative condition factor of forty-one individuals of red cornetfish Fistularia petimba were studied for the first time from the North-West coast of India during February to September 2022. The maximum coefficient of variation was observed for inter-orbital length (25.85%) followed by lower jaw length (18.14%) and pectoral-fin length (16.96%). The morphometric index value was found <10% (genetically-controlled characters) for all the morphometric characters except total length with caudal filament length indicating restricted distribution. LLRs revealed isometric growth and high values of correlation coefficient (0.6109–0.9992). The b value of LWRs showed significant departure from 3 (p < 0.05) and hence negative allometric growth was recorded. The high R2 value of the LWRs indicates absolute fitness of the growth model and superior health status of the studied species. The mean condition factor value was calculated as 0.99 ± 0.04 indicating that the F. petimba population is in good health. Further, F. petimba is a reef-associated species forming a part of low-value bycatch which is mainly utilized for the preparation of fishmeal. Thus the provided morphometric and biometric information of the species will be useful for further biological, stock assessment and nutritional research in the region."
"An Oldest Record of the Shark Cosmopolitodus planus (Lamnidae) from the Lower Miocene of the Sakhalin, Russia","An isolate tooth of a rare extinct hook-toothed mako Cosmopolitodus planus (Agassiz, 1856), discovered in the Lower Miocene deposits of the Chekhov Formation of Sakhalin Island is described. This extinct species was distributed exceptionally in the Pacific basin, and is known mainly from the deposits of the Middle and Upper Miocene. Thus, the described tooth is, probably, the oldest record of this species. The geographic and stratigraphic distribution of this species, as well as the validity of the genus Cosmopolitodus Glickman, 1964, are discussed."
"A Preliminary Study on the Morphometric Features of the European Eel, Anguilla anguilla (Anguillidae) in Gediz Lagoon (Izmir Bay, the Aegean Sea): Special Emphasis to Sexual Dimorphism","In this study, we aimed to state how we can contribute to an effective population management and protection by determining the morphometric characteristics of European yellow eels, Anguilla anguilla Linnaeus 1758, in the Aegean Sea population, Izmir Bay. It was found that the eye index and condition values of the female specimens are higher than those of the males. While it was determined that there was a significant difference between both sexes in 19 of 20 morphometric measurements of the head region, there was no statistical difference only in the height measurement at the nostril level of the head. In our study, the fact that specimens with ovaries were seen among the females longer than 34 cm (length group II) is remarkable in terms of early maturation in the region. The differences in head measurements between sexes indicate the existence of a dimorphic structure and these differences are in favor of female specimens."
Craniological Features of Sabanejewia larvata (Cobitidae) and its Divergence from S. aurata and Other Congeneric Species,"The conducted craniological analysis of Sabanejewia larvata and S. aurata did not reveal fundamental differences in the general morphology of the skull and skull bones between them. Comparison with previously studied Sabanejewia caspia, S. kubanica, S. caucasica, and S. aralensis showed that all investigated species have species-specific values for some craniological indices. Sabanejewia larvata and S. caspia are most similar and are characterized by the lowest skull in the ethmoid region, the widest praeoperculum, the ascending process of the dentary displaced anteriorly, and the narrowest cleithrum. The obtained results confirm the validity of the subgenus Andrzewia. At the same time, the observed craniological divergence of S. aurata and S. aralensis testifies in favor of an independent species status of the golden loach from the Aral Sea basin. However, further genetic and morphological studies are needed."
Effects of Bi Inclusion on Tensile Mechanical Property and Deformation Mechanism of Nanopolycrystalline Fe: A Molecular Dynamics study,"The effects of bismuth inclusion on the mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of nanopolycrystalline iron under uniaxial tensile loading were investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. The analysis of the stress-strain behavior of polycrystalline pure Fe and alloy containing Bi inclusion shows that the Young’s modulus of the latter is lower, the strain into the yield stage is smaller, and the yield strength is significantly decreased. Microscopic analysis of pure Fe polycrystalline and Fe–Bi polycrystalline systems with small grain size shows that the deformation mechanisms of pure Fe polycrystalline systems are mainly grain boundary migration, grain boundary slip and grain twisting, while a limited amount of twinning can be observed. The deformation of Fe–Bi system is accomplished based on the deformation mechanism of pure Fe system combined with the shear slip of atoms in Bi inclusion and adjacent region. Meanwhile, the nucleation and growth of cavity can be observed inside the inclusion."
Determinants of Variable Total Platelet Count in Healthy Plateletpheresis Donor,"The platelet count in a healthy individual varies between 150 and 450 × 109/L. This study explores the factors affecting this variation in platelet count in healthy blood donors selected for platelet donation. This retrospective study comprises an analysis of platelet donor data between the year 2016–2022. The pre-recorded donor details such as age, gender, blood group, body mass index (BMI), and complete blood counts were collected and analyzed using the software ‘R’ (version 4.1.0). The statistical analysis consists of a test of normalcy followed by descriptive details and advanced statistics such as correlation and regression analysis to predict the variables affecting platelet count. The p-value of less than 0.05 was taken as significant. The median (IQR) of hemoglobin, platelet count, and total leucocyte count (TLC) was 142(135–150) g/L, 239(204–285) × 109/L, and 7.6(6.4–8.8) × 109/L, respectively. The platelet count was positively correlated with TLC (p = 0.000) and negatively with the age of the platelet donor (p = 0.001). The Kruskal–Wallis test detected significant differences in the platelet count among the ABO blood group (p = 0.008). Further, regression analysis confirms the independent positive association of total platelet count with the total leucocyte count (p = 0.000) and the negative association of platelet count with age (p = 0.004). This study concludes the strong dependency of total platelet count with total leucocyte count, age, and blood group."
"Role conflict, entrepreneurial identity, and academic entrepreneurship: the effects of immigration status","University scientists have been strongly encouraged by administrators to engage in academic entrepreneurship (AE), via patenting, licensing, and startup formation. AE is a key aspect of the rise of “entrepreneurial universities” as discussed by (Guerrero & Urbano, Journal of Technology Transfer, 37(1), 43–74, 2012). We examine the relationship between role conflict and scientists’ propensity to engage in AE. Our model starts with the realization that academics contemplating AE struggle with multiple identities as scientists and entrepreneurs and different roles. We hypothesize that foreign-born scientists are more adept at developing an entrepreneurial identity and managing role conflict, which makes them more likely to engage in AE than their domestic counterparts. Our empirical results, based on data from 391 scientists at 25 US research universities, confirm that foreign-born scientists are well-positioned for AE and that engagement in AE mediates the positive impact of foreign-born status on entrepreneurial identity. The results imply that a more open immigration policy will generate higher levels of AE."
Synthesis and Structure of the Co(III) Complex with 2-[((E)-(2-(ethylamino)-5-nitrophenylimino)methyl)-4-(phenyldiazenyl)]-Phenol,"A new anionic Co(III) complex with 2-[((E)-(2-(ethylamino)-5-nitrophenylimino)methyl)-4-(phenyl diazenyl)]-phenol is prepared and characterized by 1H NMR, IR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The crystal structure of the complex is studied by single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD). From the single crystal XRD data it is found that in the complex, two structurally non-equivalent molecules of the doubly deprotonated ligand are tridentate-chelated by the central Co atom. The cobalt(III) ion is in a slightly distorted octahedral environment of four N and two O atoms."
"Photoluminescent Properties of Eu3+ in Different γ-, η-, θ-, and α-Al2O3 Polymorphs","Photoluminescent properties of the Eu3+ ion as a probe are studied in γ-, η-, θ-, and α-Al2O3:Eu3+ polymorphs with an europium concentration of 0.05 wt.%. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of Eu3+ ions are analyzed in the 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0-4) transition region along with the asymmetry ratio, decay kinetics, and PL excitation spectra. It is found that Eu3+ ions incorporate into the Al2O3 lattice and occupy the site with the C3v local symmetry. The biexponential nature of the Eu3+ PL decay kinetics in γ-, η-, θ-, and Al2O3:Eu3+ polymorphs is shown to be due to the occurrence of Eu3+ ions both in the bulk and at subsurface sites. For α-Al2O3:Eu3+ the concentration of surface centers is minimum and the PL decay kinetics is described only by one exponent. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the obtained results on PL of single-phase Al2O3 powders, the characteristic features are revealed, such as PL intensity, electronic structure of 5D0 → 7FJ transitions, asymmetry ratio, position of the O2– → Eu3+ charge transfer band, and 5D0 lifetimes. These characteristics allow the use of Eu3+ ions as structure-sensitive probes to study the local structure of Al2O3 and to identify its phase composition during structural transformations."
"Crystal Structure, Hirshfeld Surface Analysis and Computational Studies of Two Benzo[b][1,4]Diazepine Derivatives","The DFT computational studies, crystal structures and Hirshfeld surface analysis of (E)-4-(2-chlorostyryl)-2,2-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[b][1,4]diazepine (1) and (E)-4-(2-(2,2-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[b][1,4]diazepin-4-yl)vinyl)phenol (2) have been presented. The compounds crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21/c with 4 molecules in their unit cells each. The experimental and computed bond lengths and bond angles deviated from each other to some extent but also showed good agreement with each other in some cases. Hirshfeld surface analysis of the compounds provided further information about the structural properties of the compounds."
Effect of Titanium and Manganese Additions on the Surface Segregation of Barium in Hexaferrites,"Distribution of chemical elements in polycrystalline BaFe12–xTixO19 and BaFe12–xMnxO19 barium ferrite samples is studied. The samples are prepared by solid-phase synthesis at 1400 °C from stoichiometric mixtures of oxides and carbonates. The XRD data indicate that all the studied samples have one crystalline phase characteristic of the M-type hexaferrite structure. The Curie temperatures are determined by differential scanning calorimetry. It is shown that replacing iron with Ti and Mn atoms diminishes the temperature of magnetic phase transition. The difference in bulk and surface atomic composition between the studied ferrites are established by XRD and XPS. It is shown that barium can exhibit surface segregation. The replacement of iron by manganese in the barium hexaferrite structure leads to surface segregation of barium, while the replacement by titanium hinders the segregation."
Electronic Structure and Optical Properties of the Adducts of Er3+ and Yb3+ Thenoyltrifluoracetonate with TPPO,"Adducts of Er3+ and Yb3+ tris-thenoyltrifluoroacetonate with triphenylphosphine oxide OP(C6H5)3 (TPPO) are studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy, and density functional quantum chemical simulations. The spatial structure, electronic levels, effective atomic charge distribution, and excited states are simulated. The main physicochemical characteristics are established from experimental photoelectronic and optical absorption spectra. The experimental data are interpreted using the obtained theoretical results. According to the calculations, all the excited states are caused by transitions to vacant π4*-MO states of the tta ligands."
Three-dimensional porous In2O3 arrays for self-powered transparent solar-blind photodetectors with high responsivity and excellent spectral selectivity,"Transparent solar-blind ultraviolet photodetectors (SBUV PDs) have extensive applications in versatile scenarios, such as optical communication. However, it is still challenging to simultaneously achieve high responsivity, high transparency, and satisfying self-powered capability. Here, we demonstrated high-performance, transparent, and self-powered photoelectrochemical-type (PEC) SBUV PDs based on vertically grown ultrathin In2O3 nanosheet arrays (NAs) with a three-dimensional (3D) porous structure. The 3D porous structure simultaneously improves the transmittance in the visible light region, accelerates interfacial reaction kinetics, and promotes photogenerated carrier transport. The performance of In2O3 NAs photoanodes exceeds most reported self-powered PEC SBUV PDs, exhibiting a high transmittance of approximately 80% in the visible light region, a high responsivity of 86.15 mA/W for 254 nm light irradiation, a fast response speed of 15/18 ms, and good multicycle stability. The In2O3 NAs also show excellent spectral selectivity with an ultrahigh solar-blind rejection ratio of 1319.30, attributed to the quantum confinement effect induced by the ultrathin feature (2–3 nm). Furthermore, In2O3 NAs photoanodes show good capability in underwater optical communication. Our work demonstrated that a 3D porous structure is a powerful strategy to synchronously achieve high responsivity and transparency and provides a new perspective for designing high-performance, transparent, and self-powered PEC SBUV PDs."
In situ reconstruction induced oxygen-deficient multiphase Cu based species hybridized with Ni single atoms as tandem platform for CO2 electroreduction,"Tandem catalysis, capable of decoupling individual steps, provides a feasible way to build a high-efficiency CO2 electroconversion system for multicarbons (C2+). The construction of electrocatalytic materials is one of focusing issues. Herein, we fabricated a single atom involved multivalent oxide-derived Cu composite material and found it inclined to reconstruct into oxygen-deficient multiphase Cu based species hybridized with monatomic Ni on N doped C matrix. In this prototype, rapid CO generation and C–C coupling are successively achieved on NiN4 sites and surface amorphized Cu species with defects, resembling a micro-production line. In this way, the in situ formed tandem catalyst exhibited a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ∼ 78% for C2+ products along with satisfactory durability over 50 h. Particularly, the reconstruction-induced amorphous layer with abundant asymmetric sites should be favorable to improve the ethanol selectivity (FE: 63%), which is about 10 times higher than that of the non-tandem Cu-based contrast material. This work offers a new approach for manipulating tandem catalyst systems towards enhancing C2+ products."
Extending 3D geometric file formats for geospatial applications,"This study addresses the representation and exchange of geospatial geometric 3D models, which is a common requirement in various applications like outdoor mixed reality, urban planning, and disaster risk management. Over the years, multiple file formats have been developed to cater to diverse needs, offering a wide range of supported features and target areas of application. However, classic exchange formats like the JavaScript Object Notation and the Extensible Markup Language have been predominantly favored as a basis for exchanging geospatial information, leaving out common geometric information exchange formats such as Wavefront’s OBJ, Stanford’s PLY, and OFF. To bridge this gap, our research proposes three novel extensions for the mentioned geometric file formats, with a primary focus on minimizing storage requirements while effectively representing geospatial data and also allowing to store semantic meta-information. The extensions, named GeoOBJ, GeoOFF, and GeoPLY, offer significant reductions in storage needs, ranging from 14 to 823% less compared to standard file formats, while retaining support for an adequate number of semantic features. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate the suitability of these proposed extensions for geospatial information representation, showcasing their efficacy in delivering low storage overheads and seamless incorporation of critical semantic features. The findings underscore the potential of GeoOBJ, GeoOFF, and GeoPLY as viable solutions for efficient geospatial data representation, empowering various applications to operate optimally with minimal storage constraints."
Reconstructing patterns of domestication in reindeer using 3D muscle attachment areas,"The use of reindeer has been a crucial element in the subsistence strategies of past Arctic and Subarctic populations. However, the spatiotemporal occurrence of systematic herding practices has been difficult to identify in the bioarchaeological record. To address this research gap, this study proposes a new virtual anthropological approach for reconstructing habitual physical activity in reindeer, relying on the protocols of the “Validated Entheses based Reconstruction of Activity” (VERA) method. Following blind analytical procedures, we focused on eight muscle attachment sites (“entheses”) in 36 reindeer free ranging in the wild, 21 specimens in captivity (zoo), and eight racing reindeer (habitual runners). Importantly, our analyses accounted for the effects of variation by subspecies, sex, age, and estimated body size. Our results showed clear differences across activity groups, leading to the development of discriminant function equations with cross-validated accuracies ranging from approximately 88 to 100%. The reliability of our functions was additionally confirmed using a blind test involving six zoo individuals not included in the initial dataset. Our findings support the use of the proposed approach for identifying domestication-related activities in zooarchaeological contexts, introducing a valuable tool for locating suspected domestication hotspots and elucidating the nature of past human-reindeer interactions."
"Variability of chemical, mineralogical, and morphological attributes of five soils of the Guabirotuba formation","Problematic soils, such as expansive clay-rich soils, need geological and geotechnical assessments before commencing any construction project. The mineralogical composition of the soil plays a crucial role in determining its physical and chemical behavior, ultimately affecting its stability and susceptibility to erosion. This study analyzed the variability of chemical, mineralogical, and morphological attributes of five soils of the Guabirotuba formation. Samples in different areas of Curitiba and the metropolitan region were collected. Chemical composition by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF), mineralogical composition by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and microstructure by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were determined. The results showed that the five soils have a similar chemical composition, with silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide being the main constituents. The mineralogical composition varied in all analyzed soils. However, they belong to the same geological formation, and certain conditions, such as weathering, pressure, cation exchange, and climate, may differ in their mineralogy. Four of the five soils analyzed showed low expansion capacity due to kaolinite, characterized by low swelling potential and water adsorption capacity. On the other hand, one of the soils presented expansive potential because it did not have the presence of kaolinite in its mineralogical composition. Finally, the variability of soil characteristics changes from one place to another. Although they have similar chemical compositions, the cation exchange and mineralogical composition contribute to the development of several behaviors that can be useful for decision-making about the destination of said soil."
Terahertz spectroscopy of paper to low temperatures,"The terahertz spectrum of paper has been measured from room temperature to cryogenic temperatures. As the paper is cooled, the main absorption lines move to higher frequencies. The same behaviour is observed for two types of paper. The spectrum at base temperature provides the most direct comparison yet with calculations made using density functional theory, which assume the studied material to be at absolute zero temperature. These unique experiments should spur the development of better theoretical models of cellulose and cognate materials."
CrackUnet: a novel network with joint network-in-network structure and deformable convolution for pavement crack detection,"Automatic pavement crack detection is a critical technique in the intelligent transportation system, which can effectively replace the person with a machine to detect the pavement crack automatically. This task is excellently challenging due to the tiny texture and the various shapes of each crack object. Previous crack detection networks mainly aim to perform complicated multi-scale feature fusion to learn the semantic information of cracks. However, the typical symmetrical networks with high-to-low resolution are undesirable to extract detailed crack texture information, and these existing methods cannot effectively deal with the issue of the various shapes.This paper proposes a novel end-to-end U-shaped convolutional neural network, termed CrackUNet, for the pavement crack detection task. To extract the information of the tiny texture, we design a novel network-in-network structure, which can enlarge the receptive field and obtain multi-scale features by putting a sub-network into each convolutional layer. Besides, to handle the issue of the various shapes for the crack object, we exploit the deformable convolution to capture contextual information of each crack, which can further improve the performance of crack detection. We train and evaluate the proposed CrackUNet on three public pavement crack datasets. The quantitative experimental results illustrate that our network outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods with almost the same efficiency. Specifically, the precision, recall, and F1-score of the CrackUNet are approximately 92.27%, 93.99%, and 92.94%, respectively."
Evaluating the Interrater Reliability of the Icelandic Version of K-SADS-PL DSM-5,"The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL) is a valuable tool for diagnosing mental disorders in children and adolescents. Previous studies have examined its interrater reliability, but there is limited information on individual disorders, on the updated DSM-5 version. This study aims to analyse the interrater reliability of the Icelandic translation of K-SADS-PL, DSM-5 version. K-SADS-PL was administered to a clinical sample of outpatients from the Icelandic Anxiety Centre for Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults, and The Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Landspítali, the National University Hospital in Reykjavík, Iceland. In total, 135 patients aged 6–18 were included in this study. We assessed the interrater reliability using Cohen’s κ, with results ranging from poor to excellent (0.3–1.0), though most disorders showed excellent reliability (κ > 0.75). The Icelandic translation of the DSM-5 K-SADS-PL is generally reliable when used by properly trained post-graduate students, which supports its use in clinical settings."
"The implication of atmospheric aerosols on rainfall over Malawi, Southeast Africa","Understanding the driving factors for the change of climatic patterns is crucial for the implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures. Significant effort has been made to understand changes in climatic patterns; however, less has been done to investigate the driving factors that influence the trends of early rainfall over Malawi. Hence, a substantial research gap exists concerning in the implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures. The present study investigates the implications of atmospheric aerosols on precipitation during the early rainfall season over Malawi. Open burning, such as bushfires and burning of crop residues by local farmers, are the major anthropogenic activities enhancing aerosol accumulation in the atmosphere and hence need to be strictly controlled over the domain and the surrounding region. The present results show that rainfall generally starts between October and November and gradually increases with the maximum observed in January and ends in March in most areas. Monthly aerosol optical depth (AOD550) has an opposite pattern to that of rainfall with high AOD550 (>0.4) between September and October, mostly over southern areas and along with Lake Malawi. An analysis of rainfall during the beginning of the season indicates a significant decrease of rainfall over the southern areas of Malawi, associated with high AOD550, while insignificant change is observed over the central and northern areas associated with low AOD550 values. Statistical analyses among AOD550, cloud effective radius (CER), and precipitation demonstrates that negative trends of rainfall are strongly associated with a high concentration of anthropogenic aerosols from biomass burning during October. These aerosols might have absorbed excess moisture and disrupted local convective processes associated with the first rainfall that the domain receives, between the months of October and November. Therefore, regional control measures are required to reduce the excess emissions of anthropogenic aerosols into the atmosphere, such as controlling open burning during the active fire period (July-October)."
Irrelevant Emotional Information Does Not Modulate Response Conflict in Mindfulness Meditators,"Although mindfulness improves executive control and emotional processing, its impact on conflict resolution—an essential executive function—in emotionally irrelevant contexts is unclear. The present study investigated the interactive role of mindfulness and task-irrelevant emotional information in conflict resolution."

"Therapeutic Physical Properties, Photocatalytic, and Anti-bacterial Activities of Hydrothermally Fabricated Cu-doped ZnO NPs","A hydrothermal process is applied to fabricate copper-doped dilute magnetic semiconductor nanorods Zn1 − xCuxO (x = 3%). The influence of reaction pH value and synthesis temperature was evaluated on their physical properties’ anti-bacterial and photocatalytic activities. XRD denouements imply that the material is crystalline and exhibits hexagonal wurtzite geometry whose crystallinity reduces from 29.86 to 26.1 nm and enhances from 29.86 to 34.83 nm with increasing pH value and synthesis temperature, respectively. The material morphology was switched from nanorods to nanowires, and a blue shift from 3.14 to 3.28 eV was noticed in the optical bandgap along with shifting in various vibrations. The dielectric and electrical measurements showed similar behavior, whereas the relative permeability and saturation magnetization were knocked off by increasing pH value and temperature. The photocatalytic activity results showed the maximum degradation of MO dye (95%) under sunlight using the Cu-doped ZnO synthesized at pH 13 and 130 °C. All the samples were found active to inhibit the growth of bacterial strains."
"Synthesis of Ag2O-TiO2-Kaolinite Clay Nanocomposite for Efficient Removal of Mn2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, and Pb2+ and Pathogens in Mining Wastewater","Synthesis of Ag2O-TiO2-kaolinite clay nanocomposite was undertaken to eliminate some selected heavy metals released into the environment from mining wastewater. Silver nitrate and titanium-tetra-isopropoxide were employed as the bulk reagents for the Ag2O-TiO2 nanoparticles synthesis, using an aqueous extract of Parkia biglobossa leaf (green synthesis method). The Ag2O-TiO2 nanoparticles were supported on acid-activated kaolinite clay via wet impregnation method, to develop the nanocomposite and were characterized for phase structure, morphology, and oxidation states. The functionality of the nanocomposite for the sequestration of Mn2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, and Pb2+ ions from mining wastewater was examined by adsorption studies. The XRD pattern of the Ag2O-TiO2-kaolinite clay reveals the synthesis of the rutile phase of TiO2 embedded in the kaolinite clay. While the HRSEM shows an evenly distributed arrangement of hemispherical stacks of kaolinites. The oxidation states of Ag2O and TiO2 revealed by the XPS are + 1 and + 4 respectively either as binary or ternary nanocomposite. The Ag2O-TiO2-clay nanocomposite adsorbed 99.85%, 97.85% 95.18%, and 40% of Mn2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, and Pb2+ ions at 120 min from the mining wastewater respectively. The synergetic efforts of the Ag2O-TiO2-clay were responsible for the adsorptive capability of the nanocomposite for the removal of the selected heavy metal ions."
Accurate solutions of interval linear quadratic regulator optimal control problems with fractional-order derivative,"In this study, the goal is to obtain optimal solutions for fractional interval linear quadratic regulator problems. The major contribution made in this paper is to apply an indirect approach based on the interval calculus of variations with a joint application of constrained interval arithmetic to transcribe the fractional problem under study into a system of Volterra integral equations. To do so, we present the fractional interval Pontryagin’s minimum principle for the extraction of necessary optimality conditions. The obtained conditions are first transformed into a system of Volterra integral equations and then using the Laplace transform method, we solve these equations and obtain the optimal solutions. One of the key points of this method is to keep the continuous form of the problems, which we can change to an equivalent form without discretizing it and proving the existence of its solution. Some numerical examples are carried out to confirm the standard criteria with theoretically accurate results."
TRIOBP modulates β-catenin signaling by regulation of miR-29b in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal and devastating lung disease of unknown etiology, described as the result of multiple cycles of epithelial cell injury and fibroblast activation. Despite this impressive increase in understanding, a therapy that reverses this form of fibrosis remains elusive. In our previous study, we found that miR-29b has a therapeutic effect on pulmonary fibrosis. However, its anti-fibrotic mechanism is not yet clear. Recently, our study identified that F-Actin Binding Protein (TRIOBP) is one of the target genes of miR-29b and found that deficiency of TRIOBP increases resistance to lung fibrosis in vivo. TRIOBP knockdown inhibited the proliferation of epithelial cells and attenuated the activation of fibroblasts. In addition, deficiency of Trio Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (TRIO) in epithelial cells and fibroblasts decreases susceptibility to lung fibrosis. TRIOBP interacting with TRIO promoted abnormal epithelial–mesenchymal crosstalk and modulated the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of β-catenin. We concluded that the miR-29b‒TRIOBP–TRIO–β-catenin axis might be a key anti-fibrotic axis in IPF to regulate lung regeneration and fibrosis, which may provide a promising treatment strategy for lung fibrosis."
Relative importance of VECTRI model parameters in the malaria disease transmission and prevalence,"In this study, a sensitivity analysis on a VECTRI dynamical model of malaria transmission is investigated to determine the relative importance of model parameters to disease transmission and prevalence. Apart from being most climatic prone, Odisha is a highly endemic state for malaria in India. The lack in sufficient modeling studies severely impacts the malarial process studies which further hinder the possibility of malaria early warning systems and preventive measures to be undertaken beforehand. Therefore, modeling studies and investigating the relationship between malaria transmission process studies and associated climatic factors are the need of the hour. Environmental conditions have pronounced effects on the malaria transmission dynamics and abundance of the poikilothermic vectors, but the exact relationship of sensitivity for these parameters is not well established. Sensitivity analysis is a useful tool for ascertaining model responses to different input variables. Therefore, in order to perform the requisite study, a dynamical model, VECTRI, is utilized. The study period ranges from 2000 to 2013, where several sensitivity tests are performed using different model parameters such as infiltration and evaporation rate loss of ponds, degree-days for parasite development, threshold temperature for parasite development, threshold temperature for egg development in the vector, and maximum and minimum temperature for larvae survival. The experiments suggest that the lower value of minimum temperature for larvae survival (rlarv_tmin), i.e., 16 °C, provides higher vector density and entomological inoculation rate (EIR) values. EIR reaches its maximum, when the threshold temperature for parasite development (rtsporo) is 22 °C and degree-days for parasite development (dsporo) is 8 degree-days. No change is observed in the vector density; even when rtsporo is 30 °C, values of EIR are close to 0. A successive increment of infiltration and evaporation rate loss of ponds (rwaterfrac evap126) values from 130 to 200 mm/day result in approximately 5% consistent decline in vector density and EIR. The study concludes that the most sensitive parameters are dsporo, rlarv_tmin, and rwaterfrac evap126. The VECTRI model is rather insensitive to maximum temperature for larvae survival (rlarv_tmin) for vector density and EIR variables. Further certain modifications and improvements are required in VECTRI to predict out variables like vector density and EIR more accurately in highly endemic region."
"Hydrothermal monazite and xenotime chemistry as genetic discriminators for intrusion-related and orogenic gold deposits: implications for an orogenic origin of the Pogo gold deposit, Alaska","Attempts to geochemically distinguish between metamorphic-hydrothermal systems that form orogenic gold deposits and both reduced and oxidized magmatic-hydrothermal systems using isotopes or metal associations have proven ambiguous, particularly for orogenic gold and reduced intrusion-related gold systems. The absence of conclusive geochemical discriminators and the overlap in geologic characteristics have led to gold deposit models being potentially incorrectly applied, which in turn negatively affect regional mineral exploration and mine planning. In this study, in situ electron microprobe geochemical analyses of hydrothermal monazite and xenotime crystals associated with different types of gold-bearing deposits are shown to be effective geochemical discriminators. There are notable differences in mineral chemistry such as rare earth element (REE) profiles, total light REE, Dy, Er, Pr, Y, Nd/Sm, and La/Sm that distinguish monazite precipitated from metamorphic-hydrothermal fluids that form orogenic gold deposits and those precipitated from magmatic-hydrothermal fluids that form both porphyry Cu-Mo-Au and reduced intrusion-related gold deposits. Notable differences in overall xenotime abundances and concentrations of heavy REEs, Ca, and Sc are distinctive between the different deposit classes for xenotime. The origin of the controversially classified Pogo gold deposit, Tintina gold province, Alaska, which has been characterized as both a reduced intrusion-related and an orogenic gold deposit, is tested based upon the noted chemical differences associated with these hydrothermal phosphates. The findings of this study have implications for exploration and mine development in the Tintina gold province and other areas that contain deposits that are controversially classified as either orogenic or as magmatic-hydrothermal gold deposits."
Characterization of Microstructure and Tensile Properties of a New Alumina-Forming Austenitic Alloy at High Temperatures,"High temperature structural materials are essential for the proper function of ultra-supercritical power generation devices. The natural reductions in strength and elongation of the material at high temperatures of operation (from 600 to 750 °C) reduce the service life of the generator. In this research, a novel alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless alloy was produced and studied as a promising option for such devices. After the design and production of the novel AFA alloy, detailed mechanical tests were conducted at elevated temperatures. The evolution of the fracture morphology, microstructure, and phase transformation was evaluated at different temperatures. According to an analysis of the microstructure, the strengthening mechanism of the alloy was a combination of solution strengthening and dislocation strengthening. Through dynamic recovery, the density of the dislocations decreased and the degree of work-hardening reduced, leading to a decrease in the strength with an increase in the temperature. The segregation of Fe and Cr at the grain boundary made the grain boundary brittle and caused ductility reduction. The electron backscatter diffraction results also showed reductions of the ratio of low-angle grain boundaries and the mean number of geometrically necessary dislocations. However, this novel AFA kept a high tensile strength and a large elongation at 750 °C, which confirmed it as a good option for ultra-supercritical power generation devices."

Taiji-TianQin-LISA network: Precisely measuring the Hubble constant using both bright and dark sirens,"In the coming decades, the space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors such as Taiji, TianQin, and LISA are expected to form a network capable of detecting millihertz GWs emitted by the mergers of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs). In this work, we investigate the potential of GW standard sirens from the Taiji-TianQin-LISA network in constraining cosmological parameters. For the optimistic scenario in which electromagnetic (EM) counterparts can be detected, we predict the number of detectable bright sirens based on three different MBHB population models, i.e., pop III, Q3d, and Q3nod. Our results show that the Taiji-TianQin-LISA network alone could achieve a constraint precision of 0.9% for the Hubble constant, meeting the standard of precision cosmology. Moreover, the Taiji-TianQin-LISA network could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the CMB data, particularly in the dynamical dark energy models. When combined with the CMB data, the joint CMB+Taiji-TianQin-LISA data offer σ(w) = 0.036 in the wCDM model, which is close to the latest constraint result obtained from the CMB+SN data. We also consider a conservative scenario in which EM counterparts are not available. Due to the precise sky localizations of MBHBs by the Taiji-TianQin-LISA network, the constraint precision of the Hubble constant is expected to reach 1.2%. In conclusion, the GW standard sirens from the Taiji-TianQin-LISA network will play a critical role in helping solve the Hubble tension and shedding light on the nature of dark energy."
Season affects the estrogen system and the immune response of common carp,"The physiology of ectothermic animals, including fish, is strictly regulated by season-related external factors such as temperature or photoperiod. The immune response and the production of hormones, such as estrogens, are therefore also subject to seasonal changes. This study in common carp aimed to determine how the season affects the estrogen system and the immune response, including the antibacterial response during Aeromonas salmonicida infection. We compared the immune reaction in spring and autumn in the head kidney and liver and found that carp have higher levels of blood 17β-estradiol in autumn, while in the liver of these fish there is a higher constitutive expression of genes encoding vitellogenin, estrogen receptors and Cyp19 aromatase than in spring. Fish sampled in autumn also exhibited higher expression of immune-related genes in the liver. In contrast, in the head kidney from fish sampled in the autumn, the expression of genes encoding estrogen receptors and aromatase was lower than in spring, and a similar profile of expression was also measured in the head kidney for inos, arginases and il-10. In turn, during bacterial infection, we observed higher upregulation of the expression of inos, il-12p35, ifnγ-2, arginase 2 and il-10 in the liver of carp sampled in spring. In the liver of carp infected in spring a higher upregulation of the expression of the genes encoding CRPs was observed compared to fish infected during autumn. The opposite trend occurred in the head kidney, where the upregulation of the expression of the genes involved in the immune response was higher in fish infected in autumn than in those infected in spring. During the infection, also season-dependent changes occurred in the estrogen system. In conclusion, we demonstrated that season differentially affects the estrogenic and immune activity of the head kidney and liver. These results reinforce our previous findings that the endocrine and immune systems cooperate in maintaining homeostasis and fighting infection."
Optimization of process parameters for bio-crude and value-added chemical recovery through hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae,"Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising conversion technique utilized in converting microalgal biomass into value-added products like bio-crude and bio-char. On processing this bio-crude based on the applications leads to biofuel, aqueous phase, and value-added chemicals which have many applications. For this study, Nannochloropsis oculata (NO), Chlorella vulgaris (CV), and Arthrospira platensis (AP) were selected for bio-crude production using the HTL process. The process parameters like temperature (250–300 °C), residence time (30–60 min), and microalgae to water loading ratio (4–10) were chosen using Box-Behnken design using response surface methodology to obtain maximum bio-crude yield. A total of 17 experiments for each microalga were conducted for optimization of process parameters. The study suggested it is a quadratic model that fits all three process parameters interacting with each other and having R-squared values of 0.9704 (NO), 0.9827 (CV), and 0.9884 (AP). For NO, the highest yield of 53.78% was obtained (280 °C, 60 min, 9.5); similarly, the maximum yield of 48.04% (290 °C, 60 min, 10) and 44.65% (278 °C, 57min, 7.5) was obtained for CV and AP. GC-MS analysis of bio-crude showed the presence of major compounds like phenol, alcohols, acids, and esters. Elemental analysis for the bio-crude was performed and NO had a higher HHV value of 39.85 MJ/kg followed by CV (33.88 MJ/kg) and AP (32.47 MJ/kg)."
Development and utilization of raw and NaOH-modified peanut hull as potential adsorbents for crystal violet dye removal from wastewater,"This study examines the effectiveness of raw peanut hull (PHR) and NaOH-modified peanut hull (PHN) adsorbents in removing crystal violet (CV) dye from wastewater. Several analytical methods, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDAX), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), proximate and component analyses, and point of zero charge (pHPZC), were employed to characterize the prepared adsorbents. Analyses revealed that PHN exhibited a higher cellulose and fixed carbon content than PHR. Additionally, PHN had lower levels of hemicellulose, lignin, ash, volatile matter, moisture, and extractive content. Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of various parameters, viz., adsorbent dosages, contact duration, pH, starting dye concentration, and temperature. Various isotherm and kinetic models were employed to analyze and interpret the experimental data. Among these, the Langmuir isotherm and the pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetic models were the most accurate in describing the adsorption behavior of both adsorbents. The thermodynamic analysis indicated that the adsorption of CV onto both adsorbents was spontaneous and endothermic. The process was accompanied by an increase in entropy. Both adsorbents, PHR and PHN, notably utilized for four successful adsorption–desorption cycles using hydrochloric acid (HCl) as an eluent. The present work demonstrates the fruitful utilization of waste material to treat polluted wastewater. The additional benefits of easy synthesis, low cost, and reusability of the PHN for several cycles make it novel."
Transforming crustacean waste into a powerful antibacterial nanocomposite: unveiling the synergistic potential of novel copper doped zinc oxide–carbon dot nanocomposite,"Ensuring environmental sustainability and longevity heavily relies on the reutilization of waste materials. This study utilizes Crustacean waste to fabricate fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CQDS) employing facile hydrothermal method. The obtained results showed that the prepared CQDs have spherical structures (with an average diameter of 8–9 nm) exhibiting green fluorescence. A novel antibacterial nanocomposite (ZnO-Cu@CQD) comprising the synthesized CQD and copper (Cu)-doped zinc oxide (ZnO) was fabricated and characterized. neem (Azadirachta indica) leaf extract is used in the study to synthesize zinc oxide (ZnO) particles in a simple and environmentally benign manner. ZnO nanoparticles exhibit free radical-induced antibacterial activity when exposed to light. This is further enhanced by doping with antibacterial copper metal. To achieve even greater antibacterial efficacy, we combined the copper-doped zinc oxide with the carbon quantum dots obtained from crustacean waste to create the ZnO-Cu@CQD nanocomposite. Comprehensive characterization of the ZnO-Cu@CQD composite using XRD, FTIR, UV, PL, and TEM affirmed its enhanced light absorption across UV and visible spectra, its tunable fluorescence, and the successful amalgamation of CQDs into the Cu-doped ZnO matrix. The composite enhanced light absorption in the UV and visible spectra and tunable fluorescence in PL spectra. FTIR and XRD analyses confirm the composite’s specific functional groups and the successful integration of CQDs into the Cu-doped ZnO matrix; XRD patterns and HRTEM studies validate the successful integration of CQDs into the Cu-doped ZnO matrix, indicating a Cu-doped ZnO nanoparticle surface incorporated with CQD to obtain nanocomposite. The biocompatibility of this composite was assessed by evaluating its cytotoxicity against human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells. The composite showed non-cytotoxic behavior up to a dose of 50 μg/ml, with over 75% cell survival during a 24-h incubation, as determined by the MTT assay. Moreover, the new ZnO-Cu@CQD nanocomposite exhibited significantly improved antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (S. aureus) and gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria. This low-cost fabrication of the novel nanocomposite has the potential to develop affordable and effective antibacterial agents, which can also be employed in wastewater treatment without any harmful side effects."
Investigation of diaphragma juglandis fructus extract fortified edible coating on the storage stability of walnut kernels,"This study investigated the potential of utilizing diaphragma juglandis fructus (DJF) extract in an edible film for packaging walnut kernels and its impact on storage stability. The antioxidant activity value and total phenolic content of the DJF extract found between 73.63 and 74.77 mg TE/g DW and between 44.08 and 59.46 mg GAE/g DW, respectively. Different film-forming polymers were evaluated and the DJF extract addition gain to antioxidant properties to sodium caseinate (SC + DJF) and starch-based (S + DJF) films. DJF addition changes the film color values and SC + DJF film was selected for walnut kernel coating due to its favorable mechanical properties. Walnut samples were packaged with or without nanocomposite films and the edible coating. Initially, six aldehyde components were identified in walnut kernels, with a total aldehyde concentration of 237 μg/kg. After 5 months of storage, nine aldehyde compounds were detected, with higher concentrations in unpackaged samples. Sensory analysis showed that ZnO-containing LDPE film in packaging, as well as through edible coating, might be applied to the preservation of walnut kernel color and taste under applied storage conditions. In conclusion, the study highlights the potential of DJF as a valuable resource to enhance active edible film and coating applications."
A Guide to an Iterative Approach to Model-Based Decision Making in Health and Medicine: An Iterative Decision-Making Framework,"Decision makers frequently face decisions about optimal resource allocation. A model-based economic evaluation can be used to guide decision makers in their choices by systematically evaluating the magnitude of expected health effects and costs of decision options and by making trade-offs explicit. We provide a guide to an iterative approach to the medical decision-making process by following a coherent framework, and outline the overarching iterative steps of model-based decision making. We systematized the framework by performing three steps. First, we compiled the existing guidelines provided by the ISPOR-SMDM Modeling Good Research Practices Task Force, and the ISPOR Value of Information Task Force. Second, we identified other previous work related to frameworks and guidelines for model-based decision analyses through a literature search in PubMed. Third, we assessed the role of the evidence and iterative process in decision making and formalized key steps in a model-based decision-making framework. We provide guidance on an iterative approach to medical decision making by applying the compiled iterative model-based decision-making framework. The framework formally combines the decision problem conceptualization (Part I), the model conceptualization and development (Part II), and the process of model-based decision analysis (Part III). Following the overarching steps of the framework ensures compliance to the principles of evidence-based medicine and regular updates of the evidence, given that value of information analysis represents an essential component of model-based decision analysis in the framework. Following the provided guide and the steps outlined in the framework can help inform various health care decisions, and therefore it has the potential to improve decision making."
"Robust, Co-design Exploration of Multilevel Product, Material, and Manufacturing Process Systems","Achieving targeted product performance requires the integrated exploration of design spaces across multiple levels of decision-making in systems comprising products, materials, and manufacturing processes—product-material-manufacturing process (PMMP) systems. This demands the capability to co-design PMMP systems, that is, share ranged sets of design solutions among distributed product, material, and manufacturing process designers. PMMP systems are subject to uncertainties in processing, microstructure, and models employed. Facilitating co-design requires support for simultaneously exploring high-dimensional design spaces across multiple levels under uncertainty. In this paper, we present the Co-Design Exploration of Multilevel PMMP systems under Uncertainty (CoDE-MU) framework to facilitate the simultaneous exploration of high-dimensional design spaces across multiple levels under uncertainty. The CoDE-MU framework is a machine learning-enhanced, robust co-design exploration framework that integrates robust, coupled compromise Decision Support Problem (rc-cDSP) construct with interpretable Self-Organizing Maps (iSOM). The framework supports multidisciplinary designers to (i) understand the multilevel interactions, (ii) identify the process mechanisms that affect material and product responses, and (iii) provide decision support for problems involving many goals with different behaviors across multiple levels and uncertainty. We use an industry-inspired hot rod rolling (HRR) steel manufacturing process chain problem to showcase the CoDE-MU framework’s efficacy in facilitating the simultaneous exploration of the product, material, and manufacturing process design spaces across multiple levels under uncertainty. The framework is generic and facilitates the co-design of multilevel PMMP systems characterized by hierarchical product-material-manufacturing process relations and many goals with different behaviors that must be realized simultaneously at individual levels."
Graphic-enhanced collision detection for robotic manufacturing applications in complex environments,"High-performance collision detection is the key to achieving automatic trajectory planning and secure motion control for industrial robots. However, most existing solutions reported thus far are difficult to guarantee computational accuracy and efficiency simultaneously when it comes to complex manufacturing environments. Therefore, this work presents a graphic-enabled collision detection method for robotic manufacturing applications in complex environments. With this method, a collision detection model that can be applied to arbitrarily complex polyhedrons is first established by using graphics depth peeling technology. A rapid collision detection algorithm utilizing a programmable graphics pipeline of GPU is developed. Then, the proposed collision detection model is extended to robotic manufacturing applications in complex environments. The effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method are verified through comparative simulation experiments, which have shown that the authors’ method can greatly improve the computational efficiency, robustness, and memory consumption when compared with the existing methods, showing great application potential in collision-free trajectory planning and motion planning for robotic manufacturing applications in complex environments."
Rhodamine-based Fluorescent Probe With Quick Response and High Selectivity for Imaging Labile Ferrous Iron in Living Cells and Zebrafish,"The transition between its various oxidation states of Iron plays a crucial part in various chemical transformation of cells. Misregulation of iron can give rise to the iron-catalyzed reactive oxygen species disorder which have been linked to a variety of diseases, so it is crucial to monitor the labile iron pool in vivo for clinical diagnosis. According to iron autoxidation and hydrogen abstraction reaction, we reported a novel “off-on” fluorescent probe to response to ferrous (Fe2+) both in solutions and biological systems. The probe responds to Fe2+ with good selectivity toward competing metal ions. What’s more, the probe presents significant fluorescent enhancement to Fe2+ in less than 1 min, making real-time sensing in biological system possible. The applications of the probe in bioimaging revealed the changes in labile iron pool by iron autoxidation or diverse stimuli."
SGLT2 Inhibitors for Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction: What Hospitalists Need to Know,
An iterative and shrinking generalized ridge regression for ill-conditioned geodetic observation equations,"In geodesy, Tikhonov regularization and truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) are commonly used to derive a well-defined solution for ill-conditioned observation equations. However, as single-parameter regularization methods, they may face some limitations in application due to their lack of flexibility. In this contribution, a kind of multiparameter regularization method is considered, called generalized ridge regression (GRR). Generally, GRR projects observations into several orthogonal spectral domains and then uses different regularization parameters to minimize the mean squared error of the estimated parameters in corresponding spectral domains. To find suitable regularization parameters for GRR, an iterative and shrinking generalized ridge regression (IS-GRR) is proposed. The IS-GRR procedure starts by introducing a predetermined approximation of unknown parameters. Subsequently, in each spectral domain, the signal and noise of the observations are estimated in an iterative and shrinking manner, and the regularization parameters are updated according to the estimated signal-to-noise ratio. Compared to conventional regularization schemes, IS-GRR has the following advantages: Tikhonov regularization usually oversmooths signals in the low-spectral domains and undersuppresses noise in the high-spectral domains, whereas TSVD usually undersuppresses noise in the low-spectral domains and oversmooths signals in the high-spectral domains. However, IS-GRR strikes a balance between retaining signals and suppressing noise in different spectral domains, thereby exhibiting better performance. Two experiments (simulation and mascon modelling examples) verify the effectiveness of IS-GRR for solving ill-conditioned equations in geodesy."
Development of brimonidine niosomes laden contact lenses for extended release and promising delivery system in glaucoma treatment,"Increased intraocular pressure is a common symptom of glaucoma. In severe circumstances, it may result in loss of eyesight. Glaucoma treatment is difficult due to ocular physiological barriers that prevent medications from reaching the afflicted area. Traditional formulations (eye drops) have a short residence period and are rapidly drained away via the nasolacrimal duct, resulting in increased adverse drug responses and lower efficacy. The usage of nanoparticles such as niosomes could be one potential answer to these problems. While niosomes improve drug penetration, they have little effect on ocular retention of the medication. Contact lenses containing niosomes can assist to overcome this disadvantage."
Enantioselective Fluorescence Recognition of Free α-Amino Acids by Ion-Type Ammonium Salt-Based Sensors,"Optically pure amino acids have extensive applications in pharmaceuticals, pesticides, food, materials, and other fields. Enantiomers recognition of chiral amino acids using optical methods with synthetic chiral sensors has attracted extensive attention. Most reported sensors typically identify guests by covalent or hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interaction with amino acids and their derivatives. In this paper, a series of ion-type quaternary ammonium salt-based enantioselective fluorescent sensors were synthesized for chiral recognition of free α-amino acids via electrostatic interaction. The fluorescence intensity ratios ID/IL (ID, IL, fluorescence intensity of sensor when treated with D- or L-amino acid) were up to 2.1 and enantioselective fluorescence enhancement ratios ef (ef=[IL−I0]/[ID−I0] or [ID−I0]/[IL−I0]. (I0, fluorescence intensity of the sensor)) were up to 5.0. Among them, sensor 3 showed best enantioselective recognition performance toward tryptophan (Trp), and L-Trp significantly quenched the fluorescence of sensor 3, but D-Trp greatly enhanced the fluorescence of sensor 3, its ID/IL was 2.11 and ef was 1.8. The mechanistic investigation by NMR spectrum revealed that a tight three-point interaction, including electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bond, and π-π stacking, between sensor 3 and D-Trp was formed."
Perception of illusory contours in children and adults: An eye-tracking study,"The eye-tracking study investigated the perception of subjective Kanizsa and Ehrenstein figures in adults and in children aged 3–4, 5–6, 7–8, and 9–11 years of age. More specifically, the distribution of looking at the inner stimulus part versus the inducing elements was measured for illusory figures, figures with real contours, and control displays. It was hypothesized that longer looking at the inner area of the illusory figures indicates global contour interpolation, whereas longer looking at the inducing elements indicates a local processing mode. According to the results, participants of all ages looked longer at the illusory Kanizsa and Ehrenstein contours than at the figures’ inducing elements. However, performance was lowest in the children aged 3–4 years and increased during the preschool period. Moreover, the illusory contour displays elicited comparable visual responses as did the real contour displays. The use of the control displays that contained no contour information ensured that the participants’ looking behavior was not driven by a spontaneous tendency to attend to the inner stimulus parts. The study confirms the view that sensitivity to illusory contours emerges very early in life."

Die Studien befassten sich mit dem Verständnis von Gesundheitsförderung im Alltag von Studierenden aus physischer, psychischer und sozialer Perspektive. Das Ziel des Projekts war die Anwendung der Methode und die kritische Reflexion dieser im Kontext der Chancen und Herausforderungen partizipativer Ansätze."
de Sitter-eating O-planes in supercritical string theory,"It has been proposed that flux compactifications of supercritical string theories (i.e., with spacetime dimension D > 10) have dS vacua, with large D acting as a control parameter for corrections to the classical spacetime effective action. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the self-consistency of such models, focussing on α′ and backreaction corrections. We first show that all supercritical AdS, Minkowski and dS vacua in this setting have \( \gtrsim \mathcal{O}(1) \) curvature and/or field strengths in the string frame. This may be in tension with suppressing α′ corrections unless the coefficients of the higher-derivative terms have a sufficiently strong large-D suppression. We then argue that an additional and more severe problem arises in the dS case due to the backreaction of O-planes. In particular, we argue using a combination of geometric bounds and string-theory constraints that the O-plane backreaction is large in supercritical dS models. This implies that a large part of the naive classical geometry is eaten up by singular holes and thus indicates a breakdown of the classical description. Our finding resonates with several other recent results suggesting that string theory does not admit dS vacua in regimes where string and backreaction corrections are under control. As byproducts of our analysis, we derive a number of technical results that are useful beyond the specific applications in this paper. In particular, we compute the leading backreaction corrections to the smeared solution in a general flux compactification from D to d dimensions for an arbitrary distribution of O-planes and D-branes. We further argue for a general estimate for Green’s functions on compact manifolds (and therefore for the backreaction corrections) in terms of their diameter, volume and dimension."
Hydrological conditions of phytophilic fish reproduction in the Lower Don River under the influence of climate change and flow regulation,"Despite the significant role that the Lower Don plays in Russia’s fishing industry, the region’s fisheries remain in a depressed state. It is well understood that the Tsimlyansk reservoir impacts the region’s fisheries, but the potential influence of climate change and associated reductions in snowmelt water flow remains under debate. The present study provides the first investigation of the effects of reservoir management and reduction in snowmelt water flow due to global warming on fish spawning independently. Using estimates of water discharge in the lower reaches of the Don, in the absence of the Tsimlyansk reservoir, the results showed that climate-related factors, although still significant, had a smaller effect on water discharge, compared with reservoir management regimes. Hydrological characteristics affecting fish reproduction (i.e., water discharge, water level, area and duration of floodplain inundation, and fingerling abundance) are decreasing under the reservoir influence by a factor of 1.5–3.2, while the declines associated with climate change are a factor of 1.4–2.1. Artificial fish reproduction and improvements in management of the Tsimlyansk reservoir could lead to restoration of fish stocks in the Lower Don."
