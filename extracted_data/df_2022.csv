Biochemical Property Based Positional Matrix: A New Approach Towards Genome Sequence Comparison,"The growth of the genome sequence has become one of the emerging areas in the study of bioinformatics. It has led to an excessive demand for researchers to develop advanced methodologies for evolutionary relationships among species. The alignment-free methods have been proved to be more efficient and appropriate related to time and space than existing alignment-based methods for sequence analysis. In this study, a new alignment-free genome sequence comparison technique is proposed based on the biochemical properties of nucleotides. Each genome sequence can be distributed in four parameters to represent a 21-dimensional numerical descriptor using the Positional Matrix. To substantiate the proposed method, phylogenetic trees are constructed on the viral and mammalian datasets by applying the UPGMA/NJ clustering method. Further, the results of this method are compared with the results of the Feature Frequency Profiles method, the Positional Correlation Natural Vector method, the Graph-theoretic method, the Multiple Encoding Vector method, and the Fuzzy Integral Similarity method. In most cases, it is found that the present method produces more accurate results than the prior methods. Also, in the present method, the execution time for computation is comparatively small."
Mediative Mechanism of Freezing/Thawing on Greenhouse Gas Emissions in an Inland Saline-Alkaline Wetland: a Metagenomic Analysis,"Inland saline-alkaline wetlands distributed in the mid-high latitude have repeatedly experienced freezing and thawing. However, the response of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and microbially-mediated carbon and nitrogen cycle to freezing and thawing remains unclear. We monitored the GHG flux in an inland saline-alkaline wetland and found that, compared with the growth period, the average CO2 flux decreased from 171.99 to 76.61–80.71 mg/(m2‧h), the average CH4 flux decreased from 10.72 to 1.96–3.94 mg/(m2‧h), and the average N2O flux decreased from 56.17 to − 27.14 to − 20.70 μg/(m2‧h). Freezing and thawing significantly decreased the relative abundance of functional genes involved in carbon and nitrogen cycles. The aceticlastic methanogenic pathway was the main methanogenic pathway, whereas the Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera was the most abundant methane oxidizer in the wetland. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea and denitrifier belonging to proteobacteria was the major microbial N2O source, while bacteria within clade II nosZ was the major microbial N2O sink. Freezing and thawing reduced the relative abundance of these genes, leading to a decrease in GHG flux."
Frequency shifts in a laterally finite piezoelectric resonator loaded with a viscous liquid layer of finite size,"The free shear vibration in a laterally finite piezoelectric plate loaded with a viscous liquid layer of finite size is investigated in this paper. Considering the lateral edge effect and segmented boundary condition at the solid–liquid interface, a new theoretical solution is obtained using the Fourier series, from which the resonant frequencies and mode shapes are calculated and examined. The convergence of the solution is verified, and the correctness is proved by the finite element method. The results reveal that the vibration in the central part of the sensor decays into lateral boundaries and the liquid layer when contacting with liquid, resulting in a decrease in frequency and an increase in attenuation. Moreover, the effects of liquid thickness, length, viscosity and density on resonant frequency are quantified, which are expected to provide useful data and guidelines for liquid sensor design and development."
Fracture mechanics of an arbitrary position crack emanating from a nano-hole in one-dimensional hexagonal piezoelectric quasicrystals,"The mode III fracture behavior of an arbitrary position crack emanating from a nano-hole in one-dimensional hexagonal piezoelectric quasicrystals is studied. Based on the Gurtin–Murdoch surface theory and the boundary value problems theory, the expressions of the electro-elastic fields and the generalized field intensity factor at the crack tip are obtained. The presented solution can degenerate into existing results. The influences of the hole size, crack location, crack–hole interaction, applied electro-elastic loads and quasicrystal coupling coefficient on the generalized field intensity factor are discussed. The generalized field intensity factor has significant size effects when the surface effect is considered. The influence of the surface effect on the generalized field intensity factor depends on the crack location. The larger the relative size of the crack is, the greater the surface effect is. The effects of applied electro-elastic loads and quasicrystal coupling coefficient on each generalized field intensity factor are quite different."
Neutral coated spheres in nonlinear thermoelectricity,"We construct neutral coated spherical inhomogeneities in a nonlinearly coupled thermoelectric material. The coated spherical inhomogeneity, when inserted into a thermoelectric matrix, does not disturb the prescribed thermoelectric field of uniform electric current density and uniform energy flux along arbitrary directions in the surrounding matrix. Exact expressions for the effective electric and thermal conductivities of two-phase sphere assemblages completely replacing the original thermoelectric matrix are obtained. The most restrictive Hashin–Shtrikman bounds are derived for the effective electric and thermal conductivities of macroscopically homogeneous and isotropic two-phase thermoelectric materials."
Microstructure and color stability of calcium silicate-based dental materials exposed to blood or platelet-rich fibrin,"To investigate the effects of blood and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), commonly used scaffolds in regenerative endodontic treatment (RET), on the hydration, microstructure, and color stability of three hydraulic calcium silicate cements (HCSCs), OrthoMTA, RetroMTA, and TotalFill-BC-RRM."
"Redox Status, Immune Alterations, Histopathology, and Micronuclei Induction in Labeo rohita Dwelling in Polluted River Water","In this study, we measured various parameters of oxidative stress, immune response, and abnormalities in the erythrocyte nucleus of Labeo rohita inhabiting the polluted Kshipra River, India. The river water contains heavy metals in this order: Ni > Fe > Cd > Cr > Mn > Zn > Cu. Fe showed the highest accumulation in gills, liver, and gut, whereas Ni (gills and gut) and Cd (liver) were lowest accumulated. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were found to be increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the gills (SOD: 211%; CAT: 150%), liver (SOD: 447%; CAT: 304%), and gut (SOD: 98.11%; CAT: 58.69%) in comparison with the reference fish. However, glutathione S transferase (GST) showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher activity in the gills (25.5%) but lower activity in the liver (− 49.22%) and the gut (− 30.57%). Moreover, reduced glutathione (GSH) decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in the gills (− 46.66%), liver (− 33.20%), and gut (− 39.87%). Despite the active response of the antioxidant enzymes, the highest lipid peroxidation was observed in the liver (463%). The effect of heavy metals was also observed on the immunity of the fish, causing immunosuppression as evident by significantly (p < 0.05) lower values of acid phosphatase (− 50%), myeloperoxidase (− 48.33%), and nitric oxide synthase (− 50%) in serum. Histopathological findings showed gill lamellae shortening, hyperplasia, club-shaped lamellar tip in exposed gills and necrosis, vacuolization, and pyknosis in the exposed liver. Furthermore, polluted river water was also found to induce micronuclei (2.1%) and lobed nuclei (0.72%) in erythrocytes (0.65%). These results indicate the potential of heavy metal-induced oxidative stress and other forms of stress in inhabiting fish, highlighting the need to control the pollution of this river water."
In Silico and In Vitro Analyses Reveal Promising Antimicrobial Peptides from Myxobacteria,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global concern, and as soon as new antibiotics are introduced, resistance to those agents emerges. Therefore, there is an increased appetite for alternative antimicrobial agents to traditional antibiotics. Here, we used in silico methods to investigate potential antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from predatory myxobacteria. Six hundred seventy-two potential AMP sequences were extracted from eight complete myxobacterial genomes. Most putative AMPs were predicted to be active against Klebsiella pneumoniae with least activity being predicted against Staphylococcus aureus. One hundred seventeen AMPs (defined here as ‘potent putative AMPs’) were predicted to have very good activity against more than two bacterial pathogens, and these were characterized further in silico. All potent putative AMPs were predicted to have anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties, but none was predicted to be active against viruses. Twenty six (22%) of them were predicted to be hemolytic to human erythrocytes, five were predicted to have anticancer properties, and 56 (47%) were predicted to be biofilm active. In vitro assays using four synthesized AMPs showed high MIC values (e.g. So_ce_56_913 250 µg/ml and Coral_AMP411 125 µg/ml against E. coli). However, antibiofilm assays showed a substantial reduction in numbers (e.g. Coral_AMP411 and Myxo_mac104 showed a 69% and 73% reduction, respectively, at the lowest concentration against E. coli) compared to traditional antibiotics. Fourteen putative AMPs had high sequence similarity to proteins which were functionally associated with proteins of known function. The myxobacterial genomes also possessed a variety of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that can encode antimicrobial secondary metabolites, but their numbers did not correlate with those of the AMPs. We suggest that AMPs from myxobacteria are a promising source of novel antimicrobial agents with a plethora of biological properties."
Three-dimensional quantum wavelet transforms,"Wavelet transform is being widely used in the field of information processing. One-dimension and two-dimension quantum wavelet transforms have been investigated as important tool algorithms. However, three-dimensional quantum wavelet transforms have not been reported. This paper proposes a multi-level three-dimensional quantum wavelet transform theory to implement the wavelet transform for quantum videos. Then, we construct the iterative formulas for the multi-level three-dimensional Haar and Daubechies D4 quantum wavelet transforms, respectively. Next, we design quantum circuits of the two wavelet transforms using iterative methods. Complexity analysis shows that the proposed wavelet transforms offer exponential speed-up over their classical counterparts. Finally, the proposed quantum wavelet transforms are selected to realize quantum video compression as a primary application. Simulation results reveal that the proposed wavelet transforms have better compression performance for quantum videos than two-dimension quantum wavelet transforms."
"A new self-assessment tool following shoulder stabilization surgery, the auto-Walch and auto-Rowe questionnaires","Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) are increasingly used for patient evaluation, as well as for scientific research. Few are used for practical purposes in the clinical setting, and few are reliable enough to allow proper feedback to physicians. Two of the most commonly used assessment tools in shoulder instability are the Walch–Duplay and the Rowe scores. The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of self-administered versions of the Walch–Duplay and Rowe scores following shoulder stabilization procedure."
Fortified milk-beverage with amphora algae and its functionality for aflatoxin inactivation in rats,"Aflatoxins are considered a severe hazard, contaminate dietary products, and cause malignant alterations in liver tissues. Fermented milk (FM) is prepared using probiotic lactic acid strains. This investigation aimed to produce an integrated milk beverage, inactivating aflatoxins toxicity and biotransformation. The proximate analysis of the investigated materials and biochemical parameter changes of the in-vivo experiment were determined. Results reflected the extract’s valuable content of polysaccharides and antioxidants. Nine phenolics were identified predominantly with catechin (39.67 ± 1.5 µg/g). FM-fortification is reflected by enhancement in protein (49.5 ± 2.97 g/Kg) and fiber content (1.78 ± 0.54 g/Kg) compared to the FM content. Relative rats’ weight gain improved to 34.29% for the fortified-FM group close to the control; it was recorded at 16.47% for the AFM1 group. Alkaline phosphatase in AFM1 rats was 99.2 ± 1.86 U/L and decreased to 44.2 ± 0.71 U/L in the fortified-FM group (44.2 ± 0.71 U/L) to be close to the control group. Aflatoxin M1 rats exposure reflects tissue alterations and cell damage, which recorded lesser in rats treated by extract and beverage administrations. The beverage’s corrective action relied on two integrated mechanisms, aflatoxin-binding to bacterial and bioactivity interaction of extract substances. This beverage stopped tissue alterations that occurred due to aflatoxins. The result supports the future production of fortified-milk beverages as a bio-shield against aflatoxin toxicity, besides their nutritional and functional properties."
Rapid detection of gingerol and thymol in medicinal foods based on Fe2O3 nanoparticles modified glassy carbon electrode,"Ginger and Ajwain are used extensively in food products, natural medicine to treat certain common diseases and as an immunity booster against viral infections. In this work, we report the fabrication of a novel electrochemical sensor based on α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles for detection and quantification of [6]-Gingerol (GIN) and Thymol (THY) which are water soluble phytochemicals derived from edible herbs Ginger and Ajwain respectively. The α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were synthesised by sol-gel method and its structure and composition were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy studies. The α-Fe2O3 NPs modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of GIN and THY in phosphate buffer saline at pH 7. The α-Fe2O3 modified GCE exhibited the lowest detection limits of 35.2 nM and 24 nM for GIN and THY respectively over the corresponding dynamic ranges of 55.6 nM to 118 µM and 27.8 nM to 56 µM. Detailed interference study confirmed the potential anti-interference ability of the fabricated sensor against a number of potential interfering compounds. Cyclic stability study yielded relative standard deviation (RSD) values of 9.9% and 9.18% for GIN and THY respectively, demonstrating excellent stability of the sensor. Reproducibility of the α-Fe2O3/GCE was investigated by testing a number of electrodes which yielded RSD values of 1.08% and 0.97%, for GIN and THY respectively. These promising characteristic features of the proposed sensor make it suitable for quick and precise detection of GIN and THY in food and natural medicines."
Disease detection and physical disorders classification for citrus fruit images using convolutional neural network,"Citrus is an agricultural product with significant added value in the world. Depending on market demands and causing possible economic losses, disease detection in citrus fruits at an early stage is important as well as for all agricultural products. Therefore, it is critical to detect both early-stage citrus diseases and physically damaged citrus fruits with technological solutions. In this study, a new convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model, CitrusNet, was proposed for the classification of defective and deformed citrus fruits. In this study, 5149 images of citrus fruits were collected from citrus orchards in Antalya, Turkey. In the experiments conducted with four different CNN models, the CitrusNet and ResNet50 models obtained the best classification results. In the other phase of the study, experiments were carried out to detect Alternaria alternata and Thrips diseases, which are common in Turkey, using five different CNN models. In the first phase of the study, a dataset of 3582 images of citrus diseases was obtained. The experimental results show that the YOLOv5 and Mask R-CNN models adequately detected the citrus diseases compared to the other models. These models achieved the best performance with an average precision (AP) of 0.99."
Sevoflurane consumption pattern by individual anaesthesiologists varies widely despite using the same high-end workstations in the same hospital,"Volatile anaesthetics are potent greenhouse gasses but contemporary workstations enable considerable savings while improving patient safety. Institutions may provide this technology to reduce the ecological footprint but proper training and motivation is required to maximize their ecologic and financial benefit. This study aims to compare the sevoflurane consumption of 22 anaesthesiologists in a medium sized hospital 4 years after flow-i workstations (Getinge, Sweden) entered into service, in three airway approaches: intubated patients, laryngeal mask ventilation, and mask anaesthesia. Typical sevoflurane consumption for each anaesthesiologist was defined as the mean cumulative consumption in the chronologically first 50 cases meeting the inclusion criteria for each airway group in 2019. The potential savings, if everyone were to adopt the approach of the more economical anaesthesiologists (15th percentile), was calculated. The CO2 equivalent emissions were calculated using a GWP20 of 702 and a GWP100 of 195. The median [range] consumption after 45 min was 10.9 [7.5–18.4] ml in intubated patients and 9.0 [7.4–15.3] ml in patients with laryngeal mask, and 9.9 [3.4–20.9] ml after 8 min with mask ventilation. This corresponds to a double to six fold consumption between the least and most wasteful approach. The typical CO2 equivalent emissions (GWP20) per anaesthesiologist varied between 8.0 and 19.6 kg/45 min in intubated airways, between 7.9 and 16.3 kg/45 min in LMA, and between 3.6 and 22.3 kg/8 min in mask ventilation. Despite using the same workstations in the same hospital, the typical sevoflurane consumption differed dramatically between 22 anaesthesiologists. In addition to providing advanced workstations, proper education is required to achieve the behavior change needed to reduce the pollution and financial waste associated with volatile anaesthetics."
A Detergent-Compatible Alkaline Metalloprotease from Bacillus pseudofirmus BBAU-19: Characterization and Application,"We isolated a bacterium (BBAU-19) producing alkaline protease from the saline soil of Uttar Pradesh, India. The isolate identified through 16S rRNA gene analysis was Bacillus pseudofirmus. The enzyme production of BBAU-19 was optimum at pH 9 and a temperature of 40 °C. The ammonium sulfate salt partially purified the crude enzyme. The filtered enzyme was analyzed under ion-exchange chromatography through a DEAE-cellulose column. The partially purified enzyme (PPE) activity increased up to ~ 1.92-fold compared to crude protease, and the recovery of protease enzyme was 54.60%. The molecular weight of the PPE was determined to be 42 kDa. The optimum temperature and pH of the PPE were 40 °C and 10.0, respectively. Ca++ and Mg++ ions enhanced the enzyme activity, while Cu++and Na+ ions suppressed it. The presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid completely inhibited the enzyme activity. The findings of this study suggest that the enzyme is a Metallo-type protease in nature. We evaluated the efficiency of alkaline protease by testing its ability to remove stains of the cloth stained with Bradford reagent. The compatibility test with detergents enhanced the commercial use of this enzyme. The PPE (partially purified enzyme) was compatible with Ghadi and Nirma detergents, and the de-staining was maximum with 500 ml of the PPE."
Reconstruction of rabbit mandibular bone defects using carbonate apatite honeycomb blocks with an interconnected porous structure,"Carbonate apatite (CO3Ap) granules are useful as a bone substitute because they can be remodeled to new natural bone in a manner that conforms to the bone remodeling process. However, reconstructing large bone defects using CO3Ap granules is difficult because of their granular shape. Therefore, we fabricated CO3Ap honeycomb blocks (HCBs) with continuous unidirectional pores. We aimed to elucidate the tissue response and availability of CO3Ap HCBs in the reconstruction of rabbit mandibular bone defects after marginal mandibulectomy. The percentages of the remaining CO3Ap area and calcified bone area (newly formed bone) were estimated from the histological images. CO3Ap area was 49.1 ± 4.9%, 30.3 ± 3.5%, and 25.5 ± 8.8%, whereas newly formed bone area was 3.0 ± 0.6%, 24.3 ± 3.3%, and 34.7 ± 4.8% at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, respectively, after implantation. Thus, CO3Ap HCBs were gradually resorbed and replaced by new bone. The newly formed bone penetrated most of the pores in the CO3Ap HCBs at 12 weeks after implantation. By contrast, the granulation tissue scarcely invaded the CO3Ap HCBs. Some osteoclasts invaded the wall of CO3Ap HCBs, making resorption pits. Furthermore, many osteoblasts were found on the newly formed bone, indicating ongoing bone remodeling. Blood vessels were also formed inside most of the pores in the CO3Ap HCBs. These findings suggest that CO3Ap HCBs have good osteoconductivity and can be used for the reconstruction of large mandibular bone defects."
Silk fibroin microgels as a platform for cell microencapsulation,"Cell microencapsulation has been utilized for years as a means of cell shielding from the external environment while facilitating the transport of gases, general metabolites, and secretory bioactive molecules at once. In this light, hydrogels may support the structural integrity and functionality of encapsulated biologics whereas ensuring cell viability and function and releasing potential therapeutic factors once in situ. In this work, we describe a straightforward strategy to fabricate silk fibroin (SF) microgels (µgels) and encapsulate cells into them. SF µgels (size ≈ 200 µm) were obtained through ultrasonication-induced gelation of SF in a water-oil emulsion phase. A thorough physicochemical (SEM analysis, and FT-IR) and mechanical (microindentation tests) characterization of SF µgels were carried out to assess their nanostructure, porosity, and stiffness. SF µgels were used to encapsulate and culture L929 and primary myoblasts. Interestingly, SF µgels showed a selective release of relatively small proteins (e.g., VEGF, molecular weight, MW = 40 kDa) by the encapsulated primary myoblasts, while bigger (macro)molecules (MW = 160 kDa) were hampered to diffusing through the µgels. This article provided the groundwork to expand the use of SF hydrogels into a versatile platform for encapsulating relevant cells able to release paracrine factors potentially regulating tissue and/or organ functions, thus promoting their regeneration."
Superpixel-based foreground-preserving image stitching,"Image stitching aims to stitch multiple images with overlapping areas into a high-resolution image with natural appearance, no ghosting and no seam, so as to obtain a wide field of vision. And the stitching is required to be as fast as possible. In this article, we discuss the loss of foreground object caused by the seam-cut method for image stitching. Moreover, we propose an improved seam-cut method based on superpixel to solve this problem. The proposed method uses the matching information of feature points and superpixel segmentation to divide the scene into foreground and background. By adjusting the penalty value of foreground superpixels in the superpixel-based seam-cut method, the foreground object can avoid the cutting of optimal seam. The experimental results demonstrate that our method will not cause the ghosting of foreground object or the loss of foreground object in the stitching result in the scene with large parallax. In this method, the foreground object will be preserved completely."
Closed-loop recycling of colored regenerated cellulose fibers from the dyed cotton textile waste,"Worldwide, 45 million tons of waste cotton textiles are produced annually, of which 75% is burned and buried, leading to serious environmental pollution. In this study, a method for directly preparing colored regenerated cellulose fibers (CRCFs) from dyed cotton textile waste (DCTW) was demonstrated. The tensile strength of CRCFs reached 226 MPa, which was equivalent to that of commercial viscose fibers. CRCFs exhibited excellent color fastness and hydrophilicity. In addition, CRCFs can be reprocessed into secondary CRCFs. The tensile strength of secondary CRCFs was 14.64% less than that of the primary CRCFs due to the reduction in the polymerization degree of secondary CRCFs; however, it also can be woven into fabrics. The exploration of the secondary utilization of CRCFs provides an experimental basis for prolonging the service life of DCTW. This approach of preparing CRCFs achieves closed-loop recycling of waste colored cellulose textiles and prevents environmental pollution caused by decoloring and dyeing."
Controlling cellulose feedstock size allows for modification of cellulose-based carbon-based solid acid size,"Carbon-based solid acids (CSA) have grown in popularity in recent years owing to their strong catalytic activity, thermal stability, and reusability. The size effect has a significant influence on the catalytic activity of carbon-based solid acids in heterogeneous catalysts. The impacts of raw material size on the shape, sulfonation degree, and catalytic activity of produced carbon-based solid acids were examined in this article. Various sizes of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), and cotton fiber pulp (CP) were used as carbon sources in a simple carbon-sulphonation method to synthesize carbon-based solid acids. The produced CSA has a high concentration of sulphonic acid groups, as well as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, and exhibits remarkable catalytic activity for the conversion of xylan to xylose. The solid acids generated from MCC have the most homogeneous shape, the greatest degree of sulphonation, and the highest catalytic activity. The conversion rate of xylan hydrolysis to xylose was up to 58.8% under ideal reaction conditions (150 °C, 4 h), and the catalyst retained almost its initial level of activity after five cycles with no appreciable deactivation."
Chromatin remodeler CHD7 targets active enhancer region to regulate cell type-specific gene expression in human neural crest cells,"A mutation in the chromatin remodeler chromodomain helicase DNA-binding 7 (CHD7) gene causes the multiple congenital anomaly CHARGE syndrome. The craniofacial anomalies observed in CHARGE syndrome are caused by dysfunctions of neural crest cells (NCCs), which originate from the neural tube. However, the mechanism by which CHD7 regulates the function of human NCCs (hNCCs) remains unclear. We aimed to characterize the cis-regulatory elements governed by CHD7 in hNCCs by analyzing genome-wide ChIP-Seq data and identifying hNCC-specific CHD7-binding profiles. We compared CHD7-binding regions among cell types, including human induced pluripotent stem cells and human neuroepithelial cells, to determine the comprehensive properties of CHD7-binding in hNCCs. Importantly, analysis of the hNCC-specific CHD7-bound region revealed transcription factor AP-2α as a potential co-factor facilitating the cell type-specific transcriptional program in hNCCs. CHD7 was strongly associated with active enhancer regions, permitting the expression of hNCC-specific genes to sustain the function of hNCCs. Our findings reveal the regulatory mechanisms of CHD7 in hNCCs, thus providing additional information regarding the transcriptional programs in hNCCs."
The prognosis predictive score around primary debulking surgery (PPSP) improves diagnostic efficacy in predicting the prognosis of ovarian cancer,"In recent years, the pretreatment inflammatory responses have proven to predict the prognosis, but no report exists analyzing the combined inflammatory response of the pre- and postsurgical treatment. The current study aims to extract the factors predicting the recurrence and create novel predictive scoring. This retrospective study was conducted at our institution between November 2006 and December 2020, with follow-up until September 2022. Demographic and clinicopathological data were collected from women who underwent primary debulking surgery. We created the scoring system named the prognosis predictive score around primary debulking surgery(PPSP) for progression-free survival(PFS). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess its efficacy in predicting PFS and overall survival(OS). Cox regression analyses were used to assess its time-dependent efficacy. Kaplan–Meier and the log-rank test were used to compare the survival rate. A total of 235 patients were included in the current study. The cut-off value of the scoring system was six. Multivariate analyses revealed that an advanced International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics(FIGO) stage (p < 0.001 for PFS; p = 0.038 for OS), the decreased white blood cell count difference (p = 0.026 for PFS) and the high-PPSP (p = 0.004 for PFS; p = 0.002 for OS) were the independent prognostic factors. Cox regression analysis also supported the above results. The PPSP showed good prognostic efficacy not only in predicting the PFS but also OS of ovarian cancer patients comparable to FIGO staging."
Comparison of changes in lipid profiles of premenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer treated with different endocrine therapies,"Adjuvant endocrine therapy improves the prognosis of early breast cancer with hormone receptor positivity. However, there is no systematic report on the effect of endocrine therapy (particularly ovarian function suppression, OFS) on serum lipids in premenopausal women. This retrospective cohort study aimed to determine whether various endocrine treatments had different effects on blood lipids. This study enrolled 160 premenopausal patients with stage I–III breast cancer in eastern China. The initial diagnostic information was retrieved from patient's medical records, including age at the time of diagnosis, tumor characteristics, anticancer treatment and past medical history. The changes in blood lipids in patients receiving different types of endocrine therapy were compared at the 3rd, 6th, 12th, and 24th months after initiating endocrine therapy. Generalized linear mixed model was used in our analyses. Our data revealed that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in patients with tamoxifen (TAM) were significantly lower in the 6th, 12th, and 24th months than that in the 3rd month, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in the 6th, 12th, and 24th months were significantly higher than that in the 3rd month, indicating that blood lipid levels generally improved with time. While in TAM plus OFS group, HDL-C levels were significantly higher in the 24th month than in the 3rd month, total cholesterol (TC) levels were significantly higher in the 24th month than in the 6th month. The lipid profiles of OFS plus aromatase inhibitor (AI) group did not show significant differences at any time point but were significantly higher than those of the other two groups especially in LDL and TC. TAM group tended to have lower serum lipid levels. With longer follow-up, no statistically significant difference in values was observed between TAM and TAM plus OFS groups at various time points. Compared with the other two groups, OFS plus AI group presented an increasing trend toward LDL-C and TC. The risk of dyslipidemia requires further investigation using a large sample size."
A new method of ventilation inhomogeneity assessment based on a simulation study using clinical data on congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases,"Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) is a diaphragm defect associated with lung hypoplasia and ventilation inhomogeneity (VI). The affected neonates are usually born with respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation after birth. However, significant interindividual VI differences make ventilation difficult. So far, there are no clinical methods of VI assessment that could be applied to optimize ventilation at the bedside. A new VI index is a ratio of time constants T1/T2 of gas flows in both lungs. Pressure-controlled ventilation simulations were conducted using an infant hybrid (numerical-physical) respiratory simulator connected to a ventilator. The parameters of the respiratory system model and ventilator settings were based on retrospective clinical data taken from three neonates (2, 2.6, 3.6 kg) treated in the Paediatric Teaching Clinical Hospital of the Medical University of Warsaw. We searched for relationships between respiratory system impedance (Z) and ventilation parameters: work of breathing (WOB), peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), and mean airway pressure (MAP). The study showed the increased VI described by the T1/T2 index value highly correlated with elevated Z, WOB, PIP and MAP (0.8–0.9, the Spearman correlation coefficients were significant at P < 0.001). It indicates that the T1/T2 index may help to improve the ventilation therapy of CDH neonates."
Single-cell resolved ploidy and chromosomal aberrations in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-(NASH) induced hepatocellular carcinoma and its precursor lesions,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its precursor, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are an unmet health issue due to widespread obesity. We assessed copy number changes of genes associated with hepatocarcinogenesis and oxidative pathways at a single-cell level. Eleven patients with NASH-HCC and 11 patients with NAFLD were included. Eight probes were analyzed using multiplex interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (miFISH), single-cell imaging and phylogenetic tree modelling: Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), C-Myc (MYC), hepatocyte growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (MET), tumor protein 53 (TP53), cyclin D1 (CCND1), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), the fragile histidine triad gene (FHIT) and FRA16D oxidoreductase (WWOX). Each NASH-HCC tumor had up to 14 distinct clonal signal patterns indicating multiclonality, which correlated with high tumor grade. Changes frequently observed were TP53 losses, 45%; MYC gains, 36%; WWOX losses, 36%; and HER2 gains, 18%. Whole-genome duplications were frequent (82%) with aberrant tetraploid cells evolving from diploid ancestors. Non-tumorous NAFLD/NASH biopsies did not harbor clonal copy number changes. Fine mapping of NASH-HCC using single-cell multiplex FISH shows that branched tumor evolution involves genome duplication and that multiclonality increases with tumor grade. The loss of oxidoreductase WWOX and HER2 gains could be potentially associated with NASH-induced hepatocellular carcinoma."
"Species delimitation in Ceratozamia (Zamiaceae) from Southwestern Mexico, in light of reproductive and climatic diversification","Multidisciplinary taxonomic studies have enhanced the delimitation of species within complex taxonomic groups. In the cycad genus Ceratozamia, the taxonomy is still not fully resolved for the several species complexes that have been proposed. Five Ceratozamia species occur in geographic proximity in the Soconusco region of southwestern Mexico. Because of similarity and variable morphology across these species, their taxonomy is a source of confusion. Based on integrative taxonomy, including morphological (qualitative and quantitative), ecological, and molecular data, we aimed to diagnose the species from the Soconusco region. We carried out extensive field sampling, collecting 225 individuals from a total of 12 populations, and reviewed one hundred herbarium specimens to evaluate whether the species are diagnosable. We carried out morphometric analyses at the population level on vegetative and reproductive characters and present the first analyses of phenotypic variability of pollen and ovulate strobili in neotropical cycads. Additionally, we evaluated the influence of climatic factors on morphological variation. Morphological characters of ovulate strobili were correlated with climatic conditions. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between the morphology of pollen strobili and the environment. In the pollen strobili, we found fixed characters that allow for the identification of the species. The haplotype networks displayed several groups of related haplotypes, which in some species corresponded to mixed population clusters. We detected a discordance between phenotypic and genetic evidence. The integration of evidence offers grounded views for clarifying species boundaries and outlining the differences among species, which we incorporated into a taxonomic key. In general, the mixed relations within this group of species may be due to historical hybridization events favored by common phenology and sharing of biotic pollination vectors. Finally, based on our results, we discuss the use of morphology for species delimitation and inference of evolutionary relationships in cycads."
Closed-loop recycling of colored regenerated cellulose fibers from the dyed cotton textile waste,"Worldwide, 45 million tons of waste cotton textiles are produced annually, of which 75% is burned and buried, leading to serious environmental pollution. In this study, a method for directly preparing colored regenerated cellulose fibers (CRCFs) from dyed cotton textile waste (DCTW) was demonstrated. The tensile strength of CRCFs reached 226 MPa, which was equivalent to that of commercial viscose fibers. CRCFs exhibited excellent color fastness and hydrophilicity. In addition, CRCFs can be reprocessed into secondary CRCFs. The tensile strength of secondary CRCFs was 14.64% less than that of the primary CRCFs due to the reduction in the polymerization degree of secondary CRCFs; however, it also can be woven into fabrics. The exploration of the secondary utilization of CRCFs provides an experimental basis for prolonging the service life of DCTW. This approach of preparing CRCFs achieves closed-loop recycling of waste colored cellulose textiles and prevents environmental pollution caused by decoloring and dyeing."
Controlling cellulose feedstock size allows for modification of cellulose-based carbon-based solid acid size,"Carbon-based solid acids (CSA) have grown in popularity in recent years owing to their strong catalytic activity, thermal stability, and reusability. The size effect has a significant influence on the catalytic activity of carbon-based solid acids in heterogeneous catalysts. The impacts of raw material size on the shape, sulfonation degree, and catalytic activity of produced carbon-based solid acids were examined in this article. Various sizes of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), and cotton fiber pulp (CP) were used as carbon sources in a simple carbon-sulphonation method to synthesize carbon-based solid acids. The produced CSA has a high concentration of sulphonic acid groups, as well as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, and exhibits remarkable catalytic activity for the conversion of xylan to xylose. The solid acids generated from MCC have the most homogeneous shape, the greatest degree of sulphonation, and the highest catalytic activity. The conversion rate of xylan hydrolysis to xylose was up to 58.8% under ideal reaction conditions (150 °C, 4 h), and the catalyst retained almost its initial level of activity after five cycles with no appreciable deactivation."
Machine learning regression-based RETRO-VLP for real-time and stabilized indoor positioning,"Many real-world applications require real-time and robust positioning of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this context, visible light communication (VLC) is a promising approach due to its advantages in terms of high accuracy, low cost, ubiquitous infrastructure, and freedom from RF interference. Nevertheless, there is a growing need to improve positioning speed and accuracy. In this paper, we propose and prototype a VLC-based positioning solution using retroreflectors attached to the IoT device of interest. The proposed algorithm uses the retroreflected power received by multiple photodiodes to estimate the euclidean and directional coordinates of the underlying IoT device. In particular, the relative relationship between reflected light magnitude and reflected power is used as input to trainable machine learning regression models. Such models are trained to estimate the coordinates. The proposed algorithm excels in its simplicity and fast computation. It also reduces the need for sensory devices and active operation. Additionally, after regression, Kalman filtering is applied as a post-processing operation to further stabilize the obtained estimates. The proposed algorithm is shown to provide stable, accurate, and fast. This has been verified by extensive experiments performed on a prototype in real-world environments. Experiments confirm a high level of positioning accuracy and the added benefit of Kalman filtering stabilization."
What Happens to Those Who Exit Jehovah’s Witnesses: An Investigation of the Impact of Shunning,"Shunning and ostracism have severe impacts on individuals’ psychological and social well-being. Members of Jehovah’s Witnesses are subject to shunning when they do not comply with the stated doctrine or belief system. To investigate the effects of shunning, interviews with 10 former Jehovah’s Witnesses, ranging in age from 20 to 44 years old, were conducted; six male, six White, one Native American, one Black, and two Latinx. Transcripts were analyzed with interpretative phenomenological analysis for narrative themes pertaining to their life after exclusion from their former faith using the context of Jehovah’s Witnesses culture. Results suggest shunning has a long-term, detrimental effect on mental health, job possibilities, and life satisfaction. Problems are amplified in female former members due to heavy themes of sexism and patriarchal narratives pervasive in Jehovah’s Witnesses culture. Feelings of loneliness, loss of control, and worthlessness are also common after leaving. The culture of informing on other members inside the Jehovah’s Witnesses also leads to a continued sense of distrust and suspicion long after leaving."
Evaluation and Decomposition of Factors Responsible for Alteration in Streamflow in Lower Watersheds of the Han River Basin Using Different Budyko-Based Functions,"Streamflow is documented as a key element of the hydrological cycle, and alterations in streamflow may result in hydrological disaster. The accurate quantification of streamflow under various climatological and anthropogenic factors, as well as decomposing their respective effects, remains challenging. In this study, we quantified and split the effects of climate variation and human action on streamflow changes in lower watersheds of the Han River. We utilized distinct methodologies and compared their outcomes. The methodologies include Budyko-based curve decomposition, the Budyko-based hydrological elasticity method, the conceptual eco-hydrological method, and the hydrological sensitivity analysis method. Subsequently, the hydrological change point was inspected in 1997. During the baseline period (1966–1997), variations in climate led to changes in the streamflow. In contrast, in the post-baseline period (1998–2013), the variation in the streamflow was attributed to the combined effects of climate variation and human action. Climate variation was observed to be a prominent accountable feature in streamflow alterations. The results obtained from different methodologies appeared to align with each other, showing that 70% to 91% (average 80%) of the alteration in the streamflow occurred in response to variations in climate-related parameters. The contribution from human action was less, accounting for 9% to 30% (average 20%) of the change. Moreover, the relative proportion of effects was perceived to be sensitive to the methods applied and the type of Budyko-based function. Further, the relative impacts of both factors can enhance the uncertainty in the management of water resources. Thus, this information is essential for the execution of water management on the spatial and temporal scales to reduce the risk of hydrological disasters in the watershed."
Novel circuit design for content-addressable memory in QCA technology,"The content-addressable memory is an especial memory cell that can search in its entire contents in one clock cycle. The Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) technology is also the promising nanotechnology for digital circuits implementation. This study presents and evaluates a new architecture for two-input XOR gate in the QCA technology. Then, the unique gate is developed using the developed XOR gate. The novel and efficient content-addressable memory is also developed using the developed unique gate. The QCADesigner tool is utilized to evaluate the functionally of these architectures. The implementation results prove that the developed content-addressable memory has 0.03 µ\({\text{m}}^{{2}}\) area, 0.5 clock cycles, and 37 cells. The developed architectures provide advantages in comparison with other architectures in terms of area, latency, and cell count."
Experimental study on supported MnO2-based catalysts for NO oxidation,"In this paper, a single-phase supported MnO2/Al2O3 catalyst and Ce-doped MnCe/Al catalyst system were used for the NO-SCO experiment with MnO2 as the main active component. Furthermore, the effect of loading and Ce doping on active oxygen species and the important factors related to catalyst activity was revealed. The MnO2 catalyst obtained the best activity at 300 °C, corresponding to a NO conversion rate of 79.4%. After MnO2 was loaded on the γ-Al2O3, the activity of the Mn/Al catalysts was not as good as that of the MnO2 catalyst, and the temperature window of Mn/Al shifted to the high-temperature region with the increase of the loading ratio. The relative content of adsorbed oxygen Oα of Mn/Al catalysts was lower than that of MnO2, resulting in poor activity. Ce-doped Mn0.23Ce0.023/Al catalysts exhibited good low-temperature activity. The introduction of the Ce element enhanced the dispersion of Mn species on the catalyst surface, the relative content of surface adsorbed oxygen Oα increased, and the low-temperature activity and mobility of surface oxygen species were enhanced. The Mn0.23Ce0.023/Al catalyst was endowed with both a high specific surface area and good pore structure, as well as a large oxygen storage capacity and excellent surface oxygen species."
A new analytical ICCE and force prediction model for wide-row machining of free-form surface,"Cutting force is the most intuitive reflection of various influencing factors in the milling process, which is important for improving machining quality and efficiency. For the wide-row milling with flat-end mill of free-form surface, an analytical in-cut cutting edge (ICCE) algorithm is studied in detail, and overall cutting force model is further constructed. The cutter location points along tool path are discretized into small oblique planes. Taking the oblique plane machining as the new object, the relative position of flat-end mill and workpiece in five-axis machining is defined parametrically. By constructing a semi-enclosed space in which the cutting edge participates in cutting, the ICCE is directly obtained. By analyzing the cutting force of oblique plane, the cutting force model of free-form surface can be established by spatial coordinate transformation. The simulation and experiment have demonstrated the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed ICCE algorithm and force prediction model."
Time-varying multi-objective region iterative learning motion control,"In the multi-axis motion control field, the point-to-point multi-objective learning algorithm, taking target point tracking accuracy as the major control objective, limits the optimization of other control objectives such as motion distance and energy consumption of the system. Therefore, this paper initially proposes multi-objective region iterative learning control algorithm, extending point-to-point tracking to region-to-region tracking and further optimizing other performance indexes via flexibly setting the region size on the grounds of the tracking requirements. In view that the fixed weight coefficient of each object in the multi-objective iterative learning algorithm is not suitable for occasions with dynamic control requirements, this paper further presents time-varying multi-objective region iterative learning control algorithm and unifies point-to-point tracking and region-to-region tracking under one algorithm framework. In addition, by means of designing time-varying weight matrix, strengthening major control objectives, weakening minor control objectives and satisfying the ever-changing control requirements, experimental results show that time-varying multi-objective region iterative learning algorithm is capable of flexibly adjusting the weight size of each objective in line with various control needs so that the control system is endowed with higher tracking accuracy in trajectory tracking segment as well as lower energy consumption and shorter motion distance in region tracking segment, thus having good flexibility."
Study on micro-grinding mechanism and surface and subsurface quality of 20 vol% SiCp/Al composites,"A finite element model of single abrasive grinding was established to analyze the material removal during the grinding process and analyze the surface and subsurface defects of the material after grinding. Using the orthogonal test method to machine the surface of the workpiece with a grinding rod of 2 mm grinding head diameter, and to investigate the influence degree of the machining parameters on the roughness. It was concluded that the grinding depth has the most significant effect on surface roughness, followed by the spindle speed and the feed speed, and the minimum roughness of the ground surface obtained was 0.066 µm. The rough surface was simulated by the digital filtering method based on fast Fourier transform (FFT), and the morphological characteristics of the rough surface at Ra = 0.116 µm were described, and the simulated surface was consistent with the detected surface. The laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used for inspection, and the analysis showed that the main removal forms of the enhanced particles were broken, fractured, and pulled out. The surface defects were cracks, pits, and burrs, and the subsurface damages were voids, cracks, and pits."
A numerical study on free vibration analysis of detailed and homogenized models for FG-CNTRC beams,"The goal of this study is to compare and investigate the free vibration characteristics of detailed and homogenized models for functionally graded carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (FG-CNTRC) beams, based on the finite element method (FEM). In this study, three types of FG-CNTRC beams and boundary conditions are considered for different volume fractions of CNT: UD (uniformly distributed), FG-X, and FG-Λ beams. These beams in which single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are distributed with a gradient through the thickness are employed and analyzed for simply supported (SS), clamped-clamped (CC), and free-free (FF) boundary conditions. For the homogenized model, the effective material properties are determined in terms of the CNT volume fraction using the linear rule of mixture. A commercial midas NFX program is used for finite element simulations to analyze the free vibration responses of FG-CNTRC beams. The numerical results are compared with the existing analytical solutions in the literature in order to validate the developed finite element models."
Energy and exergy analyses of the Kalina system integrated with a two-phase turbine,"The Kalina power cycle can be integrated with a two-phase turbine as a substitute for the expansion valve to yield useful mechanical energy. An energy- and exergy-based mathematical model was formulated to analyze and evaluate the performance of the proposed cycle in this study. Independent parameters, including the base ammonia-water solution concentration, separator pressure, temperature difference in the recuperator, and vapor turbine outlet pressure, were used to analyze the sensitivity of efficiencies. The results show that the proposed cycle is efficient in terms of energy and exergy efficiencies. The two-phase turbine power is much larger than the solution pump power, and the exergy destruction of the turbine is much smaller than that of a throttle valve. The effect of the base solution concentration was dominant. At low concentrations, the energy and exergy efficiency improvements were 140 % and 160 %, respectively. At high concentrations, the substitution was not significant because the solution flow rate through the two-phase turbine was negligible. Furthermore, the efficiency enhancement was notable at a high vapor turbine outlet pressure."
A Strength Criterion for Deep Rock with Stochastic Fractures via DEM Simulations,"Criteria for rock strength mostly focus on macromechanical parameters, which cannot directly explain the relationship between microscopic fracture characteristics and strength. This paper analyses the strength characteristics of deep jointed rock with stochastic fractures by the distinct element method (DEM) and proposes a new strength criterion. First, an improved bond contact model and the smooth-joint contact model are implemented within the framework of DEM to simulate the characteristics of deep rock. Then, triaxial compression tests on Berea sandstone are also numerically simulated under various confining pressures and fracture intensities (P32). Finally, a strength criterion is proposed and validated based on the numerical and experimental results. The criterion can capture the nonlinear relationship between the major principal stress and the confining pressure and reveal the microscopic fracture characteristics of deep rock. However, the criterion does not consider the influence of the intermediate principal stress. The average deviation between all the predicted strengths and the experimental results is 5.12%, which demonstrates that the criterion has good applicability."
Economic and environmental analysis of composite recycling techniques for the design of future waste management supply chains,"Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites have permeated every aspect of modern life. Significant progress has been made in engineering communities to recycle composite wastes. While emerging recycling techniques can recover both fibers and resins at mild processing conditions, they are currently limited on the laboratory scale. It remains unclear if they could lead to market viability and environmental sustainability when they are used for industrial applications; if not, what the limiting factors are and how to improve them. In this study, the environmental and economic impacts of existing recycling techniques are studied. The average recycling costs are analyzed, and the environmental impacts are examined. It reveals that while the emerging techniques can recycle composites with extremely low environmental impact, their costs are significant compared to conventional techniques, primarily due to the expensive solvents and catalysts used to enable recycling. However, the study shows that it is possible to combine conventional waste processing techniques with emerging ones to enable recycling scenarios that are both cost-effective and environmentally beneficial. Overall, the study in this paper provides valuable insights for the design of future waste management supply chains and appropriate business models for the sustainable development of society."
Effect of Microplastics on the Adsorption and Desorption Properties of Cadmium in Soil,"This study analyzed the role of micro polyethylene (mPE) and micro polypropylene (mPP) on cadmium (Cd) adsorption and desorption in soil. Cd adsorption in soils reached equilibrium within 240 min with or without mPP/mPE. The largest Cd adsorption amount was 923.88 mg kg−1 in the control treatment (no MPs). The Cd adsorption amount in the mPP treatment was 872.21 mg kg−1, greater than that in the mPE treatment (780.21 mg kg−1). MPs reduced the soil adsorption of Cd to some extent. Soils supplemented with mPE were more inhibitory to Cd adsorption than mPP. The pseudo-second-order model equation proved to be the most optimal equation for describing Cd adsorption dynamics in the presence of different MPs, while the Freundlich equation was best for describing isothermal adsorption of Cd in the presence of MPs. MPs facilitate the desorption of metals from the soil."
Conversion of Coal into Graphitized Microcrystalline Carbon with a Hierarchical Porous Structure for Electrochemical Hydrogen Storage,"Electrochemical hydrogen storage, which can be performed at ambient temperatures and mild pressures, is regarded as a promising technique to store hydrogen safely and efficiently. In this study, the electrochemical hydrogen storage performance of activated carbon was improved by synthesizing a graphitized microcrystalline porous carbon material through a facile one-step catalytic carbonization activation procedure using coal as the raw material. Owing to the synthetic effect of the conductive network and the hierarchical porous structure, the carbon electrode exhibited high capacity, excellent rate performance, and substantial cycling stability for electrochemical hydrogen storage. The hydrogen storage capacity of the material was 278 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1, with considerable capacity retention of 86% after 50 cycles. The electrode exhibited superior rate capacity of 260 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1. Porous carbon with microcrystalline graphite was demonstrated to be an efficient electrode for electrochemical hydrogen storage."
An Integrated Deep Learning Prediction Approach for Efficient Modelling of Host Load Patterns in Cloud Computing,"Recent surge in technology and integration of IoT into Cloud computing has resulted in increasingly heterogeneous workloads with unprecedented compute and storage demands. As Cloud workloads evolve, so also their computational demands, resulting in server loads interspersed by random peaks and troughs and by continuous and periodic demands. A predictive model that accounts for these diverse load patterns can generate more realistic future resource demands which is essential for efficient capacity planning and meeting service level objectives with minimal energy consumption. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), the prevalent approach for host load prediction suffers from information decay with long inputs, while hybrid methods using Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and LSTM fail to effectively model different host load patterns. To overcome above limitations, we propose a multistep CPU usage prediction approach named RCP-CL, to model random fluctuations and novel continuous and periodic patterns from contiguous and non-contiguous CPU load values augmented with daily and weekly time patterns, by integrating 1-Dimensional CNN (1D-CNN) and LSTM networks. RCP-CL uses parallel and stacked 1D-CNN layers with kernel size and dilation rates that are guided by the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analysis of CPU usage while LSTM derives temporal dependencies from the learnt spatial patterns. Experimental evaluations with Google Trace and Alibaba trace demonstrate impressive learning skills of RCP-CL over the state-of-the-art LSTM and 1D-CNN based host load prediction models, achieving up to 20% improvement in mean squared error for Google trace and up to 22% improvement for Alibaba trace."
Optimal collective investment: an analysis of individual welfare,"We analyze optimal asset allocation in continuous time for a collective of tied-together investors. We rely on a specific collective utility function which dates back to Karatzas et al. (Math Oper Res 15(1):80–128, 1990), by which the fund manager maximizes the weighted average of expected individual utilities for the investors in the collective. This problem allows for a closed form solution. The payoffs allocated to the investors correspond to the individually optimal ones which can be reached with a modified initial wealth that results from redistribution. The redistribution of wealth follows from the weights of the individual investors in the collective utility function, the condition of financial fairness, the condition of maximal average utility gains, or some other condition on net certainty equivalent returns. We illustrate the resulting solutions both for a Black–Scholes economy and a model with stochastic interest rates."
FLI1 accelerates leukemogenesis through transcriptional regulation of pyruvate kinase-L/R and other glycolytic genes,"In cancer cells, multiple oncogenes and tumor suppressors control glycolysis to sustain rapid proliferation. The ETS-related transcription factor Fli1 plays a critical role in the induction and progression of leukemia, yet, the underlying mechanism of this oncogenic event is still not fully understood. In this study, RNAseq analysis of FLI1-depleted human leukemic cells revealed transcriptional suppression of the PKLR gene and activation of multiple glycolytic genes, such as PKM1/2. Pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis by PKM2 inhibitor, Shikonin, significantly suppressed leukemic cell proliferation. FLI1 directly binds to the PKLR promoter, leading to the suppression of this inhibitor of glycolysis. In accordance, shRNA-mediated depletion of PKLR in leukemic HEL cells expressing high levels of FLI1 accelerated leukemia proliferation, pointing for the first time to its tumor suppressor function. PKLR knockdown also led to downregulation of the erythroid markers EPOR, HBA1, and HBA2 and suppression of erythroid differentiation. Interestingly, silencing of PKLR in HEL cells significantly increased FLI1 expression, which was associated with faster proliferation in culture. In FLI1-expressing leukemic cells, lower PKLR expression was associated with higher expression of PKM1 and PKM2, which promote aerobic glycolysis. Finally, injection of pyruvate, a known inhibitor of glycolysis, into leukemia mice significantly suppressed leukemogenesis. These results demonstrate that FLI1 promotes leukemia in part by inducing glycolysis, implicates PKLR in erythroid differentiation, and suggests that targeting glycolysis may be an attractive therapeutic strategy for cancers driven by FLI1 overexpression."
Catalyst-free synthesis of highly functionalized triazole hexahydroquinoline carbohydrazide scaffolds via four-component cyclocondensation reaction,"A new class of multi-functional triazole hexahydroquinoline carbohydrazide named 2-amino-7,7-dimethyl-5-oxo-4-phenyl-1-(4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline-3-carbohydrazide has been synthesized by a novel multi-component process involving the reaction of dimedone, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, various benzaldehyde with cyanoacetohydrazide under mild conditions in the stoichiometric melt and chloroform in sequence. The simple one-pot process, straight product isolation without applying tedious purification procedures, progression of the reaction without using any catalyst, the application of diverse aldehydes causing a high molecular diversity, the existence of several nitrogen atoms in the product structure, and the possibility of creating multiple hydrogen bonding in the final compound are attractive specifications of the present strategy."
Fermented seeds of Pentaclethra macrophylla mitigate against memory deficit and restored altered enzymatic activity in the brain of streptozotocin-diabetic rats,"Memory deficit has been reported as one of the complications of diabetes. Fermented seeds of Pentaclethra Macrophylla (P. macrophylla) have been used in folklore for the management of metabolic diseases. The research aims to evaluate the impact of diets with the inclusion of the fermented seed of P. macrophylla on memory deficit in diabetic rats and its underlying mechanisms. Before the induction, the rats were subjected to training sessions. Thereafter, streptozotocin (50 mg/kg body weight) was administered to the trained rats via intraperitoneal (i.p). 72 hours after, the rats blood glucose level was checked, rats with blood glucose level greater than 250 mg/dl were selected for the memory index evaluation study. The induced rats were randomly distributed into groups: Normal rats (group 1), untreated diabetic rat (Group 2), acarbose treated diabetic rats (group 3); diabetic rats placed on diet supplemented with fermented seed of P. macrophylla (10 & 20% inclusion) were allotted to group 4 & 5. Then, evaluation of memory retention capacity was performed on the day 14 of the experiment. Thereafter, experimental rats were sacrificed, tissue of interest (brain) was excised, homogenized and homogenates were used for biochemical analysis. The cholinergic, angiotensin-1-converting enzyme (ACE), arginase activity and biomarkers for oxidative stress were significantly altered in untreated diabetic rats when compared with non-diabetes rats. Also, the memory capacity of the diabetic rats was significantly reduced when compared with the non-diabetes rats. Meanwhile, diabetic rats placed on diet with fermented seeds of P. macrophylla (10 & 20% inclusion) exhibited significantly higher memory capacity, lower activity of cholinergic, ACE, arginase activity in relation to untreated diabetic rats while the antioxidant status of the brain was enhanced. Nevertheless, fermented seeds of P. macrophylla ameliorated memory deficit in STZ induced diabetes rats. This gave credence to P. macrophylla nutraceutical potential as claimed in folk medicine."
Financing for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond,"The economic and social impact of covid-19 pandemic both on developing and developed countries has been significant. In addition to the impact of the pandemic, the current Ukraine war has also led to severe supply chain disruptions leading to a sharp increase in food and commodity prices globally. Due to a combination of external shocks and the impact of the pandemic global economic growth is expected to slow down from 6.1% in 2021 to 3.2% in 2022 and further to 2.7% in 2023 (IMF in: World economic outlook, International Monetary Fund, 2022). The above factors have led to a sharp increase in government expenditure constraining both developed and developing countries' fiscal capacity. This has further implications for the achievement of SDGs especially for low-income countries. The challenge for developing countries in the current scenario is to mobilise adequate resources both from domestic and international sources, not just for the achievement of SDGs as such, but also to sustain the livelihoods, health, and welfare of people. This special issue aims to examine some of these issues in the context of developing countries."
The impact of HER2-low status on response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in clinically HER2-negative breast cancer,"Low expression of HER2 (HER2-low expression) in breast cancer (BC) has unique biological characteristics. However, whether HER2-low expression has an impact on neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in HER2-negative breast cancer remains unclear."
Predicted cardiac and second cancer risks for patients undergoing VMAT for mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma,To predict treatment-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) and second cancer 30-year absolute mortality risks (AMR30) for patients with mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma in a large multicentre radiation oncology network in Ireland.
Optimizing the Organizational Crisis Communication Portfolio,"Organizational reputation can be seriously damaged after a self-inflicted or externally induced crisis. Studies have tested the restoring and protective effects of various crisis communication strategies. For this paper, we compared the effects on organizational reputation dependent on (a) crisis type and (b) crisis communication strategy used. We combined six strategies in a stepwise manner, showing which ones are most effective in which type of crisis in an experimental online setting. Respondents were randomly assigned to questionnaires with varying combinations of (b) in a different sequence of (a) rating the organization for three points in time. Using a diverse sample, we show that organizational reputation improves significantly only after combining at least five strategies."
The effect of chlorantraniliprole on the transcriptomic profile of Spodoptera frugiperda: a typical case analysis for the response of a newly invaded pest to an old insecticide,"Chlorantraniliprole is a diamide insecticide widely used in China over the last 15 years. The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, newly invaded China in 2019. The response of FAW to chlorantraniliprole deserves more attention, in the context of many destructive lepidopteran species are resistant to diamide insecticides and the patent on core chemical of chlorantraniliprole in China expired in August 2022."
The perceptual antecedents of brand anthropomorphism in the name-brand voice assistant context,"The widespread use of voice assistants (VAs) is leading consumers to attribute social presence (i.e. human characteristics) to these interfaces. Considering name-brand VAs (NBVAs), the medium through which users interact with the brand name and brand voice, the emergence of perceptions of brands as human entities may also be hypothesised. Consequently, this study aims to test a model of perceptual antecedents of brand anthropomorphism outlining the direct and indirect effects exerted by human-like brand voice and NBVA social presence, as well as the moderating role of gender and expertise. PLS-SEM was used for data analysis. A survey involving young adults reveals that the relationship between human-like brand voice and brand anthropomorphism is fully mediated by NBVA social presence. However, the direct positive impact of human-like brand voice on brand anthropomorphism is significant only for novices, while the mediating role of social presence is stronger for experts. Finally, the influence of social presence on brand anthropomorphism is significantly stronger among men than women. This study contributes to jointly advancing knowledge in both the VA and brand anthropomorphism fields by focusing on under-researched branding perceptions in the context of NBVAs and by identifying the vocal antecedents of brand anthropomorphism."
Etiology and Complications of Deep Neck Space Infections: A Hospital Based Retrospective Study,"Infections of the deep spaces of the neck often present a true clinical challenge to a Head and Neck surgeon which may rapidly spread due to the various connections between the spaces resulting in morbidity and mortality. This study aims to obtain knowledge about various DNSI’s and their predisposing factors.. It was a hospital based retrospective cross-sectional study done in Goa Medical College, India. A total of 300 patients who presented with DNSI’s over the past 7 years were studied. Simple proportions and percentages were calculated and Chi-square test was used to study associations. A total of 300 patients were evaluated and male preponderance was seen. Most of the patients were seen belonging to the pediatric age group (26%). Infections of dental origin (45.67%) were the most common etiological factor associated with poor oral hygiene and tobacco chewing (12.67%). Major comorbidities were anemia (34%) and diabetes (19.3%) which were directly related to the complications. The most common complication was airway compromise (14.66%) which was treated by tracheostomy. DNSI should be treated like a medical as well as a surgical emergency which can be life-threatening especially in diabetics and elderly who are immunocompromised and need special attention. Odontogenic infections associated with poor oral hygiene and tobacco chewing could be prevented by educating the population about oral hygiene."
Laryngotracheal Stenosis: Our Experience in a Tertiary Care Hospital,"Laryngotracheal stenosis is a recalcitrant disease with high morbidity. Laryngotracheal stenosis can be defined as a partial or circumferential narrowing of the airway and may be congenital or acquired. Sites involved are supraglottis, glottis, or sub glottis. The goal of treating the patient with laryngotracheal stenosis is to reconstruct an adequate airway while preserving phonation and airway protection. Furthermore, there is no fixed treatment for laryngotracheal stenosis, the choice of surgical procedure is determined by the individual anatomy, involved site, length and luminal narrowing of stenotic segment and function of the larynx and trachea, together with patient factors and available facilities. To determine the most common aetiology of laryngotracheal stenosis and to study outcome of various treatment modalities and their efficacies according to the site of stenosis and time of presentation. We have prospectively studied 25 cases of laryngotracheal stenosis who presented in Department of ENT, Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad from May 2019 to December 2021. All patients with clinical suspicion of laryngotracheal stenosis underwent CECT Neck and Thorax with virtual bronchoscopy, flexible bronchoscopy and graded according to myer cotton classification and then included in study. In our study of 25 patients 19 patients had history of intubation. Out of 25 patients, 5 Powered by Editorial Manager® and ProduXion Manager® from Aries Systems Corporation patients had supraglottic stenosis, 14 had subglottic stenosis and 6 patients had tracheal stenosis. 20 patients were tracheostomised. Bilateral vocal cord mobility is pre requisite for any surgical intervention and for decannulation of tracheostomy tube. Laser ablation is best modality for supra glottis stenosis patients. Treatment options of subglottic and tracheal stenosis patients depends on vocal cord mobility, % of luminal narrowing and type of stenosis on flexible bronchoscopy and CT scan. Patients of subglottic or tracheal stenosis having Myer cotton grading 1 or 2 were successfully treated by Laser + Balloon dilatation while grade 3 or 4 by resection and end to end anastomosis. Endoscopic CO2 laser ablation with/without balloon dilatation gives promising results in cases of supra glottic stenosis and in soft, mucosal, short segment (< 1.5 cm), grade 1 or 2 stenosis patients with subglottic or tracheal stenosis. In patients with subglottic or tracheal stenosis having hard, cartilage framework involvement, > 1.5 cm stenotic segment, Grade 3 or 4 needed external open approach like tracheal resection and end to end anastomosis."
Quality of life of patients with rare cancer: a comparison with patients with colorectal cancer and the association with disease trajectory-related factors,"Differences in quality of life (QoL) between patients with rare and common cancer might be explained by the specific challenges patients with rare cancer face during their disease trajectory, but research is scarce. This study aimed to (1) assess the difference in QoL between patients with rare and common cancer (i.e. colorectal cancer (CRC)) and (2) examine the association between disease trajectory-related factors and QoL in patients with rare cancer."
"Tumoral CD105 promotes immunosuppression, metastasis, and angiogenesis in renal cell carcinoma","CD105 (endoglin) is a transmembrane protein that functions as a TGF-beta coreceptor and is highly expressed on endothelial cells. Unsurprisingly, preclinical and clinical evidence strongly suggests that CD105 is an important contributor to tumor angiogenesis and tumor progression. Emerging evidence suggests that CD105 is also expressed by tumor cells themselves in certain cancers such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In human RCC tumor cells, CD105 expression is associated with stem cell-like properties and contributes to the malignant phenotype in vitro and in xenograft models. However, as a regulator of TGF-beta signaling, there is a striking lack of evidence for the role of tumor-expressed CD105 in the anti-tumor immune response and the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we report that tumor cell-expressed CD105 potentiates both the in vitro and in vivo tumorigenic potential of RCC in a syngeneic murine RCC tumor model. Importantly, we find that tumor cell-expressed CD105 sculpts the tumor microenvironment by enhancing the recruitment of immunosuppressive cell types and inhibiting the polyfunctionality of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Finally, while CD105 expression by endothelial cells is a well-established contributor to tumor angiogenesis, we also find that tumor cell-expressed CD105 significantly contributes to tumor angiogenesis in RCC."
NLRP3 in tumor-associated macrophages predicts a poor prognosis and promotes tumor growth in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"The NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays cell- and tissue-specific roles in cancer, meaning that its activation in different tumors or cells may play different roles in tumor progression. We have previously described the tumor-promoting function of tumor-intrinsic NLRP3/IL-1β signaling in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but its role in immune cells remains unclear. In this study, we found that NLRP3 was highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in both mouse and human HNSCC, and the expression of NLRP3 was positively correlated with the density of TAMs according to immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry analyses. Importantly, the number of NLRP3high TAMs was related to worse overall survival in HNSCC patients. Knocking out NLRP3 inhibited M2-like macrophage differentiation in vitro. Moreover, the carcinogenic effect induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide was decreased in Nlrp3-deficient mice, which had smaller tumor sizes. Genetic depletion of NLRP3 reduced the expression of protumoral cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and CCL2, and suppressed the accumulation of TAMs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in mouse HNSCC. Thus, activation of NLRP3 in TAMs may contribute to tumor progression and have prognostic significance in HNSCC."
Current methods of preventing infectious disease and managing febrile neutropenia in childhood cancer patients: a nationwide survey in Japan,"Preventing infection and managing febrile neutropenia (FN) is mandatory for children with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. However, the current situation in Japan is unknown."
Cyclooxygenase-2 activates EGFR–ERK1/2 pathway via PGE2-mediated ADAM-17 signaling in testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia,Prostatic inflammation is the driving force in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). This work investigated the potential modulatory effect of COX-2 inhibition on ADAM-17/EGFR/ERK1/2 axis.
A new method of ventilation inhomogeneity assessment based on a simulation study using clinical data on congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases,"Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) is a diaphragm defect associated with lung hypoplasia and ventilation inhomogeneity (VI). The affected neonates are usually born with respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation after birth. However, significant interindividual VI differences make ventilation difficult. So far, there are no clinical methods of VI assessment that could be applied to optimize ventilation at the bedside. A new VI index is a ratio of time constants T1/T2 of gas flows in both lungs. Pressure-controlled ventilation simulations were conducted using an infant hybrid (numerical-physical) respiratory simulator connected to a ventilator. The parameters of the respiratory system model and ventilator settings were based on retrospective clinical data taken from three neonates (2, 2.6, 3.6 kg) treated in the Paediatric Teaching Clinical Hospital of the Medical University of Warsaw. We searched for relationships between respiratory system impedance (Z) and ventilation parameters: work of breathing (WOB), peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), and mean airway pressure (MAP). The study showed the increased VI described by the T1/T2 index value highly correlated with elevated Z, WOB, PIP and MAP (0.8–0.9, the Spearman correlation coefficients were significant at P < 0.001). It indicates that the T1/T2 index may help to improve the ventilation therapy of CDH neonates."
Comparison of changes in lipid profiles of premenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer treated with different endocrine therapies,"Adjuvant endocrine therapy improves the prognosis of early breast cancer with hormone receptor positivity. However, there is no systematic report on the effect of endocrine therapy (particularly ovarian function suppression, OFS) on serum lipids in premenopausal women. This retrospective cohort study aimed to determine whether various endocrine treatments had different effects on blood lipids. This study enrolled 160 premenopausal patients with stage I–III breast cancer in eastern China. The initial diagnostic information was retrieved from patient's medical records, including age at the time of diagnosis, tumor characteristics, anticancer treatment and past medical history. The changes in blood lipids in patients receiving different types of endocrine therapy were compared at the 3rd, 6th, 12th, and 24th months after initiating endocrine therapy. Generalized linear mixed model was used in our analyses. Our data revealed that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in patients with tamoxifen (TAM) were significantly lower in the 6th, 12th, and 24th months than that in the 3rd month, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in the 6th, 12th, and 24th months were significantly higher than that in the 3rd month, indicating that blood lipid levels generally improved with time. While in TAM plus OFS group, HDL-C levels were significantly higher in the 24th month than in the 3rd month, total cholesterol (TC) levels were significantly higher in the 24th month than in the 6th month. The lipid profiles of OFS plus aromatase inhibitor (AI) group did not show significant differences at any time point but were significantly higher than those of the other two groups especially in LDL and TC. TAM group tended to have lower serum lipid levels. With longer follow-up, no statistically significant difference in values was observed between TAM and TAM plus OFS groups at various time points. Compared with the other two groups, OFS plus AI group presented an increasing trend toward LDL-C and TC. The risk of dyslipidemia requires further investigation using a large sample size."
"The severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on bullying victimization, mental health indicators and quality of life","Children and adolescents have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of traditional and digital bullying and mental health problems a year into the pandemic. Further, how anxiety level, loneliness, and self-perceived school functioning have influenced the quality of life. A comprehensive questionnaire was administered (N = 1239) in the city of Tromsø and compared to a similar data collection (N = 972) conducted in the same schools in 2017. The main findings were increased prevalence in bullying, more mental health problems and significantly reduced quality of life compared to before the pandemic. Implications and the importance of implementing anti-bullying and psychosocial measures after the pandemic are discussed."
Machine learning can aid in prediction of IDH mutation from H&E-stained histology slides in infiltrating gliomas,"While Machine Learning (ML) models have been increasingly applied to a range of histopathology tasks, there has been little emphasis on characterizing these models and contrasting them with human experts. We present a detailed empirical analysis comparing expert neuropathologists and ML models at predicting IDH mutation status in H&E-stained histology slides of infiltrating gliomas, both independently and synergistically. We find that errors made by neuropathologists and ML models trained using the TCGA dataset are distinct, representing modest agreement between predictions (human-vs.-human κ = 0.656; human-vs.-ML model κ = 0.598). While no ML model surpassed human performance on an independent institutional test dataset (human AUC = 0.901, max ML AUC = 0.881), a hybrid model aggregating human and ML predictions demonstrates predictive performance comparable to the consensus of two expert neuropathologists (hybrid classifier AUC = 0.921 vs. two-neuropathologist consensus AUC = 0.920). We also show that models trained at different levels of magnification exhibit different types of errors, supporting the value of aggregation across spatial scales in the ML approach. Finally, we present a detailed interpretation of our multi-scale ML ensemble model which reveals that predictions are driven by human-identifiable features at the patch-level."
Chromatin remodeler CHD7 targets active enhancer region to regulate cell type-specific gene expression in human neural crest cells,"A mutation in the chromatin remodeler chromodomain helicase DNA-binding 7 (CHD7) gene causes the multiple congenital anomaly CHARGE syndrome. The craniofacial anomalies observed in CHARGE syndrome are caused by dysfunctions of neural crest cells (NCCs), which originate from the neural tube. However, the mechanism by which CHD7 regulates the function of human NCCs (hNCCs) remains unclear. We aimed to characterize the cis-regulatory elements governed by CHD7 in hNCCs by analyzing genome-wide ChIP-Seq data and identifying hNCC-specific CHD7-binding profiles. We compared CHD7-binding regions among cell types, including human induced pluripotent stem cells and human neuroepithelial cells, to determine the comprehensive properties of CHD7-binding in hNCCs. Importantly, analysis of the hNCC-specific CHD7-bound region revealed transcription factor AP-2α as a potential co-factor facilitating the cell type-specific transcriptional program in hNCCs. CHD7 was strongly associated with active enhancer regions, permitting the expression of hNCC-specific genes to sustain the function of hNCCs. Our findings reveal the regulatory mechanisms of CHD7 in hNCCs, thus providing additional information regarding the transcriptional programs in hNCCs."
The prognosis predictive score around primary debulking surgery (PPSP) improves diagnostic efficacy in predicting the prognosis of ovarian cancer,"In recent years, the pretreatment inflammatory responses have proven to predict the prognosis, but no report exists analyzing the combined inflammatory response of the pre- and postsurgical treatment. The current study aims to extract the factors predicting the recurrence and create novel predictive scoring. This retrospective study was conducted at our institution between November 2006 and December 2020, with follow-up until September 2022. Demographic and clinicopathological data were collected from women who underwent primary debulking surgery. We created the scoring system named the prognosis predictive score around primary debulking surgery(PPSP) for progression-free survival(PFS). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess its efficacy in predicting PFS and overall survival(OS). Cox regression analyses were used to assess its time-dependent efficacy. Kaplan–Meier and the log-rank test were used to compare the survival rate. A total of 235 patients were included in the current study. The cut-off value of the scoring system was six. Multivariate analyses revealed that an advanced International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics(FIGO) stage (p < 0.001 for PFS; p = 0.038 for OS), the decreased white blood cell count difference (p = 0.026 for PFS) and the high-PPSP (p = 0.004 for PFS; p = 0.002 for OS) were the independent prognostic factors. Cox regression analysis also supported the above results. The PPSP showed good prognostic efficacy not only in predicting the PFS but also OS of ovarian cancer patients comparable to FIGO staging."
Single-cell resolved ploidy and chromosomal aberrations in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-(NASH) induced hepatocellular carcinoma and its precursor lesions,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its precursor, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are an unmet health issue due to widespread obesity. We assessed copy number changes of genes associated with hepatocarcinogenesis and oxidative pathways at a single-cell level. Eleven patients with NASH-HCC and 11 patients with NAFLD were included. Eight probes were analyzed using multiplex interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (miFISH), single-cell imaging and phylogenetic tree modelling: Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), C-Myc (MYC), hepatocyte growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (MET), tumor protein 53 (TP53), cyclin D1 (CCND1), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), the fragile histidine triad gene (FHIT) and FRA16D oxidoreductase (WWOX). Each NASH-HCC tumor had up to 14 distinct clonal signal patterns indicating multiclonality, which correlated with high tumor grade. Changes frequently observed were TP53 losses, 45%; MYC gains, 36%; WWOX losses, 36%; and HER2 gains, 18%. Whole-genome duplications were frequent (82%) with aberrant tetraploid cells evolving from diploid ancestors. Non-tumorous NAFLD/NASH biopsies did not harbor clonal copy number changes. Fine mapping of NASH-HCC using single-cell multiplex FISH shows that branched tumor evolution involves genome duplication and that multiclonality increases with tumor grade. The loss of oxidoreductase WWOX and HER2 gains could be potentially associated with NASH-induced hepatocellular carcinoma."
Protistan epibionts affect prey selectivity patterns and vulnerability to predation in a cyclopoid copepod,"Colonisation of crustacean zooplankton with ciliate epibionts is widespread in freshwater and marine environments. However, the ecology of such association are little studied as yet. The occurrence of ciliate epibionts on copepods and the preference towards this association with different life stages of Mesocyclops were studied from winter to spring. Relative susceptibility of zooplankton species was evaluated by analysing the epibiont colonies and zooids and relate this to the surface area of the host. The maximum epibiont infestation per unit body surface area was recorded on copepodites followed by copepod nauplii rather than other zooplankton species, whereas the rotifer Asplanchna was never affected. Influence of climatic factors such as temperature on the colonisation of epibionts on basibionts was found significant. In winter (November to February) samples, copepods were infested by autotrophic epibionts whereas in late spring and early summer (March–April) heterotrophic protists (peritrichian ciliates) were the sole epibionts on copepods. We conducted experiments in the laboratory on prey selection pattern of predators by direct visual and video-graphic observations of various events (encounter, attack, capture, ingestion, prey escape) during predation by infested and uninfested copepodites and adults of Mesocyclops. Postencounter the attack probability was significantly lower in infested than in uninfested copepods. The present paper reports on substrate preference by epibionts and their impacts in food rich and food scarce environments. Furthermore, major environmental interactions were studied with the reproductive phenology of copepods with respect to epibionts and the cause and effect of long term association of epibionts with copepods need to be addressed."
An ancestral hard-shelled sea turtle with a mosaic of soft skin and scutes,"The transition from terrestrial to marine environments by secondarily aquatic tetrapods necessitates a suite of adaptive changes associated with life in the sea, e.g., the scaleless skin in adult individuals of the extant leatherback turtle. A partial, yet exceptionally preserved hard-shelled (Pan-Cheloniidae) sea turtle with extensive soft-tissue remains, including epidermal scutes and a virtually complete flipper outline, was recently recovered from the Eocene Fur Formation of Denmark. Examination of the fossilized limb tissue revealed an originally soft, wrinkly skin devoid of scales, together with organic residues that contain remnant eumelanin pigment and inferred epidermal transformation products. Notably, this stem cheloniid—unlike its scaly living descendants—combined scaleless limbs with a bony carapace covered in scutes. Our findings show that the adaptive transition to neritic waters by the ancestral pan-chelonioids was more complex than hitherto appreciated, and included at least one evolutionary lineage with a mosaic of integumental features not seen in any living turtle."
Dietary intervention with avocado (Persea americana Mill.) ameliorates intestinal inflammation induced by TNBS in rats,"Nutritional interventions have been shown to be an interesting approach for the treatment of chronic diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Persea americana Mill. (avocado), is a potential food to be used for the prevention or treatment of intestinal inflammation, due to its nutritional value and pharmacological effects. In this study we evaluated if the dietary intervention with avocado fruit pulp could as an intestinal anti-inflammatory diet using a trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) model of intestinal inflammation in rats. For this purpose, 5, 10 or 20% of avocado fruit pulp was incorporated in the diet of rats, for 21 days before and 7 days after TNBS-induced intestinal inflammation. Dietary intervention with avocado fruit pulp (20%) decreased the extension of colonic lesions (1.38 ± 0.99 vs. 2.67 ± 0.76 cm), weight/length colon ratio (151.03 ± 31.45 vs. 197.39 ± 49.48 cm), inhibited myeloperoxidase activity (891.2 ± 243.2 vs 1603 ± 158.2 U/g), reduced tumor necrosis factor-α (53.94 ± 6.45 vs. 114.9 ± 6.21 pg/mg), interleukin-1β (583.6 ± 106.2 vs. 1259 ± 81.68 pg/mg) and interferon gamma (27.95 ± 2.97 vs. 47.79 ± 3.51 pg/mg) levels and prevented colonic glutathione depletion (2585 ± 77.2 vs 1778 ± 167.2 nmol/g). The consumption of enriched diet with 20% avocado pulp by 28 days did not promote any alterations in the biochemical or behavioral parameters evaluated. Avocado showed intestinal anti-inflammatory activity, modulating immune response, and acting as antioxidant. The dietary intervention with avocado was safe, suggesting its potential as a complementary treatment in intestinal inflammation."
Enhanced photoelectronic performance of MoS2 nanosheets decorated TiO2 nanotube arrays via simultaneously promoting light absorption and charge separation,"Both light absorption and charge separation are highly important to the photoelectronic performance of semiconductor-based electrodes. Herein, we describe the fabrication of TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs) decorated with dual-functional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets using a facile hydrothermal method. The obtained MoS2/TiO2 heterojunction shows a high photocurrent density of 0.76 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE (V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode), which is over five times higher than that of pristine TiO2 NTAs. The enhanced photoelectronic performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between the extended light absorption and improved charge separation after the introduction of MoS2 nanosheet. This simple yet general strategy provides a unique platform to improve the catalytic activity of photoelectrode materials with a narrow band-gap."
Assessing the inequality in out-of-pocket health expenditure among the chronically and non-chronically ill in Saudi Arabia: a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis,"Many high-income countries have made significant progress towards achieving universal health coverage. Nevertheless, out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditure continues to undermine the effectiveness of the universal healthcare system. In Saudi Arabia, due to the overburdened free public health services, many people opt for alternative healthcare services, risking high OOP payments. The presence of chronic illness further exacerbates this situation. However, there is limited evidence on the extent of the gap in OOP health expenditure between the chronically and non-chronically ill and the associated drivers contributing to this gap. The aim of this study was to assess inequalities in relative OOP health expenditure, estimated as the percentage of income spent on healthcare, between the chronically and non-chronically ill in Saudi Arabia and their associated drivers."
Adverse effects of low serum lipoprotein cholesterol on the immune microenvironment in gastric cancer: a case‒control study,"Cholesterol is crucial for tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) remodeling. Serum lipoprotein cholesterol is closely associated with gastric cancer (GC) progression, but whether it affects TIME remodeling is unknown."
Mechanism of autophagy induced by activation of the AMPK/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway after TRIM22-mediated DENV-2 infection of HUVECs,Dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) was used to infect primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to examine autophagy induced by activation of the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway following tripartite motif-containing 22 (TRIM22)-mediated DENV-2 infection to further reveal the underlying pathogenic mechanism of DENV-2 infection.
Endometrial Thickness (ET) by TVS and its Correlation with HPE by Endometrial Aspiration Biopsy in Postmenopausal Bleeding,Postmenopausal Women can present with abnormal uterine bleeding. Evaluation methods may have to be applied meticulously with an idea of not missing the diagnosis and at the same time not to be invasive all the time. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of ET on TVS and endometrial aspiration biopsy with histopathology taken as the gold standard.
Genetic profiling of different phenotypic subsets of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) in breast cancer patients,"Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) have a crucial role in breast carcinogenesis, development, and progression. The aim of the current study is to characterize the BCSCs through the genetic profiling of different BCSCs phenotypic subsets to determine their related genetic pathways."
3D Interconnected Honeycomb-Like Multifunctional Catalyst for Zn–Air Batteries,The unique initiator doping strategy is adopted to achieve high dispersion of Fe atoms in the catalyst.
Efficacy and safety of pyronaridine-artesunate (Pyramax®) for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium vivax malaria in Northwest Ethiopia,"Declining efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment Plasmodium vivax malaria has been reported in different endemic settings in Ethiopia. This highlights the need to assess alternative options for P. vivax treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapy, such as pyronaridine-artesunate. This treatment regimen has shown high efficacy for uncomplicated malaria in both Africa and Asia. However, limited data are available from Ethiopia. This study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of pyronaridine-artesunate for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Northwest Ethiopia."
Effectiveness of seasonal malaria chemoprevention in three regions of Togo: a population-based longitudinal study from 2013 to 2020,"In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) in areas of high seasonal transmission. Though implemented since 2013, the effectiveness of SMC in Togo was never evaluated."
Experimental Investigation on Impact of Diethyl Ether Additives with Cashew Nut Shell Liquid Biodiesel Blends on Performance Characteristics of Engine Operating at Optimum Conditions,"Stringent emission norms and the fast depletion of fuel led to the use of alternate fuels and additives and work on methods to optimize fuel injection parameters and exhaust gas recirculation. The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of diethyl ether additives as blend constituents with diesel-cashew nut shell biodiesel blends. To facilitate biodiesel, minor modification such as retardation of timing by 4° CA, 15% split, and 20% EGR has been implemented. These modifications are intended to obtain lower emissions. Experiments are conducted by blending additives with diesel and biodiesel blends, and results are compared to the base. Higher latent heat of additives reduces combustion temperature, resulting in lower NOx emissions. Lower viscosity, higher cetane number, and higher oxygen concentration improved atomization, better air–fuel mixture, and complete combustion leading to a further reduction in CO, HC, and smoke emissions. Brake thermal efficiency and BSEC improved marginally with additives due to better combustion characteristics."
Impact of Physio-Chemical Properties of Ketones With 2-Methoxyethanol and 2-Butoxyethanol at 303 K,"At 303 K, the densities, viscosities, and the refractive indices in binary mixes of ketones with 2-butoxyethanol, and 2-methoxyethanol were determined as a function of the binary blends. Using these measurements, molar refraction, polarizability, and refractive index values are determined. The experimental values are used to determine excess characteristics such as molar volume (VE),molar refraction (RmE)and like as viscosities (ηE), deviations of refractive indices (ΔnD), Gibbs free energy (ΔG*E). The excess property data is predicted from the Redlich–Kister like polynomial type fitting parameters to determine their coefficients and standard deviations. The various theoretical models are used to examine the experimental refractive indices, and standard deviations are expected. The decreasing trend of excess molar volume deviation and increasing trends of excess Gibbs free energy deviation suggest that specific forms of interaction in unlike(dipole-induced dipole) molecules. The specific force can be described as hydrogen bonding between different molecules(C=O…H–O)."
Why Quasi-Realism cannot Accommodate Moral Mind-Independence,"Quasi-realists have proposed an “internal” reading of the mind-independence claim embedded in our moral discourse, according to which the claim to mind-independence itself is a moral claim. I argue against such a quasi-realist “internal” reading. My objection is that quasi-realists cannot plausibly explain why the majority of us, either implicitly or explicitly, take moral mind-independence to be a metaethical notion. Quasi-realists either must attribute a quite obvious mistake to most metaethical theorists without explaining why they cannot recognize it, or give us an intolerably ad hoc explanation about why ordinary moral speakers fail to understand their own words. Without properly addressing this problem, we have good reason to reject the quasi-realist account of moral mind-independence."
Torsional and axial vibration of restrained saturated nanorods via strain gradient elasticity,"Size-dependent torsional and longitudinal free vibrations of restrained saturated porous nanorods are studied by a higher-order elasticity theory. The strain gradient elasticity model is used in this study able to overcome inconsistencies of classical elasticity model. The presented higher-order model leads to well-posed boundary value problem for arbitrary value of the small size parameter. Two elastic springs in torsional and axial directions are attached to saturated porous nanorods at two boundary points. Angular rotation and axial deflection functions based on the strain gradient elasticity model are represented by two Fourier sine series. The difference of this proposed solution is that it does not impose a limitation on the support conditions and allows the frequencies to be obtained with a single solution. Two coefficient matrices including torsional or axial effects are obtained by using Stokes’ transformation and non-classical boundary conditions. Free vibration frequencies of saturated nanorods are calculated by an effective eigen-value solution strategy. It is shown clearly that elastic spring coefficients, small-scale parameter and saturation a notable impact on the dynamic response of nanorods."
Diel patterns of depth use and swimming activity of post-release greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili) in the northern Gulf of Mexico,"Greater amberjack are active swimmers that occur over a range of depths around reefs and artificial structures. In this study, we describe overall diel patterns of depth use and swimming activity for greater amberjack. We tested for impacts of fishing-related stress on diel patterns, and we describe the potential influence of cyclonic storms on diel behavior and site attachment. Fifty-five fish were tagged with depth and accelerometer tags off coastal Alabama, USA, in three field efforts (FEs): FE1, summer–fall 2018; FE2, spring 2019; and FE3, summer–fall 2020. Fish displayed diel depth patterns that varied among individuals: fish that occupied a narrow depth range midway within the water column, fish that spent time both at mid-water and near bottom, and fish with more generalized patterns. Diel depth use was best predicted by both site depth and field effort, while swimming patterns were best predicted by field effort among tested factors: legal or sublegal sizes, field effort, site, and use of a descender device vs. surface release. Swimming activity was elevated on post-release days 1–5, consistent with predicted impacts of fishing stress. For most fish, however, depth use did not vary appreciably following release. Release with a descender did not prevent altered diel patterns, and thus, barotrauma was not likely a factor. Fish occupied shallower depths when Hurricane Laura (2020) passed south of the study area, and swimming activity was elevated during Hurricane Sally (2020). Our study highlights that depth use and swimming activity of greater amberjack are influenced by multiple factors and recreational fishing discards may impart sublethal stress that results in elevated swimming activity."
Causal relationships between potential risk factors and chronic rhinosinusitis: a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study,"Smoking, alcohol consumption, allergic rhinitis (AR), asthma, and obesity are associated with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), albeit the causal relationships between them remain elusive. Therefore, we conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the bidirectional causal effects between these potential risk factors and CRS."
Complementary use of multi-model climate ensemble and Bayesian model averaging for projecting river hydrology in the Himalaya,"Considering the sensitivity and importance of water resources in the Himalayan uplands, this study intended to assess the hydrological responses to climate change in the Jhelum basin. Representative concentration pathway (RCP)–based projections from six dynamically downscaled global circulation models (GCMs) were bias-corrected for developing the climatic projections over the twenty-first century. The uncertainty associated with GCM outputs was addressed by using multi-model ensemble projections developed through Bayesian model averaging (BMA) technique. The assessment reveals that compared to the baseline (1980–2010) values, the annual mean maximum temperature in the basin will rise by 0.41–2.31 °C and 0.63–4.82 °C, and the mean minimum temperature will increase by 1.39–2.37 °C and 2.14–4.34 °C under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. While precipitation is expected to decrease by 7.2–4.57% and 4.75–2.47% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, correspondingly. BMA ensemble projections were coupled with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate the future hydrological scenarios of the drainage basin. With the changing climate, the discharge of rivers in the Jhelum basin is expected to witness reductions by about 23–37% for RCP4.5 and 19–46% for RCP8.5. Moreover, the water yield of the basin may also exhibit decreases of 17–25% for RCP4.5 and 18–42% for RCP8.5. The projected scenarios are likely to cause water stress, affect the availability of water for diverse uses, and trigger transboundary water-sharing-related conflicts. The impact of climate change on discharge demands early attention for the formulation of mitigation and adaptive measures at the regional level and beyond."
Zinc-doped and biochar support strategies to enhance the catalytic activity of CuFe2O4 to persulfate for crystal violet degradation,"Sulfate radicals-based Fenton-like technology has placed more emphasis on effectively dealing with the threat of dye wastewater. In this work, the Zn-doped CuFe2O4@biochar composite (Cu0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4@BC) was prepared through the convenient sol–gel pyrolysis process and applied as heterogeneous persulfate (PS) activator for crystal violet (CV) degradation. The crystal morphology and physicochemical properties of Cu0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4@BC were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method (BET), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The morphology of the catalyst changed before and after Zn doping. The crystallite size, lattice constant, saturation magnetization, and oxygen vacancy content increased after doping Zn. Compared with CuFe2O4@BC, the CV degradation efficiency of Cu0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4@BC activating PS increased from 87.7 to 96.9%, and the corresponding reaction rate constant increased by about 3.69 times. The effect of experimental conditions was systematically studied on the degradation progress. The degradation efficiency of CV was 91% after five times cycle experiments. Multiple experiments indicated that SO4•–, •OH and O2•– predominated for CV degradation. The degradation mechanism of CV in the Cu0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4@BC/PS system involved both free radical (SO4•–, •OH and O2•–) and non-free radical pathways (electron transfer). The possible degradation pathways were investigated according to the ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) analysis of degradation intermediates. The result showed that Cu0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4@BC have an excellent catalyst performance, which provides a new strategy for improving catalytic activity."
Can digital finance reduce carbon emission intensity? A perspective based on factor allocation distortions: evidence from Chinese cities,"The world is facing the challenges of climate change and energy structure adjustments. The role of digital finance, a new branch of business that combines digital technology and traditional financial products, in reducing global carbon emissions needs to be studied. This paper uses panel data on 280 cities in China from 2011 to 2019 to empirically examine the efficacy of digital finance for governing carbon emission reductions and the mechanism by which it does so. The results show that (1) digital finance can facilitate carbon emission reductions and help reduce carbon emission intensity within regions; (2) digital finance helps promote the rational allocation of resources and alleviates factor distortions by encouraging firms to rationally use their own factor endowments so as to reduce carbon emission intensity, which holds robustly after considering the endogenous issues such as possibly omitting variables and collinearity; and (3) differences in geographical location, the vitality of regional innovation and entrepreneurship, regional willingness to protect the environment, and environmental protection levels lead to heterogeneity in the effect of digital finance on carbon emission intensity. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously develop digital finance as a long-term tool for carbon governance."
Three-dimensional quantum wavelet transforms,"Wavelet transform is being widely used in the field of information processing. One-dimension and two-dimension quantum wavelet transforms have been investigated as important tool algorithms. However, three-dimensional quantum wavelet transforms have not been reported. This paper proposes a multi-level three-dimensional quantum wavelet transform theory to implement the wavelet transform for quantum videos. Then, we construct the iterative formulas for the multi-level three-dimensional Haar and Daubechies D4 quantum wavelet transforms, respectively. Next, we design quantum circuits of the two wavelet transforms using iterative methods. Complexity analysis shows that the proposed wavelet transforms offer exponential speed-up over their classical counterparts. Finally, the proposed quantum wavelet transforms are selected to realize quantum video compression as a primary application.

Comparative Study of Energy Efficiency Criteria for IGBC and GRIHA Systems Using Simulation,"Energy efficiency criteria are important in Green Building Rating (GBR) systems, and the requirements vary depending on the GBR system. A comparison study is conducted to distinguish between two major GBR systems used in India: Indian Green Building Council Green Homes (IGBC GH) and Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA). The energy simulation software eQuest was used to forecast annual energy demand for a case study multi-family residential building with various design scenarios. Various design combinations for the roof envelope, wall envelope, and HVAC efficiency were chosen, and the possibilities of meeting the energy efficiency criteria of the two GBR systems were discussed. It was discovered that an improvement made based on envelope condition, the efficiency of the HVAC system considered in this study, and assigning renewable energy gives higher energy performance under IGBC Green Homes, with the possibility of achieving full credit points, but the combinations discussed did not give the full credit points for GRIHA. GRIHA, in particular, requires a significant reduction in HVAC load to receive full credit. GRIHA requires more renewable energy allocation than IGBC GH because renewable energy for achieving credit points is a percentage of HVAC, lighting, and domestic hot water consumption, whereas IGBC GH is a percentage of common area lighting consumption."
Sevoflurane consumption pattern by individual anaesthesiologists varies widely despite using the same high-end workstations in the same hospital,"Volatile anaesthetics are potent greenhouse gasses but contemporary workstations enable considerable savings while improving patient safety. Institutions may provide this technology to reduce the ecological footprint but proper training and motivation is required to maximize their ecologic and financial benefit. This study aims to compare the sevoflurane consumption of 22 anaesthesiologists in a medium sized hospital 4 years after flow-i workstations (Getinge, Sweden) entered into service, in three airway approaches: intubated patients, laryngeal mask ventilation, and mask anaesthesia. Typical sevoflurane consumption for each anaesthesiologist was defined as the mean cumulative consumption in the chronologically first 50 cases meeting the inclusion criteria for each airway group in 2019. The potential savings, if everyone were to adopt the approach of the more economical anaesthesiologists (15th percentile), was calculated. The CO2 equivalent emissions were calculated using a GWP20 of 702 and a GWP100 of 195. The median [range] consumption after 45 min was 10.9 [7.5–18.4] ml in intubated patients and 9.0 [7.4–15.3] ml in patients with laryngeal mask, and 9.9 [3.4–20.9] ml after 8 min with mask ventilation. This corresponds to a double to six fold consumption between the least and most wasteful approach. The typical CO2 equivalent emissions (GWP20) per anaesthesiologist varied between 8.0 and 19.6 kg/45 min in intubated airways, between 7.9 and 16.3 kg/45 min in LMA, and between 3.6 and 22.3 kg/8 min in mask ventilation. Despite using the same workstations in the same hospital, the typical sevoflurane consumption differed dramatically between 22 anaesthesiologists. In addition to providing advanced workstations, proper education is required to achieve the behavior change needed to reduce the pollution and financial waste associated with volatile anaesthetics."
"A new self-assessment tool following shoulder stabilization surgery, the auto-Walch and auto-Rowe questionnaires","Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) are increasingly used for patient evaluation, as well as for scientific research. Few are used for practical purposes in the clinical setting, and few are reliable enough to allow proper feedback to physicians. Two of the most commonly used assessment tools in shoulder instability are the Walch–Duplay and the Rowe scores. The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of self-administered versions of the Walch–Duplay and Rowe scores following shoulder stabilization procedure."
A Detergent-Compatible Alkaline Metalloprotease from Bacillus pseudofirmus BBAU-19: Characterization and Application,"We isolated a bacterium (BBAU-19) producing alkaline protease from the saline soil of Uttar Pradesh, India. The isolate identified through 16S rRNA gene analysis was Bacillus pseudofirmus. The enzyme production of BBAU-19 was optimum at pH 9 and a temperature of 40 °C. The ammonium sulfate salt partially purified the crude enzyme. The filtered enzyme was analyzed under ion-exchange chromatography through a DEAE-cellulose column. The partially purified enzyme (PPE) activity increased up to ~ 1.92-fold compared to crude protease, and the recovery of protease enzyme was 54.60%. The molecular weight of the PPE was determined to be 42 kDa. The optimum temperature and pH of the PPE were 40 °C and 10.0, respectively. Ca++ and Mg++ ions enhanced the enzyme activity, while Cu++and Na+ ions suppressed it. The presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid completely inhibited the enzyme activity. The findings of this study suggest that the enzyme is a Metallo-type protease in nature. We evaluated the efficiency of alkaline protease by testing its ability to remove stains of the cloth stained with Bradford reagent. The compatibility test with detergents enhanced the commercial use of this enzyme. The PPE (partially purified enzyme) was compatible with Ghadi and Nirma detergents, and the de-staining was maximum with 500 ml of the PPE."
Effect of Microplastics on the Adsorption and Desorption Properties of Cadmium in Soil,"This study analyzed the role of micro polyethylene (mPE) and micro polypropylene (mPP) on cadmium (Cd) adsorption and desorption in soil. Cd adsorption in soils reached equilibrium within 240 min with or without mPP/mPE. The largest Cd adsorption amount was 923.88 mg kg−1 in the control treatment (no MPs). The Cd adsorption amount in the mPP treatment was 872.21 mg kg−1, greater than that in the mPE treatment (780.21 mg kg−1). MPs reduced the soil adsorption of Cd to some extent. Soils supplemented with mPE were more inhibitory to Cd adsorption than mPP. The pseudo-second-order model equation proved to be the most optimal equation for describing Cd adsorption dynamics in the presence of different MPs, while the Freundlich equation was best for describing isothermal adsorption of Cd in the presence of MPs. MPs facilitate the desorption of metals from the soil."
Nickel Removal from Aqueous Solution Using Peanut Oil–Coated Fe3O4 Nanoparticle,"In this study, it was aimed to examine the use of a natural material as an alternative to the use of chemicals in the stabilization stage of nanoparticles in order to minimize the damage to the environment both during the production phase and after its use in water treatment. Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesised in accordance with the co-precipitation method; coated with peanut oil to stabilize the nanoparticles and their efficiency in the removal of nickel from aqueous solution was investigated. Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray (SEM–EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyzes were performed to characterize the green synthesised material. As a result of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, the surface area of the Fe3O4 material coated with peanut oil was determined as 63.37 m2/g. According to the data obtained from the batch experiments, the nickel removal efficiency of the nanoparticle at the optimum conditions (contact time: 50 min, nanoparticle dose: 8 g/L, pH: 8, and initial nickel concentration: 30 mg/L) was obtained as 96.6%. Correlation coefficients of Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms were determined as 0.623 and 0.986, respectively."
Helopeltis theivora Responsive Transcriptomic Reprogramming Uncovers Long Non-coding RNAs as Possible Regulators of Primary and Secondary Metabolism in Tea Plant,"Helopeltis theivora or the tea mosquito bug (TMB) is reportedly one of the most devastating pests of tea plant (Camellia sinensis) causing threat to the beverage crop. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute a group of endogenous RNAs that play gene regulatory roles in eukaryotes. In the present study, 9502 lncRNAs were identified from healthy and TMB-infested C. sinensis tissues using high-throughput strand-specific RNA sequencing, out of which 80 lncRNAs got differentially expressed in response to TMB infestation. Determination of genes that could act as potential targets of lncRNAs revealed that the identified lncRNAs could possibly target as many as 5804 genes. Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis led to the identification of 3665 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which, the expression of 1767 genes got upregulated and 1898 genes got downregulated during tea plant’s response to TMB. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of DEGs and lncRNA-target genes have shown that TMB infestation might have triggered transcriptomic reprogramming leading to altered primary and secondary metabolism in C. sinensis. LncRNAs can act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to bind with common microRNA (miRNA) response elements (MREs) involving a competition between mRNAs and lncRNAs. We report 11 lncRNAs competing with 14 mRNAs to bind with 28 miRNAs forming the ceRNA network. The expression of 6 DEGs and 5 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) has been validated by qRT-PCR."

In this study, the laboratory data and echocardiography and abdominal ultrasonography assessments were evaluated before and after Methylprednisolone pulse as an initial treatment of hyper-inflammatory syndrome. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assessment the clinical manifestations and laboratory data and outcome after methylprednisolone pulse as an initial treatment."
Experimental Study on Rockburst and Spalling Failure in Circular Openings for Deep Underground Engineering,"This study aims to simulate the process of rockburst and spalling failure of roadway surrounding rock under three-dimensional stress in deep rock engineering. Utilizing an independently developed true triaxial rockburst experimental setup, the failure process of a circular tunnel under initial in-situ stress at a depth of 500 m was investigated using red sandstone with prefabricated holes. A miniature camera device and acoustic emission (AE) monitoring system were used to monitor and record the experimental process in real time. Using the collected data, the process of rockburst and spalling failure of the circular tunnel was reproduced. Finally, the difference between rockburst and spalling failure was analyzed and compared based on four aspects of stress characteristics, acoustic emission characteristics, fragment characteristics, and V-shaped notch morphology characteristics. The experimental results show that the failure of surrounding rock was more likely to occur under dynamic disturbance load, resulting in particle ejection. The spalling failure was found to be a slow and gradual static failure process. The mechanism of rockburst was more complex involving tension-shear coupling failure, whereas, the mechanism of spalling failure was simple involving a tensile failure. Compared with spalling failure, rockburst was more intense, producing more debris, and the V-shaped notch was narrow and deep."
Catalyst-free synthesis of highly functionalized triazole hexahydroquinoline carbohydrazide scaffolds via four-component cyclocondensation reaction,"A new class of multi-functional triazole hexahydroquinoline carbohydrazide named 2-amino-7,7-dimethyl-5-oxo-4-phenyl-1-(4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline-3-carbohydrazide has been synthesized by a novel multi-component process involving the reaction of dimedone, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, various benzaldehyde with cyanoacetohydrazide under mild conditions in the stoichiometric melt and chloroform in sequence. The simple one-pot process, straight product isolation without applying tedious purification procedures, progression of the reaction without using any catalyst, the application of diverse aldehydes causing a high molecular diversity, the existence of several nitrogen atoms in the product structure, and the possibility of creating multiple hydrogen bonding in the final compound are attractive specifications of the present strategy."
FLI1 accelerates leukemogenesis through transcriptional regulation of pyruvate kinase-L/R and other glycolytic genes,"In cancer cells, multiple oncogenes and tumor suppressors control glycolysis to sustain rapid proliferation. The ETS-related transcription factor Fli1 plays a critical role in the induction and progression of leukemia, yet, the underlying mechanism of this oncogenic event is still not fully understood. In this study, RNAseq analysis of FLI1-depleted human leukemic cells revealed transcriptional suppression of the PKLR gene and activation of multiple glycolytic genes, such as PKM1/2. Pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis by PKM2 inhibitor, Shikonin, significantly suppressed leukemic cell proliferation. FLI1 directly binds to the PKLR promoter, leading to the suppression of this inhibitor of glycolysis. In accordance, shRNA-mediated depletion of PKLR in leukemic HEL cells expressing high levels of FLI1 accelerated leukemia proliferation, pointing for the first time to its tumor suppressor function. PKLR knockdown also led to downregulation of the erythroid markers EPOR, HBA1, and HBA2 and suppression of erythroid differentiation. Interestingly, silencing of PKLR in HEL cells significantly increased FLI1 expression, which was associated with faster proliferation in culture. In FLI1-expressing leukemic cells, lower PKLR expression was associated with higher expression of PKM1 and PKM2, which promote aerobic glycolysis. Finally, injection of pyruvate, a known inhibitor of glycolysis, into leukemia mice significantly suppressed leukemogenesis. These results demonstrate that FLI1 promotes leukemia in part by inducing glycolysis, implicates PKLR in erythroid differentiation, and suggests that targeting glycolysis may be an attractive therapeutic strategy for cancers driven by FLI1 overexpression."
Experimental study of the influence of swing grinding parameters on machining surface quality of large-width cam,"The swing grinding method is an excellent choice for the manufacturing of the large-width cam to avoid the grinding defects and form splendid surface quality. Since the influence of swing grinding parameters on machining surface quality has not been clearly clarified, experimental study was conducted in the paper. The orthogonal experiment was designed, and based on which, the residual stress, surface roughness, and hardness of large-width cam were analyzed through the combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. The results showed that the grinding depth and the cam speed have a relatively great influence on the residual stress compared with grinding wheel swing frequency and swing amplitude. Moreover, the grinding wheel swing frequency has the greatest influence on the hardness of the cam surface and the increment of it will increase the hardness of the cam."
Design and effects of the teacher-student interaction model in the online learning spaces,"The interaction between teachers and students is vital for promoting teaching quality. Online learning spaces have various features that can support teacher-student interaction in online learning contexts. In this study, a preliminary model was developed by analyzing the principles underlying the interaction between teachers and students and the support features of online learning spaces. Then, the interaction model was refined and validated in three rounds of teaching practice involving 31 college students. A real-time dynamic artificial intelligence analysis system was used to analyze the teacher-student interaction during three rounds of design-based research. The results showed that the model significantly fostered students’ engagement during the interaction. Moreover, students significantly improved their final exam scores and their innovative problem-solving ability after the intervention."
"Assessment of Morphology and Degradation of Craters in and Around Gale Crater, Mars Using High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) Images","In the present study, high resolution stereo camera DEM and Martian crater catalog data have been used to analyze 154 craters with radii ranging from 900 m to 23 kms in the Gale crater and surrounding region. These craters are classified based on crater shape and crater degradation using morphometric parameters like crater rim, diameter, depth, slope, circularity index, and topographic roughness index (TRI). A positive linear correlation was observed between diameter and depth with R2 of 0.66 for small craters and 0.81 for large craters. A similar positive trend was observed between diameter and slope for small craters, whereas it was negative for large craters. TRI showed no correlation with diameter. As per crater degradation, 19.48% of the craters were found to be in class A (Fresh crater), 53.89% were in class B (Moderately degraded) and 26.62% were in class C (Degraded). For round floored craters, maximum craters were found to be in Class B and Class A and very few in Class C. In case of flat floored craters, maximum craters were falling under class B and Class C and very few in class A. Further, it was found that a maximum number of craters (102 out of 154) were found to be flat floored and degraded which may be due to the possible erosional or infilling activities."

"On the occasion of the centennial of insulin therapy (1922–2022), II-Organotherapy of diabetes mellitus (1906–1923): Acomatol. Pancreina. Insulin.","The general objective has been the historiographical investigation of the organotherapy of diabetes mellitus between 1906 and 1923 in its scientific, social and political dimensions, with special emphasis on the most relevant contributions of researchers and institutions and on the controversies generated on the priority of the ""discovery"" of antidiabetic hormone."
Strong Consistency for the Conditional Self-weighted M Estimator of GRCA(p) Models,"In this paper, we investigate the strong consistency for the conditional self-weighted M (SM, for short) estimator of generalized random coefficient autoregressive (GRCA(p), for short) model under some general assumptions. We obtain different estimators by taking different loss functions for the conditional SM estimation. What’s more, the simulation studies are provided by conducting three types of GRCA models. We allow that the variance of errors is finite or infinite, the numerical simulations are still valid. In addition, a real data example is given."
Whole bone subcutaneous transplantation as a strategy to study precisely the bone marrow niche,"Hematopoietic stem cells are maintained in a specialized microenvironment, known as the ‘niche’, within the bone marrow. Understanding the contribution of cellular and molecular components within the bone marrow niche for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells is crucial for the success of therapeutic applications. So far, the roles of crucial mechanisms within the bone marrow niche have been explored in transgenic animals in which genetic modifications are ubiquitously introduced in the whole body. The lack of precise tools to explore genetic alterations exclusively within the bone marrow prevents our determination of whether the observed outcomes result from confounding effects from other organs. Here, we developed a new method – ‘whole bone subcutaneous transplantation’- to study the bone marrow niche in transgenic animals precisely. Using immunolabeling of CD45.1 (donor) vs. CD45.2 (recipient) hematopoeitic stem cells, we demonstrated that hematopoeitic stem cells from the host animals colonize the subcutaneously transplanted femurs after transplantation, while the hematopoietic stem cells from the donor disappear. Strikinlgy, the bone marrow niche of these subcutaneously transplanted femurs remain from the donor mice, enabling us to study specifically cells of the bone marrow niche using this model. We also showed that genetic ablation of peri-arteriolar cells specifically in donor femurs reduced the numbers of hematopoietic stem cells in these bones. This supports the use of this strategy as a model, in combination with genetic tools, to evaluate how bone marrow niche specific modifications may impact non-modified hematopoietic stem cells. Thus, this approach can be utilized for genetic manipulation in vivo of specific cell types only within the bone marrow. The combination of whole bone subcutaneous transplantation with rodent transgenic models will facilitate a more precise, complex and comprehensive understanding of existing problems in the study of the hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow niche."
Design optimization of circular vessel using computational fluid dynamics for the effective heat storage,"The latent heat energy storage using Phase Change Material (PCM) has an enormous appeal due to its profitable points associated with density and thermal characteristics. In this regard, a heat exchanger is modelled and analyzed to visualize the thermal behaviour and melting progression of PCM in a circular-shaped enclosed erect vessel via CFD tool. This work analyzes a multiphase transient study of a U-shaped copper tube placed in a closed cylindrical vessel through which heat transfer fluid flows for transferring heat to the PCM. This work shall be advantageous to the researchers to realize the thermal performance, time of PCM melting etc., to carry out research related to solar heat storage. The present study reports substantial decrease in the time taken to melt all the PCM filled in the container. Almost 32% of time is saved in the process of melting of PCM and thus improving the efficiency of the energy storage system."
Alginate Encapsulation Stabilizes Xylanase Toward the Laccase Mediator System,"Xylanase, a hydrolytic enzyme, is susceptible to inactivation by the oxidative conditions generated by the laccase mediator system (LMS). Given the impetus to develop a mixed enzyme system for application in biomass processing industries, xylanase was encapsulated with either Cu2+- or Ca2+-alginate and then exposed to the LMS with variations such as mediator type, mediator concentration, and treatment pH. Results demonstrate that alginate-encapsulated xylanase retains substantial activity (> 80%) when exposed to the LMS relative to non-encapsulated xylanase. Cu2+-alginate generally provided better protection than Ca2+-alginate for all mediators, and protection was observed even at a low pH, where the LMS is most potent. Despite encapsulation, xylanase was still capable of hydrolyzing its polymeric substrate xylan, given kcat/Km values within an order of magnitude of that for non-encapsulated xylanase. The alginate matrix does not impede the function of the oxidized mediator, since comparable Vmax values were observed for the conversion of veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde by free and Cu2+-alginate encapsulated laccase. Overall, these results support development of a mixed enzyme system for biomass delignification and, more broadly, show potential for protecting protein function in an oxidative environment."
Biodegradation of the Pesticides Bifenthrin and Fipronil by Bacillus Isolated from Orange Leaves,"The pyrethroid bifenthrin and the phenylpyrazole fipronil are widely employed insecticides, and their extensive use became an environmental issue. Therefore, this study evaluated their biodegradation employing bacterial strains of Bacillus species isolated from leaves of orange trees, aiming at new biocatalysts with high efficiency for use singly and in consortium. Experiments were performed in liquid culture medium at controlled temperature and stirring (32 °C, 130 rpm). After 5 days, residual quantification by HPLC-UV/Vis showed that Bacillus amyloliquefaciens RFD1C presented 93% biodegradation of fipronil (10.0 mg.L−1 initial concentration) and UPLC-HRMS analyses identified the metabolite fipronil sulfone. Moreover, Bacillus pseudomycoides 3RF2C showed a biodegradation of 88% bifenthrin (30.0 mg.L−1 initial concentration). A consortium composed of the 8 isolated strains biodegraded 81% fipronil and 51% bifenthrin, showing that this approach did not promote better results than the most efficient strains employed singly, although high rates of biodegradation were observed. In conclusion, bacteria of the Bacillus genus isolated from leaves of citrus biodegraded these pesticides widely applied to crops, showing the importance of the plant microbiome for degradation of toxic xenobiotics."
Artabotrys odoratissimus Bark Extract Restores Ethanol Induced Redox Imbalance and Toxicity in Hepatocytes and In Vivo Model,"Alcohol-induced oxidative stress is a key player in the development of liver diseases, and herbal alternatives are important means of ameliorating the hepatotoxic effects. The study aimed to evaluate the hepatoprotective potentiality of Artabotrys odoratissimus, an important medicinal shrub from the family Annonaceae. The phenolic compounds from bark ethanol extract (BEE) were detected using RP-HPLC. The in vitro hepatoprotective activity against ethanol-induced damage was studied in HepG2 cells with cell viability assays, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, double staining assay and western blotting. The in vivo mice model was used to evaluate the alcohol-induced stress with liver function enzymes, lipid profile and histopathology. All the thirteen phenolic compounds detected with HPLC were docked onto protein targets such as aspartate amino transferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NO). The RP-HPLC detected the presence of various phenolics including rutin, chlorogenic acid and catechin, amongst others. Co-administration of BEE with ethanol alleviated cell death, ROS and MMP in HepG2 cells compared to the negative control. The extract also modulated the MAP kinase/caspase-3 pathway, thereby showing protective effects in HepG2 cells. Also, pre-treatment for 14 days with the extract in the mice model before a single toxic dose (5 g/kg body weight) reduced the liver injury by bringing the levels of liver function enzymes, lipid profile and bilirubin to near normal. In silico analysis revealed that rutin showed the best binding affinity with all the target proteins in the study. These results provide evidence that BEE possesses significant hepatoprotective effects against ethanol-induced oxidative stress in hepatic cells and in vivo models, which is further validated with in silico analysis."
In-vitro degradation behavior of hybrid epoxy-alkyl sol–gel/anodized composite coating on AZ31B Mg alloy,"Mg alloys are considered a promising alternative to use as biodegradable implants. However, the main limitations of these alloys are the high susceptibility to hydrogen evolution and corrosion. Consequently, it is necessary to control the corrosion rate through surface treatment techniques. In this regard, a double layer system, based on the first deposition of a MgO coating and the subsequent deposition of an organo-silane sol-gel coating (anodized/SGMI) was proposed to increase the biocompatibility and reduce the corrosion rate of Mg alloy. Sol-gel coatings were prepared using methyltriethoxysilane (MTES), (glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (GPTMS), SiO2 nanoparticles, and 1-methyl imidazole (1-MI). 29Si and 13C NMR measurements were performed to investigate the inorganic-organic network formation during the sol-gel synthesis, and to characterize the structure of the cured silane coating. According to the results, the addition of 1-MI mainly promotes the condensation reaction of GPTMS and MTES. After sol-gel deposition, a higher cross-linking coating network was obtained and the degradation of AZ31B Mg alloy in simulated body fluid (SBF) was slowed down. The control of the hydrogen and pH evolution over 450 h suggest that the anodized/SGMI coating system may be suitable for short-term implants applications; particularly for applications that are expected to degrade after 10-12 days such as surgical skin staples."
Magnetite based green bio composite for uranium exclusion from aqueous solution,"The work demonstrates a new greener approach in developing bio-composite magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4@PBP) containing a sorbent extracted from papaya (Carica papaya) bark for efficient uranium (VI) sorption from aqueous media. The findings showed that Fe3O4@PBP nano composites exhibited a characteristic average size of around 26.4 nm, as inferred from the XRD data. Further, these nano composite performed well in the uptake of uranium (VI), revealing the removal efficiency and the maximum adsorption capacity to be 88.8% and 120.48 mg/g, respectively. The thermodynamic investigation indicated that the endothermic uranium(VI) uptake sorption process by expeditious Fe3O4@PBP nano composite is naturally impulsive."
An engineering classification system for the detached granite blocks distributed on slopes,"Gentle slopes with large amounts of granite blocks are widespread in granitic areas with warm and humid climate. These blocks pose a potential risk to the existing and planned infrastructure. The instability type and geometry of these blocks will influence their motility and destructive power to some extent. This study aims at creating a classification system that can indicate both the shape and the instability type of these blocks and then developing a block removal scheme. The classification system was constructed based on the mechanical stability analysis of blocks on an inclined surface. This analysis identified key factors affecting stability, including block shape, block weathering roundness, the existing state of a block on a slope, and the friction between the block and the slope. The achieved work allowed the establishment of a direct correlation between block geometry and their instability types. The availability of this classification system was validated by field data and experimental data in the literature. The proposal to remove blocks identified as the toppling types, such as cylindrical-toppling types, cuboid-toppling types, cube-toppling types, was put forward to avoid the uneconomical problem of a complete clearance. Meanwhile, this classification provides a foundation for further research on the instability probability of each type of block and the development of a more refined blocks’ removal scheme. The classification approach adopted in this paper can provide a reference for the classification of other lithological blocks under similar engineering geological conditions."

"Effect of Part Thickness and Build Angle on the Microstructure, Surface Roughness, and Mechanical Properties of Additively Manufactured IN-939","Powder bed fusion-laser beam of metals (PBF-LB/M) has attracted significant interest due to the possibility of producing dedicated design features like thin-walled structures, even though their mechanical response and microstructure are not well understood. Hence, thin-walled IN-939 structures of different thicknesses (0.5, 1 and 2 mm) were manufactured at two build angles (90 and 45 deg) by PBF-LB/M. A preferred 〈100〉 crystallographic orientation was found along the build direction in all cases. The crystallographic texture intensity and surface roughness increased as the part thickness decreased for 90 deg and increased for 45 deg build angle. Reduction in wall thickness resulted in a decrease in the tensile properties, e.g., YS decreases by up to 33 pct and UTS decreases by up to 30 pct in comparison with the bulk specimen which had YS of 1051 ± 11 MPa and UTS of 1482 ± 9 MPa. Obtained results indicate that the apparent difference in tensile properties is primarily due to the overestimation of the load-bearing area. Two methods to estimate the accurate tensile properties based on roughness compensation are presented, using of which the corrected tensile performance of the thin-walled specimens was comparable with a standard tensile specimen."
Conversion of Coal into Graphitized Microcrystalline Carbon with a Hierarchical Porous Structure for Electrochemical Hydrogen Storage,"Electrochemical hydrogen storage, which can be performed at ambient temperatures and mild pressures, is regarded as a promising technique to store hydrogen safely and efficiently. In this study, the electrochemical hydrogen storage performance of activated carbon was improved by synthesizing a graphitized microcrystalline porous carbon material through a facile one-step catalytic carbonization activation procedure using coal as the raw material. Owing to the synthetic effect of the conductive network and the hierarchical porous structure, the carbon electrode exhibited high capacity, excellent rate performance, and substantial cycling stability for electrochemical hydrogen storage. The hydrogen storage capacity of the material was 278 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1, with considerable capacity retention of 86% after 50 cycles. The electrode exhibited superior rate capacity of 260 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1. Porous carbon with microcrystalline graphite was demonstrated to be an efficient electrode for electrochemical hydrogen storage."

Silk fibroin microgels as a platform for cell microencapsulation,"Cell microencapsulation has been utilized for years as a means of cell shielding from the external environment while facilitating the transport of gases, general metabolites, and secretory bioactive molecules at once. In this light, hydrogels may support the structural integrity and functionality of encapsulated biologics whereas ensuring cell viability and function and releasing potential therapeutic factors once in situ. In this work, we describe a straightforward strategy to fabricate silk fibroin (SF) microgels (µgels) and encapsulate cells into them. SF µgels (size ≈ 200 µm) were obtained through ultrasonication-induced gelation of SF in a water-oil emulsion phase. A thorough physicochemical (SEM analysis, and FT-IR) and mechanical (microindentation tests) characterization of SF µgels were carried out to assess their nanostructure, porosity, and stiffness. SF µgels were used to encapsulate and culture L929 and primary myoblasts. Interestingly, SF µgels showed a selective release of relatively small proteins (e.g., VEGF, molecular weight, MW = 40 kDa) by the encapsulated primary myoblasts, while bigger (macro)molecules (MW = 160 kDa) were hampered to diffusing through the µgels. This article provided the groundwork to expand the use of SF hydrogels into a versatile platform for encapsulating relevant cells able to release paracrine factors potentially regulating tissue and/or organ functions, thus promoting their regeneration."
Reconstruction of rabbit mandibular bone defects using carbonate apatite honeycomb blocks with an interconnected porous structure,"Carbonate apatite (CO3Ap) granules are useful as a bone substitute because they can be remodeled to new natural bone in a manner that conforms to the bone remodeling process. However, reconstructing large bone defects using CO3Ap granules is difficult because of their granular shape. Therefore, we fabricated CO3Ap honeycomb blocks (HCBs) with continuous unidirectional pores. We aimed to elucidate the tissue response and availability of CO3Ap HCBs in the reconstruction of rabbit mandibular bone defects after marginal mandibulectomy. The percentages of the remaining CO3Ap area and calcified bone area (newly formed bone) were estimated from the histological images. CO3Ap area was 49.1 ± 4.9%, 30.3 ± 3.5%, and 25.5 ± 8.8%, whereas newly formed bone area was 3.0 ± 0.6%, 24.3 ± 3.3%, and 34.7 ± 4.8% at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, respectively, after implantation. Thus, CO3Ap HCBs were gradually resorbed and replaced by new bone. The newly formed bone penetrated most of the pores in the CO3Ap HCBs at 12 weeks after implantation. By contrast, the granulation tissue scarcely invaded the CO3Ap HCBs. Some osteoclasts invaded the wall of CO3Ap HCBs, making resorption pits. Furthermore, many osteoblasts were found on the newly formed bone, indicating ongoing bone remodeling. Blood vessels were also formed inside most of the pores in the CO3Ap HCBs. These findings suggest that CO3Ap HCBs have good osteoconductivity and can be used for the reconstruction of large mandibular bone defects."
Superpixel-based foreground-preserving image stitching,"Image stitching aims to stitch multiple images with overlapping areas into a high-resolution image with natural appearance, no ghosting and no seam, so as to obtain a wide field of vision. And the stitching is required to be as fast as possible. In this article, we discuss the loss of foreground object caused by the seam-cut method for image stitching. Moreover, we propose an improved seam-cut method based on superpixel to solve this problem. The proposed method uses the matching information of feature points and superpixel segmentation to divide the scene into foreground and background. By adjusting the penalty value of foreground superpixels in the superpixel-based seam-cut method, the foreground object can avoid the cutting of optimal seam. The experimental results demonstrate that our method will not cause the ghosting of foreground object or the loss of foreground object in the stitching result in the scene with large parallax. In this method, the foreground object will be preserved completely."
Fortified milk-beverage with amphora algae and its functionality for aflatoxin inactivation in rats,"Aflatoxins are considered a severe hazard, contaminate dietary products, and cause malignant alterations in liver tissues. Fermented milk (FM) is prepared using probiotic lactic acid strains. This investigation aimed to produce an integrated milk beverage, inactivating aflatoxins toxicity and biotransformation. The proximate analysis of the investigated materials and biochemical parameter changes of the in-vivo experiment were determined. Results reflected the extract’s valuable content of polysaccharides and antioxidants. Nine phenolics were identified predominantly with catechin (39.67 ± 1.5 µg/g). FM-fortification is reflected by enhancement in protein (49.5 ± 2.97 g/Kg) and fiber content (1.78 ± 0.54 g/Kg) compared to the FM content. Relative rats’ weight gain improved to 34.29% for the fortified-FM group close to the control; it was recorded at 16.47% for the AFM1 group. Alkaline phosphatase in AFM1 rats was 99.2 ± 1.86 U/L and decreased to 44.2 ± 0.71 U/L in the fortified-FM group (44.2 ± 0.71 U/L) to be close to the control group. Aflatoxin M1 rats exposure reflects tissue alterations and cell damage, which recorded lesser in rats treated by extract and beverage administrations. The beverage’s corrective action relied on two integrated mechanisms, aflatoxin-binding to bacterial and bioactivity interaction of extract substances. This beverage stopped tissue alterations that occurred due to aflatoxins. The result supports the future production of fortified-milk beverages as a bio-shield against aflatoxin toxicity, besides their nutritional and functional properties."
Rapid detection of gingerol and thymol in medicinal foods based on Fe2O3 nanoparticles modified glassy carbon electrode,"Ginger and Ajwain are used extensively in food products, natural medicine to treat certain common diseases and as an immunity booster against viral infections. In this work, we report the fabrication of a novel electrochemical sensor based on α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles for detection and quantification of [6]-Gingerol (GIN) and Thymol (THY) which are water soluble phytochemicals derived from edible herbs Ginger and Ajwain respectively. The α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were synthesised by sol-gel method and its structure and composition were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy studies. The α-Fe2O3 NPs modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of GIN and THY in phosphate buffer saline at pH 7. The α-Fe2O3 modified GCE exhibited the lowest detection limits of 35.2 nM and 24 nM for GIN and THY respectively over the corresponding dynamic ranges of 55.6 nM to 118 µM and 27.8 nM to 56 µM. Detailed interference study confirmed the potential anti-interference ability of the fabricated sensor against a number of potential interfering compounds. Cyclic stability study yielded relative standard deviation (RSD) values of 9.9% and 9.18% for GIN and THY respectively, demonstrating excellent stability of the sensor. Reproducibility of the α-Fe2O3/GCE was investigated by testing a number of electrodes which yielded RSD values of 1.08% and 0.97%, for GIN and THY respectively. These promising characteristic features of the proposed sensor make it suitable for quick and precise detection of GIN and THY in food and natural medicines."
Disease detection and physical disorders classification for citrus fruit images using convolutional neural network,"Citrus is an agricultural product with significant added value in the world. Depending on market demands and causing possible economic losses, disease detection in citrus fruits at an early stage is important as well as for all agricultural products. Therefore, it is critical to detect both early-stage citrus diseases and physically damaged citrus fruits with technological solutions. In this study, a new convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model, CitrusNet, was proposed for the classification of defective and deformed citrus fruits. In this study, 5149 images of citrus fruits were collected from citrus orchards in Antalya, Turkey. In the experiments conducted with four different CNN models, the CitrusNet and ResNet50 models obtained the best classification results. In the other phase of the study, experiments were carried out to detect Alternaria alternata and Thrips diseases, which are common in Turkey, using five different CNN models. In the first phase of the study, a dataset of 3582 images of citrus diseases was obtained. The experimental results show that the YOLOv5 and Mask R-CNN models adequately detected the citrus diseases compared to the other models. These models achieved the best performance with an average precision (AP) of 0.99."

Assessing the inequality in out-of-pocket health expenditure among the chronically and non-chronically ill in Saudi Arabia: a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis,"Many high-income countries have made significant progress towards achieving universal health coverage. Nevertheless, out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditure continues to undermine the effectiveness of the universal healthcare system. In Saudi Arabia, due to the overburdened free public health services, many people opt for alternative healthcare services, risking high OOP payments. The presence of chronic illness further exacerbates this situation. However, there is limited evidence on the extent of the gap in OOP health expenditure between the chronically and non-chronically ill and the associated drivers contributing to this gap. The aim of this study was to assess inequalities in relative OOP health expenditure, estimated as the percentage of income spent on healthcare, between the chronically and non-chronically ill in Saudi Arabia and their associated drivers."
Experimental Investigation on Impact of Diethyl Ether Additives with Cashew Nut Shell Liquid Biodiesel Blends on Performance Characteristics of Engine Operating at Optimum Conditions,"Stringent emission norms and the fast depletion of fuel led to the use of alternate fuels and additives and work on methods to optimize fuel injection parameters and exhaust gas recirculation. The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of diethyl ether additives as blend constituents with diesel-cashew nut shell biodiesel blends. To facilitate biodiesel, minor modification such as retardation of timing by 4° CA, 15% split, and 20% EGR has been implemented. These modifications are intended to obtain lower emissions. Experiments are conducted by blending additives with diesel and biodiesel blends, and results are compared to the base. Higher latent heat of additives reduces combustion temperature, resulting in lower NOx emissions. Lower viscosity, higher cetane number, and higher oxygen concentration improved atomization, better air–fuel mixture, and complete combustion leading to a further reduction in CO, HC, and smoke emissions. Brake thermal efficiency and BSEC improved marginally with additives due to better combustion characteristics."

Prediction of the delivered instantaneous lumen by a straight tubular daylight pipe: an experimental evaluation and application for Indian climatic condition,"The judicious utilization of available daylight for indoor illumination is an indispensable requirement for buildings. A daylight pipe is considered an appropriate daylighting system to bring daylight in a deep-plan indoor space. Mathematical models are available to predict horizontal illuminance contributed by daylight pipe as a function of global horizontal illuminance. Since light collection and propagation characteristics of direct and diffuse light through a highly specular light guiding system are different, direct and diffuse components of global illuminance are to be considered separately. This paper presents a mathematical formulation for estimation of the delivered instantaneous lumen by a straight tubular hollow daylight pipe system as a function of instantaneous global horizontal illuminance considering direct and diffuse components separately which is applicable for mostly clear sky conditions prevail in a tropical region. Experimental validation of the proposed formulation is conducted under the real sky and the root means square deviation and the percentage deviation of the predicted lumen from the measured lumen are found at 23.83 lumens and 1.17%, respectively, while the correlation coefficient is obtained as 0.9967. Finally, the application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated with DLPs of different configurations for four representative days using measured solar radiation data under Indian sky conditions."
Design of 16 × 100 Gbps free-space optical system using advanced modulation techniques,"In this paper, advanced modulation techniques based on external modulation, such as I-AMI, AMI, and DBRZ, are designed to improve long-haul transmission and lower high power requirements in the FSO communication system. For long-haul 16 × 100 Gbps FSO systems, an alternate mark inversion modulation approach with high-data rate distortion less transmission is possible. The results demonstrate improved performance in terms of performance indicators such as Q-factor (29.62) and BER (3.8e−193), as well as improved data transmission capabilities of up to 100 Gbps over a distance of 9 km in clear weather. Because here, AMI technique uses a low input power of 5 dBm instead of a conventional power of 10 dBm, the achieved findings demonstrate a reasonable reduction in signal degradation, especially nonlinear effects."
Microbial Population Dynamics in Lemnaceae (Duckweed)-Based Wastewater Treatment System,"The dynamic microflora associated within, and in the surrounding aquatic environment, has been found to be responsible for the functional properties of many aquatic plants. The aim of the current work was to evaluate the effectiveness of Lemnaceae-based wastewater treatment system under tropical conditions and investigate the changes in the aquatic microflora upon plant growth. A biological wastewater treatment system was designed and investigated using mixed Lemnaceae culture comprising Lemna minor and Spirodela polyrhiza in a batch mode. A significant reduction in total solids (31.8%), biochemical oxygen demand (93.5%), and chemical oxygen demand (73.2%) was observed after seven days of duckweed growth using a low inoculum. A preliminary study on the change in the microbial population diversity and functionality, in the wastewater before and after treatment, revealed an increase in the denitrifying microflora in wastewater post-Lemnaceae treatment. Dominance of 10 bacterial phyla, contributing for 98.3% of the total bacterial communities, was recorded, and ~ 50.6% loss of diversity post-treatment of wastewater was revealed by the Shannon Index. Among 16 bacterial families showing relative abundance of ≥ 1% in untreated wastewater, Methylobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Brucellaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Acetobacteraceae prevailed in the water post-treatment by duckweeds. This is a novel work done on the dynamics of aquatic microflora associated with Lemnaceae under tropical Indian conditions. It confirms the application of Lemnaceae-based wastewater treatment system as effective biofilter and calls for further studies on the active involvement of the endophytic and aquatic microflora in the functions of these plant."

On the predictions of cumulative prospect theory for third and fourth order risk preferences,"In this paper, we analyse higher-order risky choices by the representative cumulative prospect theory (CPT) decision maker from three alternative reference points. These are the status quo, average payout and maxmin. The choice tasks we consider in our analysis include binary risks, and are the ones employed in the experimental literature on higher order risk preferences. We demonstrate that the choices made by the representative subject depend on the reference point. If the reference point is the status quo and the lottery choices exhibit symmetric risk, we demonstrate that there is no third order reflection effect of lottery choices but there is a fourth order reflection effect. When the average payout is the reference point, we demonstrate that any third or fourth order lottery choice is possible dependent upon the lottery payoffs. However, under the assumption of maxmin reference point, the risky choices are prudent and temperate. In addition to these results, our analysis reveals that the representative CPT subject can choose combinations of second with third and fourth order risky options that differ from those in other major models of decision under risk. We contrast our theoretical predictions with the empirical results reported in the literature on higher order risk preferences and are able to reconcile some conflicting experimental evidence."
Electrochemical nanosensor for ultrasensitive detection of malachite green and monitoring of its photocatalytic degradation,"Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization, and application of TiO2/ZnO and La-doped ZnO nanocomposites for the detection and degradation studies of Malachite Green (MG). TiO2/ZnO and La-doped ZnO nanocomposites were synthesized by reflux and hydrothermal methods, respectively, and characterized by UV–visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. A glassy carbon electrode modified with COOH-fMWCNTs and TiO2/ZnO nanocomposite demonstrated high sensitivity characteristics for the sensing of MG up to 0.34 nM limit of detection. The application of a photocatalytic method using 2% La-doped ZnO led to 99% degradation of MG in 40 min. The photocatalytic breakdown of MG followed first-order kinetics as revealed from the spectroscopic and electrochemical monitoring of the degradation process. Color variation offered naked-eye evidence of MG degradation in the specified time. The experimental findings helped in proposing the degradation mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, the current work presents the first example of a novel photocatalyst for almost absolute degradation of MG. Moreover, the electrode modifier as well as the approach adopted is novel and efficient for minute-level detection of MG and monitoring of its photocatalytic degradation."
Construction and validation of a prognostic model for osteosarcoma patients based on autophagy-related genes,"Osteosarcoma is the most frequent primary bone malignancy with a poor prognosis because of pulmonary metastasis.

Machine learning regression-based RETRO-VLP for real-time and stabilized indoor positioning,"Many real-world applications require real-time and robust positioning of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this context, visible light communication (VLC) is a promising approach due to its advantages in terms of high accuracy, low cost, ubiquitous infrastructure, and freedom from RF interference. Nevertheless, there is a growing need to improve positioning speed and accuracy. In this paper, we propose and prototype a VLC-based positioning solution using retroreflectors attached to the IoT device of interest. The proposed algorithm uses the retroreflected power received by multiple photodiodes to estimate the euclidean and directional coordinates of the underlying IoT device. In particular, the relative relationship between reflected light magnitude and reflected power is used as input to trainable machine learning regression models. Such models are trained to estimate the coordinates. The proposed algorithm excels in its simplicity and fast computation. It also reduces the need for sensory devices and active operation. Additionally, after regression, Kalman filtering is applied as a post-processing operation to further stabilize the obtained estimates. The proposed algorithm is shown to provide stable, accurate, and fast. This has been verified by extensive experiments performed on a prototype in real-world environments. Experiments confirm a high level of positioning accuracy and the added benefit of Kalman filtering stabilization."
Impact of quorum sensing from native peanut phosphate solubilizing Serratia sp. S119 strain on interactions with agronomically important crops,"Bacteria communicate with each other using a language based on the use of autoinducer molecules (AI) to collectively control gene expression through the process known as quorum sensing (QS). The N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) are the most common AIs known in Gram-negative bacteria. Numerous genes encoding QS systems have been reported in plant beneficial endophytic bacterial genomes although there are fewer studies evaluating the participation of QS in the mechanisms of plant growth promotion. The aim of this study was to describe the genetic background and the types of AHLs produced by a phosphate-solubilizing bacterial strain isolated from the roots of peanut Serratia sp. S119, and to evaluate the participation of these AIs in promoting the growth of plants of agronomic importance."
Complementary use of multi-model climate ensemble and Bayesian model averaging for projecting river hydrology in the Himalaya,"Considering the sensitivity and importance of water resources in the Himalayan uplands, this study intended to assess the hydrological responses to climate change in the Jhelum basin. Representative concentration pathway (RCP)–based projections from six dynamically downscaled global circulation models (GCMs) were bias-corrected for developing the climatic projections over the twenty-first century. The uncertainty associated with GCM outputs was addressed by using multi-model ensemble projections developed through Bayesian model averaging (BMA) technique. The assessment reveals that compared to the baseline (1980–2010) values, the annual mean maximum temperature in the basin will rise by 0.41–2.31 °C and 0.63–4.82 °C, and the mean minimum temperature will increase by 1.39–2.37 °C and 2.14–4.34 °C under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. While precipitation is expected to decrease by 7.2–4.57% and 4.75–2.47% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, correspondingly. BMA ensemble projections were coupled with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate the future hydrological scenarios of the drainage basin. With the changing climate, the discharge of rivers in the Jhelum basin is expected to witness reductions by about 23–37% for RCP4.5 and 19–46% for RCP8.5. Moreover, the water yield of the basin may also exhibit decreases of 17–25% for RCP4.5 and 18–42% for RCP8.5. The projected scenarios are likely to cause water stress, affect the availability of water for diverse uses, and trigger transboundary water-sharing-related conflicts. The impact of climate change on discharge demands early attention for the formulation of mitigation and adaptive measures at the regional level and beyond."
How do financial fragility and ICT penetration affect renewable energy consumption and green growth in top-polluting economies?,"Green growth is an extension of traditional economic growth. Financial fragility and ICT penetration are important pillars of green growth sustainability. However, very limited studies have explored this association and provided conflicting results. Thus, our study intends to fill this vacuum by exploring the impact of financial fragility and ICT penetration on renewable energy consumption and green growth for the top five polluting economies over the period 1996–2020. In this study, financial fragility is measured by bank costs and bank non-performing loans. Panel ARDL technique is used to find out long-run and short-run results estimates. Financial fragility reduces renewable energy consumption and green growth in the long run. However, internet penetration enhances renewable energy consumption and green growth in the long run. Our findings suggest imperative policy implications for the green economy."
Zinc-doped and biochar support strategies to enhance the catalytic activity of CuFe2O4 to persulfate for crystal violet degradation,"Sulfate radicals-based Fenton-like technology has placed more emphasis on effectively dealing with the threat of dye wastewater. In this work, the Zn-doped CuFe2O4@biochar composite (Cu0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4@BC) was prepared through the convenient sol–gel pyrolysis process and applied as heterogeneous persulfate (PS) activator for crystal violet (CV) degradation. The crystal morphology and physicochemical properties of Cu0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4@BC were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method (BET), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The morphology of the catalyst changed before and after Zn doping. The crystallite size, lattice constant, saturation magnetization, and oxygen vacancy content increased after doping Zn. Compared with CuFe2O4@BC, the CV degradation efficiency of Cu0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4@BC activating PS increased from 87.7 to 96.9%, and the corresponding reaction rate constant increased by about 3.69 times. The effect of experimental conditions was systematically studied on the degradation progress. The degradation efficiency of CV was 91% after five times cycle experiments. Multiple experiments indicated that SO4•–, •OH and O2•– predominated for CV degradation. The degradation mechanism of CV in the Cu0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4@BC/PS system involved both free radical (SO4•–, •OH and O2•–) and non-free radical pathways (electron transfer). The possible degradation pathways were investigated according to the ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) analysis of degradation intermediates. The result showed that Cu0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4@BC have an excellent catalyst performance, which provides a new strategy for improving catalytic activity."
Isotretinoin treatment upregulates the expression of p53 in the skin and sebaceous glands of patients with acne vulgaris,"The transcriptomic regulation induced by isotretinoin (13-cis retinoic acid) is still a matter of debate as short-term exposures of immortalized sebocytes with isotretinoin produced conflicting results. Based on translational evidence, it has been hypothesized that oral isotretinoin treatment upregulates the expression of the transcription factor p53. Twenty-five patients suffering from acne vulgaris were treated with isotretinoin (0.6 mg/kg body weight) for 6 weeks. Biopsies from back skin were taken before and after isotretinoin treatment for the determination of p53 expression by immunohistochemical staining, quantification of p53 protein concentration by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and TP53 gene expression by quantitative reverse transcription real time PCR. Fifteen socio-demographically cross-matched healthy volunteers served as controls. Isotretinoin treatment significantly increased the nuclear expression of p53 in sebaceous glands of treated patients compared to pre-treatment levels and p53 levels of untreated controls. Furthermore, the p53 protein and gene expression significantly increased in the skin after treatment. The magnitude of p53 expression showed an inverse correlation to acne severity score and body mass index. Under clinical conditions, isotretinoin induced the expression of p53, which controls multiple transcription factors involved in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris including FoxO1, androgen receptor and critical genes involved in the induction of autophagy and apoptosis. Increased p53-FoxO1 signalling enhanced by systemic isotretinoin treatment explains the underlying transcriptomic changes causing sebum suppression but also the adverse effects associated with systemic isotretinoin therapy."
Natural sunlight driven photocatalytic dye degradation by biogenically synthesized tin oxide (SnO2) nanostructures using Tinospora crispa stem extract and its anticancer and antibacterial applications,"In the present study, tin oxide (SnO2) was synthesized by advocating the principles of green chemistry for the photo-mediated degradation of pollutants, antimicrobial, and as an antitumor agent. Bioactive SnO2 (nanorods & nanospheres) were fabricated using Tinospora crispa stem extract (TCSE) via sol–gel technique and characterized extensively. XRD, UV–VIS, FTIR, and XPS studies confirmed the formation of crystalline and well stoichiometric pure phase of SnO2 nanostructures with optical bandgap 3.2 to 3.5 eV. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results demonstrated the effect of secondary phytoconstituents on the shape of SnO2 in a concentration dependent manner. The morphological variations in the obtained nanostructures attributed to the nucleation density and coalescence effect leading to the formation of nanorods with an average diameter 23–25 nm whereas the average particle size of the nanospheres obtained was found to be 23–30 nm. The zeta potential value of SnO2 nanorods was high (− 58.9 mV) indicating the higher stability compared to nanospheres (− 15.6 mV). The SnO2 nanostructures were investigated for the simultaneous degradation of methylene blue with degradation efficiency of 92.3% and 47.3% for rhodamine B in mono system and 72.3%, 47.7% respectively for binary dye system. The anticancer activity of SnO2 nanorods explored against human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells revealed a concentration dependent cytotoxic effect reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced cell death. Additionally, efficient antibacterial activity of SnO2 was established using E.coli."
Can digital finance reduce carbon emission intensity? A perspective based on factor allocation distortions: evidence from Chinese cities,"The world is facing the challenges of climate change and energy structure adjustments. The role of digital finance, a new branch of business that combines digital technology and traditional financial products, in reducing global carbon emissions needs to be studied. This paper uses panel data on 280 cities in China from 2011 to 2019 to empirically examine the efficacy of digital finance for governing carbon emission reductions and the mechanism by which it does so. The results show that (1) digital finance can facilitate carbon emission reductions and help reduce carbon emission intensity within regions; (2) digital finance helps promote the rational allocation of resources and alleviates factor distortions by encouraging firms to rationally use their own factor endowments so as to reduce carbon emission intensity, which holds robustly after considering the endogenous issues such as possibly omitting variables and collinearity; and (3) differences in geographical location, the vitality of regional innovation and entrepreneurship, regional willingness to protect the environment, and environmental protection levels lead to heterogeneity in the effect of digital finance on carbon emission intensity. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously develop digital finance as a long-term tool for carbon governance."
Torsional and axial vibration of restrained saturated nanorods via strain gradient elasticity,"Size-dependent torsional and longitudinal free vibrations of restrained saturated porous nanorods are studied by a higher-order elasticity theory. The strain gradient elasticity model is used in this study able to overcome inconsistencies of classical elasticity model. The presented higher-order model leads to well-posed boundary value problem for arbitrary value of the small size parameter. Two elastic springs in torsional and axial directions are attached to saturated porous nanorods at two boundary points. Angular rotation and axial deflection functions based on the strain gradient elasticity model are represented by two Fourier sine series. The difference of this proposed solution is that it does not impose a limitation on the support conditions and allows the frequencies to be obtained with a single solution. Two coefficient matrices including torsional or axial effects are obtained by using Stokes’ transformation and non-classical boundary conditions. Free vibration frequencies of saturated nanorods are calculated by an effective eigen-value solution strategy. It is shown clearly that elastic spring coefficients, small-scale parameter and saturation a notable impact on the dynamic response of nanorods."
Enterococcus exceedances related to environmental variability at New Jersey ocean beaches,"Microbial pollution at ocean beaches is a global public health problem that can be exacerbated by excessive rainfall, particularly at beaches adjacent to urban areas. Rain is acknowledged as a predictive factor of Enterococcus levels at NJ beaches, but to date no study has explicitly examined the link. Here, five beaches (156 observations) in Monmouth County, NJ, with storm drain outflows present were sampled for Enterococcus and water quality during dry and wet periods. Hypotheses included (1) beaches differ in Enterococcus levels, (2) Enterococcus is present year-round, and (3) Enterococcus exceedances could be modeled based on environmental parameters. Beaches showed significantly different median Enterococcus levels, with site SEA2 (Neptune Blvd. in Deal, NJ) lower than others and site SEA4 (South Bath Ave. in Long Branch, NJ) higher than the other sites. Elevated Enterococcus levels were detected at water temperatures from 6.5 to 22.2 °C. Multiple linear regression models identified rainfall (+), water temperature (+), and water level (−) as related to Enterococcus concentrations levels at these beaches. For the purpose of simulating the efficacy of different monitoring strategies, a hindcast model of Enterococcus abundance based on historic rainfall, water temperature, and water level data was produced. Results indicated that once-per-week sampling detected ~14% (e.g., 1/7) exceedance events, while sampling during summer alone detected ~ 50% of annual exceedance events. Models of Enterococcus exceedance based on readily available environmental time series have the potential to supplement and improve Enterococcus monitoring at NJ beaches."
"Soil aggregation and associated organic matter under management systems in sandy-textured soils, subtropical region of Brazil","Increasing the diversity of plant species in agricultural production areas favors the maintenance or improvement of soil quality, particularly for soils with a sandy texture. This beneficial effect is related to the formation of aggregates of different origins. This study aimed to (i) verify whether soil use and management affect the proportion of biogenic (Bio) and physicogenic (Phy) aggregates and (ii) verify whether biogenic aggregation is more likely to lead to soil improvement than physicogenic aggregation. Three management systems were evaluated (permanent pasture, PP; no-tillage system, NT; and no-tillage + Brachiaria system, NT + B) as well as a reference area (Atlantic Forest biome vegetation, NF). According to their origin or formation pathway, the aggregates were separated, identified, and classified as Bio (formed by biological processes) and Phy (resulting from chemical and physical actions). The differentiation between Bio and Phy aggregates was performed based on the visualization of morphological features, such as shape, size, presence of roots, porosity, and subunit arrangements, and junctions. Only the PP area was able to promote greater aggregate formation of biological origin, with greater amounts of Bio aggregates. The highest total organic carbon (TOC) contents and the least negative δ13C values were also quantified in the aggregates of the PP area. The NT + B system provided an increase in the TOC content of its aggregates in comparison with aggregates in the NT and NF areas. Among the formation pathways, the Bio aggregates had the highest TOC and soil organic matter fractions contents and the most negative δ13C values. Perennial forage grasses vegetation was more important than the plant species diversity in favoring Bio aggregate formation. The beneficial effect of Brachiaria can be observed when incorporated as part of intercropping with corn in grain production systems. The biogenic aggregates favored the concentration of more labile soil organic matter fractions. The results of this study can provide important theoretical information for future studies focused on the combination of different plant species in agricultural food production areas on sandy-textured soils."

Coordinate-based fast lightweight path search algorithm for electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy,"Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) uses electromagnetic positioning technology to guide the bronchoscope to accurately and quickly reach the lesion along the planned path. However, enormous data in high-resolution lung computed tomography (CT) and the complex structure of multilevel branching bronchial tree make fast path search challenging for path planning. We propose a coordinate-based fast lightweight path search (CPS) algorithm for ENB. First, the centerline is extracted from the bronchial tree by applying topological thinning. Then, Euclidean-distance-based coordinate search is applied. The centerline points are represented by their coordinates, and adjacent points along the navigation path are selected considering the shortest Euclidean distance to the target on the centerline nearest the lesion. From the top of the trachea centerline, search is repeated until reaching the target. In 50 high-resolution lung CT images acquired from five scanners, the CPS algorithm achieves accuracy, average search time, and average memory consumption of 100%, 88.5 ms, and 166.0 MB, respectively, reducing search time by 74.3% and 73.1% and memory consumption by 83.3% and 83.0% compared with Dijkstra and A* algorithms, respectively. CPS algorithm is suitable for path search in multilevel branching bronchial tree navigation based on high-resolution lung CT images."
Integrated Slope Monitoring System for Slope Stability Over Old Underground Galleries During Surface Mining Operations Using Internet of Things,"Surface mining methods have been adopted to extract the coal which is in the form of pillars and roof in old underground coal workings. There are slope failures associated with the extraction method. Conventional slope monitoring systems are available but require physical presence of the person at the site and the readout units which are physically connected to the base units and generally such monitoring is done only during day light. Radar-based systems are being used to monitor the broad area through rain, dust, smoke and operate during both day and night. They provide accurate results, but they are high-cost and require a skilled person for operating in the field. Hence, an investigation taken up to assess the stability of the slope stability over old underground coal workings by using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and internet of things (IoT). In this paper, monitoring of slope stability using a low cost wireless sensor networks is discussed. An integrated wireless data acquisition system is developed to assess the slope stability and it is validated with conventional instrument and numerical modeling approach. The variation in between integrated slope monitoring system (ISMS) to data logger and numerical modeling is around 3.03%–19%. Statistical analysis results revealed that there is a good correlation between field observations and modeling studies."
Multi-objective optimization of surface texture for the slipper/swash plate interface in EHA pumps,"Well-designed surface textures can improve the tribological properties and the efficiency of the electrohydrostatic actuator (EHA) pump under high-speed and high-pressure conditions. This study proposes a multi-objective optimization model to obtain the arbitrarily surface textures design of the slipper/swash plate interface for improving the mechanical and volumetric efficiency of the EHA pump. The model is composed of the lubrication film model, the component dynamic model considering the spinning motion, and the multi-objective optimization model. In this way, the arbitrary-shaped surface texture with the best comprehensive effect in the EHA pump is achieved and its positive effects in the EHA pump prototype are verified. Experimental results show a reduction in wear and an improvement in mechanical and volumetric efficiency by 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively, with the textured swash plate compared with the untextured one."
"Genome sequence analysis and characterization of Bacillus altitudinis B12, a polylactic acid- and keratin-degrading bacterium","Keratin-rich wastes, mainly in the form of feathers, are recalcitrant residues generated in high amounts as by-products in chicken farms and food industry. Polylactic acid (PLA) is the second most common biodegradable polymer found in commercial plastics, which is not easily degraded by microbial activity. This work reports the 3.8-Mb genome of Bacillus altitudinis B12, a highly efficient PLA- and keratin-degrading bacterium, with potential for environmental friendly biotechnological applications in the feed, fertilizer, detergent, leather, and pharmaceutical industries. The whole genome sequence of B. altitudinis B12 revealed that this strain (which had been previously misclassified as Bacillus pumilus B12) is closely related to the B. altitudinis strains ER5, W3, and GR-8. A total of 4056 coding sequences were annotated using the RAST server, of which 2484 are core genes of the pan genome of B. altitudinis and 171 are unique to this strain. According to the sequence analysis, B. pumilus B12 has a predicted secretome of 353 proteins, among which a keratinase and a PLA depolymerase were identified by sequence analysis. The presence of these two enzymes could explain the characterized PLA and keratin biodegradation capability of the strain."
"Stressful Events, Psychological Distress and Well-Being during the Second Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic in Spain: A Gender Analysis","The present study investigates gender differences in stressful events, psychological distress and well-being during the second wave of COVID-19 in Spain, analyzing women’s and men’s risk and resilience factors for psychological distress and for well-being. Participants were 1758 individuals from the general population, 50.8% women, aged between 18 and 79 years. Women and men did not differ in age, number of children, educational level, occupation or marital status. The participants were assessed by seven self-report questionnaires and scales. The results revealed that women experienced more psychological distress, more negative feelings, more stressful events related to the COVID-19 pandemic, more social support, and lower thriving and self-esteem than men. Multiple regression analyses showed that, in the case of women and men as well, self-esteem was the most important predictor of higher well-being and lower psychological distress and negative feelings while more COVID-19 pandemic-related stressful events were associated with higher psychological distress and lower well-being. Another important predictor of greater well-being for either gender was social support while unemployment was associated with lower well-being. In women and men, a higher educational level was associated with greater psychological distress and negative feelings; the male sample revealed that psychological distress was also connected to younger age while in women it was associated with lower instrumental social support. The results suggest that gender plays an important role in the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the risk being higher for women than for men."
Why Quasi-Realism cannot Accommodate Moral Mind-Independence,"Quasi-realists have proposed an “internal” reading of the mind-independence claim embedded in our moral discourse, according to which the claim to mind-independence itself is a moral claim. I argue against such a quasi-realist “internal” reading. My objection is that quasi-realists cannot plausibly explain why the majority of us, either implicitly or explicitly, take moral mind-independence to be a metaethical notion. Quasi-realists either must attribute a quite obvious mistake to most metaethical theorists without explaining why they cannot recognize it, or give us an intolerably ad hoc explanation about why ordinary moral speakers fail to understand their own words. Without properly addressing this problem, we have good reason to reject the quasi-realist account of moral mind-independence."

Causal relationships between potential risk factors and chronic rhinosinusitis: a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study,"Smoking, alcohol consumption, allergic rhinitis (AR), asthma, and obesity are associated with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), albeit the causal relationships between them remain elusive.

Diel patterns of depth use and swimming activity of post-release greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili) in the northern Gulf of Mexico,"Greater amberjack are active swimmers that occur over a range of depths around reefs and artificial structures. In this study, we describe overall diel patterns of depth use and swimming activity for greater amberjack. We tested for impacts of fishing-related stress on diel patterns, and we describe the potential influence of cyclonic storms on diel behavior and site attachment. Fifty-five fish were tagged with depth and accelerometer tags off coastal Alabama, USA, in three field efforts (FEs): FE1, summer–fall 2018; FE2, spring 2019; and FE3, summer–fall 2020. Fish displayed diel depth patterns that varied among individuals: fish that occupied a narrow depth range midway within the water column, fish that spent time both at mid-water and near bottom, and fish with more generalized patterns. Diel depth use was best predicted by both site depth and field effort, while swimming patterns were best predicted by field effort among tested factors: legal or sublegal sizes, field effort, site, and use of a descender device vs. surface release. Swimming activity was elevated on post-release days 1–5, consistent with predicted impacts of fishing stress. For most fish, however, depth use did not vary appreciably following release. Release with a descender did not prevent altered diel patterns, and thus, barotrauma was not likely a factor. Fish occupied shallower depths when Hurricane Laura (2020) passed south of the study area, and swimming activity was elevated during Hurricane Sally (2020). Our study highlights that depth use and swimming activity of greater amberjack are influenced by multiple factors and recreational fishing discards may impart sublethal stress that results in elevated swimming activity."
Nonnegative spatial factorization applied to spatial genomics,"Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used to analyze high-dimensional count data because, in contrast to real-valued alternatives such as factor analysis, it produces an interpretable parts-based representation. However, in applications such as spatial transcriptomics, NMF fails to incorporate known structure between observations. Here, we present nonnegative spatial factorization (NSF), a spatially-aware probabilistic dimension reduction model based on transformed Gaussian processes that naturally encourages sparsity and scales to tens of thousands of observations. NSF recovers ground truth factors more accurately than real-valued alternatives such as MEFISTO in simulations, and has lower out-of-sample prediction error than probabilistic NMF on three spatial transcriptomics datasets from mouse brain and liver. Since not all patterns of gene expression have spatial correlations, we also propose a hybrid extension of NSF that combines spatial and nonspatial components, enabling quantification of spatial importance for both observations and features. A TensorFlow implementation of NSF is available from https://github.com/willtownes/nsf-paper."
Are you planning to be a radiation oncologist?

Expansion of human amniotic epithelial cells using condition cell reprogramming technology,"Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) are non-immunogenic epithelial cells that can develop into cells of all three germline lineages. However, a refined clinically reliable method is required to optimize the preparation and banking procedures of hAECs for their successful translation into clinical studies. With the goal of establishing standardized clinically applicable hAECs cultured cells, we described the use of a powerful epithelial cell culture technique, termed Conditionally Reprogrammed Cells (CRC) for ex vivo expansion of hAECs. The well-established CRC culture method uses a Rho kinase inhibitor (Y-27632) and J2 mouse fibroblast feeder cells to drive the indefinite proliferation of all known epithelial cell types. In this study, we used an optimized CRC protocol to successfully culture hAECs in a CRC medium supplemented with xenogen-free human serum. We established that hAECs thrive under the CRC conditions for over 5 passages while still expressing pluripotent stem markers (OCT-4, SOX-2 and NANOG) and non-immunogenic markers (CD80, CD86 and HLA-G) suggesting that even late-passage hAECs retain their privileged phenotype. The hAECs-CRC cells were infected with a puromycin-selectable lentivirus expressing luciferase and GFP (green fluorescent protein) and stably selected with puromycin. The hAECs expressing GFP were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of Athymic and C57BL6 mice to check the tolerability and stability of cells against the immune system. Chemiluminescence imaging confirmed the presence and viability of cells at days 2, 5, and 42 without acute inflammation or any tumor formation. Collectively, these data indicate that the CRC approach offers a novel solution to expanding hAECs in humanized conditions for future clinical uses, while retaining their primary phenotype."
A case of paraovarian tumor of borderline malignancy with decrease of apparent diffusion coefficient value and marked 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation,"Para-ovarian cysts are occasionally encountered in clinical practice; however, malignant tumors derived from them are rare. Due to its rarity, the characteristic imaging findings of para-ovarian tumors with borderline malignancy (PTBM) are largely unknown. Herein, we report a case of PTBM, along with imaging findings. A 37-year-old woman came to our department with a suspected malignant adnexal tumor. Pelvic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a solid part within the cystic tumor with a decrease in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value (1.16 × 10–3 mm2/s). We also performed Positron Emission Tomography–MRI and showed a strong accumulation of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the solid part (SUVmax = 14.8). In addition, the tumor appeared to develop independently of the ovary. Because tumor was derived from para-ovarian cyst, we suspected PTBM preoperatively and planned fertility sparing treatment. Pathological examination revealed a serous borderline tumor and PTBM was confirmed. PTBM can have unique imaging characteristics, including a low ADC value and high FDG accumulation. When a tumor appears to develop from para-ovarian cysts, borderline malignancy can be suspected, even if imaging findings suggest malignant potential."
Real-World Findings on the Characteristics and Treatment Exposures of Patients with Hidradenitis Suppurativa from US Claims Data,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, debilitating, and painful inflammatory skin disease that significantly and negatively impacts patients’ quality of life. The prevalence of HS in the USA is estimated to be 0.10%, with worldwide reports suggesting a prevalence closer to 1%. There is limited real-world evidence available on the care of patients with HS. We aimed to evaluate the trends in clinical care and treatment in the patient population with HS in the USA in a real-world setting."
Novel Ni2+/Cu2+ doped Bi2WO6 nanosheets with enhanced photocatalytic performance under visible light,"A series of Ni2+/Cu2+ doped Bi2WO6 nanosheets were successfully fabricated through a simple one-step solvothermal process without any surfactants. Various characterization methods were used to analyze the as-synthesized catalysts. The photocatalytic activity of all catalysts was studied through degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) dyes under visible light illumination. The photocatalytic performance of Bi2WO6 is significantly improved by doping Ni2+ and Cu2+, and the BIW-12 (Ni2+/Cu2+/Bi2WO6 molar ratios is 1:2:100) sample shows the highest photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the photo-electro-chemistry measurements were carried out to know that BIW-12 exhibits a low charge-transfer resistance and a significant photocurrent density and to further elucidate the band structure for samples prepared. Also, based on the radical species trapping experiments and Mott-Schottky plots, a possible photogenerated carrier transfer mechanism is proposed."
Evaluation and Decomposition of Factors Responsible for Alteration in Streamflow in Lower Watersheds of the Han River Basin Using Different Budyko-Based Functions,"Streamflow is documented as a key element of the hydrological cycle, and alterations in streamflow may result in hydrological disaster. The accurate quantification of streamflow under various climatological and anthropogenic factors, as well as decomposing their respective effects, remains challenging. In this study, we quantified and split the effects of climate variation and human action on streamflow changes in lower watersheds of the Han River. We utilized distinct methodologies and compared their outcomes. The methodologies include Budyko-based curve decomposition, the Budyko-based hydrological elasticity method, the conceptual eco-hydrological method, and the hydrological sensitivity analysis method. Subsequently, the hydrological change point was inspected in 1997. During the baseline period (1966–1997), variations in climate led to changes in the streamflow. In contrast, in the post-baseline period (1998–2013), the variation in the streamflow was attributed to the combined effects of climate variation and human action. Climate variation was observed to be a prominent accountable feature in streamflow alterations. The results obtained from different methodologies appeared to align with each other, showing that 70% to 91% (average 80%) of the alteration in the streamflow occurred in response to variations in climate-related parameters. The contribution from human action was less, accounting for 9% to 30% (average 20%) of the change. Moreover, the relative proportion of effects was perceived to be sensitive to the methods applied and the type of Budyko-based function. Further, the relative impacts of both factors can enhance the uncertainty in the management of water resources. Thus, this information is essential for the execution of water management on the spatial and temporal scales to reduce the risk of hydrological disasters in the watershed."
A Strength Criterion for Deep Rock with Stochastic Fractures via DEM Simulations,"Criteria for rock strength mostly focus on macromechanical parameters, which cannot directly explain the relationship between microscopic fracture characteristics and strength. This paper analyses the strength characteristics of deep jointed rock with stochastic fractures by the distinct element method (DEM) and proposes a new strength criterion. First, an improved bond contact model and the smooth-joint contact model are implemented within the framework of DEM to simulate the characteristics of deep rock. Then, triaxial compression tests on Berea sandstone are also numerically simulated under various confining pressures and fracture intensities (P32). Finally, a strength criterion is proposed and validated based on the numerical and experimental results. The criterion can capture the nonlinear relationship between the major principal stress and the confining pressure and reveal the microscopic fracture characteristics of deep rock. However, the criterion does not consider the influence of the intermediate principal stress. The average deviation between all the predicted strengths and the experimental results is 5.12%, which demonstrates that the criterion has good applicability."
Study on micro-grinding mechanism and surface and subsurface quality of 20 vol% SiCp/Al composites,"A finite element model of single abrasive grinding was established to analyze the material removal during the grinding process and analyze the surface and subsurface defects of the material after grinding. Using the orthogonal test method to machine the surface of the workpiece with a grinding rod of 2 mm grinding head diameter, and to investigate the influence degree of the machining parameters on the roughness. It was concluded that the grinding depth has the most significant effect on surface roughness, followed by the spindle speed and the feed speed, and the minimum roughness of the ground surface obtained was 0.066 µm. The rough surface was simulated by the digital filtering method based on fast Fourier transform (FFT), and the morphological characteristics of the rough surface at Ra = 0.116 µm were described, and the simulated surface was consistent with the detected surface. The laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used for inspection, and the analysis showed that the main removal forms of the enhanced particles were broken, fractured, and pulled out. The surface defects were cracks, pits, and burrs, and the subsurface damages were voids, cracks, and pits."
Energy and exergy analyses of the Kalina system integrated with a two-phase turbine,"The Kalina power cycle can be integrated with a two-phase turbine as a substitute for the expansion valve to yield useful mechanical energy. An energy- and exergy-based mathematical model was formulated to analyze and evaluate the performance of the proposed cycle in this study. Independent parameters, including the base ammonia-water solution concentration, separator pressure, temperature difference in the recuperator, and vapor turbine outlet pressure, were used to analyze the sensitivity of efficiencies. The results show that the proposed cycle is efficient in terms of energy and exergy efficiencies. The two-phase turbine power is much larger than the solution pump power, and the exergy destruction of the turbine is much smaller than that of a throttle valve. The effect of the base solution concentration was dominant. At low concentrations, the energy and exergy efficiency improvements were 140 % and 160 %, respectively. At high concentrations, the substitution was not significant because the solution flow rate through the two-phase turbine was negligible. Furthermore, the efficiency enhancement was notable at a high vapor turbine outlet pressure."

Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles from peel extract of Chrysophyllum albidum fruit and their antimicrobial synergistic potentials and biofilm inhibition properties,"Current methods for green synthesis of metal nanoparticles often require continuous harvesting of fresh bio-materials for every synthesis cycle. Practices and procedures that economize bio-materials need to be employed if green synthesis could become a sustainable and eco-friendly method for synthesizing metal nanoparticles. This study explores Chrysophyllum albidum peels (mostly regarded as waste) to prepare silver nanoparticles (Alb-AgNPs). The technique employed in the synthesis allows repeated use of the peels, thus, reducing the heavy dependence on bio-materials. The optical and structural properties of the Alb-AgNPs were studied with Scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, UV-Vis spectrophotometer and powder X-ray diffractometer. The antimicrobial properties of the Alb-AgNPs were studied with selected microorganisms namely; S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, B. subtilis, S. mutans, P. aeruginosa, S. typhi, and Candida albicans. High inhibitory activity against the microorganisms were exhibited with MICs ranging from 15.62 to 1000 µg/mL. Again, the Alb-AgNPs showed the ability to enhance the efficacy of standard antimicrobial agents. The results of the combined interaction with standard antibacterial and antifungal agents ranged from synergistic to antagonistic effects against the tested microorganisms. In addition, the Alb-AgNPs could serve as a biofilm inhibitor with the highest percent inhibition of about 92% against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The results from this study thus provide access to the simple, sustainable, economic and eco-friendly synthesis of silver nanoparticles with efficient antimicrobial properties as drug candidates as a means of overcoming the prevailing antibiotic resistance menaces."
Impact of quorum sensing from native peanut phosphate solubilizing Serratia sp. S119 strain on interactions with agronomically important crops,"Bacteria communicate with each other using a language based on the use of autoinducer molecules (AI) to collectively control gene expression through the process known as quorum sensing (QS). The N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) are the most common AIs known in Gram-negative bacteria. Numerous genes encoding QS systems have been reported in plant beneficial endophytic bacterial genomes although there are fewer studies evaluating the participation of QS in the mechanisms of plant growth promotion. The aim of this study was to describe the genetic background and the types of AHLs produced by a phosphate-solubilizing bacterial strain isolated from the roots of peanut Serratia sp. S119, and to evaluate the participation of these AIs in promoting the growth of plants of agronomic importance."
Investigation of hydrodynamics along an embankment generated by a nearby riparian vegetation patch,"Typhoon Hagibis in 2019 caused overflow of embankments. The overflow breached the embankment of the Toki River in Saitama Prefecture, Japan, at a point where its height was relatively low. A field survey showed that grass or woody debris piled up in riparian bamboo vegetation patches growing near the breach location during the flooding. In view of this, a series of flume experiments and numerical simulations with a two-dimensional (2D) k−ɛ Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) turbulence model were carried out to understand the flow hydrodynamics along the open channel embankment with a vegetation model (VM) and a debris model (DM). Several configurations of the VM gap (i.e. the gap between VM and the flume wall: d) and VM angle (i.e. angle of VM to the flume wall: θ) were considered. The gap was normalized (dnd) with respect to the cross-stream width (w) of the VM (dnd = d/w). When considering the maximum water depth, velocity and bed shear along the side wall, it is recommended that the vegetation patches that satisfy dnd > 0.3 be maintained and that 60°, 90° and 120° patch orientations be avoided."
An Integrated Deep Learning Prediction Approach for Efficient Modelling of Host Load Patterns in Cloud Computing,"Recent surge in technology and integration of IoT into Cloud computing has resulted in increasingly heterogeneous workloads with unprecedented compute and storage demands. As Cloud workloads evolve, so also their computational demands, resulting in server loads interspersed by random peaks and troughs and by continuous and periodic demands. A predictive model that accounts for these diverse load patterns can generate more realistic future resource demands which is essential for efficient capacity planning and meeting service level objectives with minimal energy consumption. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), the prevalent approach for host load prediction suffers from information decay with long inputs, while hybrid methods using Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and LSTM fail to effectively model different host load patterns. To overcome above limitations, we propose a multistep CPU usage prediction approach named RCP-CL, to model random fluctuations and novel continuous and periodic patterns from contiguous and non-contiguous CPU load values augmented with daily and weekly time patterns, by integrating 1-Dimensional CNN (1D-CNN) and LSTM networks. RCP-CL uses parallel and stacked 1D-CNN layers with kernel size and dilation rates that are guided by the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analysis of CPU usage while LSTM derives temporal dependencies from the learnt spatial patterns. Experimental evaluations with Google Trace and Alibaba trace demonstrate impressive learning skills of RCP-CL over the state-of-the-art LSTM and 1D-CNN based host load prediction models, achieving up to 20% improvement in mean squared error for Google trace and up to 22% improvement for Alibaba trace."

Furthermore, the photo-electro-chemistry measurements were carried out to know that BIW-12 exhibits a low charge-transfer resistance and a significant photocurrent density and to further elucidate the band structure for samples prepared. Also, based on the radical species trapping experiments and Mott-Schottky plots, a possible photogenerated carrier transfer mechanism is proposed."
Optimal collective investment: an analysis of individual welfare,"We analyze optimal asset allocation in continuous time for a collective of tied-together investors. We rely on a specific collective utility function which dates back to Karatzas et al. (Math Oper Res 15(1):80–128, 1990), by which the fund manager maximizes the weighted average of expected individual utilities for the investors in the collective. This problem allows for a closed form solution. The payoffs allocated to the investors correspond to the individually optimal ones which can be reached with a modified initial wealth that results from redistribution. The redistribution of wealth follows from the weights of the individual investors in the collective utility function, the condition of financial fairness, the condition of maximal average utility gains, or some other condition on net certainty equivalent returns. We illustrate the resulting solutions both for a Black–Scholes economy and a model with stochastic interest rates."
A case of paraovarian tumor of borderline malignancy with decrease of apparent diffusion coefficient value and marked 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation,"Para-ovarian cysts are occasionally encountered in clinical practice; however, malignant tumors derived from them are rare. Due to its rarity, the characteristic imaging findings of para-ovarian tumors with borderline malignancy (PTBM) are largely unknown. Herein, we report a case of PTBM, along with imaging findings. A 37-year-old woman came to our department with a suspected malignant adnexal tumor. Pelvic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a solid part within the cystic tumor with a decrease in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value (1.16 × 10–3 mm2/s). We also performed Positron Emission Tomography–MRI and showed a strong accumulation of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the solid part (SUVmax = 14.8). In addition, the tumor appeared to develop independently of the ovary. Because tumor was derived from para-ovarian cyst, we suspected PTBM preoperatively and planned fertility sparing treatment. Pathological examination revealed a serous borderline tumor and PTBM was confirmed. PTBM can have unique imaging characteristics, including a low ADC value and high FDG accumulation. When a tumor appears to develop from para-ovarian cysts, borderline malignancy can be suspected, even if imaging findings suggest malignant potential."
Integrated Slope Monitoring System for Slope Stability Over Old Underground Galleries During Surface Mining Operations Using Internet of Things,"Surface mining methods have been adopted to extract the coal which is in the form of pillars and roof in old underground coal workings. There are slope failures associated with the extraction method. Conventional slope monitoring systems are available but require physical presence of the person at the site and the readout units which are physically connected to the base units and generally such monitoring is done only during day light. Radar-based systems are being used to monitor the broad area through rain, dust, smoke and operate during both day and night. They provide accurate results, but they are high-cost and require a skilled person for operating in the field. Hence, an investigation taken up to assess the stability of the slope stability over old underground coal workings by using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and internet of things (IoT). In this paper, monitoring of slope stability using a low cost wireless sensor networks is discussed. An integrated wireless data acquisition system is developed to assess the slope stability and it is validated with conventional instrument and numerical modeling approach. The variation in between integrated slope monitoring system (ISMS) to data logger and numerical modeling is around 3.03%–19%. Statistical analysis results revealed that there is a good correlation between field observations and modeling studies."
Neutral coated spheres in nonlinear thermoelectricity,"We construct neutral coated spherical inhomogeneities in a nonlinearly coupled thermoelectric material. The coated spherical inhomogeneity, when inserted into a thermoelectric matrix, does not disturb the prescribed thermoelectric field of uniform electric current density and uniform energy flux along arbitrary directions in the surrounding matrix. Exact expressions for the effective electric and thermal conductivities of two-phase sphere assemblages completely replacing the original thermoelectric matrix are obtained. The most restrictive Hashin–Shtrikman bounds are derived for the effective electric and thermal conductivities of macroscopically homogeneous and isotropic two-phase thermoelectric materials."
Fracture mechanics of an arbitrary position crack emanating from a nano-hole in one-dimensional hexagonal piezoelectric quasicrystals,"The mode III fracture behavior of an arbitrary position crack emanating from a nano-hole in one-dimensional hexagonal piezoelectric quasicrystals is studied. Based on the Gurtin–Murdoch surface theory and the boundary value problems theory, the expressions of the electro-elastic fields and the generalized field intensity factor at the crack tip are obtained. The presented solution can degenerate into existing results. The influences of the hole size, crack location, crack–hole interaction, applied electro-elastic loads and quasicrystal coupling coefficient on the generalized field intensity factor are discussed. The generalized field intensity factor has significant size effects when the surface effect is considered. The influence of the surface effect on the generalized field intensity factor depends on the crack location. The larger the relative size of the crack is, the greater the surface effect is. The effects of applied electro-elastic loads and quasicrystal coupling coefficient on each generalized field intensity factor are quite different."
Frequency shifts in a laterally finite piezoelectric resonator loaded with a viscous liquid layer of finite size,"The free shear vibration in a laterally finite piezoelectric plate loaded with a viscous liquid layer of finite size is investigated in this paper. Considering the lateral edge effect and segmented boundary condition at the solid–liquid interface, a new theoretical solution is obtained using the Fourier series, from which the resonant frequencies and mode shapes are calculated and examined. The convergence of the solution is verified, and the correctness is proved by the finite element method. The results reveal that the vibration in the central part of the sensor decays into lateral boundaries and the liquid layer when contacting with liquid, resulting in a decrease in frequency and an increase in attenuation. Moreover, the effects of liquid thickness, length, viscosity and density on resonant frequency are quantified, which are expected to provide useful data and guidelines for liquid sensor design and development."
Laser interstitial thermal therapy using the Leksell Stereotactic System and a diagnostic MRI suite: how I do it,"Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a stereotactic neurosurgical procedure used to treat neoplastic and epileptogenic lesions in the brain. A variety of advanced technological instruments such as frameless navigation systems, robotics, and intraoperative MRI are often described in this context, although the surgical procedure can also be performed using a standard stereotactic setup and a diagnostic MRI suite."
Microsurgical DREZotomy for pain related to Pancoast-Tobias syndrome: how I do it?,Neuralgic pain related to Pancoast-Tobias syndrome can be difficult to treat. An invasive but effective option for management is open cervical DREZotomy.
Biochemical Property Based Positional Matrix: A New Approach Towards Genome Sequence Comparison,"The growth of the genome sequence has become one of the emerging areas in the study of bioinformatics. It has led to an excessive demand for researchers to develop advanced methodologies for evolutionary relationships among species. The alignment-free methods have been proved to be more efficient and appropriate related to time and space than existing alignment-based methods for sequence analysis. In this study, a new alignment-free genome sequence comparison technique is proposed based on the biochemical properties of nucleotides. Each genome sequence can be distributed in four parameters to represent a 21-dimensional numerical descriptor using the Positional Matrix. To substantiate the proposed method, phylogenetic trees are constructed on the viral and mammalian datasets by applying the UPGMA/NJ clustering method. Further, the results of this method are compared with the results of the Feature Frequency Profiles method, the Positional Correlation Natural Vector method, the Graph-theoretic method, the Multiple Encoding Vector method, and the Fuzzy Integral Similarity method. In most cases, it is found that the present method produces more accurate results than the prior methods. Also, in the present method, the execution time for computation is comparatively small."
"Redox Status, Immune Alterations, Histopathology, and Micronuclei Induction in Labeo rohita Dwelling in Polluted River Water","In this study, we measured various parameters of oxidative stress, immune response, and abnormalities in the erythrocyte nucleus of Labeo rohita inhabiting the polluted Kshipra River, India. The river water contains heavy metals in this order: Ni > Fe > Cd > Cr > Mn > Zn > Cu. Fe showed the highest accumulation in gills, liver, and gut, whereas Ni (gills and gut) and Cd (liver) were lowest accumulated. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were found to be increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the gills (SOD: 211%; CAT: 150%), liver (SOD: 447%; CAT: 304%), and gut (SOD: 98.11%; CAT: 58.69%) in comparison with the reference fish. However, glutathione S transferase (GST) showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher activity in the gills (25.5%) but lower activity in the liver (− 49.22%) and the gut (− 30.57%). Moreover, reduced glutathione (GSH) decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in the gills (− 46.66%), liver (− 33.20%), and gut (− 39.87%). Despite the active response of the antioxidant enzymes, the highest lipid peroxidation was observed in the liver (463%). The effect of heavy metals was also observed on the immunity of the fish, causing immunosuppression as evident by significantly (p < 0.05) lower values of acid phosphatase (− 50%), myeloperoxidase (− 48.33%), and nitric oxide synthase (− 50%) in serum. Histopathological findings showed gill lamellae shortening, hyperplasia, club-shaped lamellar tip in exposed gills and necrosis, vacuolization, and pyknosis in the exposed liver. Furthermore, polluted river water was also found to induce micronuclei (2.1%) and lobed nuclei (0.72%) in erythrocytes (0.65%). These results indicate the potential of heavy metal-induced oxidative stress and other forms of stress in inhabiting fish, highlighting the need to control the pollution of this river water."
Mediative Mechanism of Freezing/Thawing on Greenhouse Gas Emissions in an Inland Saline-Alkaline Wetland: a Metagenomic Analysis,"Inland saline-alkaline wetlands distributed in the mid-high latitude have repeatedly experienced freezing and thawing. However, the response of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and microbially-mediated carbon and nitrogen cycle to freezing and thawing remains unclear. We monitored the GHG flux in an inland saline-alkaline wetland and found that, compared with the growth period, the average CO2 flux decreased from 171.99 to 76.61–80.71 mg/(m2‧h), the average CH4 flux decreased from 10.72 to 1.96–3.94 mg/(m2‧h), and the average N2O flux decreased from 56.17 to − 27.14 to − 20.70 μg/(m2‧h). Freezing and thawing significantly decreased the relative abundance of functional genes involved in carbon and nitrogen cycles. The aceticlastic methanogenic pathway was the main methanogenic pathway, whereas the Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera was the most abundant methane oxidizer in the wetland. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea and denitrifier belonging to proteobacteria was the major microbial N2O source, while bacteria within clade II nosZ was the major microbial N2O sink. Freezing and thawing reduced the relative abundance of these genes, leading to a decrease in GHG flux."
A Numerical Calculation Algorithm of the Inclination Function Based on the Representation of SO(3) Group,"In the determination of the Earth gravity field in satellite geodesy, the inclination functions represent the projection of data observed along the orbital plane of a satellite orbit into the sphere in the terrestial reference frame. The inclination functions in this work is studied from a group theoretical perspective. The inclination functions are proved to generate a representation of the SO(3) group. An orthogonal relation of the inclination functions is derived and some recurrence relations for the inclination functions are given, based on which an algorithm to calculate the inclination functions is proposed."
Anti-Ramsey Numbers of Cycles of Length Three in Uniform Hypergraphs,"For an r-uniform hypergraph F, the anti-Ramsey number ar(n, r, F) is the minimum number c of colors such that an n-vertex r-uniform complete hypergraph equipped any edge-coloring with at least c colors unavoidably contains a rainbow copy of F. In this paper, we determine the anti-Ramsey number for cycles of length three in r-uniform hypergraphs for r ≥ 3, including linear cycles, loose cycles and Berge cycles."
"Reproductive ecology, age, and growth of the Kidako moray Gymnothorax kidako from Tateyama Bay, Chiba, Japan","An ecological study of the Kidako moray Gymnothorax kidako (Anguilliformes, Muraenidae) was conducted at Tateyama Bay, Chiba, Japan. Although this species is common along temperate coasts and is distributed as a food in local cities of southern Japan, its reproductive ecology, age structure, and growth rates are unknown. Specimens (in total, 93 males and 117 females) were collected monthly from January to December 2015, and in May 2022. There was no significant difference between the total length of males and females. Throughout the year, the male gonadosomatic index was relatively constant, and sperm was detected. The female gonadosomatic index was especially high and tertiary vitellogenic oocytes were observed in the ovary from July to August. A female with a swollen abdomen full of ovulated oocytes was collected in August. Results indicate that spawning in G. kidako at Tateyama occurs from July to August. Age was estimated from increment analysis of the right sagittal otolith, on which a single annulus forms between July and August. On the basis of otolith-increment counts, 58 males and 83 females were aged 3–34 years. The von Bertalanffy growth formula indicated that males and females grow rapidly over the first 10 years, after which growth slowed for both sexes, but males continued to grow at a greater rate than females."
Current methods of preventing infectious disease and managing febrile neutropenia in childhood cancer patients: a nationwide survey in Japan,"Preventing infection and managing febrile neutropenia (FN) is mandatory for children with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. However, the current situation in Japan is unknown."
"Tumoral CD105 promotes immunosuppression, metastasis, and angiogenesis in renal cell carcinoma","CD105 (endoglin) is a transmembrane protein that functions as a TGF-beta coreceptor and is highly expressed on endothelial cells. Unsurprisingly, preclinical and clinical evidence strongly suggests that CD105 is an important contributor to tumor angiogenesis and tumor progression. Emerging evidence suggests that CD105 is also expressed by tumor cells themselves in certain cancers such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In human RCC tumor cells, CD105 expression is associated with stem cell-like properties and contributes to the malignant phenotype in vitro and in xenograft models. However, as a regulator of TGF-beta signaling, there is a striking lack of evidence for the role of tumor-expressed CD105 in the anti-tumor immune response and the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we report that tumor cell-expressed CD105 potentiates both the in vitro and in vivo tumorigenic potential of RCC in a syngeneic murine RCC tumor model. Importantly, we find that tumor cell-expressed CD105 sculpts the tumor microenvironment by enhancing the recruitment of immunosuppressive cell types and inhibiting the polyfunctionality of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Finally, while CD105 expression by endothelial cells is a well-established contributor to tumor angiogenesis, we also find that tumor cell-expressed CD105 significantly contributes to tumor angiogenesis in RCC."
NLRP3 in tumor-associated macrophages predicts a poor prognosis and promotes tumor growth in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"The NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays cell- and tissue-specific roles in cancer, meaning that its activation in different tumors or cells may play different roles in tumor progression. We have previously described the tumor-promoting function of tumor-intrinsic NLRP3/IL-1β signaling in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but its role in immune cells remains unclear. In this study, we found that NLRP3 was highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in both mouse and human HNSCC, and the expression of NLRP3 was positively correlated with the density of TAMs according to immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry analyses. Importantly, the number of NLRP3high TAMs was related to worse overall survival in HNSCC patients. Knocking out NLRP3 inhibited M2-like macrophage differentiation in vitro. Moreover, the carcinogenic effect induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide was decreased in Nlrp3-deficient mice, which had smaller tumor sizes. Genetic depletion of NLRP3 reduced the expression of protumoral cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and CCL2, and suppressed the accumulation of TAMs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in mouse HNSCC. Thus, activation of NLRP3 in TAMs may contribute to tumor progression and have prognostic significance in HNSCC."
Tibial quantitative ultrasound compared to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in preterm infants,The gold standard for diagnosing metabolic bone disease in pediatrics is dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Bone quantitative ultrasound (QUS) has increasing applications. This study compared the relationship of DXA to QUS in preterm infants.
Predictors of poor outcomes after cholecystectomy in gallstone pancreatitis: NSQIP analysis of 30-day morbidity and mortality,Contemporary nationwide outcomes of gallstone pancreatitis (GSP) managed by cholecystectomy at the index hospitalization are limited. This study aims to define the rate of 30-day morbidity and mortality and identify associated perioperative risk factors in patients undergoing cholecystectomy for GSP.
An integrated approach to address the temporal variation of geochemistry in groundwater of an arid region,"Kuwait is characterized with an arid climate and scarce freshwater sources. Variation in groundwater quality with space and time leads to sustainable development of the region. Evaluating the chemical properties of groundwater is of prime importance to ensure the longevity of this important source of water. In this study, the geochemical data for the years 2004 and 2018 were examined for 6 wells in the freshwater zones of Northern Kuwait. The aim of this study is to examine the geochemical variations, if any that occurred on the only existing freshwater aquifer in Kuwait. The chemical properties examined in this study include total dissolved solids, chloride, nitrate, bicarbonate, calcium, electric conductivity, sulfate, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and pH. The variation of the electrical conductivity in this region indicates an improvement in three wells located in the northern to central region of the study area as values decreased from 1210 to 956 (μS/cm); however, the electrical conductivity has deteriorated in the remaining three wells located in the central to southern part of the study area as values increased from 791 to 1401 (μS/cm). The geochemical facies of the groundwater were determined, indicating a migration of the groundwater facies towards more chloride dominant field in 2018. The saturation states of carbonates like aragonite, calcite, dolomite, and magnesite and those of sulfates like gypsum and anhydrite were determined. The increase in calcium in most of the wells facilitated the saturation index of calcium sulfates relatively more than calcium carbonate minerals. The principal component analysis was conducted for the data of 2004 and 2018; it extracted two main components accounting for the variability of the data; the main components indicate geogenic influences and anthropogenic pollution such as agriculture. The study indicates that there is no major variation observed in groundwater chemistry during the 15 years, as the chemical changes which occurred are minimal and do not require immediate remediation measures. Hence, if the current groundwater extraction rate remained with no extensive land use development, it would sustain the water quality of the region."
Metal tolerance gene family in barley: an in silico comprehensive analysis,"Metal-tolerance proteins (MTPs) are divalent cation transporters that play critical roles in metal tolerance and ion homeostasis in plants. However, a comprehensive study of MTPs is still lacking in crop plants. The current study aimed to comprehensively identify and characterize the MTP gene family in barley (Hordeum vulgare, Hv), an important crop. In total, 12 HvMTPs were identified in the barley genome in this study. They were divided into three phylogenetic groups (Zn-cation diffusion facilitator proteins [CDFs], Fe/Zn-CDFs, and Mn-CDFs) and further subdivided into seven groups (G1, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, and G12). The majority of MTPs were hydrophobic proteins found in the vacuolar membrane. Gene duplication analysis of HvMTPs revealed one pair of segmental-like duplications in the barley genome. Evolutionary analysis suggested that barley MTPs underwent purifying natural selection. Additionally, the HvMTPs were analyzed in the pan-genome sequences of barley (20 accessions), which suggests that HvMTPs are highly conserved in barley evolution. Cis-acting regulatory elements, microRNA target sites, and protein–protein interaction analysis indicated the role of HvMTPs in a variety of biological processes. Expression profiling suggests that HvMTPs play an active role in maintaining barley nutrient homeostasis throughout its life cycle, and their expression levels were not significantly altered by abiotic stresses like cold, drought, or heat. The expression of barley HvMTP genes in the presence of heavy metals such as Zn2+, Cu2+, As3+, and Cd2+ revealed that these MTPs were induced by at least one metal ion, implying their involvement in metal tolerance or transportation. The identification and comprehensive investigation of MTP gene family members will provide important gene resources for the genetic improvement of crops for metal tolerance, bioremediation, or biofortification of staple crops."
Effect of Buffers with Multiple Binding Sites on Calcium Waves,"The existence and properties of intracellular waves of increased free cytoplasmic calcium concentration (calcium waves) are strongly affected by the binding and unbinding of calcium ions to a multitude of different buffers in the cell. These buffers can be mobile or immobile and, in general, have multiple binding sites that are not independent. Previous theoretical studies have focused on the case when each buffer molecule binds a single calcium ion. In this study, we analyze how calcium waves are affected by calcium buffers with two non-independent binding sites, and show that the interactions between the calcium binding sites can result in the emergence of new behaviors. In particular, for certain combinations of kinetic parameters, the profiles of buffer molecules with one calcium ion bound can be non-monotone."
Ethical decisions during COVID-19: level of moral disengagement and national pride as mediators,"COVID-19 created a global crisis of unprecedented comprehensiveness affecting personal and professional lives of individuals worldwide. The pandemic and various governmental guidelines associated with it had numerous consequences for the workplace and the marketplace. In light of the global nature and multiplicity of the consequences of the pandemic, this study examines the impact of individual characteristics of respondents from three countries from various areas of the world: China, Israel, and the USA toward COVID-19 related business ethics decisions in three different spheres: human resources, marketing, and social responsibility. Data from 374 respondents in these three countries indicated that moral disengagement was negatively related to all of the ethical decisions presented, with national pride moderating the above. Possible implications of these findings and future research directions are presented."
Physiological race characterisation of Fusarium oxysporum strains infecting tomato employing candidate pathogenicity genes and host resistance,"Physiological races of 14 strains of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici were established by PCR profiling SIX gene expressions. No amplification of the SIX4 (Avr1) gene was observed in any of the 14 strains. Based on amplification of the SIX3 (Avr2) gene, 6 strains were distinguished as race 2. Race 2 strains are known to contain identical SIX3 sequences and differ from race 3 strains by single point mutations. Hence, based on polymorphic amplicons of the SIX3 gene detected by stringent PCR conditions, 8 strains were identified as race 3. The identity of the physiological races of the strains was validated by inoculating on three germplasm lines, EC-814916, FEB-2 and Pusa Rohini carrying I-2, I-3 and no I gene, respectively. The race 2 and race 3 strains were avirulent on EC-814916 and FEB-2 lines, respectively. All the 14 fungal strains were pathogenic on Pusa Rohini, the Fusarium wilt susceptible cultivar lacking R genes and exhibited different levels of virulence. In evaluating two other potential pathogenicity genes, Fow1 and Fow2 as markers for virulence, their expressions were observed among both the races of the Fol strains, and hence are not potential candidates for physiological race discrimination. However, strong expressions of the genes in the root tissues inoculated with the highly virulent strain, TOFU-IHBT in comparison to the uninoculated control indicated their roles in fungal pathogenicity. To understand the role of these pathogenicity genes in countering the host defence mechanisms, their expressions in response to ROS and phenolics, the earliest known defence mechanisms of host plants were assessed. In H2O2, the Fow2 gene expressed 1.4-fold greater than that of the control. On the contrary, in relation to the control, the expressions of Fow1 were strongly repressed exhibiting 0.7-to 0.8-fold lesser at 0.1 mM through 3 mM concentrations than that of the control indicating that the gene is modulated by the phenolic acid indicating the roles of Fow2 and Fow1 in alleviating oxidative stress and targeted by the phenolic acid, respectively."
A mathematical analysis about the geo-temporal characterization of the multi-class maliciousness of an IP address,"The degree of severity of a cybersecurity event of potentially malicious activity is crucial to determine an appropriate response. Machine learning techniques are used to obtain models to achieve a correct characterization of events as well as an accurate maliciousness measure. A model is constructed by setting up an effective collection of features that are able to characterize the maliciousness of IP addresses. As a first approach, a set of contextual features has been selected. These features are simple to extract and require no high costs. That set contains 23 features: 18 obtained through time series analysis, and the other 5 extracted directly related with the spatial (geolocation) and temporal (time of occurrence) similarity of the events. The test of the feature set is conducted with statistical analyses to determine which features are the most effective and the impact of hyperparameter selection in the construction of a time series of features. In addition, the effect of IP geo-localization shifts on model performance is studied through concept drift theory. The results conclude that, overall, the feature set provides adequate performance for our task, although more complex features may be required to achieve better performance. The best results are obtained with the geolocation and time occurrence features."
Hubbard U through polaronic defect states,"Since the preliminary work of Anisimov and co-workers, the Hubbard corrected DFT+U functional has been used for predicting properties of correlated materials by applying on-site effective Coulomb interactions to specific orbitals. However, the determination of the Hubbard U parameter has remained under intense discussion despite the multitude of approaches proposed. Here, we define a selection criterion based on the use of polaronic defect states for the enforcement of the piecewise linearity of the total energy upon electron occupation. A good agreement with results from piecewise linear hybrid functionals is found for the electronic and structural properties of polarons, including the formation energies. The values of U determined in this way are found to give a robust description of the polaron energetics upon variation of the considered state. In particular, we also address a polaron hopping pathway, finding that the determined value of U leads to accurate energetics without requiring a configurational-dependent U. It is emphasized that the selection of U should be based on physical properties directly associated with the orbitals to which U is applied, rather than on more global properties such as band gaps and band widths. For comparison, we also determine U through a well-established linear-response scheme finding noticeably different values of U and consequently different formation energies. Possible origins of these discrepancies are discussed. As case studies, we consider the self-trapped electron in BiVO4, the self-trapped hole in MgO, the Li-trapped hole in MgO, and the Al-trapped hole in α-SiO2."
Circ_0026218 ameliorates oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced vascular endothelial cell dysfunction by regulating miR-188-3p/TLR4/NF-κB pathway,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have shown important regulatory roles in cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis (AS). However, the role and mechanism of circ_0026218 in AS remain unclear."
Appropriate fitted point on fracture limit curve of orthotropic materials to include the fracture process zone effects on mixed-mode I/II fracture criterion,"The fracture phenomenon in orthotropic materials is associated with the formation of the fracture process zone at the crack tip. Several toughening mechanisms in this zone delay the fracture by absorbing energy. The activation of these mechanisms and the extent of their effects depend on the loading mode. In this paper, the behavior of the fracture process zone under different loading modes is investigated. In the following, considering the fracture process zone effects, a new mixed-mode I/II fracture criterion is presented to investigate the crack growth behavior of orthotropic materials. In this criterion, by extending the minimum strain energy density theory to orthotropic materials and fitting the fracture limit curve to a midpoint (a mixed-mode I/II point) instead of the pure mode I point, a greater portion of the energy absorbed in the fracture process zone is considered. To validate the presented criterion, the related fracture limit curves are compared with the available experimental data for laminated composites and wood species as orthotropic materials. The results show that the newly proposed criterion, unlike the available conservative ones, especially around predominantly mode II, is more compatible with the nature of the failure phenomena in orthotropic materials."
Wave attenuation of a multi-span continuous beam with variable cross sections,"This paper studies the vibration band-gaps of a non-uniform beam with periodically continuous variable cross sections and hinged supports. The governing equation of the beam is obtained by using spectral element method. The frequency responses of the beam under external excitation are shown. The accuracy and efficiency of the spectral element method are validated. The advantages of the proposed beam are discussed. The influences of the structural and material parameters on the band-gap properties are explored, such as the height curve, the disordered vibration absorbers, and the material attributes. The coupling effects of the local resonance band-gaps and the Bragg scattering band-gaps are explored and can be used to design the band-gap structure. The displacement amplitudes of the beam for different excitation frequencies are shown."
"Trophic connectivity between the terrestrial and marine ecosystems of Malpelo Island, Colombia, evaluated through stable isotope analysis","The trophic dynamics of islands with low terrestrial primary productivity often depend on marine allochthonous inputs from nearby donor habitats. For instance, on Malpelo Island, Colombia (4° 00′ 05.63″ N; 81° 36′ 36.41″ W), the Nazca booby Sula granti affects the productivity and trophic dynamics of the terrestrial ecosystem by delivering nutrients, primary in the form guano, chick carcasses, and eggs. This study evaluated the trophic connectivity between the terrestrial and marine ecosystems of Malpelo Island, Colombia based on the isotopic (δ13C and δ15N) assessment of 403 samples (107 terrestrial and 296 marine) collected between 2017 and 2021. Isospaces were estimated based on δ13C and δ15N values, contribution of terrestrial sources in consumer diets (mixing model), 15 N enrichment in C3 plants, and interactions among environments (overlap). δ13C and δ15N values showed a larger terrestrial isospace (134.7‰2) than the marine isospace (117.2‰2). The mixing model indicated that detritusTerrestrial (median: 30.2%) contributed more to the food web than C3 plants (0.2%), reflecting high δ13CMarine content. The high isotopic overlap (> 60%) between terrestrial and marine isospaces suggests a significant trophic connection between environments. These results show the role of the marine ecosystem on the terrestrial ecosystem and the importance of S. granti regarding nutrient transfer between environments. The conservation of this seabird is essential to maintain the balance of this insular ecosystem. Using stable isotopes, this study was able to reveal trophic relationships between ecosystems associated with small oceanic islands that host large seabird colonies but have low primary productivity."
Development and validation of a predictive model for treatment outcome after emergency extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy in patients with symptomatic ureteral stones during the COVID-19 pandemic: in a large prospective cohort,"The predictors of treatment outcome after emergency extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) are not well characterized. Therefore, based on a large prospective cohort, we aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for predicting treatment outcome after emergency SWL in patients with symptomatic ureteral stones. The development cohort included 358 patients with symptomatic ureteral stones who underwent emergency SWL between June 2020 and August 2021 in our hospital. One hundred and twenty-nine patients with symptomatic ureteral stones participated in the validation cohort from September 2021 to April 2022. The data were prospectively recorded. The backward stepwise selection was applied using the likelihood ratio test with Akaike’s information criterion as the stopping rule. The efficacy of this predictive model was assessed concerning its clinical usefulness, calibration, and discrimination. Finally, 15.6% (56/358) of patients in the development cohort and 14.0% (18/129) of those in the validation cohort suffered from stone-free failure after emergency SWL. We identified four predictors for stone-free failure: stone size, stone density, skin to stone distance (SSD), and degree of hydronephrosis. This model showed good discrimination with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves of 0.935 (0.899–0.971) and good calibration (P = 0.059). The decision curve analysis showed that the model was clinically valuable. In this large prospective cohort, we found that stone size, stone density, SSD, and degree of hydronephrosis were predictors of treatment outcome after emergency SWL. This nomogram will be helpful in preoperative risk stratification to provide individualized treatment recommendations for each patient. Furthermore, early identification and appropriate management of patients may increase the success rate of emergency SWL during the COVID-19 pandemic."
Intelligent modeling of photocatalytically reactive yellow 84 azo dye removal from aqueous solutions by ZnO-light expanded clay aggregate nanoparticles,"This study deals with the intelligent modeling of reactive yellow 84 dye removal from aqueous solutions by zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles based on inorganic light expanded clay aggregates. Accordingly, a set of experimental data were utilized to develop robust models by adjusting the initial feed concentration, initial pH, de-colorization time, catalyst concentration, and lamp power as input factors. The Leverage method, a common method for detecting outliers, proved all measured data were reliable. After definition of input factors, four intelligent approaches, i.e., multilayer perceptron, Gaussian process regression (GPR), radial basis function, and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system with subtractive clustering were used to establish exact models for predicting the dye removal. Among them, the GPR-based model produced the best results with AARE, RRMSE, and R2 values of 4.87%, 6.21%, and 97.31%, respectively, for the test dataset. The remaining models also provided satisfactory outputs with AAREs between 6.59% and 9.81%. In addition, the influence of each operating parameter on the dye removal was properly described for the novel models. Finally, the most effective parameters on removal performance were determined by using a sensitivity analysis based on the GPR model."
3D Sulfur and nitrogen doped carbon materials Ni-MOF electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction,"Sulfur-nitrogen doped porous carbon (SNPC) material was first synthesized by the hydrothermal method and high-temperature carbonization. Then, the three-dimensional cube SNPC-Ni-metal organic frameworks (SNPC-Ni-MOF) composite was finally synthesized by hydrothermal method and applied in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). BET analysis proved the porosity and higher specific surface area of SNPC. FTIR analysis implied that the coordination of trimesic acid with metal ions was successful. SEM images showed that the as-synthesized carbon materials presented beautiful spherical. The overpotential of the as-synthesized composite was conducted by the LSV test, and it was found that the SNPC-Ni-MOF composite exhibited the lower overpotential (400 mV). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed the SNPC-Ni-MOF had the smaller Rct value (1.744 Ω cm−2). Tafel plot indicated that the doping of sulfur and nitrogen improved the electrochemical properties of carbon materials to some extent. The cyclic voltammetry test illustrated that the electrochemical active surface area of SNPC-Ni-MOF was 48.75 cm2. The turnover frequency ​​for OER was 0.016 s−1. In addition, the i-t curve test indicated that the SNPC-Ni-MOF composite possessed better stability, the retention rate reaches 96.7% after 20,000 cycles. All results illustrate that the OER performance of the as-prepared SNPC-Ni-MOF composite has been improved and can be used as electro-catalysts for water splitting."
Robust Design of 3D-Printed W-Band Bandpass Filters Using Gap Waveguide Technology,"In this paper, a W-band 3D-printed bandpass filter is proposed. The use of higher-order TE10n modes in groove gap waveguide (GGW) technology is evaluated in order to alleviate the manufacturing requirements. In addition to the use of higher-order modes, the coupling between them is analyzed in detail to improve the overall fabrication robustness of the component. This allows the implementation of narrow-band filters operating at millimeter-wave frequency bands (or above), which usually demand complex manufacturing techniques to provide the high accuracy required for this kind of devices. In order to show the applicability of the proposed method, a narrow-band 5th-order Chebyshev bandpass filter centered at 94 GHz, which can be easily fabricated by state-of-the-art stereolithographic (SLA) 3D-printing techniques followed by silver coating, is shown. Excellent measured performance has been obtained."
"COVID-19 Infection and Contact Tracing Among Refugees in the United States, 2020–2021","Refugees in the United States are believed to be at high risk of COVID-19. A cross-sectional study design was utilized to collect anonymous, online surveys from refugee communities in the United States during December 2020 to January 2021. We invited bilingual community leaders to share the survey link with other refugees aged ≥18 years. We identified factors associated with COVID-19 infection and measured the distribution of contact tracing among those who tested positive. Of 435 refugees who completed the survey, 26.4% reported testing positive for COVID-19. COVID-19 infection was associated with having an infected family member and knowing people in one’s immediate social environment who were infected. Among respondents who tested positive, 84.4% reported that they had been contacted for contact tracing. To prepare for future pandemics, public health authorities should continue partner with refugee community leaders and organizations to ensure efficient programs are inclusive of refugee communities."
Exact SDP relaxations for quadratic programs with bipartite graph structures,"For nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs), we first show that, under certain feasibility conditions, the standard semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation is exact for QCQPs with bipartite graph structures. The exact optimal solutions are obtained by examining the dual SDP relaxation and the rank of the optimal solution of this dual SDP relaxation under strong duality. Our results generalize the previous results on QCQPs with sign-definite bipartite graph structures, QCQPs with forest structures, and QCQPs with nonpositive off-diagonal data elements. Second, we propose a conversion method from QCQPs with no particular structure to the ones with bipartite graph structures. As a result, we demonstrate that a wider class of QCQPs can be exactly solved by the SDP relaxation. Numerical instances are presented for illustration."
"Matrix group integrals, surfaces, and mapping class groups II: \(\textrm{O}\left( n\right) \) and \(\textrm{Sp}\left( n\right) \)","Let w be a word in the free group on r generators. The expected value of the trace of the word in r independent Haar elements of \(\textrm{O}(n)\) gives a function \({\mathcal {T}}r_{w} ^{\textrm{O}}(n)\) of n. We show that \({\mathcal {T}}r_{w} ^{\textrm{O}}(n)\) has a convergent Laurent expansion at \(n=\infty \) involving maps on surfaces and \(L^{2}\)-Euler characteristics of mapping class groups associated to these maps. This can be compared to known, by now classical, results for the GUE and GOE ensembles, and is similar to previous results concerning \({\textrm{U}}\left( n\right) \), yet with some surprising twists. A priori to our result, \({\mathcal {T}}r_{w} ^{\textrm{O}}(n)\) does not change if w is replaced with \(\alpha (w)\) where \(\alpha \) is an automorphism of the free group. One main feature of the Laurent expansion we obtain is that its coefficients respect this symmetry under \(\textrm{Aut}({\textbf{F}} _{r})\). As corollaries of our main theorem, we obtain a quantitative estimate on the rate of decay of \({\mathcal {T}}r _{w}^{\textrm{O}}(n)\) as \(n\rightarrow \infty \), we generalize a formula of Frobenius and Schur, and we obtain a universality result on random orthogonal matrices sampled according to words in free groups, generalizing a theorem of Diaconis and Shahshahani. Our results are obtained more generally for a tuple of words \(w_{1},\ldots ,w_{\ell }\), leading to functions \({\mathcal {T}}r_{w_{1},\ldots ,w_{\ell }} ^{\textrm{O}}\). We also obtain all the analogous results for the compact symplectic groups \(\textrm{Sp}(n)\) through a rather mysterious duality formula."
Do marine protected areas protect shallow coral reef systems? A resilience-based management approach in Tropical Southwestern Atlantic reefs,"Adequate methods to evaluate the extension of global and local damage on coral reefs, and to minimize it, are urgent. The Tropical Southwestern Atlantic reefs are partially protected by Marine Protected Areas (MPA) that apply spatial zoning as a management strategy. A resilience-based management approach was used to evaluate the effectiveness of no-take areas in improving reef resilience, inside the largest coastal MPA of Brazil. Ecological indicators were used to calculate resilience scores, to test the hypothesis that no-take reefs present higher resilience than tourism reefs. Score values indicated medium–high resilience for both. Despite the similar values, the contribution of the indicators to the score varied between reefs. Herbivorous fish biomass was the main indicator influencing higher scores. Management through spatial zoning and the compliance of this regulation raised the resilience of coral reefs. The main management actions recommended are the creation of no-take areas in coastal habitats such as mangroves and seagrass beds."
Fast and effective production of industrial grade activated carbon,"The present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a flash heating method to produce in a short time industrial-grade activated carbon with a well-developed pore structure and high adsorption capacity. Hazelnut shells, rice husk, and corn stalks were impregnated with potassium hydroxide (KOH) and activated using flash and slow heating at different temperatures. The slow heating process was conducted with a heating rate of 10 °C/min, while no heating rate was applied in flash heating during activated carbon production. Obtained products were characterized by the X-ray diffractometer, fourier transform infrared, and BET surface area. It was observed that the surface area of ACs ranged from 1650 and 2573 m2/g by using flash heating, and 1005–3257 m2/g by using slow heating. Methylene and iodine number test procedures were applied to the final product to examine the adsorption capacity of the available pores. The methylene blue adsorption capacity was 714 mg/g which is the highest value using flash heating while 630 mg/g is the best value for slow heating. Iodine numbers were over 1000 mg/g for all obtained activated carbons. Consequently, the high methylene and iodine number values were attained with the flash-activated carbons, showing their high adsorption potential as an adsorbent compared to commercial activated carbon. The results of this study show that flash-activated carbon could be used as an alternative to commercial carbon and produced in a short time with a promising heating way."
Measurement and Correlation of Solubility of L–Tryptophan in Aqueous Solutions with a Wide Range of pH and Different Monovalent Counterions from 283.15 to 323.15 K,"The aqueous solubility of L-tryptophan was measured with a wide range of pH (1.00–12.50) and different monovalent counterions (Na+, K+, Cl− and \({\text{NO}}_{\text{3}}^{-}\)) from 283.15 to 323.15 K by using a static equilibrium method. The results showed that the solubility of L-tryptophan increased with increasing temperature and the solubility–pH profile was a “U” shape with the lowest value at the isoelectric point. Additionally, the distribution of the ionic forms of L-tryptophan as a function of pH was obtained using the knowledge of the acid–base equilibria of amino acids, and it was found that the isoelectric points increased with temperature. Moreover, different counterions were introduced by using different acids or bases during pH adjustment and their effect on the solubility of L-tryptophan was investigated, which showed that more L-tryptophan could be dissolved in the presence of K+ (or \({\text{NO}}_{\text{3}}^{-}\)) than Na+ (or Cl−). Besides, the modified Apelblat model and the NRTL model were successfully used to correlate the aqueous solubility data with all the average relative deviation less than 2.1%."
Small Scale Formations in the Incompressible Porous Media Equation,"We construct examples of solutions to the incompressible porous media (IPM) equation that must exhibit infinite in time growth of derivatives provided they remain smooth.

"Transaction Latency Within Permissionless Blockchains: Analysis, Improvement, and Security Considerations","Permissionless blockchains such as Ethereum offer decentralization and security. However, their performance is low compared to permissioned and traditional centralized systems, which may hinder their adoption. Transaction latency is an important performance metric that impacts the use of blockchain systems. That is, there is a need for a systematic evaluation to analyze the factors that may contribute to transaction latency. In this article, we propose a queueing model and conduct extensive simulation experiments to evaluate transaction latency within the Ethereum blockchain, considering all the contributing factors. Our simulation results suggest that transaction fees, block limit, block interval time, transaction arrival rate, and the behavior of the network nodes can all significantly contribute to the latency figures. We find the behavior of the network nodes can significantly impact the waiting time for transactions, especially since nodes are not enforced to utilize their blocks properly in the current implementation of permissionless blockchains. Finally, we suggest improvements to transaction latency by (1) increasing the block limit, (2) reducing the block interval time, and (3) encouraging nodes to fill their blocks with transactions as well as discussing the relevant security issues."
Relationship between slow-wave sleep and serum γ-glutamine transaminase in non-obese men with obstructive sleep apnea–hypopnea syndrome,"Obstructive sleep apnea–hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a disease characterized with intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation. Obesity and gender are major risk factors for the onset of OSAHS. Previous studies on obese men with OSAHS have been performed, while few studies on non-obese men with OSAHS have been carried out. The purpose of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics of polysomnography and blood biochemical indexes in non-obese men with OSAHS and to identify the possible influencing factors."

Creation of poxvirus expressing foot-and-mouth and peste des petits ruminant disease virus proteins,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and Peste des petits ruminant disease (PPR) are acute and severe infectious diseases of sheep and are listed as animal diseases for compulsory immunization. However, there is no dual vaccine to prevent these two diseases. The Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara strain (MVA) has been widely used in the construction of recombinant live vector vaccine because of its large capacity of foreign gene, wide host range, high safety, and immunogenicity. In this study, MVA-GFP recombinant virus skeleton was used to construct dual live vector vaccines against FMD and PPR."
Measuring Oral Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Continuation Through Electronic Health Records During Program Scale-Up Among the General Population in Zambia,"HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is being scaled-up in Zambia, but PrEP continuation data are limited by paper-based registers and aggregate reports. Utilization of Zambia’s electronic health record (EHR) system, SmartCare, may address this gap. We analyzed individuals aged ≥ 15 years who initiated PrEP between October 2020 and September 2021 in four provinces in Zambia in SmartCare versus aggregate reports. We measured PrEP continuation using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. SmartCare captured 29% (16,791/58,010) of new PrEP clients; 49% of clients continued at one month, and 89% discontinued PrEP by February 2022. Women were less likely than men to discontinue PrEP (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.89, 95% CI 0.86–0.92, z = − 6.99, p < 0.001), and PrEP clients aged ≥ 50 years were less likely to discontinue PrEP compared to clients 15–19 years (aHR: 0.53, 95% CI 0.48–0.58, z = − 13.04, p < 0.001). Zambia’s EHR is a valuable resource for measuring individual-level PrEP continuation over time and can be used to inform HIV prevention programs."
Numerical Study on Damage Behavior of Fiber-Metal Laminates Subjected to High Velocity Fragments Impact,"Fiber metal laminates (FMLs) are widely used in a variety of protective structures due to their excellent impact resistance. In the present work, a nonlinear finite element (FE) model is developed to investigate the damage behavior of carbon fiber reinforced aluminum laminates (CRALLs) under high velocity fragments impact. The strain rate effect of composite ply is involved and the intra-laminar damage is predicted based on 3D Hashin criteria; Johnson-cook model is employed to simulate the high velocity fragments impact response of aluminum layer; cohesive elements are introduced to describe the inter-laminar delamination phenomena. The proposed FE model is verified with the available experimental data in ballistic impact condition and then implemented to predict the fragments impact behavior of FMLs. The dynamic response and damage mechanism of FMLs are analyzed and the effects of explosion distance, explosion mass and impact angle on the impact performance are discussed in detail."
Numerical Simulation of Composite Material Light-Curing Process Based on the Finite Element Analysis Method,"Compared to the traditional thermal curing method, ultraviolet light-curing can effectively avoid the problems of long curing time and complicated curing equipment. In this paper, a geometric and physical model of the light-curing process of the glass fiber reinforced composite multilayer laminate is established based on the theory of optics and curing kinetics, considering the propagation of ultraviolet light in the laminate is affected by the interlayer during the light-curing process. The meta-analysis method is adopted to calculate and predict the changes in the curing degree, temperature, and stress fields during the light-curing process of glass fiber composites, which also analyzes and summarizes the multi-field distribution and its variation law during the process. By comparing the experimental data with the predicted results, the model's accuracy is verified, and the causes of errors are analyzed, providing an efficient analysis method to investigate the composite light-curing."

"Persisting cognitive impairment predicts functional dependence at 1 year after stroke and transient ischemic attack: a longitudinal, cohort study","Minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) usually have mild and nondisabling symptoms, and these functional deficits may recover fully e.g., TIA, however, part of them still suffer from cognitive impairment and poor outcomes. We conducted a study to determine the relationship between cognition evaluated by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and poor functional outcomes assessed by the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (mRS ≥ 2) and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS)-16(SIS-16<25%)."
Multi-stage mine production timetabling with optimising the sizes of mining operations: an application of parallel-machine flow shop scheduling with lot streaming,"In open-pit mining, a trade-off between determination of appropriate sizes of mining jobs and optimisation of allocating and sequencing mining equipment units at each operational stage is one of critical decisions for mining practitioners. To simultaneously optimise the above data-driven interplay between planning and scheduling decisions in multi-stage mine production timetabling, we introduce a novel integrated-planning-scheduling problem for considering the disturbances and variability of jobs’ sizes based on the theory of parallel-machine flow shop scheduling with lot streaming. This new problem is called the “Multi-stage Mine Production Timetabling with Optimising the Sizes of Mining Operations” and abbreviated as the MMPT-OSMO, in which the sizes of mining jobs (i.e., the number of block units to be aggregated on different working benches) are considered as planning-type variables and integrated with scheduling-type variables in a parallel-machine flow shop scheduling system. Due to considerable complexity, an innovative math-heuristic approach embodied as a hybridisation of decomposed mixed integer programming models and heuristic algorithms under a three-level divide-&-conquer scheme is devised to efficiently solve the MMPT-OSMO. By integrating both planning and scheduling decision variables in such a solitary problem, the MMPT-OSMO intrinsically characterises the potential to significantly improve mining productivity, which is validated by theoretical analysis and extensive computational experiments. In real-world implementation, replacing the current labour-intensive manual way, the proposed MMPT-OSMO methodology provides an intelligent decision-making tool to mathematically optimise the interactive decisions between mine planning and scheduling engineers. The proposed MMPT-OSMO methodology would make a breakthrough in the field of mining optimisation, as it contributes to extend mathematical modelling boundary by applying continuous-time machine scheduling theory to operational-level mining optimisation in theory and to help mining practitioners improve the production throughput using lot-streaming techniques in practice."
Grassl–Rötteler cyclic and consta-cyclic MDS codes are generalised Reed–Solomon codes,"We prove that the cyclic and constacyclic codes constructed by Grassl and Rötteler in International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT), pp. 1104–1108 (2015) are generalised Reed–Solomon codes. This note can be considered as an addendum to Grassl and Rötteler International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT), pp 1104–1108 (2015). It can also be considered as an appendix to Ball and Vilar IEEE Trans Inform Theory 68:3796–3805, (2022) where Conjecture 11 of International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT), pp 1104–1108 (2015), which was stated for Grassl–Rötteler codes, is proven for generalised Reed–Solomon codes. The content of this note, together with IEEE Trans Inform Theory 68:3796–3805, (2022) therefore implies that Conjecture 11 from International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT), pp. 1104–1108 (2015) is true."
Experimental study of stratified lean burn characteristics on a dual injection gasoline engine,"Due to increasingly stringent fuel consumption and emission regulation, improving thermal efficiency and reducing particulate matter emissions are two main issues for next generation gasoline engine. Lean burn mode could greatly reduce pumping loss and decrease the fuel consumption of gasoline engines, although the burning rate is decreased by higher diluted intake air. In this study, dual injection stratified combustion mode is used to accelerate the burning rate of lean burn by increasing the fuel concentration near the spark plug. The effects of engine control parameters such as the excess air coefficient (Lambda), direct injection (DI) ratio, spark interval with DI, and DI timing on combustion, fuel consumption, gaseous emissions, and particulate emissions of a dual injection gasoline engine are studied. It is shown that the lean burn limit can be extended to Lambda = 1.8 with a low compression ratio of 10, while the fuel consumption can be obviously improved at Lambda = 1.4. There exists a spark window for dual injection stratified lean burn mode, in which the spark timing has a weak effect on combustion. With optimization of the control parameters, the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) decreases 9.05% more than that of original stoichiometric combustion with DI as 2 bar brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) at a 2000 r/min engine speed. The NOx emissions before three-way catalyst (TWC) are 71.31% lower than that of the original engine while the particle number (PN) is 81.45% lower than the original engine. The dual injection stratified lean burn has a wide range of applications which can effectively reduce fuel consumption and particulate emissions. The BSFC reduction rate is higher than 5% and the PN reduction rate is more than 50% with the speed lower than 2400 r/min and the load lower than 5 bar."
Tween-80 improves single/coaxial electrospinning of three-layered bioartificial blood vessel,"Electrospinning is a promising technique for preparing bioartificial blood vessels. Nanofibers prepared by electrospinning can simulate the structure of extracellular matrix to promote cell adhesion and proliferation. However, thorn-like protrusions can appear as defects on electrospun scaffolds and coaxial electrospun nanofibers often have no clear core/shell structure, which can seriously affect the quality of bioartificial blood vessels. To address these problems, Tween 80 is added to the electrospinning solution, which results in a stable Taylor cone, eliminates the thorn-like protrusions on electrospun bioartificial blood vessels, and reduces interfacial effects due to different core/shell solutions during coaxial electrospinning. Simulations, biomechanical tests, and in vivo studies were performed. The results demonstrate the excellent mechanical properties and biocompatibility of the bioartificial blood vessel. This research provides a useful reference for optimizing the electrospinning process for fabricating bioartificial blood vessels."
Tensile properties of human spinal dura mater and pericranium,"Autologous pericranium is a promising dural graft material. An optimal graft should exhibit similar mechanical properties to the native dura, but the mechanical properties of human pericranium have not been characterized, and studies of the biomechanical performance of human spinal dura are limited. The primary aim of this study was to measure the tensile structural and material properties of the pericranium, in the longitudinal and circumferential directions, and of the dura in each spinal region (cervical, thoracic and lumbar) and in three directions (longitudinal anterior and posterior, and circumferential). The secondary aim was to determine corresponding constitutive stress–strain equations using a one-term Ogden model. A total of 146 specimens were tested from 7 cadavers. Linear regression models assessed the effect of tissue type, region, and orientation on the structural and material properties. Pericranium was isotropic, while spinal dura was anisotropic with higher stiffness and strength in the longitudinal than the circumferential direction. Pericranium had lower strength and modulus than spinal dura across all regions in the longitudinal direction but was stronger and stiffer than dura in the circumferential direction. Spinal dura and pericranium had similar strain at peak force, toe, and yield, across all regions and directions. Human pericranium exhibits isotropic mechanical behavior that lies between that of the longitudinal and circumferential spinal dura. Further studies are required to determine if pericranium grafts behave like native dura under in vivo loading conditions. The Ogden parameters reported may be used for computational modeling of the central nervous system."
"Nutritional quality, Chemical Composition and Antioxidant Capacity of Red and Green Opuntia Ficus Indica Peels’ Extracts","The goal of the present work is to evaluate the nutritive quality, chemical composition and antioxidant potential of red and green Opuntia Ficus Indica (OFI) peel extracts. Mineral analysis showed that the green peels exhibited the greatest concentrations of potassium, calcium and magnesium. Our findings showed that linoleic and linolenic acids were the major constituents (29.18 and 29.27%, respectively) followed by palmitic acid (20.82%) in the green peels, whereas linoleic acid (28.76%) was the predominant one followed by palmitic (25.74%) and linolenic (24.72%) acids in the red peels. The green and red peels’ lipids contained 44.43 g/kg and 64.31 g/kg of phytosterols and triterpenols, respectively. The sterol marker was β-sitosterol representing more than 55% of the entire sterol content in the two peels followed by campesterol and stigmasterol. Tocopherol amounts were 656.895 and 813.025 mg/kg for the green and red peels, respectively. Methanol extracts of defatted peels showed high amounts of total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and expressed strong antioxidant capacity. Red peels extract displayed the largest values of TPC = 143.32 mg GAE/g, TFC = 37.06 mg QE/g, DPPH IC50 = 327.72 μg/mL and FRAP EC50 = 302.43 μg/mL."
Characterizations of Unusual Peptides Encoded by Circular RNAs and their Possible Involvements in Human Diseases,"Circular RNAs are included in the family of non-coding RNA molecules. As the name implies, circular RNAs are not supposed to be “non-coding”. However, some circular RNAs have internal ribosomal entry sites, and through these sites, they can code for peptides/proteins. Some of such circular RNAs are circAKT3, circβ-catenin, circFBXW7 and circLINC-PINT. All of these circular RNAs are known to be associated with some forms of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, only the genetics of these circular RNAs are studied. Till date, there is no information pertaining to the proteins generated from these circular RNAs. In this work, the proteins encoded by the circular RNAs circAKT3, circβ-catenin, circFBXW7 and circLINC-PINT were analyzed by in silico techniques. We obtained the amino acid sequences of the proteins from databases, and they were used to decipher various structure-based features. This is the first report that delineates the structure–function relationships of the proteins encoded by the aforementioned circular RNA molecules. The work presented here may be used in wet laboratory for the characterizations of the peptides encoded by the circular RNAs and therefore to determine the roles of these proteins in disease onset."
Bio-Physico Characterization of Poly-3-Hydroxybutyrate (PHB) Produced from an Organic Pollutant Utilizer Bacillus subtilis subsp.subtilis DJ9192,"In the existing research, Phenol, an organic pollutant, was designated for substrate consumption and production into Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) using the Bacillus subtilis subsp.subtilis DJ9192 species, isolated from sewage treatment plant. This organism displayed growth on Phenol, which is a toxic carcinogenic & mutagenic organic compound that was studied for 48 h. The utilization pattern of phenol organic compound at 100 mg/l concentration was analyzed using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The strain showed potent PHB production of 2.00 g/l after 48 h. The results confirm that this bacterial strain can alter or reduce organic Phenol and produce intermediate products. The identification of functional groups & structural elucidation of PHB confirms by the FTIR technique, 1H & 13C NMR technique. The extracted PHB component shows FTIR peak in the range of 1000 cm−1 to 2739 cm−1. Thermal Gravimetric analysis favors that at 100ºc PHB retains its capacity up to 99.309% and at 1000ºc up to 23.232%. The Differential Scanning Colorimetric (DSC) analysis at 500ºc and 1000ºc respectively signify a chemical transition peak at 151.860 C & 256.430 at 500ºc and a peak at 157.08ºc & 260.19ºc at 1000ºc. The mass spectrum of granules was derived from Mass Spectroscopy analysis. The crystallographic structural confirmation of PHB was done by x-ray diffraction analysis shows the distinctive peak positions in the ranges of 2θ of 8.60 to 56.40. This research discloses the phenol utilization and polyhydroxy butyrate production by B. subtilis subsp.subtilis DJ9192 which can be used as an effective microbial polyester and functional as an alternative to synthetic plastic."
Seniority of the assistant surgeon and perioperative outcomes in robotic-assisted proctectomy for rectal cancer,"The background of this study is to evaluate the impact of the assistant surgeon's in robotic-assisted proctectomy (RAP) on perioperative outcomes. A retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent RAP for rectal adenocarcinoma between 2011 and 2020 was conducted. Patient cohort was divided into three groups based on the assistant surgeon’s training level: post-graduate years (PGY) 1–3 surgical residents (Group 1), PGY 4–5 surgical residents (Group 2), and board-certified general surgeons (Group 3). Overall, 175 patients were included in the study: 29 patients (17%) in Group 1, 84 (48%) in Group 2, and 62 (35%) in Group 3. The median tumor distance from the anal verge was 8 cm in all groups (p = 0.73). The median operative time was similar across all groups: 290, 291, and 281 min in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (p = 0.69). In a multivariable analysis, the lack of association between assistant training level and procedure time maintained when adjusting for the year of operation (p = 0.84). Patients operated with junior residents as assistant surgeons (Group 1) had a more postoperative complications (p = 0.01) and a slightly longer hospital length of stay [7 days, interquartile range (IQR) 3], compared to those operated by assistant surgeons that were senior residents or attendings (6 IQR 2.5, and 6 IQR 2 in Groups 2 and 3, respectively; p = 0.02). Conversion rates (p = 0.12), intraoperative complications (p = 0.39), major postoperative complications (Clavien–Dindo ≥ 3; p = 0.32), 30-day readmission (p = 0.45), and mortality (p = 0.99) were similar between the groups. Robotic-assisted proctectomy performed with the assistance of a junior resident was found to be correlated with worse postoperative outcomes compared to more experienced assistants. No difference was seen in intraoperative outcomes."
The effects of temperature on mental health: evidence from China,"We examine the effects of ambient temperatures on mental health using a nationally representative longitudinal survey of Chinese individuals. We find that temperatures over \(30^\circ{\rm C}\) significantly increase the likelihood of depression. High temperatures have larger detrimental effects on the mental health of the middle-aged and elderly, females, the less-educated, and agricultural workers. We discuss two likely mechanisms for the mental health impact of high temperatures: raising the incidence of physical illness and reducing sleeping time. We find suggestive evidence of air conditioners moderating the adverse impacts of high temperatures and of adaptation to high temperatures in the long term. We reveal that without any government interventions or private adaptation, mental health will deteriorate by 3.1% in the medium term and 5.3% in the long term based on the Hadley GEM2-ES climate-change projection."
Metric Analysis for AOP and OOP Programming Paradigm,"Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming that is centered around the articles and their conduct's ideas. It has been utilized for a long time by programmers' gathering. Configuration examples are the best act of OOP that has been assembled. OOP centers around taking care of the issues regarding true components. In any case, sooner or later, OOP has restrictions and execution which can be improved. AOP is a programming worldview that can beat the impediment of the OOP and can accomplish the successes decidedly, yet it can likewise cause the incidental effects in the code even with the victories. Special case taking care of is the component which deals with the run time blunders to protect the customary progression of the application Nonetheless, the execution of like these instruments with viewpoint arranged programming (AOP) could prompt mistake containing situations. Utilizing the AOP idea like joint cut, cross cut, perspective and a lot more  can forestall such situations. This paper attempts to carry out the code with special case taking care of with AOP ideas and distinguishes the benefits and inconveniences in gathering with the conventional OOP execution. This report gives the examination of AOP OOP through measurements investigation and gives the depicted data about this area of study."
Immune cell populations differ in patients undergoing revision total knee arthroplasty for arthrofibrosis,"Arthrofibrosis following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a debilitating condition typically diagnosed based on clinical findings. To gain insight into the histopathologic immune cell microenvironment of arthrofibrosis, we assessed the extent of tissue fibrosis and quantified immune cell populations in specific tissue regions of the posterior capsule. We investigated specimens from three prospectively-collected, matched cohorts, grouped as patients receiving a primary TKA for osteoarthritis, revision TKA for arthrofibrosis, and revision TKA for non-arthrofibrotic, non-infectious reasons. Specimens were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin staining, picrosirius red staining, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry with Aperio®-based digital image analysis. Increased collagen deposition and increased number of α-SMA/ACTA2 expressing myofibroblasts were present in the arthrofibrosis group compared to the two non-arthrofibrotic groups. CD163 + macrophages were the most abundant immune cell type in any capsular sample with specific enrichment in the synovial tissue. CD163 + macrophages were significantly decreased in the fibrotic tissue region of arthrofibrosis patients compared to the patients with primary TKA, and significantly increased in adipose tissue region of arthrofibrotic specimens compared to non-arthrofibrotic specimens. Synovial CD117 + mast cells were significantly decreased in arthrofibrotic adipose tissue. Together, these findings inform diagnostic and targeted therapeutic strategies by providing insight into the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms of arthrofibrosis."

PhenoExam: gene set analyses through integration of different phenotype databases,"Gene set enrichment analysis (detecting phenotypic terms that emerge as significant in a set of genes) plays an important role in bioinformatics focused on diseases of genetic basis. To facilitate phenotype-oriented gene set analysis, we developed PhenoExam, a freely available R package for tool developers and a web interface for users, which performs: (1) phenotype and disease enrichment analysis on a gene set; (2) measures statistically significant phenotype similarities between gene sets and (3) detects significant differential phenotypes or disease terms across different databases."
The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis in Western Australia,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common form of autoimmune arthritis, but the prevalence in Australia is unknown.

Formative research to promote lupus awareness and early screening at Historically Black College and University (HBCU) communities in South Carolina,"Systemic lupus erythematosus or lupus is a severe chronic autoimmune disorder that disproportionately impacts young African Americans. Increasing lupus awareness in this high-risk group may be an effective approach to ultimately improving lupus outcomes. To begin to address this disparity, this report describes qualitative data to be utilized in the development of a campaign to enhance awareness of lupus on Historically Black Colleges and University (HBCU) campuses."
"Floristic composition and community analysis of woody species in Hereje Natural Forest, southwest Ethiopia","The floristic composition, diversity, and conservation status of woody plant species in Ethiopia are determined in this study. Data on vegetation are collected using a systematic random sampling method from 45 20 m × 20 m    (400m2) plots laid every 100 m along four parallel transect lines running from south to north. The Flora of Ethiopia and Eritrea identification key (Volume I–VIII) is used to identify the scientific names of all woody plant species. The Shannon–Wiener diversity index is used to calculate species diversity, whereas Sorensen's similarity coefficient is used to assess similarities and differences among plant communities. The studied forest contains 44 plant species from 29 families and 40 genera. The Fabaceae is the most dominant family, followed by the Rubiaceae and Combretaceae. In terms of habit, the collected woody species consisted of 30 (68.2%) trees and 14 (31.8%) shrubs. The two most frequent species are Syzygium guineense (51.11%) and Maytenus gracilipes (46.66%). Three plant community types are identified using Agglomerative Hierarchical Cluster Analysis. Most species (Calpurnia aurea-Combretum molle) are observed in community type two. The study is generally limited to the floristic and diversity of woody plant species. Therefore, a thorough investigation of all species' floristic composition, population structure, regeneration status, and ecological aspects is recommended."
Aging Mechanism of p-Type Dopingless JLFET: NBTI and Channel-Hot-Carrier Stress,"In this work, an extensive study of the aging mechanisms of the p-type dopingless JLFET (DL JLFET) structure is reported for the first time. The negative-bias-temperature-instability (NBTI) and channel-hot-carrier (CHC) stress conditions are considered for analyzing the aging behavior of p-type DL JLFET. The variations in electrical characteristics of lightly doped DL JLFET are compared with its conventional counterpart JLFET against NBTL and CHC stress. We have shown that JLFET with heavily doped channel region exhibits higher drain current degradation under CHC stress due to high electric field and large gate leakage current. The JLFET has 19% drain current degradation due to CHC stress which is 1.7 times higher than DL JLFET. However, under NBTI stress, the DL JLFET has slightly higher drain current degradation and almost symmetric shift in \(V_{th}\) than JLFET. Hence, this study suggests that dopingless devices are superior candidate for designing aging-resilient and more reliable circuits."
Feasibility and preliminary efficacy of training health workers in detecting Priority Mental Health Conditions among adolescents in rural South India,"Half of all mental disorders start during adolescence, before 14 years. In India, the current prevalence of mental disorders in 13–17 years age group was 7.3%. Many gaps persist in the mental healthcare delivery through the national mental health program, the low psychiatrist population ratio being one of them. Community health workers can play an essential role in providing mental healthcare in such resource-constrained settings. The World Health Organization mental health gap action program (WHO mhGAP) is a widely studied mental health tool that health workers can use to identify mental disorders. The study’s aim was to test the preliminary efficacy of training healthcare workers (HCWs) in identifying mental health conditions among adolescents using modified WHO mhGAP modules."

Analysis of degradation products of Novichok agents in human urine by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry,"The detection of hydrolysis products of Novichok agents in biological samples from victims is important for confirming exposure to these agents. However, Novichok agents are new class of nerve agent and there have been only few reports on analyses of Novichok agent degradation products. Here, we developed hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)–tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methods to detect Novichok agent degradation products in human urine with simple pretreatment and high sensitivity."
The Temporal Bias Approach to the Symmetry Problem and Historical Closeness,"In addressing the Lucretian symmetry problem, the temporal bias approach claims that death is bad because it deprives us of something about which it is rational to care (e.g., future pleasures), whereas prenatal nonexistence is not bad because it only deprives us of something about which it is rational to remain indifferent (e.g., past pleasures). In a recent contribution to the debate on this approach, Miguel and Santos argue that a late beginning can deprive us of a future pleasure. Their argument is based on the claim that for birth or death to deprive a person of any value in life, the historically closest counterfactual situation that contains the value is such that the person begins to exist earlier or dies later. This is what they call the Historical Condition. However, the Historical Condition is untenable for several reasons. First, this condition substantially weakens the explanatory capacity of the deprivation account because it implies that most ordinary sorts of pleasures are not deprived by death. In addition, the Historical Condition is vulnerable to counterexamples. In particular, what they offer as a standard case of the deprivation of future pleasure due to a late beginning (what they call Seeing The Beatles), or some of its variants, can be used to falsify this condition. Finally, the Historical Condition is theoretically indefensible because it is based on a faulty analysis of deprivation."
Chiral pesticides levels in peri-urban area near Yangtze River and their correlations with water quality and microbial communities,"Pesticides are considered to be the second-largest non-point source pollution in water. Our research assayed the river network of typical agricultural areas in the middle and lower Yangtze River as the study area. Pesticides residues in aquatic environment were determined by QuEChERS, combined with high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, or gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. At chiral pesticides’ levels, we detected pesticides contents in water, classified and counted the types of pesticides, and analyzed their environmental risk assessment. Furthermore, potential correlations between chiral pesticides concentrations and water quality indicators were assayed. Additionally, we explored their relations with microbial communities at species levels. Enantiomers of Diclofop-methyl, Ethiprole, Difenoconazole and Epoxiconazole were enantioselectively distributed. More interestingly, due to various chiral environment of the sampling site, the enantiomers of Tebuconazole Acetochlor, Glufosinate ammonium and Bifenthrin had completely different distributions at different sites. Based on that, the chiral pesticides Diclofop-methyl, Bifenthrin, Ethiprole, Tebuconazole and Difenoconazole are enantioselective to the risk of aquatic environment. Generally, enantiomeric selectivity had high positive correlations with total nitrogen and phosphorus. Then we found that chiral fate behavior of Tebuconazole and Paichongding in water might be affected by prokaryotes. In addition, the chiral behavior of Diclofop-methyl, Propiconazole, Difenoconazole, and Tebuconazole isomers in water might be negatively affected by eukaryotes. That research helped us to comprehensively understand the impact of non-point source pollution of chiral pesticides in aquatic environment and provided basic data support for developing biological and water quality indicators for monitoring pollution in aquatic environment."
What drives strategic agility? Evidence from a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (FsQCA),"Strategic agility is a topic that has not reached maturity and is of increasing interest for companies and academics alike. Yet few studies assess what drives strategic agility in organisations. This paper aims to review how companies are currently obtaining strategic agility and to identify the individual factors and configurations that lead to it. The study draws on a survey carried out with 40 Spanish companies in the services sector. The study then uses Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to identify the different configurations of factors that lead to strategic agility. Finally, we complement QCA analysis by performing a case study for each of the configurations that lead to strategic agility. The study reveals that there is no necessary condition to reach strategic agility and that companies reach it in five main ways, depending on different combinations of six factors: firm size, firm age, whether the firm is international, whether it competes in a turbulent environment, and whether the firm invests in i) capabilities and technologies, and ii) additional revenue models or cost-cutting mechanisms or not."
Contextual transformer sequence-based recognition network for medical examination reports,"The automatic recognition of the medical examination report table (MERT) is receiving increasing attention in recent years as it is an essential step for intelligent healthcare and medical treatment. However, there are still some challenges in the table prediction when it is applied practically. In this paper, a recognition network (CoT_SRN) for medical examination reports is proposed to improve the recognition accuracy of MERT structure and reconstruct the image into a spreadsheet. The network is based on contextual transformer sequence and consists of CoT encoder and SRN decoder. In the encoder, the CNN backbone is constructed to extract the MERT image structure features based on the Contextual Transformer (CoT) proposed in this paper. In the decoder, an attention head with gated recurrent unit (GRU) was used for feature sequence recognition to obtain the cell location and table structure represented by a structured language. In addition, MERT structure labels are defined as character-level HTML formats, which are added in the training of the table structure recognition. The proposed method can achieve competitive tree-edit-distance-based similarity (TEDS) scores on the English datasets, such as PubTabNet and SciTSR, and Chinese datasets, such as the Chinese medical document dataset (CMDD). It demonstrates that the Cot_SRN is helpful to preserve the good performance across multi-language MERT structure recognition. Additionally, the performance of the proposed method is verified on the practical examples with folds and small angle deflection. The experimental results show that the proposed method is promising in practical application."
On proportional volume sampling for experimental design in general spaces,"Optimal design for linear regression is a fundamental task in statistics. For finite design spaces, recent progress has shown that random designs drawn using proportional volume sampling (PVS for short) lead to polynomial-time algorithms with approximation guarantees that outperform i.i.d. sampling. PVS strikes the balance between design nodes that jointly fill the design space, while marginally staying in regions of high mass under the solution of a relaxed convex version of the original problem. In this paper, we examine some of the statistical implications of a new variant of PVS for (possibly Bayesian) optimal design. Using point process machinery, we treat the case of a generic Polish design space. We show that not only are known A-optimality approximation guarantees preserved, but we obtain similar guarantees for D-optimal design that tighten recent results. Moreover, we show that our PVS variant can be sampled in polynomial time. Unfortunately, in spite of its elegance and tractability, we demonstrate on a simple example that the practical implications of general PVS are likely limited. In the second part of the paper, we focus on applications and investigate the use of PVS as a subroutine for stochastic search heuristics. We demonstrate that PVS is a robust addition to the practitioner’s toolbox, especially when the regression functions are nonstandard and the design space, while low-dimensional, has a complicated shape (e.g., nonlinear boundaries, several connected components)."
"Genomic insight into Myroides oncorhynchi sp. nov., a new member of the Myroides genus, isolated from the internal organ of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)","The strain M-43T was isolated from the Oncorhynchus mykiss from a fish farm in Mugla, Turkey. Pairwise 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis was used to identify strain M-43T. The strain was a member of the genus Myroides sharing the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence identity levels of 98.7%, 98.3%, and 98.3% with the type strains of M. profundi D25T, M. odoratimimus subsp. odoratimimus CCUG 39352T and M. odoratimimus subsp. xuanwuensis DSM27251T, respectively. A polyphasic taxonomic approach including whole genome-based analyses was employed to confirm the taxonomic provenance of strain M-43T within the genus Myroides. The overall genome relatedness indices (OGRI) for strain M-43T compared with its most closely related type strains M. odoratimimus subsp. xuanwuensis DSM 27251T, M. profundi D25T, and M. odoratimimus subsp. odoratimimus ATCC BAA-634T, were calculated as 25.3%, 25.1%, and 25% for digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), 83.3%, 83.6%, and 83.4% for average nucleotide identity (ANI) analyses, respectively. The OGRI values between strain M-43T and its close neighbors confirmed that the strain represents a novel species in the genus Myroides. The DNA G + C content of the strain is 33.7%. The major fatty acids are iso-C15:0 and summed feature 9 (iso-C17:1 ω9c and/or 10-methyl C16:0). The predominant polar lipids are phosphatidylethanolamine, an amino-lipid and five unidentified lipids. The major respiratory quinone is MK-6. Chemotaxonomic and phylogenomic analyses of this isolate confirmed that the strain represents a novel species for which the name Myroides oncorhynchi sp. nov. is proposed, with M-43T as the type strain (JCM 34205T = KCTC 82265T)."
Significant Differences in Planktonic Virus Communities Between “Cellular Fraction” (0.22 ~ 3.0 µm) and “Viral Fraction” (< 0.22 μm) in the Ocean,"Compared to free-living viruses (< 0.22 m) in the ocean, planktonic viruses in the “cellular fraction” (0.22 ~ 3.0 μm) are now far less well understood, and the differences between them remain largely unexplored. Here, we revealed that even in the same seawater samples, the “cellular fraction” comprised significantly distinct virus communities from the free virioplankton, with only 13.87% overlap in viral contigs at the species level. Compared to the viral genomes deposited in NCBI RefSeq database, 99% of the assembled viral genomes in the “cellular fraction” represented novel genera. Notably, the assembled (near-) complete viral genomes within the “cellular fraction” were significantly larger than that in the “viral fraction,” and the “cellular fraction” contained three times more species of giant viruses or jumbo phages with genomes > 200 kb than the “viral fraction.” The longest complete genomes of jumbo phage (~ 252 kb) and giant virus (~ 716 kb) were both detected only in the “cellular fraction.” Moreover, a relatively higher proportion of proviruses were predicted within the “cellular fraction” than “viral fraction.” Besides the substantial divergence in viral community structure, the different fractions also contained their unique viral auxiliary metabolic genes; e.g., those potentially participating in inorganic carbon fixation in deep sea were detected only in the “cellular-fraction” viromes. In addition, there was a considerable divergence in the community structure of both “cellular fraction” and “viral fraction” viromes between the surface and deep-sea habitats, suggesting that they might have similar environmental adaptation properties. The findings deepen our understanding of the complexity of viral community structure and function in the ocean."
The global impact of the US–China trade war: firm-level evidence,"This paper documents the impact of the US–China trade war on firms worldwide. Based on data on more than five thousand listed firms in 40 countries, I establish that firms with export exposure to China have had a decline in revenue, profits and capital stocks since the trade war began. This effect is stronger in industries in which China raised tariffs on the US, suggesting that rest of the world exports to China are complements to US exports. At the same time, firms have benefited from export exposure to the US, especially in industries in which the US imposed trade war tariffs on China, implying that rest of the world exports substitute Chinese exports to the US. Supply chain linkages have also played a role: firms in Europe and the Americas in industries selling intermediate inputs to the US have had a relative decline in revenue during the trade war. These impacts have been highly heterogeneous across geographic regions as well as across firms of different sizes."
Predictive factors of collateral vessel development induced by oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy,"Oxaliplatin can lead to hepatic sinusoidal injury, called hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), resulting in portal hypertension-related complications. This could worsen the clinical course of the patients treated with oxaliplatin. Early diagnosis is challenging. We explored predictive markers of oxaliplatin-induced collateral vessels."
Rapid Treatment Using Vacuum-surcharge Preloading with Dynamic Consolidation Method: Laboratory Model Test,"This study presents an experimental investigation of reinforcement effect of dredged fill obtained from the Oufei project of Wenzhou, China using improved method of vacuum-surcharge preloading with dynamic consolidation by five parallel laboratory model tests: four model tests with different tamping energy combinations and a control group of vacuum-surcharge preloading method. The water content after treatment of the vacuum-surcharge preloading method was close to the optimal water content obtained from standard compaction test. The treatment of improved method of vacuum-surcharge preloading with dynamic consolidation can improve reinforcement effect and shorten consolidation time. The tests with higher tamping energy have a higher range of improvement. Under the condition of the identical level of tamping energy, compared with the drop height, the weight of hammer plays a greater role in foundation reinforcement, embodying concretely in water discharge, crater depth, and dissipation of pore water pressure, water content, vane shear strength, and porosity. The findings from this study may benefit the engineering application and further research of the combined method."
The Unequal Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Political Interest Representation,"The COVID-19 pandemic is viewed by many as the biggest global crisis since WWII and had profound effects on the daily lives of people and decision-making worldwide. Using the pandemic as a system-wide agenda shock, we employ a difference-in-differences design to estimate its causal effects on inequalities in political access, and social media prominence among business interests and NGOs. Our argument is twofold. First, the urgency and uncertainty of crises incentivized decision-makers to privilege providing access to business groups over securing inclusivity in the types of interests consulted. Second, NGOs compensated by increasing prominence in public communications. Our analysis of data from over 10,000 interest groups from over 100 countries registered in the European Union supports these hypotheses. Business interests successfully capitalized on the crisis in insider access, while NGOs increased prominence on social media. The results have wider implications for understanding how large-scale crises affect inequalities in representation."
Tip fabrication methods of hollow metal microneedles,"Hollow microneedles can penetrate the corneum of the skin and various biological barriers. Drugs can enter through a minimally invasive path or bodily fluid can be collected from the epidermis or dermis. This makes hollow microneedles (MN) a promising tool for drug delivery and body fluid sensing in a painless manner. Here, we propose a nickel microneedle with a length of 720 µm, an inner diameter of 27 µm, and an outer diameter of 87 µm. To construct the metal hollow microneedle model, we introduce three different manufacturing methods. The three methods are laser cutting, re-dissolution by SU-8 coating, and ultrasonic blade cutting. To verify the penetration capability, the microneedle array was tested to penetrate of the rabbit skin without rupture. The microneedle array was also repeatedly used in a film puncture experiment to verify the reliability of the structure. These microneedles can be combined with syringes and other drug delivery devices to achieve accurate quantitative and controllable flow rates of drug delivery. Through mechanical test and solution delivery test, we demonstrated that the microneedle structure has strong mechanical strength and a controllable rate of drug delivery, which is feasible as a drug delivery device."
Scaling up the sub-50 nm-resolution roll-to-roll nanoimprint lithography process via large-area tiling of flexible molds and uniform linear UV curing,"While roll-to-roll nanoimprint lithography (R2R NIL) can be capitalized in highly scalable fabrication of nanopatterns, preparation of large-area flexible molds remains the main challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that tiling of small-area nanopatterns in a slightly overlapped fashion can provide a practical solution to it; sequentially performing the UV NIL processes onto self-replicable UV-curable resin drops by using a small tile mold can create large-area-tiled molds. We systematically investigated that controlling the tile NIL force and several parameters is crucial to minimize the seams between tiles. We also present that the R2R NIL system can be improved by integrating a linear UV LED module for prompt UV curing before the as-imprinted nanopattern reflows, which is critical for high-resolution, high-quality nanopatterning. By using the tiled mold containing 45 nm-half-pitch nanogratings and operating the UV LED-integrated R2R NIL system, we exemplify that sub 50 nm-resolution nanopatterns can be faithfully created."
Online identification and robust compensation of extended nonlinear time-varying friction model in robotic arms,"Torque loss values resulting from friction in mechanical arm joints and their actuators were identified. Then, using the LuGre friction model and applying the nonlinear least square error estimation method, a more precise model is presented to model its effect. To investigate more efficiently, the general LuGre friction model was used in three forms for modeling the system’s friction. The first model was the common LuGre model, while in the two other extended models, the parameters were considered time-varying that are estimated online. Of note is that the third model also includes the nonlinear viscous term. Then, by utilizing a nonlinear sliding mode controller, simulations were performed for both point-to-point and linear path of the system’s state, and the efficiency of designed algorithm was examined. The results show the advantage of the identified models with time-varying parameters over the constant parameters model. Eventually, a 6R laboratory robot was employed for validation of the proposed algorithm, subsequently validating the simulation results, and as it showed, the final friction model presented better performance."
Numerical study on the leakage characteristics of a stepped labyrinth seal with mixed honeycomb cell diameters,"As the performance improvement of gas turbines becomes marginal, it is required to develop a seal geometry that can reduce unwanted leakage more effectively than conventional seals. Accordingly, in this paper, a new honeycomb structure with improved sealing performance was suggested. The proposed seal is a mixed honeycomb seal (MHS), where honeycomb cells with a smaller diameter (D′) are inserted into the base honeycomb structure with a cell diameter (D) to reduce the effective clearance. To compare the performance of the mixed honeycomb seal and a uniform honeycomb seal (UHS), computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses were performed by altering the pressure ratios and clearance sizes. At the same pressure ratio and clearance size, the MHS shows a performance improvement of up to 19 % (i.e., less leakage flow rate) compared to the UHS. In addition, the effects of D and D′ on the leakage performance were examined through a parametric study."
Analysis of electrochemical machining characteristics using electrode tools fabricated by 3D printing,"Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology can be used to easily and rapidly produce complex shapes. In this study, an electrode tool used for electrochemical machining (ECM) was fabricated using a 3D fused deposition modeling (FDM) printer. The electrode tool was made from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), a low-cost material commonly used in 3D printing. Since the electrode printed with ABS material is non-conductive, additional conductive coating was applied to the tool surface. Electrical conductivity characteristics and coating thicknesses were analyzed with respect to the number of coatings to identify optimal coating conditions. The ECM performance of the fabricated electrode was then compared with that of a conventional copper electrode tool. The effect on the shape of the 3D printing electrode during machining according to the type of coating was analyzed. The thermal effect of the current applying had to be considered, and a suitable coating type was selected based on the experimental results. The fabricated ECM electrode can achieve significant machining quality to the existing electrode performance, and through the results of this study, it was possible to increase sustainability in the manufacturing industry with advanced machining technology."
Influence of electro-thermal probe tip shape on thin liquid layer evolution and penetration speed in glaciers,"This study numerically investigates the dynamic behavior and heat transfer characteristics of electro-thermal drilling probes with five probe-tip shapes by analyzing the evolution of thin molten liquid layers. Commercial code ANSYS Fluent (v.20.2) was used to simulate the melting process with the dynamic mesh technique and estimate the probe velocity for different probe-tip shapes through energy conservation between the heating power and melting rate of surrounding ice. The results revealed that using the cone-shaped probe tip allowed the probe to move faster than the flat or round tip shapes because its molten liquid mass flow rate was higher than the rates of other tip shapes. Moreover, the fastest penetration was achieved using a 30° cone probe tip with the lowest heat flux because the liquid layer thickness and thermal resistance were the smallest."
Neuro-fuzzy modelling methods for relative density prediction of stainless steel 316L metal parts produced by additive manufacturing technique,"Two machine learning (ML) methods, adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks (ANN) have been implemented to predict the relative density (RD) of stainless steel 316L parts which are produced in additive manufacturing (AM) machines. The objective of this paper was to create ML models adapted for AM technique to verify the generalized model that predicts RD with the least error. Some important process parameters in AM such as scanning speed, laser power, hatch distance and layer thickness were picked as input and RD was set as output. Effects of the input parameters on RD were discussed and they were represented in the form of surface plots. It has been found that ANN method’s convergence rate was better than that of ANFIS method, which confirms that usage of neural networks is a better choice than the usage of fuzzy reasoning in modelling AM technique."
Separating machining errors of S-shaped samples based on the comprehensive error field of five-axis machine tools,"In the present study, a new method is proposed to separate machining errors of a 5-axis machine tool with a double turntable. Moreover, a high-precision compensation model is established to calculate machining errors of thin-walled parts in a 5-axis machine tool. In this regard, a comprehensive error model of the S-shaped sample part considering geometric, thermal, and machining errors is established. Then based on the homogeneous transformation matrix, the geometric error models of translational axes and the A and C axes of the rotation axis are established. Accordingly, geometric errors of each motion axes are identified and measured. Meanwhile, the thermal error of the spindle is measured, and the thermal error model of the machine tool along X/Y/Z directions is established using the multiple linear regression method. Finally, the S-shaped sample is processed and the on-machine measurement of the sample surface is carried out. Based on the obtained machining error from the separation method, the distribution of the total surface error at different curvatures of the S-shaped sample is analyzed, and the distributions of geometric and thermal errors of the machine tool are obtained. It is found that when the geometric and thermal errors of the machine tool are compensated, the measured machining error of each point of the S-shaped sample can be reduced by 10–15 µm compared with that before compensation."
Analysis of dual phase-lag heat conduction in the cornea subjected to laser irradiation,"The thermal effects occurring in a cornea subjected to short-pulsed laser irradiation during laser thermokeratoplasty are theoretically investigated. The dual phase-lag model is developed to describe the transient bioheat transfer. The model is solved analytically using finite Fourier transform and the method of variation of parameters. The computational results for the corneal temperature distribution, time-dependent temperature evolution, and thermal damage are obtained and the effects of various model parameters on the temperature profile and temperature variation with time are illustrated and discussed."
Effects of isolator length on pseudo-shock wave in a rectangular duct,"The scramjet isolator length is a very important influence factor on the stability of scramjet engines. The effects of the isolator length on the pseudo-shock wave (PSW) were studied through a numerical method. The steady and unsteady PSW characteristics were analyzed to explore the influence mechanism of the isolator length. The numerical model was validated with the existing experimental results, and the validation results show that the numerical model has high accuracy. The effects of the structural variation of the PSW on self-excited oscillation were explored at different isolator lengths. Result shows that increasing the isolator length increases the length of the PSW. The leading shock becomes stable with the increasing of PSW length, and the following shocks become unstable. This phenomenon indicates that the unsteady characteristics of self-excited oscillation are closely related to the PSW structure. The influence mechanism of isolator length is represented by the amplitude difference of the leading and following shocks caused by the PSW structure variation."
Research on fault diagnosis of rolling bearing based on the MCKD-SSD-TEO with optimal parameters,"To address challenges in fault diagnosis of rolling bearing caused by great noise contamination and difficult extraction of fault character frequency, a fault diagnosis method of rolling bearing based on the maximum correlation kurtosis deconvolution (MCKD), singular spectral decomposition (SSD) and teager energy operator (TEO) with optimal parameters was proposed in this study. First of all, denoising was performed as a preprocessing to the original vibration signals which were collected by using the MCKD with optimal parameters to highlight the impact component. Next, SSD was performed to the preprocessed signals and the optimal components were selected according to variance contribution. Finally, the energy spectra of optimal components were calculated and characteristic frequency was extracted to realize fault diagnosis of bearing. Through simulation and experimental analysis, the proposed method was proved feasible. It was further compared with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), which proved superiority and validity of the proposed method."
Free in-plane vibration of thin-walled rings with elastic supports,"The free in-plane vibration of a thin-walled ring with elastic supports is investigated in this work. These supports are represented as linear springs in radial, tangential, and torsional directions to mimic bolt supports in the real world. With the Euler-Bernoulli theory and the assumption of inextensibility, the natural frequency and mode shape are obtained. Finally, the effects of model parameters such as radius-to-thickness ratio and support stiffness are studied. The model is verified by comparing results against available publications on simpler boundary conditions."
Root cause detection of leakage in check valves using multi-scale signal analysis,"Check valves are key components required to ensure that fluid flows in one direction. Internal cross-port leakage is a common fault that affects the service performance of check valves. Cross-port leakage occurs due to defects in the valve spool. Early detection of this fault and its root cause is important to prevent downtime and subsequent costs. This research presents a multi-scale signal enhancement method based on spool impact and pressure signal analysis for leakage identification and its root causes. The impact signals obtained by accelerometers attached to the valve body are segmented from the entire vibration signal to capture the variations in the inherent characteristics of the valve. Subsequently, wavelet packet decomposition and reconstruction are performed to extract the energy distribution and energy entropy of signals. The time-frequency domain is used to extract features for leakage identification faults. Correlation analysis was applied to select 45 sensitive features out of 105 features. The performance of the method was verified using the RCYCS-G experimental hydraulic platform, and the recognition rate of four modes was found to be 100 % accurate. The proposed method accurately identifies the root causes of leakage in the check valve, lays a foundation for leakage rate prediction, and has significant engineering application value in predictive maintenance."
Computation and optimization of rack and pinion steering mechanism considering kingpin parameters and tire side slip angle,"In this paper, the parameter optimization and error analysis of the rack and pinion steering mechanism are carried out on the basis of considering the influence of kingpin parameters. The steering characteristic equation describing the motion of the steering mechanism is calculated by analyzing the spatial geometrical relationship between the wheel and kingpin and unifying the projection relation between the kingpin and the equivalent steering trapezoid. The ideal Ackermann equation is modified by the Ackermann rate and the kingpin parameters. The modified Ackermann equation is used as the objective function. The segmented fitness function and the evaluation function with weighted factors are designed. A genetic algorithm containing the three functions is used to optimize the parameters of the steering characteristic equation. The error analysis of the numerical example shows that the accuracy of steering trapezoid structure parameters, steering characteristic equation, and Ackermann equation is improved compared with that before optimization."
Multi-objective optimization design of flexible positioning platform considering its natural frequency and mass,"In this paper, the ultra-high acceleration macro-micro motion platform flexible positioning platform is taken as the research object. First, the finite element modal analysis is performed using the finite element technique, and the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the flexible positioning platform are obtained. Then, using the response surface optimization design method, the low-order natural frequency of the flexible positioning platform is increased, and its mass is decreased. Finally, the experimental modal analysis of the flexible positioning platform is carried out, and the experimental modal parameters of the flexible positioning platform are calculated. The experimental results are basically consistent with the finite element analysis results, which verify the accuracy of the finite element modal analysis. The research results are of great significance to the development of the ultra-high acceleration macro-micro motion platform."
Phenotyping Drought-Induced Morpho-Physiological Changes and Genetic Diversity Among Pigeon Pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) Genotypes,"Drought stress at reproductive stages is mainly responsible for low yield in pigeon pea especially in semi-arid regions. Understanding genetic makeup at the phenotypic and genotypic level for stress tolerance-related traits is critical for the selection of diverse parental lines and in designing the breeding program for genetic enhancement of the crop. In view of this, we assessed the responses of different pigeon pea genotypes under irrigated and drought stress conditions for two consecutive years through morpho-physiological characterization and genotyping using SSR markers for assessing diversity at the genomic level. The study revealed high genetic diversity for morpho-physiological traits of which photosynthesis and water use efficiency were found to be useful in screening for drought tolerance. Cluster and PCoA analysis revealed diverse genotypic groups by stress tolerance and maturity duration. Genotyping using genic and genomic SSRs revealed 109 unique alleles with an average of 2.09 alleles per marker with the average polymorphic information content (PIC) value of 0.28 and a range of 0.09 to 0.60 between genotypes. This study helped in identifying diverse genotypes with stress tolerance and provide an insight for the selection of parental lines for using them in the genetic enhancement program in pigeon pea."
The creation objection against timelessness fails,"In recent years Mullins and Craig have argued that there is a problem for a timeless God creating, with Mullins formulating the argument as follows:"
Becoming anonymous: how strict COVID-19 isolation protocols impacted ICU patients,"In this article, I provide phenomenological reflections on patients’ experiences of undergoing extreme isolation protocols while admitted to Intensive Care Units [ICU] during the first wave of COVID-19. Based on observation studies from within the patient isolation rooms and retrospective, in-depth phenomenological interviews with patients, I characterize this exceptional experience as one of becoming anonymous. To illustrate this, I start by establishing a perspective on embodied existence as constituted on a scale between anonymous embodiment and being enrooted into a personal niche. Against the backdrop of this framework, I illustrate how being admitted to the ICU under strict isolation protocols produced extraordinary experiences of becoming anonymous. Sources of the anonymization were: (1) Mechanical expropriation, pacification and disownership of the visceral-kinaesthetic body; (2) Objectification; (3) Spatial and intercorporeal anonymity (4) Surrealism: the intermingling of objective impressions and dream-like interpretations. Finally, I illustrate how anonymization induced an experience of embodiment as raw materiality, confronting the patient with what Martin Heidegger called the facticity of naked existence. This experience is discussed against Levinas’ critique of Heidegger, while I propose that insights from this exceptional case may substantiate Heidegger’s account."
Self-templating construction of hollow microspheres assembled by nanosheets with exposed active planes for sodium ion storage,"P2-type layered metal oxides have been considered as one of the promising cathode candidates for high-performance Na-ion batteries (SIBs). However, it is still challenging to balance the contradiction of high energy density and long cycle life due to the structural degradation and sluggish ion diffusion dynamics. Here, the hierarchical P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 hollow microspheres assembled by nanosheets are constructed via a self-template approach. The obtained nanosheets with more exposed electrochemical active planes serving as desodiation/sodiation reactors can provide substantial Na+ channels, shorten the diffusion pathways, and accommodate the volume changes during charge/discharge process. Benefiting from the facile Na+ diffusion paths and optimal architecture modulation, the cathode delivers a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 96.0% with a high energy density of 299.7 Wh·kg−1. The highly reversible structural evolutions processes are verified by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement, which would significantly improve the cycle stability (83.3% capacity retention at 1.0 C over 500 loops). Furthermore, the full cell assembled by hard carbon presents a high reversible capacity of 71 mAh·g−1 at 0.2 C and promising capacity retention (91.5% after 50 cycles). The designing concept of morphological configuration in this work paves an accessible route for building high-performance electrode materials."
Geographical representation of editorial boards: a review in the field of library and information sciences,"Diversity of editorial boards of academic journals has recently become one of the most frequently discussed topics in scientific communication. Diversity of editorial board is considered to be an important element affecting the journal, the field and the region in terms of the number and diversity of publications. In parallel with this increasing awareness in the academic circles, many studies on diversity in the literature at both the field and journal levels have been carried out. In this study, the editorial boards of academic journals in the field of Library and Information Sciences were analyzed in terms of accommodating geographical representation, and the effect of such diversity, if any, on the number of publications was investigated. The data set consisted of the journals in the mentioned field in the SCImago web page Journal Rankings. The analyzes were carried out based on 6126 persons registered to 212 journals, including chief editors. The findings of the study showed that 75.11% of all members of editorial boards were from North American and European countries. While Asian countries (Central and South Asia, and East and Southeast Asia) were represented by 13.16% in journals in the field of Library and Information Sciences. A linear correlation was found between the regions where the chief editors of the journals were registered and the assignments of the editorial boards. Moreover, a linear correlation was found between the editors of journals (chief editors and other editors assigned to boards) and the scientific outputs (citable documents, citations, and h-index) in terms of regional relationship. The consistency of the results with those of other studies in the literature clearly demonstrates a need for more transparent processes in academic publishing. A policy to ensure a fair and diverse representation in boards of journals features numerous multifaceted positive effects."
"Female author representation differs between journals from the United States of America, Europe, and Asia: a 10-year comparison of five medical disciplines","To provide information for targeted support of female scientists, the objective of this study was to evaluate how female authors are represented in journals of five medical disciplines with varying rates of female physicians from the United States of America (USA), Europe, and Asia. For this retrospective bibliometric study 15 representative gynecologic, pediatric, radiologic, urologic, and surgical journals from the USA, Europe, and Asia were selected from the Web of Science database. From these, all n = 24182 publications of the years 2007/2008 and 2017/2018 were included. Gender and affiliations were assigned to first and senior authors using a software (Gender API, Passau, Germany), native speakers, and a web-based search. For statistics mixed logistic and multinomial logistic regression were applied. In pediatrics, radiology, and urology, highest female first and senior author shares were consistently found in journals from the USA. In European journals proportions across all disciplines tripled (odds ratio 2.96 [95% CI 2.60–3.37], P < .0001). Asian journals showed three-times fewer female authorships than journals from the USA or Europe and the smallest increase (1.36 [1.11–1.66], P = .0026). Compared to the proportion of female physicians within each specialty, female first authors remained underrepresented in Asian journals and female senior authors in journals of all regions. In journals from the USA most female authors originated from institutes within the USA (36.2%), in European journals from the USA (21.1%) or Europe (21.7%). Women from Asian institutes were worst represented in journals of all regions with lowest rates in Asian journals (9.4%). In conclusion female first authors remained underrepresented in Asian journals, female senior authors and women from Asian institutes in journals from all regions. Programs for gender equality in science are thus particularly necessary to support female senior authors, for Asian journals, and women from Asian institutes."
Do Ethnic-Racial Identity Dimensions Moderate the Relations of Outgroup Discrimination and Ingroup Marginalization to Self-esteem in Black and Latinx Undergraduates?,"Guided by social identity and intergroup theory, we tested how two facets of ethnic-racial identity—felt typicality (perceived similarity to other ingroup members) and ingroup ties (felt closeness to other ingroup members)—potentially buffer the negative effects of outgroup discrimination and ingroup marginalization on self-esteem. Participants included 407 Latinx (65%) and Black (35%) undergraduates (Mage = 24.72 years, 79% women, 21% men) who completed an online survey. Our analyses yielded three key findings. First, both outgroup discrimination and ingroup marginalization predicted lower self-esteem; however, this association was significantly stronger with ingroup marginalization than outgroup discrimination. Second, the association between ingroup marginalization and self-esteem was reduced when ethnic-racial identity variables were controlled. Felt ethnic-racial typicality additionally moderated the association between ingroup marginalization and self-esteem—whereby the negative association was stronger when individuals felt higher ethnic-racial typicality. Our findings expand understanding of the impact of marginalization and discrimination from those within and outside of one’s ethnic-racial group, respectively. We also discuss the differing roles of ethnic-racial identity when experiencing outgroup discrimination and ingroup marginalization."
Productivity Enhancement in Directed Energy Deposition: The Oscillating Scanning Strategy Approach,"Directed Energy Deposition (DED) is an additive manufacturing process that enables the production of large metal components by melting the feedstock material while being deposited. An improvement of the production speed of this process would further increase its applicability in many industrial fields. The DED building rate is strictly related to the building parameters adopted, in particular to the laser spot diameter, which also affects the build accuracy and the surface quality of the components. The possibility of using a variable laser spot would result in a significant increase in the production rate in bulky zones, while also providing a good surface quality where needed. In the present work, an oscillating scanning strategy was used to create a large apparent laser spot (+ 170% of the nominal value) to produce 316L stainless steel samples via DED. The optimisation of the DED parameters with the oscillating strategy was performed using the single scan tracks (SSTs) approach. The morphologies of the SSTs obtained with different process parameters were assessed and the geometrical features related to the melt pools were analysed in order to select the most suitable X and Z displacements for the production of the cubic samples. The analyses of the cubes revealed that, if the correct overlap among nearby scans is selected, it is possible to obtain dense samples with all the oscillating diameters tested. Finally, comparing the building rate and powder efficiency values confirmed that this method can accelerate the building process and improve its overall performance."
Simultaneously Enhancing the Strength and Ductility of Spin-Extruded 2195 Al–Li Alloy by Grain Configuration Tunning,"Stiffened cylindric components made by traditional block-welding processes are severely limited by their poor mechanical properties. Here, we present a novel spin-extrusion forming (SEF) process for manufacturing 2195 Al–Li alloy weld-free stiffened components. The grain configuration of 2195 Al–Li alloy was first tuned by different annealing temperatures and subsequently modified by SEF and T8 treatments. The evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties of the stiffened cylindric component is studied in detail. The results show that the initial grain structure with large proportion of recrystallized grains are transformed into fine equiaxed grains after SEF, and the hardness is increased. After T8 treatment, the sample with higher proportion of deformed grains have the highest peak-aging hardness and the shortest peak-aging time due to grain boundary strengthening. However, T1 phases are enriched at the grain boundaries after T8 treatment, resulting in precipitation-free zones and thus lowering the strength and elongation of the samples. In clear contrast, the samples consist largely of recrystallized grains achieves the highest tensile strength (602.1 MPa) and elongation (7%), simultaneously improving the strength and ductility of the spin-extruded 2195 stiffened cylindric component."
Assessment of Trees Outside Forest (TOF) in Urban Landscape Using High-Resolution Satellite Images and Deep Learning Techniques,"Accurate assessment of Trees outside forest (TOF) is an essential input for the management and preservation of these vast resources, due to their importance in carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. Many studies have demonstrated the use of High-resolution satellite (HRS) imageries for mapping and monitoring of TOF in urban and rural landscapes. The conventional per-pixel classifier is not a suitable option for HRS data classification, owing to inherent high intra-class variability and high interclass similarity. In the present study, a convolution neural network-based approach was employed for TOF mapping using HRS images, predominantly in the urban landscape of Bengaluru city, India. We developed a semi-automated procedure for the generation of labelled training samples using object-based image analysis (OBIA), minimizing time requirement for input training data preparation for deep learning (DL) model development. These inputs were utilized to develop a DL model for the classification of TOF using U-Net, which is a semantic segmentation-based DL architecture. The results indicated that the model performed well for the classification of urban TOF with an overall classification accuracy of 89.65 percent and an F1 score of 93.03 percent, in comparison with OBIA (overall accuracy of 80.73 percent & F1 score of 86.44 percent). We demonstrated utilisation of a developed methodology for the assessment of TOF in a distinctive urban landscape, which can be extended to agriculture dominated regions in diverse landscapes."
Vijf lessen uit tuchtklachten over de huisartsenpost,"Tussen 2011 en 2022 dienden er 229 tuchtzaken tegen huisartsen op huisartsenposten. Uit de 71 gegrond verklaarde klachten trekken wij 5 lessen voor de individuele patiëntenzorg. De meeste klachten gingen over een gebrek aan medische expertise van de huisarts. Niet het missen van een diagnose was doorslaggevend voor het gegrond verklaren van een klacht, maar de beoordeling van het toestandsbeeld, het handelen daarnaar en de verslaglegging."
Een praktische handreiking voor de eerste lijn bij eetstoornissen,"Huisartsen zijn vaak het eerste aanspreekpunt voor patiënten met eetstoornissen en hun naasten. Deze patiënten moeten snel verwezen worden naar de specialistische zorg, want ze kunnen in levensbedreigende situaties terechtkomen. Daarom is het belangrijk om een gerichte anamnese met lichamelijk onderzoek en aanvullend labonderzoek uit te voeren. Dit levert veel informatie op over het type en de ernst van een eetstoornis. We bieden handvatten voor het signaleren en vroeg detecteren, en de diagnostiek en indicaties voor doorverwijzing naar collega’s in de eerste- en tweedelijnszorg."
Veiligheid van aspirine bij preventie van preeclampsie,"In de tweede lijn schrijven gynaecologen zwangere vrouwen die een hoog risico op pre-eclampsie lopen steeds vaker aspirine voor. De laatste tijd krijgen ook huisartsen regelmatig een verzoek om een aspirinerecept. Maar is aspirine wel veilig voor de (on)geboren baby? Recente publicaties laten zien dat aspirinegebruik tijdens de zwangerschap niet schadelijk is voor het kind. Huisartsen lijken daarom veilig aspirine voor te kunnen schrijven aan een zwangere vrouw, mits daar een indicatie voor is."
Ouderen met subklinische hypothyreoïdie hebben geen baat bij levothyroxine,"Huisartsen weten soms niet goed hoe ze met subklinische hypothyreoïdie (verhoogd TSH, normaal fT4) moeten omgaan. Dit geldt vooral wanneer het om ouderen gaat: ongeveer 1 op de 5 vrouwen boven de 65 jaar heeft deze afwijkende waarden. Sommige huisartsen starten direct met levothyroxinebehandeling en intensief bloedprikken, ook wanneer er geen klachten zijn. Andere huisartsen doen helemaal niets. De NHG-Standaard Schildklieraandoenin­gen voorziet niet in eenduidige aanwijzingen. Zeker nu de huisartsenpopulatie ouder wordt en patiënten thuis hun ­laboratoriumuitslagen kunnen inzien, is er een grote behoefte aan wetenschappelijk onderbouwde adviezen."
Identification of the Active Sites of Platinum-Ceria Catalysts in Propane Oxidation and Preferential Oxidation of Carbon Monoxide in Hydrogen,"Supported platinum catalysts exhibit versatile applications in heterogeneous catalysis while their active sites are identified difficultly due to the structural complexity of solid catalysts. Herein, via a comprehensive microscopic and spectroscopic study using several PtOx/CeO2 catalysts with well-controlled CeO2 morphology, we found that, besides the CeO2 morphology, the structure of supported platinum species over PtOx/CeO2 catalysts is determined by the reaction atmosphere, dominantly forming components of the platinum-ceria solid solution and fine Pt nanoparticles during propane oxidation and preferential oxidation of CO in hydrogen (CO-PROX) reactions, respectively. Catalytic performance of the platinum-ceria catalysts in propane oxidation is tightly associated with the content of metallic Pt sites which is affected by reducibility of platinum-ceria solid solution, whereas the Pt(II) species arising from the Pt-CeO2 interaction coupling with the surface oxygen vacancy concentration of ceria contribute to the CO reactivity in CO-PROX reaction. There results provide insights into the active sites of platinum-ceria catalysts in both reactions and broadens the concept of morphology-dependent catalysis of oxide-based nanocrystal catalysts that varies with the reactions catalyzed."
"The impact of climate change on drought and its adaptation strategies: findings from general circulation models and households in Tien Giang Province, Vietnam","Drought is one of the most frequent and widespread natural hazards in Tien Giang province of Vietnam, which is aggravating under the influence of climate change. As agriculture is the primary economy of the province, it is crucial to understand the influence of climate change on drought severity and how the local farmers perceive and adapt to climate change. Therefore, to examine the impacts of climate change on drought in the Tien Giang province in the Mekong Delta, the present study used three General Circulation Models (GCMs)—ACCESS 1.3, CNRM-CM5, and MRI-CGCM3 under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. In addition, the study evaluated household-level adaptation strategies based on structured questionnaire-based household survey data and focus group discussion. This study finds that the drought will be getting more severe in the future in the province based on using three GCMs and two climate change scenarios. The estimated results of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) show that there would be many potential extreme drought years between 2020 and 2050. The results from the questionnaire survey depicted that the household perception of drought is moderate in the Mekong Delta. The current adaptation measures are sufficient to adapt to moderate drought and can be improved to adapt to more potential extreme drought conditions in the future. This study provides important insights for decision-makers to manage future drought situations in the Mekong region."
Well-being and Distress in University Students with ADHD Traits: the Mediating Roles of Self-Compassion and Emotion Regulation Difficulties,"Tertiary education is particularly demanding for students with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who often struggle with emotion regulation and are at greater risk of internalising disorders compared to their peers. Self-compassion is a skill associated with positive mental health and adaptive emotion regulation that might support students in managing the emotional challenges of studying with ADHD. We examined the relationship between ADHD traits and self-compassion in university students, as well as the mediating role of self-compassion and emotion regulation difficulties in mental health outcomes."
Recurrent fuzzy fractal generated by iterated fuzzy set system with recurrent structure,"The recurrent iterated function system (RIFS) is an extension of the iterated function system (IFS) whose attractor has a global self-similarity. A recurrent fractal, i.e. an attractor of RIFS, has partial self-similarity. A lot of phenomena and images in nature have partial self-similarity rather than global self-similarity. First of all, we introduce a recurrent iterated fuzzy set system (RIFZS) which consists of a RIFS acting on the base space of fuzzy set and a family of grey-level mappings satisfying some conditions. Moreover, using mappings in RIFZS, we define recurrent fuzzy Hutchinson–Barnsley (RFHB) operator and prove that the operator is contractive. The fixed point of the operator is a recurrent fuzzy fractal. Next, we prove collage theorem and some properties of the FHB operator. Finally, we give some examples which show action of the RFHB operator on the fuzzy set and advantage of the recurrent fuzzy fractal over the fuzzy fractal, and extend the RFHB operator to the product of multiple spaces."
Stable and Historic Behavior in Replicator Equations Generated by Similar-Order Preserving Mappings,"One could observe drastically different dynamics of zero-sum and non-zero-sum games under replicator equations. In zero-sum games, heteroclinic cycles naturally occur whenever the species of the population supersede each other in cyclic fashion (like for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game). In this case, the highly erratic oscillations may cause the divergence of the time averages. In contrast, it is a common belief that the most “reasonable” replicator equations of non-zero-sum games satisfy “The Folk Theorem of Evolutionary Game Theory” which asserts that (i) a Nash equilibrium is a rest point; (ii) a stable rest point is a Nash equilibrium; (iii) a strictly Nash equilibrium is asymptotically stable; (iv) any interior convergent orbit evolves to a Nash equilibrium. In this paper, we propose two distinct vast classes of replicator equations generated by similar-order preserving mappings which exhibit stable as well as mean historic behavior. In the latter case, the time averages of the orbit will slowly oscillate during the evolution of the system and do not converge to any limit. This will eventually cause the divergence of higher-order repeated time averages."
Efficiency Improvement of Semitransparent Polymer Solar Cells with Invariable Color Render Index,"The color render index (CRI) and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) are two critical parameters of semitransparent polymer solar cells (PSCs)  which are contradictory. The CRI is strongly dependent on the absorption of the polymer:fullerene active layer. The PCE not only relies on absorption but also on a bulk heterojunction structure. Here, the 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive has been added to PCDTBT:PC71BM blend PSCs to improve the PCE with almost unchanged CRI. Based on the higher boiling point than the host solvent o-dichlorobenzene (ODB) and the better solubility of PC71BM, the device photovoltaic properties with DIO additive were obviously changed. The PCE improvement is attributed to the charge recombination and transportation process which means that the utilization of the absorbed photons is improved. However, this improvement cannot affect the transmitted light. Hence, the CRI of transmitted light is nearly invariable. With 3% v/v DIO, the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) are all increased. Correspondingly, a highest PCE is achieved of 6.15%, while the reference device without DIO only has a PCE of 5.23%. At the same time, the CRI is slightly changed from 82 to 81."
Entanglement and the Path Integral,"The path integral is not typically utilized for analyzing entanglement experiments, in part because there is no standard toolbox for converting an arbitrary experiment into a form allowing a simple sum-over-history calculation. After completing the last portion of this toolbox (a technique for implementing multi-particle measurements in an entangled basis), some interesting 4- and 6-particle experiments are analyzed with this alternate technique. While the joint probabilities of measurement outcomes are always equivalent to conventional quantum mechanics, differences in the calculations motivate a number of foundational insights, concerning nonlocality, retrocausality, and the objectivity of entanglement itself."
Artificial Neural Network Assisted P &O-Based MPPT Controller for a Partially Shaded Grid-Connected Solar PV Panel,"This paper presents an offline trained artificial neural network (ANN)-assisted perturb and observe (P &O) algorithm to track the global maximum power of a solar PV under partial shading conditions. The conventional hill climbing algorithms work very well to extract maximum power under uniform shading conditions, but fails under partial shading conditions. On the other hand, the offline trained ANN can track the power closer to global maximum power point (GMPP) with less oscillations. Hence, two methods are combined to design the MPPT controller for tracking the global maximum power accurately with less oscillations. Initially, ANN predicts the voltage near to the global maximum power point with solar PV voltage and current as the inputs. This predicted voltage from ANN is used as the initial values for the P &O algorithm, and the P &O algorithm is triggered for tracking the actual GMPP. The proposed MPPT controller is validated in the MATLAB/Simulink environment and the performance of the ANN model for the prediction of GMPP is validated with the experimental data sets."
Effect of Cocos nucifera shell powder on mechanical and thermal properties of Mucuna atropurpurea stem fibre-reinforced polyester composites,"This research examined the suitability of Cocos nucifera shell powder (CNSP) as a secondary filler in polyester composites reinforced with Mucuna atropurpurea stem fibre (MAF). The particle size analysis report revealed that the average size of the CNSP was 1265 nm. CNSP density (1530 ± 42.33 kg/m3) was determined with the help of a liquid pycnometer. The chemical analysis of CNSP showed a higher cellulose content (45.21 ± 6.72 wt.%) and a moderate quantity of lignin fraction (26.78 ± 5.11) in the CNSP. From the X-ray diffractogram, the crystallite size (0.75 nm), and crystallinity index (37.57%) of the CNSP were calculated. The thermogravimetric study of CNSP proved that it could be used as a secondary filler in polymer composites where the fabrication temperature is below 200 °C. Atomic force microscopy revealed that CNSP has an average roughness of 9.791 nm. It was found that 30 wt.% MAF-reinforced and 6 wt.% CNSP-filled polyester composites delivered significant tensile strength (130.14 MPa) and flexural strength (140.21 MPa) than other composites with CNSP content of 0, 2, 4, 8, and 10 wt.%. Also, 30 wt.% MAF-reinforced and 10 wt.% CNSP-filled polyester composites showed improved impact strength (22.43 J/m) and hardness (108.22 HRRW). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed the improvement in the maximum degradation temperature after the addition of reinforcement and filler into the polyester resin. A scanning electron microscope was used to inspect the fractured cross section of the 30 wt.% MAF-reinforced and 6 wt.% CNSP-filled polyester composites."
Effects of Heterogeneity and Nonlinearity on Uplift Characteristics of Shallow Horizontal Anchor Plates,"Based on the upper bound theorem of limit analysis and variational principle, the uplift resistance of shallow horizontal anchor plates in heterogeneous soil and three-dimensional failure surface of overlying soil are investigated. The results calculated by the theoretical approach are compared with results of the existing solutions and numerical results obtained by software PLAXIS 3D to verify the validity of the variational analysis. Furthermore, the influence of the heterogeneity and nonlinearity on the uplift characteristics of shallow horizontal anchor plates is discussed. The results show that: (i) Increase in the uplift resistance and expansion of failure range are observed with decreasing nonlinear coefficient m and variation coefficient kt of soil uniaxial tensile strength as well as increasing variation coefficient kc of soil initial cohesion. (ii) Heterogeneity and nonlinearity jointly determine the shape of failure surface. This study enriches the analytical method of anchor plates and has great significance for stability and safety of anchor plates."
Vibratory finishing for the cavity of aero-engine integral casting casing: mechanism analysis and performance evaluation,"Severe casting defects exist on the cavity surface of aero-engine integral casting casing, leading to substandard cleanliness and surface integrity, which restricts the service performance of the casing. The finishing process for the complex cavity of casting casing is one of the technical bottlenecks in aero-engine manufacturing. Vibratory finishing has excellent potential for closed cavities because of the process media’s fluidized nature. In this work, taking the particle separator main casing of turboshaft aero-engine as a practice, based on the principle of vibratory finishing, a new idea of pre-loading the media and changing the spatial posture of the casing was proposed, and processing experiments were carried out. The vibration acceleration of the casing and the dynamic stress generated on the surface were measured, and the unfinished and finished surfaces were analyzed. The dynamic stress on the casing surface is far less than the fatigue strength of aluminum alloy (AlSi7Mg), which proves the feasibility of vibratory finishing for the casting casing. Meanwhile, the collision and scratching of the steel shot caused the surface roughness of the cavity to drop by 2 ~ 4 grades, and most of the carbon elements were removed. The finished surfaces had better surface morphology and cleanliness. Denser oxide film and lower surface roughness significantly improved the service performance of the casing, in which the corrosion resistance and mechanical properties were improved considerably. This process can provide a new approach for cavity finishing of other types of casings."
Reconfigured lightweight model design method for DT-based mechatronics equipment,"Digital twin (DT) technology, as one of the top strategic technology trends for 2020, has received widespread attention and has gradually been widely used in the smart manufacturing field. DT-based mechatronics equipment emphasizes the timeliness of online simulation decision-making and the promptness of model response. However, the established DT model covering all elements of mechatronics equipment involves multi-domain, multi-scale, and multi-dimensional. If this model is directly used for simulation analysis of specific applications, it will make the solution tedious and complicated and bring a waste of computational resources. Motivated by this need, an application-oriented reconfigured lightweight DT model design method for mechatronics equipment is studied in this paper. The method starts with an application-oriented analysis of the system decomposition, decomposition scheme evaluation, and core module identification criteria. Then, the above criteria are used as a guide to identifying the core system modules for this application, and the core system modules are optimized based on the idea of inheritance. Finally, the optimal system modules are validated and analyzed to ensure that the model-solving efficiency is improved as much as possible without losing this model’s necessary behavioral characteristics and dominant effects. A case study of virtual machining dynamic performance test bench (VM-TB) design scheme validation is carried out to show the implementation flow of the proposed method and verify its operability and effectiveness."
A study on variable friction model in cold forging process with zinc phosphate coating,"Friction has always been an urgent problem in metal forming process. Considering the coefficient of friction as a constant in the cold forging process tends to predict a larger stress–strain, this will lead to an inaccurate prediction result. This study takes AISI-1025 carbon steel with zinc phosphate coating as the research object, and a combination of finite element simulations and experiments is used to develope a pressure-dependent variable friction model. On the one hand, as the interface pressure is less than the critical pressure, it is still at a low friction level, and the friction factor can be measured by the sliding friction test; on the other hand, the friction factor is logarithmically increased with the interfacial pressure because of the rupture of the zinc phosphate coating. The variable friction model is then programmed into the finite element software as a subroutine and used to simulate the solid boss extrusion experiment. The predicted results are compared with the pressure-dependent variable friction model, the constant friction model, and the experimental validation results, which demonstrate that the variable friction model has a good prediction of deformation characteristic in cold forging process."
Prevalence of Problem Gambling: A Meta-analysis of Recent Empirical Research (2016–2022),"Gambling is widely considered a socially acceptable form of recreation. However, for a small minority of individuals, it can become both addictive and problematic with severe adverse consequences. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide an overview of prevalence studies published between 2016 and the first quarter of 2022 and an updated estimate of problem gambling in the general adult population. A systematic review and a meta-analysis were carried out using academic databases, Internet, and governmental websites. Following this search and utilizing exclusion criteria, 23 studies on adult gambling prevalence were identified, distinguishing between moderate risk/at risk gambling and problem/pathological gambling. This study found a prevalence of moderate risk/at risk gambling to be 2.43% and of problem/pathological gambling to be 1.29% in the adult population. As difficult as it may be to compare studies due to different methodological procedures, cutoffs, and time frames, the present meta-analysis highlights the variations of prevalence across different countries, giving due consideration to the differences between levels of risk and severity. This work intends to provide a starting point for policymakers and academics to fill the gaps on gambling research—more specifically in some countries where the lack of research in this field is evident—and to study the effectiveness of policies implemented to mitigate gambling harm."
ECU-Net: multi-scale salient boundary detection and contrast feature enhancement U-Net for breast ultrasound image segmentation,"U-Net and its variants show excellent performance in medical image segmentation. However, due to the information loss caused by down-sampling and the blurry boundary of the ultrasound images itself, it is hard to extract and recover boundary information. Additionally, due to the intensity similarity and low contrast between tumor and non-tumor regions in breast ultrasound images, obtaining discriminative features is difficult. So we propose an optimized U-Net breast ultrasound image segmentation model ECU-Net. Firstly, a multi-scale salient boundary detection module is proposed to enhance the model’s perception of tumor boundaries. Secondly, a contrast feature enhancement module is proposed to highlight the otherness between tumor and normal tissues. Then we combine the two modules to optimize skip-connection through boundaries completion and contrast information enhancement. Exhaustive experiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets, and experimental results show our ECU-Net performs better than U-Net and its classic variants."
A pre-clinical study to investigate the anti-diabetic potential of p-propoxybenzoic acid as a multi-target inhibitor in streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced type-2 diabetic rats,The study was undertaken to evaluate the anti-diabetic potential of p-propoxybenzoic acid (p-PBA).
Decarbonization scenarios and carbon reduction potential for China’s road transportation by 2060,"The transportation sector is a crucial source of greenhouse gas emissions, and the degree of its low-carbon transformation is closely related to the achievement of China’s carbon neutrality. Based on high-frequency passenger vehicle sales data and motor vehicle real-time monitoring big data, we developed a low-carbon transition planning model of China road transport (CRT-LCTP) to explore the pathways toward carbon neutrality. The study found that although the number of new energy vehicles (NEVs) increased four times from 2016 to 2019, the average annual growth rate of road traffic emissions was still as high as 20.5%. The current transportation electrification may only reduce 0.6% of the total emissions in this sector, and it could be increased to 1.4% if the electricity completely came from clean energy. Under the enhanced policy scenario, the transport sector could peak its carbon emissions at around of 2030, with the peak level being 1330.98 Mt. Transportation electrification along could not meet the climate targets in 2060, and the continued inertia of fuel vehicles will slow the path of the road transport toward carbon neutrality, which depends on the forced elimination of fuel vehicles and more substantive decarbonization measures."
"Influence of Indigenous Herding Activities on the Spatio-temporal Distribution of Reindeer during the Summer-Autumn Period: Case from Yamal, Russia","The movement patterns of domestic reindeer depending on indigenous herding practices were studied using GPS collars. Data were collected during the summer-autumn of 2021 from the private Nenets herd in the South of Yamal Peninsula, Russia. We classified the types of herders’ influence on reindeer and estimated the densities of GPS fixes on pastures in four time periods in June – November. Based on ethnographic data and personal experience of migrating with Nenets, we hypothesized that a long-lasting stay of reindeer at a nomadic campsite is the significant indicator of human influence on a herd. Our GPS data registered that reindeer stayed at campsites significantly longer in July during the peak of insect harassment. This factor determined the maximum level of human control over the herd as shown by the limited distance of dispersal of reindeer from a campsite. By early August, the active phase of bloodsucking insects concludes as does active control of the herd, allowing a return to freer foraging and increased range of movement."
"Compressional tectonics and volcanism: the Miocene-Quaternary evolution of the Western Cordillera (24–26°S), Central Andes","Volcanism in compressional tectonic settings presents several unclear relations, especially between faulting, volcano locations, and local stress fields. The Central Andes comprise one of the most important volcanic provinces in the world, where these relations can be studied. We investigate the Miocene-Quaternary faulting and the tectonic stress evolution of the Western Cordillera of Chile, between 24 and 26°S, and how they dictate the orientation of magma feeding fractures, to understand the relations between deformation and volcanism. We calculated 68 new stress tensors from faults of recognized age and reconstructed magma paths by analyzing the morphostructural characteristics of 130 monogenetic and polygenetic volcanoes of known age. Moreover, we integrated the database with previously published data from the Western Cordillera to carry out a regional comparison. Results allow us to recognize three main volcano-tectonic events. The oldest occurred in the Early Miocene and was characterized by an E-W greatest principal stress (σ1) expressed by N-S-striking reverse faults and NW–SE left-lateral strike-slip faults. Volcanoes belonging to this stage show morphometric characteristics that indicate dominant N-S magma feeding systems. The second event, active during the Upper Miocene-Pliocene, was characterized by NW–SE to NNW-SSE σ1, WNW-ESE right-lateral strike-slip faults, and NW–SE preferential direction of volcanic feeding systems. The last event was active in the Upper Pliocene–Pleistocene, mainly in the northern part of the study area, with N-S to NE-SW normal and right-lateral strike-slip faults with NNE-SSW-trending least principal stress (σ3). Volcanism in this stage is characterized by NW–SE and N-S magma feeding systems. Our results suggest that volcano distribution has been mainly controlled by variations of the stress field related to the growth and collapse of the Puna Plateau. Magma emplacement was mainly guided by fractures parallel to the compression direction, irrespectively of the horizontal stress being σ3 or the intermediate principal stress σ2. Anyway, magma emplacement occurred also through fractures oblique to σ1, along strike-slip faults, or by exploitation of inherited weak structures, such as reverse faults."
Long-term outcomes of endoscopic papillectomy for ampullary adenoma with high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma: a propensity score-matched analysis,Evidence of endoscopic papillectomy (EP) for ampullar adenoma with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or adenocarcinoma is insufficient. Here we investigated the long-term outcomes of the advanced ampullary tumors treated by EP with careful surveillance comparing to subsequent surgery after EP.
Inverse problem estimation of internal heat transfer coefficients in ducts through a time-dependent reciprocity functional method,"The reciprocity function method is presented in this work as a powerful tool for the transient inverse estimation of steady internal heat transfer coefficients in ducts, using only external boundary data. This paper extends our previous results in a sense that transient measurements can now be used to recover a steady heat transfer coefficient without the need to reach the steady-state regime. In this method, only data from the external (accessible) surface are necessary to estimate the unknown function on the internal (inaccessible) surface. Transient temperature measurements taken on the outer surface are used to estimate internal steady heat transfer coefficients in a non-iterative and non-intrusive process. Different profiles for the internal heat transfer coefficient are considered and noisy synthetic measurements are used to verify the method. Results show that the methodology is able to recover these functions in a short computational time, with good accuracy."
Management of temporomandibular joint diseases: a rare case report of coexisting calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition and synovial chondromatosis,"The coexistence of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition (CPP) and synovial chondromatosis (SC) in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is rarely reported. CPP disease (CPPD) is complex arthritis synonymous with excessive pyrophosphate production and variable aberrations in mineral and organic phase metabolism of the joint cartilage, leading to local inundated CPP and crystal deposition of partially deciphered predispositions. Meanwhile, SC is a rare benign synovial joint proliferative disease of unclear etiology and has a low risk of malignant transformation. However, SC manifests severe joint disability and dysfunction because of connective tissue metaplasia of the synovial membrane, which forms cartilaginous nodules with or without calcifications or ossifications. These nodules often detach and form intra-articular loose bodies and very rarely within extraarticular spaces."
Biofilm elimination from infected root canals using four different single files,"Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) is the most commonly isolated bacterium from infected root canals. It is found in the form of a biofilm, which makes it more resistant to antimicrobials, and requires optimal chemomechanical strategies to maximize root canal disinfection."
Development of a yeast whole-cell biocatalyst for MHET conversion into terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol,"Over the 70 years since the introduction of plastic into everyday items, plastic waste has become an increasing problem. With over 360 million tonnes of plastics produced every year, solutions for plastic recycling and plastic waste reduction are sorely needed. Recently, multiple enzymes capable of degrading PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic have been identified and engineered. In particular, the enzymes PETase and MHETase from Ideonella sakaiensis depolymerize PET into the two building blocks used for its synthesis, ethylene glycol (EG) and terephthalic acid (TPA). Importantly, EG and TPA can be re-used for PET synthesis allowing complete and sustainable PET recycling."
Modular co-culture engineering of Yarrowia lipolytica for amorphadiene biosynthesis,"Amorphadiene is the precursor to synthesize the antimalarial drug artemisinin. The production of amorphadiene and artemisinin from metabolically engineered microbes may provide an alternate to plant secondary metabolite extraction. Microbial consortia can offer division of labor, and microbial co-culture system can be leveraged to achieve cost-efficient production of natural products. Using a co-culture system of Y. lipolytica Po1f and Po1g strains, subcellular localization of ADS gene (encoding amorphadiene synthase) into the endoplasmic reticulum, co-utilization of mixed carbon source, and enlargement of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) surface area, we were able to significantly improve amorphadiene production in this work. Using Po1g/PPtM and Po1f/AaADSERx3/iGFMPDU strains and co-utilization of 5 µM sodium acetate with 20 g/L glucose in YPD media, amorphadiene titer were increased to 65.094 mg/L. The enlargement of the ER surface area caused by the deletion of the PAH1 gene provided more subcellular ER space for the action of the ADS-tagged gene. It further increased the amorphadiene production to 71.74 mg/L. The results demonstrated that the importance of the spatial localization of critical enzymes, and manipulating metabolic flux in the co-culture of Y. lipolytica can be efficient over a single culture for the bioproduction of isoprenoid-related secondary metabolites in a modular manner."
Some missed congruences modulo powers of 2 for t-colored overpartitions,"Recently, Nayaka and Naika (Bol Soc Mat Mex 28:66, 2022) proved several congruences modulo 16 and 32 for t-colored overpartitions with \(t=5,7,11\) and 13. We extend their list using an algorithmic technique."
Cardiac adipose tissue volume assessed by computed tomography is a specific and independent predictor of early mortality and critical illness in COVID-19 in type 2-diabetic patients,"Patients with type 2-diabetes mellitus (T2D), are characterized by visceral and ectopic adipose tissue expansion, leading to systemic chronic low-grade inflammation. As visceral adiposity is associated with severe COVID-19 irrespective of obesity, we aimed to evaluate and compare the predictive value for early intensive care or death of three fat depots (cardiac, visceral and subcutaneous) using computed tomography (CT) at admission for COVID-19 in consecutive patients with and without T2D."
"Association between PPARγ, PPARGC1A, and PPARGC1B genetic variants and susceptibility of gastric cancer in an Eastern Chinese population","Previous studies showed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and PPARγ coactivator1 family (PPARGC1A and PPARGC1B) gene single nucleotide variants (SNVs)were strongly associated with cancer susceptibility. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of PPARγ, PPARGC1A, and PPARGC1B variants with the risk of gastric cancer (GC)."
Minimally invasive trans-superior articular process percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy with robot assistance,To compare the clinical outcomes of patients with lumbar disc herniation treated with robot-assisted percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (r-PELD) or conventional PELD under fluoroscopy guidance (f-PELD).
"A New Zealand regional work-related sprains and strains surveillance, management and prevention programme: study protocol","The impact and costs associated with work-related sprains and strains in New Zealand and globally are substantial and a major occupational and public health burden. In New Zealand around one-third of all sprains and strains workers compensation (ACC) claims (2019) are for back injuries, but shoulder and arm injuries are increasing at a faster rate than other sprain and strain injuries (ACC, 2020). A need exists for a change to current approaches to sprains and strains prevention, to more effectively manage this significant and persistent problem in workplaces. Designing out hazards is one of the most effective means of preventing occupational injuries and illnesses. This paper outlines the study protocol of the surveillance, management and prevention programme and describes the utilisation of prevention through design principles in the prevention of work-related sprains and strains in agriculture/horticulture/food production in the Hawkes Bay region of New Zealand."
Strategy to reduce acetic acid in sugarcane bagasse hemicellulose hydrolysate concomitantly with xylitol production by the promising yeast Cyberlindnera xylosilytica in a bioreactor,"The yeast Cyberlindnera xylosilytica UFMG-CM-Y309 has been identified as a promising new xylitol producer from sugarcane bagasse hemicellulosic hydrolysate (SCHH). However, SCHH pretreatment process generates byproducts, which are toxic to cell metabolism, including furans, phenolic compounds, and carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, typically released at high concentrations. This research aims to reduce acetic acid in sugarcane hemicellulose hydrolysate concomitantly with xylitol production by yeast strain Cy. xylosilytica UFMG-CM-Y309 in a bioreactor by strategically evaluating the influence of volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (kLa) (21 and 35 h−1). Experiments were conducted on a bench bioreactor (2 L volumetric capacity) at different initial kLa values (21 and 35 h−1). SCHH medium was supplemented with rice bran extract (10 g L−1) and yeast extract (1 g L−1). Cy. xylosilytica showed high xylitol production performance (19.56 g L−1), xylitol yield (0.56 g g−1) and, maximum xylitol-specific production rate (μpmáx 0.20 gxylitol·g−1 h−1) at kLa value of 21 h−1, concomitantly slowing the rate of acetic acid consumption. A faster acetic acid consumption (100%) by Cy. xylosilytica was observed at kLa of 35 h−1, concomitantly with an increase in maximum cellular growth (14.60 g L−1) and reduction in maximum xylitol production (14.56 g L−1 and Yp/s 0.34 g g−1). This study contributes to pioneering research regarding this yeast performance in bioreactors, emphasizing culture medium detoxification and xylitol production."
Integrative Bioinformatics Analysis of mRNA Expression Profiles of Mice to Explore the Key Genes Involved in Crim1 Mutation-Induced Congenital Cataracts,"Crim1 has been implicated in cataracts in mice and is of great importance in the development of the eye in both humans and mice. Therefore, we aimed to clarify how Crim1 mutations affect lens development and the molecular mechanism of cataracts in mice through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. The microarray chip was downloaded from the GEO database to obtain the gene expression profile data set. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using the limma package. GO and KEGG analyses of DEGs were performed using the DAVID database. Then, we established the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network in Cytoscape. Next, we used MCODE to analyze the data. We obtained 750 DEGs in total, including 407 upregulated DEGs and 343 downregulated DEGs. GO analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly related to biological processes, such as apoptosis, cell translation and the immune system. KEGG analysis showed that the enriched functions and pathways were related to the processing and presentation of ribosomes, lysosomes, and antigens. We identified 18 HUB genes, among which four core genes, C1qa, C1qb, C1qc, and Cd74, were closely related to congenital cataracts induced by Crim1 mutation. This study reveals the molecular pathogenesis of congenital cataracts induced by Crim1, and this information is expected to facilitate clinical genetic testing, molecular diagnosis, prognosis, and individualized chemotherapy for congenital cataracts (CC)."
High-Performance a-Si Clustering Nanohole Arrays for Solar Photovoltaics,"The thin-film solar cells are good candidate for clean, cheap and unlimited energy sources. The main issue of this generation of solar cells is the low conversion efficiency. In this work, a new arrangement of nanoholes is used to improve the efficiency of thin-film a-Si solar cell with the thickness of 550 nm. It demonstrated that the designed clustering nanohole has better average absorption than the conventional array nanoholes, and in the filling fraction of 38.9%, as the optimum amount for clustering nanohole, the average absorption reaches to 96%, this is equal to 88% for array nanoholes in the optimum filling fraction of 60%. The clustering nanohole, by efficient coupling between the excited waveguide modes and the incident light can be improved the short-circuit current density from 13.03 mA/cm2 to 21.65 mA/cm2. For more enhancement, SiO2 film is used on the top surface of the cell as an anti-reflection coating, and in this case, the short-circuit current density and conversion efficiency can be reached to 23.13 mA/cm2, and approximately 13%, respectively."
Synthesis of N-isopropyl acrylamide copolymerized acrylic acid caped with Dibenzo-18-crown-6 composite for selective separation of Co-60 radioisotope from radioactive liquid waste containing Cs-137,"A new selective polymeric composite capped with crown ether was successfully synthesized using N-isopropyl acrylamide copolymerized acrylic acid paired with Dibenzo-18-crown-6, P(NIPAm-Co-AA-DB 18C-6), by Gamma irradiation and ultrasonic homogenizer polymerization. Scanner electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and dynamic light scattering were used to characterize the selected polymeric composite's chemical and physical constitution. SEM shows a rough irregular surface, and FTIR spectra confirmed the function groups of P(NIPAm-Co-AA-DB 18C-6). Moreover, a systematic study of monomer and crown ether concentration was investigated to enhance the composite's performance. The behavior of the synthetic composite toward the selective separation of Co-60 from Cs-137 in a binary system was evaluated. Effects of pH, contact time, and initial ion concentration were investigated in a batch mode and the maximum capacity reached 108.0 mg/g for Co-60 and 82.0 mg/g for Cs-137. Four Kinetic models were investigated (pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich, and Intra-particle diffusion). Regarding the calculated parameters, pseudo-second-order and Elovich models are the most describing the sorption process, indicating the chemisorptions process. Six adsorption isotherms were examined, two-parameter models (Langmuir, and Freundlich) and three-parameter models (Redlich-Peterson, Khan, Sips, and Hills). The best-fitted isotherm was identified using three error methodological approaches: the correlation coefficient (R2), the chi-square test (χ2), and the root-mean-square error. Isotherm models fit the experimental values in the following sequence: Khan > Rdlish-Peterson > Hills > Sips. Finally, an application for column separation was conducted, and Co-60 was completely separated from Cs-137 by 0.1 M HNO3. These findings indicate promising applications in the successive separation of Co-60 from radioactive liquid waste containing Cs-137 from Egyptian reactors."
Spatial and temporal cooccurrence among Neotropical native coccinellids and the exotic Harmonia axyridis,"Coccinellids are important biological control agents and aphid predators in horticultural crops around the world. Neotropical Cycloneda sanguinea, Eriopis connexa and Coleomegilla quadrifasciata octodecimpustulata, and the exotic Harmonia axyridis (all Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), are predators that mainly feed on aphids. In this work we described the abundance of these coccinellid species and their spatial and temporal cooccurrence in agroecological eggplant crop of Argentina. We also estimate the intensity and symmetry of the intraguild predation between C. quadrifasciata octodecimpustulata and the other species in laboratory experiments. Both temporal and spatial segregation was observed. H. axyridis was the strongest intraguild predator in the interaction with C. quadrifasciata octodecimpustulata, and this latter was the strongest intraguild predator in interaction with C. sanguinea and E. connexa. In this context, native coccinellid species would be vulnerable to the exotic and invasive H. axyridis; however, the lack of cooccurrence of this species with the native ones, under conditions of low density of extra-guild prey would indicate that spatial segregation could be the mechanism by which these species coexist in the eggplant crop."
"Bacillus pinisoli sp. nov., Isolated from Soil of a Decayed Pine Tree","A Gram-stain-positive, rod-shaped, facultatively anaerobic, motile and spore-forming bacterium with multiple flagella designated GXH0341T was isolated from the soil associated with decayed pine tree samples collected from Weizhou Island, Beihai, Guangxi, China. Growth occurred at 4–37 °C (optimum 30 °C), at pH 5.0–11.0 (optimum 8.0) and in the presence of 0–7% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 2%). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain GXH0341T was most closely related to Bacillus mesophilus DSM 101000 T (98.9%), followed by Bacillus salitolerans KC1T (96.95%) and Margalitia shackletonii DSM 18435 T (96.67%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain GXH0341T represented a separate lineage within the genus Bacillus. Peroxidase is positive. The predominant quinone was MK-7 and the cell-wall diagnostic diamino acid was meso-diaminopimelic acid. The predominant polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and two unidentified phospholipids. The major fatty acids are iso-C14:0, iso-C15:0, anteiso-C15:0 and iso-C16:0. The genome of GXH0341T comprises the biosynthetic gene cluster for T3PKS, terpene, lassopeptide and RRE-containing element as secondary metabolites. The average nucleotide identity values and the digital DNA-DNA hybridization values between GXH0341T and B. mesophilus DSM 101000 T were 78.22% and 21.00%, respectively, which were in the range of the recommended level for interspecies identity. The results of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic analyses clearly indicated strain GXH0341T represents a novel species of the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus pinisoli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GXH0341T (= MCCC 1K07157T = JCM 35212 T)."
SHARP: Shape-Aware Reconstruction of People in Loose Clothing,"Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled 3D human body reconstruction from a monocular image, which has broad applications in multiple domains. In this paper, we propose SHARP (SHape Aware Reconstruction of People in loose clothing), a novel end-to-end trainable network that accurately recovers the 3D geometry and appearance of humans in loose clothing from a monocular image. SHARP uses a sparse and efficient fusion strategy to combine parametric body prior with a non-parametric 2D representation of clothed humans. The parametric body prior enforces geometrical consistency on the body shape and pose, while the non-parametric representation models loose clothing and handles self-occlusions as well. We also leverage the sparseness of the non-parametric representation for faster training of our network while using losses on 2D maps. Another key contribution is 3DHumans, our new life-like dataset of 3D human body scans with rich geometrical and textural details. We evaluate SHARP on 3DHumans and other publicly available datasets, and show superior qualitative and quantitative performance than existing state-of-the-art methods."
CircUBE3B High Expression Participates in Sevoflurane-Induced Human Hippocampal Neuron Injury via Targeting miR-326 and Regulating MYD88 Expression,"The clinical application of Sevoflurane (Sevo) brings about non-negligible neuron injury, leading to postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). However, related pathogenesis is complex and not fully established. We aimed to disclose the role of circRNA UBE3B (circUBE3B) in neuron injury induced by Sevo. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined by CCK-8 and flow cytometry experiments. Inflammation production was monitored by ELISA. The expression of circUBE3B, miR-326, and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) mRNA was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Apoptosis-associated markers and MYD88 protein were quantified by western blot. The putative binding site between miR-326 and circUBE3B or MYD88 was verified by a dual-luciferase reporter experiment, and their binding was validated by a pull-down assay. Sevo treatment weakened cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis and inflammatory response. CircUBE3B expression was elevated in Sevo-treated neurons. Sevo-induced neuron injury was alleviated by circUBE3B downregulation but aggravated by circUBE3B overexpression. MiR-326 was targeted by circUBE3B, and miR-326 inhibition recovered neuron injury that was repressed by circUBE3B absence in Sevo-treated neurons. MiR-326 interacted with MYD88. MiR-326 enrichment attenuated Sevo-induced neuron injury, while these effects were reversed by MYD88 overexpression. CircUBE3B dysregulation was involved in Sevo-induced human hippocampal neuron injury via targeting the miR-326/MYD88 network."
Dihydromyricetin Protects Against Salsolinol-Induced Toxicity in Dopaminergic Cell Line: Implication for Parkinson’s Disease,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although aging is the primary cause, environmental and genetic factors have also been implicated in its etiology. In fact, the sporadic nature of PD (i.e., unknown etiology) renders the uncovering of the exact pathogenic mechanism(s) or development of effective pharmacotherapies challenging. In search of novel neuroprotectants, we showed that butyrate (BUT), a short-chain fatty acid, protects against salsolinol (SALS)-induced toxicity in human neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY5Y cells, which are considered an in-vitro model of PD. Dihydromyricetin (DHM), a flavonoid derived from Asian medicinal plant, has also shown effectiveness against oxidative damage and neuroinflammation, hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we show that pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with DHM concentration-dependently prevented SALS-induced toxicity and that a combination of DHM and BUT resulted in a synergistic protection. The effects of both DHM and BUT in turn could be completely blocked by flumazenil (FLU), a GABAA antagonist acting at benzodiazepine receptor site, and by bicuculline (BIC), a GABAA antagonist acting at orthosteric site. Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a free fatty acid 3 (FA3) receptor antagonist, also fully blocked the protective effect of DHM. BHB was shown previously to only partially block the protective effect of BUT. Thus, there are some overlaps and some distinct differences in protective mechanisms of DHM and BUT against SALS-induced toxicity. It is suggested that a combination of DHM and BUT may have therapeutic potential in PD. However, further in-vivo verifications are necessary."
Multimodality: phantom imaging for superparamagnetic graphene composites using green technology for theranostic nanosystems,"In this research work, the superparamagnetic graphene composites were produced by two parallel co-precipitation processes using the leaf extracts of Melia dubia and Prosopis juliflora. We also replaced the commercial graphite with the low-cost raw bio source, Pennisetum glaucum panicle waste for graphene oxide production. Magnetic nanoparticle with graphene oxide enhances the surface area with functionalization, high loading capacity, and good conductivity. The stability, colloidal dispersivity, particle size range, composition ratio of iron oxide to graphene oxide, and superparamagnetism were characterized by UV–visible spectrophotometer, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersion X-ray (EDX and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), etc. Our composite reported better biocompatibility and cytotoxicity with less than 5% hemolysis of RBCs and up to 1 µg concentration as a safer dosage from the MTT assay. Additionally, biofilm inhibition, antioxidant, and biocompatibility activities were confirmed for statistical significance with a p value (< 0.05) by two-way ANOVA balanced design method and the composite yield parameters were optimized by response surface method using central composite design. These unique properties enabled our sample to attenuate X-ray–CT imaging and MRI phantom imaging with better contrast, almost equivalent to the commercial agents. Thus, our results provide a new avenue for multimodality contrast applications and upon loading with suitable drug it may open up a new path for potential theranostic applications."
Mechanical mechanism of rib spalling and sensitivity analysis of gangue parameters to rib spalling in gangue-bearing coal seams,"Rib spalling is one of the main factors restricting the safe and efficient production of the fully mechanized mining face in gangue-bearing coal seams, and the gangue has significant influence on the occurrence of rib spalling. In this study, the instability process and mechanical mechanism of rib spalling in gangue-bearing coal seams were studied, and the sensitivity of gangue parameters to rib spalling was analyzed. The simulation test of rib spalling under different gangue parameters was carried out by orthogonal tests. The width and depth of rib spalling were taken as evaluation indexes, and the influence of gangue parameters on the rib spalling was analyzed by variance analysis and significance tests. The results show that the failure process of rib spalling is characterized by the fracturing failure of the lower coal body, shear failure of the gangue layer, and the falling off of the upper coal body caused by the gravity; the gangue parameters (thickness, density, joint inclination, and internal friction angle) have an important influence on the sliding instability of the coal wall. In the sensitivity analysis, the influence of gangue parameters on the width of rib spalling is ordered as gangue density > joint inclination > gangue thickness > internal friction angle; the influence of gangue parameters on the depth of rib spalling is ordered as gangue density > joint inclination > internal friction angle > gangue thickness. Besides, the greater the gangue density, the less damage caused by stress concentration, and the lower the risk of rib spalling."
"Removal of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) by zero-valent iron: quantification of removal mechanisms consisting of degradation, adsorption and co-precipitation","The removal mechanisms of carbamazepine (CBZ), which is one of pharmaceutically active compounds, using zero-valent iron (ZVI) were quantified by defining three fractions, namely “degradation”, “adsorption”, and “co-precipitation”. The maximum total organic carbon (TOC) removal was obtained at pH 4. The results demonstrate that the adsorption on the ZVI surface is dominant in the TOC removal of CBZ for 4 ≤ pH ≤ 6 while the degradation by oxidative and reductive reactions is efficient exclusively for pH ≤ 3. TOC removal was not obtained for pH ≥ 8. The most dominant mechanism in the removal of CBZ by ZVI is the adsorption onto the iron oxides/hydroxides layer formed on ZVI surface rather than the degradation by oxidative and reductive reactions including Fenton and Fenton-like reactions for pH ≥ 4. A novel kinetic model for removal of CBZ by ZVI was developed to simulate the dynamic concentration profiles of CBZ, TOC, total Fe ions, and dissolved oxygen linked closely with each other and the contributions of degradation, adsorption, and co-precipitation in TOC removal of CBZ. Reasonable agreement between experimental data and model predictions suggests the applicability of the proposed kinetic model to quantitatively analyze the mechanisms of CBZ removal by ZVI."
Responses of rhizosphere bacterial communities in newly reclaimed mudflat paddies to rice genotype and nitrogen fertilizer rate,"The rhizosphere microbiome plays a vital role in crop growth and adaptation. However, the effects of rice genotype, nitrogen (N) fertilization, and their interactions on the rhizosphere bacterial communities in low fertility soil remain poorly understood. In this study, a two-factor field experiment was performed in newly reclaimed mudflat paddies characterized by poor fertility to analyze bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of Yongyou 2640 (japonica/indica hybrid rice, JIH) and Huaidao No.5 (japonica conventional rice, JC) under different N fertilizer rates. Results showed that genotype, followed by N fertilizer rate, was the primary factor affecting rhizobacteria diversity. Rhizobacteria diversity was higher in JIH than in JC and that of JIH and JC did not significantly change overall as N fertilizer rates but increased and decreased at N fertilizer rates of over 300 kg N ha−1, respectively. The inconsistent response was probably attributed to the difference in the increase of ammonium and/or nitrate in the rhizosphere of JIH and JC. Genotype explained approximately 26% of the variation in rhizosphere bacterial communities. Rhizosphere bacterial communities with N fertilizer rates of over 300 kg N ha−1 were more dissimilar to those without N fertilization relative to those with N fertilizer rates of below 300 kg N ha−1, which was mainly attributed to changes in the concentration of ammonium and/or nitrate. The relative abundances of some potential beneficial genera such as Salinimicrobium, Salegentibacter, Gillisia, and Anaerolinea in the rhizosphere of JC and Salegentibacter, Lysobacter, Nocardioides, and Pontibacter in the rhizosphere of JIH were increased under N fertilizer rates of less than 300 kg N ha−1 and positively correlated with rice yields, which indicate that changes in bacterial communities caused by N fertilization might be strongly associated with the improvement of rice yield. Overall, rhizosphere bacterial communities were more sensitive to genotype in newly reclaimed mudflat paddies and showed a consistent response to N fertilizer rates."
Chloroplast genome skimming of a potential agroforestry species Melia dubia. Cav and its comparative phylogenetic analysis with major Meliaceae members,"Melia dubia Cav. is a fast-growing plywood species gaining popularity due to high economic returns. This study aimed to assemble and annotate the chloroplast (cp) genome of M. dubia and compare it with previously published cp genomes within the Meliaceae family. The chloroplast genome was constructed by the de novo and reference-based assembly of paired-end reads generated by long-read sequencing of genomic DNA. The cp genome, sized 171,956 bp, comprised a typical angiosperm quadripartite structure. The large single-copy (LSC) region of 76,055 bp and a small single-copy (SSC) region of 18,693 bp cover 55% of the genome. The pair of inverted repeats (IRA and IRB) were 38,604 bp each (covering 45% of the genome). We identified unique genes (112), including protein-coding genes (79), tRNA (29) and 4 rRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis using complete cp genomes of 11 species from Meliaceae revealed that M. dubia and M. azedarach shared a sister clade. Comparative analysis using cp genome of M. dubia, M. azedarach and Azadirachta indica revealed a high sequence similarity (> 70%). Five intergenic regions were highly conserved among the three cp genomes. The gene trnG-UCC at LSC region was found to be more divergent in M. dubia and M. azedarach, while it shows complete conservation within M. dubia and A. indica. This is the first report of the chloroplast genome in M. dubia. The available levels of taxonomic expertise and clarity in species delineation within the Melia genus are low. The information generated provides scope for identifying new barcodes which increases the discriminatory power of the species within the genus beyond morphological identification."
"Soil erosion and its causes in high-filling body: A case study of a valley area on the Loess Plateau, China","Large-scale land consolidation projects (LCPs) have been carried out on the Loess Plateau to increase the area of agriculture land. The newly created land is prone to soil erosion under the effects of water and gravity. Taking a typical high-filling body (HFB) formed by LCPs in Yan’an, China as the subject, this study comprehensively investigated the types and causes of soil erosion with multiple methods of field investigation, on-site monitoring and laboratory tests. Results showed that the HFB presented a composite pattern of soil erosion with multiple types mainly including underground erosion, mixed water-gravity erosion, seepage erosion, and scouring erosion. The type of erosion varied spatially in different parts of the HFB depending on the dominant factors, mainly including the groundwater state, rainfall, runoff, gravity action, topography, and soil erodibility. The underground erosion mainly occurred at the positions with higher groundwater level and larger hydraulic gradient, while scouring erosion mainly occurred at the positions with extensive interactions of surface runoff, channel slope gradient and soil properties. And near the leading edge of the top of the slope, a band of mixed water-gravity erosion occurred owing to the effects of water and gravity. In addition, nearly saturated soils at the toe of HFB displayed groundwater exfiltration and slope-face slumping. Based on our findings on the causes and variation of soil erosion for the HFB, we proposed the following erosion prevention and control measures to protect the LCPs on the Loess Plateau: to construct drainage ditches and blind ditches to form a complete drainage system, plant alfalfa on the top platform to increase rainfall interception and reduce surface runoff, set seepage ditches and plant deep-rooted plants at the toe of the slope to improve slope toe stability, monitor groundwater level and slope deformation to learn the erosion dynamics and slope stability, and optimize the geometry of HFB such as the slope gradient and slope steps to reduce soil erosion."
"Family Ties, Social Capital and Small Businesses’ Efficiency. Evidence from the Italian Food Sector","We investigate whether technical efficiency is affected by family involvement in management, considering a sample of small and medium sized firms (SMEs) operating in the traditional manufacturing sector. A positive and significant relationship between family management and efficiency is found when adopting one-step procedures based on Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). Furthermore, according to our results, local social capital seems to moderate the influence of the family involvement on the performance of firms, corroborating the idea that trust and reputational assets associated with family ties can compensate for the lack of cooperative behaviour and social networks characterizing some communities where firms operate."
Implementation of a Peer-Mediated Intervention to Teach Behavioral Expectations for Two Students on Autism Spectrum and a Student with ADHD in an Inclusive Elementary Classroom in Taiwan,"One of the characteristics of individuals on the autism spectrum is the restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviors, interests, or activities which have been considered the result of a direct deficit in self-regulation skills. Peer-mediated intervention (PMI) is one of the ways to support young children on the autism spectrum for following school routines independently. PMI is an evidence-based practice based on behavioral principles to train typical peers to help with students on the autism spectrum. By using PMI, students on the autism spectrum can have more interaction opportunities with typical peers. Students on the autism spectrum can become less dependent on adult support to complete the expectations independently or with peers’ support. The aim of this study is to use PMI to support students with autism and ADHD aged 7–8 in a regular classroom to complete the behavioral expectations in Taiwan. This study used a multiple probe design across three participants to determine the effects of the intervention. The researchers trained seven typically developing peers on how to prompt and reinforce the target children. This study took both peers and target children’s data. The data shows a positive result for target children to follow the expectations independently and most peer models can prompt and reinforce the target children after being trained. Our study has extended the effectiveness and usage of PMI in teaching behavioral expectations in Taiwan."
Reverse engineering for reconstructing baseline features of dry age-related macular degeneration in optical coherence tomography,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most widespread cause of blindness and the identification of baseline AMD features or biomarkers is critical for early intervention. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging produces a 3D volume consisting of cross sections of retinal tissue while fundus fluorescence (FAF) imaging produces a 2D mapping of retina. FAF has been a good standard for assessing dry AMD late-stage geographic atrophy (GA) while OCT has been used for assessing early AMD biomarkers beyond as well. However, previous approaches in large extent defined AMD features subjectively based on clinicians’ observation. Deep learning—an objective artificial intelligence approach, may enable to discover ’true’ salient AMD features. We develop a novel reverse engineering approach which bases on the backbone of a fully convolutional neural network to objectively identify and visualize AMD early biomarkers in OCT from baseline exams before significant atrophy occurs. Utilizing manually annotated GA regions on FAF from a follow-up visit as ground truth, we segment GA regions and reconstruct early AMD features in baseline OCT volumes. In this preliminary exploration, compared with ground truth, we achieve baseline GA segmentation accuracy of 0.95 and overlapping ratio of 0.65. The reconstructions consistently highlight that large druse and druse clusters with or without mixed hyper-reflective focus lesion on baseline OCT cause the conversion of GA after 12 months. However, hyper-reflective focus lesions and subretinal drusenoid deposit lesions alone are not seen such conversion after 12 months. Further research with larger dataset would be needed to verify these findings."
Identifying vital nodes for influence maximization in attributed networks,"Identifying a set of vital nodes to achieve influence maximization is a topic of general interest in network science. Many algorithms have been proposed to solve the influence maximization problem in complex networks. Most of them just use topology information of networks to measure the node influence. However, the node attribute is also an important factor for measuring node influence in attributed networks. To tackle this problem, we first propose an extension model of linear threshold (LT) propagation model to simulate the information propagation in attributed networks. Then, we propose a novel community-based method to identify a set of vital nodes for influence maximization in attributed networks. The proposed method considers both topology influence and attribute influence of nodes, which is more suitable for identifying vital nodes in attributed networks. A series of experiments are carried out on five real world networks and a large scale synthetic network. Compared with CELF, IMM, CoFIM, HGD, NCVoteRank and K-Shell methods, experimental results based on different propagation models show that the proposed method improves the influence spread by \(-2.28\% \, \textrm{to} \, 4.76\%\), \(-2.50\% \, \textrm{to} \, 16.97\%\), \(0.18\% \, \textrm{to} \, 16.07\%\), \(0.22\% \, \textrm{to} \, 41.82\%\), \(0.23\% \, \textrm{to} \, 11.24\%\) and \(10.78\% \, \textrm{to} \, 75.22\%\)."
A pathway analysis-based algorithm for calculating the participation degree of ncRNA in transcriptome,"After sequencing, it is common to screen ncRNA according to expression differences. But this may lose a lot of valuable information and there is currently no indicator to characterize the regulatory function and participation degree of ncRNA on transcriptome. Based on existing pathway enrichment methods, we developed a new algorithm to calculating the participation degree of ncRNA in transcriptome (PDNT). Here we analyzed multiple data sets, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were used for pathway enrichment analysis. The PDNT algorithm was used to calculate the Contribution value (C value) of each ncRNA based on its target genes and the pathways they participates in. The results showed that compared with ncRNAs screened by log2 fold change (FC) and p-value, those screened by C value regulated more DEGs in IPA canonical pathways, and their target DEGs were more concentrated in the core region of the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network. The ranking of disease critical ncRNAs increased integrally after sorting with C value. Collectively, we found that the PDNT algorithm provides a measure from another view compared with the log2FC and p-value and it may provide more clues to effectively evaluate ncRNA."
On the role of tail in stability and energetic cost of bird flapping flight,"Migratory birds travel over impressively long distances. Consequently, they have to adopt flight regimes being both efficient—in order to spare their metabolic resources—and robust to perturbations. This paper investigates the relationship between both aspects, i.e., energetic performance and stability, in flapping flight of migratory birds. Relying on a poly-articulated wing morphing model and a tail-like surface, several families of steady flight regime have been identified and analysed. These families differ by their wing kinematics and tail opening. A systematic parametric search analysis has been carried out, in order to evaluate power consumption and cost of transport. A framework tailored for assessing limit cycles, namely Floquet theory, is used to numerically study flight stability. Our results show that under certain conditions, an inherent passive stability of steady and level flight can be achieved. In particular, we find that progressively opening the tail leads to passively stable flight regimes. Within these passively stable regimes, the tail can produce either upward or downward lift. However, these configurations entail an increase of cost of transport at high velocities penalizing fast forward flight regimes. Our model-based predictions suggest that long range flights require a furled tail configuration, as confirmed by field observations, and consequently need to rely on alternative mechanisms to stabilize the flight."
"Effects of paraprobiotic as replacements for antibiotic on performance, immunity, gut health and carcass characteristics in broiler chickens","This study sought to determine the effects of dietary paraprobiotic (PPB) on broiler chicken performance, immunity, gut health, and carcass traits. A total of 240 day-old CARIBRO Vishal commercial broiler chicks of identical body weight randomly divided into six treatment groups, each with five replicates and eight chicks in each replicate. Six dietary treatments were preapared: T1 = (control diet), T2 = T1 + 0.02% (w/v) chlortetracycline (CTC), T3 = T1 + 0.2% (w/v) PPB, T4 = T1 + 0.4% (w/v) PPB, T5 = T1 + 0.6% (w/v) PPB and T6 = T1 + 0.8% (w/v) PPB, respectively. Body weight gain (BWG) significantly (P ≤ 0.05) increased in the T5 (0.6% PPB) and T6 (0.8% PPB) group. At the same time the feed intake significantly (P ≤ 0.05) decreased and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) significantly (P ≤ 0.05) improved in T5 and T6 group. There was a significant (P ≤ 0.05) increase in cell-mediated immunity and haem-agglutination titre (HA titre) in the 0.6% and 0.8% PPB supplemented groups compare to the control group (T1). The percentage of carcass traits and organ weights did not significantly differ between the PPB-supplemented and control groups, but the percentage of live weight in cut up parts showed a significant improvement (P ≤ 0.05) in the PPB-supplemented group. At 42 days, villus height, width, and crypt depth all significantly (P ≤ 0.05) increased in the groups supplemented with 0.6 and 0.8% para-probiotics (T5 and T6). The results show that para-probiotics can be added to broiler diets at a rate of 0.6% (w/v) to enhance performance, immunity, gut health, and breast yield. The para-probiotic may therefore be a useful substitution for antibiotic growth promoters in the diet of chickens."
Potential biomechanical risk factors on developing lead knee osteoarthritis in the golf swing,"The load on the lead knee joint during a golf swing is greater than that observed during gait. However, current evidence regarding golf swing biomechanics for risks associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA) is limited. Therefore, this study investigated golf swing styles associated with knee adduction and abduction moments, which are considered to be crucial loading regions of the medial and lateral compartments of knee OA, respectively. Thirteen professional male golfers performed five shots using a 5-iron club, and their swings were recorded using a motion capture system with two force platforms for the feet. A regression analysis was performed to calculate the correlation coefficients between the peak knee adduction and abduction moments of the lead leg and varus/valgus angle, toe-out angle, stance width, weight transfer, and shoulder sway. Swinging with a narrower stance width at address (r =  − 0.62, p = 0.02) with more weight shift (r = 0.66, p = 0.014) and shoulder sway (r = 0.79, p = 0.001) towards the target during the downswing were associated with a higher peak knee adduction of the lead leg, whereas a greater valgus angle at address (r = 0.60, p = 0.03) was associated with a higher peak knee abduction of the lead leg. Based on these findings, we anticipate future research to support postural changes, particularly a wider stance width and restricted shoulder sway for golfers who are classified to be at high risk of developing medial compartment knee OA, as well as a lower valgus (tibial medial tilt) angle at address for those classified to be at high risk of developing lateral compartment knee OA."
Variation in heat shock protein 40 kDa relates to divergence in thermotolerance among cryptic rotifer species,"Genetic divergence and the frequency of hybridization are central for defining species delimitations, especially among cryptic species where morphological differences are merely absent. Rotifers are known for their high cryptic diversity and therefore are ideal model organisms to investigate such patterns. Here, we used the recently resolved Brachionus calyciflorus species complex to investigate whether previously observed between species differences in thermotolerance and gene expression are also reflected in their genomic footprint. We identified a Heat Shock Protein gene (HSP 40 kDa) which exhibits cross species pronounced sequence variation. This gene exhibits species-specific fixed sites, alleles, and sites putatively under positive selection. These sites are located in protein binding regions involved in chaperoning and may therefore reflect adaptive diversification. By comparing three genetic markers (ITS, COI, HSP 40 kDa), we revealed hybridization events between the cryptic species. The low frequency of introgressive haplotypes/alleles suggest a tight, but not fully impermeable boundary between the cryptic species."
A Drosophila model of the neurological symptoms in Mpv17-related diseases,"Mutations in the Mpv17 gene are responsible for MPV17-related hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome and Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease. Although several models including mouse, zebrafish, and cultured human cells, have been developed, the models do not show any neurological defects, which are often observed in patients. Therefore, we knocked down CG11077 (Drosophila Mpv17; dMpv17), an ortholog of human MPV17, in the nervous system in Drosophila melanogaster and investigated the behavioral and cellular phenotypes. The resulting dMpv17 knockdown larvae showed impaired locomotor activity and learning ability consistent with mitochondrial defects suggested by the reductions in mitochondrial DNA and ATP production and the increases in the levels of lactate and reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, an abnormal morphology of the neuromuscular junction, at the presynaptic terminal, was observed in dMpv17 knockdown larvae. These results reproduce well the symptoms of human diseases and partially reproduce the phenotypes of Mpv17-deficient model organisms. Therefore, we suggest that neuron-specific dMpv17 knockdown in Drosophila is a useful model for investigation of MPV17-related hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome and CMT caused by Mpv17 dysfunction."
miRNA expression profiles of the perilesional skin of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis patients are highly similar,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis vulgaris (PV) are chronic inflammatory skin diseases with heterogeneous molecular backgrounds. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to either development or regulation of many immune system related diseases. Only few miRNA profiling studies are available for AD and no comparisons between AD and PV skin miRNA profiles have been performed recently. We conducted a miRNA profiling analysis of skin, as well as serum, from adult AD and PV patients and control individuals. 130 miRNAs were differentially expressed in AD skin, of which 77 were common differentially expressed in AD and PV. No differentially expressed miRNAs were detected in serum. Pathway analyses revealed differentially expressed miRNAs to potentially target immune-system related pathways, including TNF-α, IL-2/STAT4 and IL-6/JAK/STAT3. Additional genetic analysis of published AD GWAS dataset detected association of several target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs in skin. Moreover, miR-28-5p, miR-31-5p, miR-378a-3p and miR-203a were validated as upregulated in the skin of AD and PV patients. All validated miRNAs were reliable predictive markers for AD or PV. In conclusion, miRNA expression pattern in the skin of adult AD patients is highly similar to that of PV with multiple differentially expressed miRNAs potentially involved in the regulation of immune responses in AD and PV."
Deep learning-derived cardiovascular age shares a genetic basis with other cardiac phenotypes,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches can now use electrocardiograms (ECGs) to provide expert-level performance in detecting heart abnormalities and diagnosing disease. Additionally, patient age predicted from ECGs by AI models has shown great potential as a biomarker for cardiovascular age, where recent work has found its deviation from chronological age (“delta age”) to be associated with mortality and co-morbidities. However, despite being crucial for understanding underlying individual risk, the genetic underpinning of delta age is unknown. In this work we performed a genome-wide association study using UK Biobank data (n=34,432) and identified eight loci associated with delta age (\(p\le 5 \times 10^{-8}\)), including genes linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) (e.g. SCN5A) and (heart) muscle development (e.g. TTN). Our results indicate that the genetic basis of cardiovascular ageing is predominantly determined by genes directly involved with the cardiovascular system rather than those connected to more general mechanisms of ageing. Our insights inform the epidemiology of CVD, with implications for preventative and precision medicine."
"Identification and analysis of odorant receptors expressed in the two main olfactory organs, antennae and palps, of Schistocerca americana","Locusts depend upon their sense of smell and provide useful models for understanding olfaction. Extending this understanding requires knowledge of the molecular and structural organization of the olfactory system. Odor sensing begins with olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), which express odorant receptors (ORs). In insects, ORNs are housed, in varying numbers, in olfactory sensilla. Because the organization of ORs within sensilla affects their function, it is essential to identify the ORs they contain. Here, using RNA sequencing, we identified 179 putative ORs in the transcriptomes of the two main olfactory organs, antenna and palp, of the locust Schistocerca americana. Quantitative expression analysis showed most putative ORs (140) are expressed in antennae while only 31 are in the palps. Further, our analysis identified one OR detected only in the palps and seven ORs that are expressed differentially by sex. An in situ analysis of OR expression suggested ORs are organized in non-random combinations within antennal sensilla. A phylogenetic comparison of OR predicted protein sequences revealed homologous relationships among two other Acrididae species. Our results provide a foundation for understanding the organization of the first stage of the olfactory system in S. americana, a well-studied model for olfactory processing."
Enhancing impact resistance and biodegradability of PHBV by melt blending with ENR,"This research aims to enhance the mechanical characteristics of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) by using epoxidized natural rubber (ENR-25 and ENR-50) as a toughening agent and polybutadiene (PB) grafted with maleic anhydride (MA) (3 MA groups/chain) as a compatibilizer. The PHBV/ENR blends were mixed in 100/0, 90/10, 80/20, and 70/30 with PB-g-MA at 0, 5, and 10% (wt./wt.), using an internal mixer set to 175 °C with a rotor speed of 50 rpm. The findings indicated that at 70/30 PHBV/ENR composition, the impact strength of the blends with 25 and 50 epoxide contents were the greatest at 6.92 ± 0.35 J m−1 and 7.33 ± 1.19 J m−1, respectively, which are about two times greater than that of neat PHBV. Furthermore, the biodegradability of the PHBV/ENR blends was more substantial than that of neat PHBV, showing a mass reduction of approximately 40% and 45% for PHBV/ENR-25 and PHBV/ENR-50, respectively. In comparison, while the mass loss of PHBV was approximately 37% after three months of soil burial. The results indicate that ENR improves the toughness of the blends while simultaneously increasing PHBV degradation, which could pave the way for broadening PHBV for sustainability purposes."
Smartphones dependency risk analysis using machine-learning predictive models,"Recent technological advances have changed how people interact, run businesses, learn, and use their free time. The advantages and facilities provided by electronic devices have played a major role. On the other hand, extensive use of such technology also has adverse effects on several aspects of human life (e.g., the development of societal sedentary lifestyles and new addictions). Smartphone dependency is new addiction that primarily affects the young population. The consequences may negatively impact mental and physical health (e.g., lack of attention or local pain). Health professionals rely on self-reported subjective information to assess the dependency level, requiring specialists' opinions to diagnose such a dependency. This study proposes a data-driven prediction model for smartphone dependency based on machine learning techniques using an analytical retrospective case–control approach. Different classification methods were applied, including classical and modern machine learning models. Students from a private university in Cali—Colombia (n = 1228) were tested for (i) smartphone dependency, (ii) musculoskeletal symptoms, and (iii) the Risk Factors Questionnaire. Random forest, logistic regression, and support vector machine-based classifiers exhibited the highest prediction accuracy, 76–77%, for smartphone dependency, estimated through the stratified-k-fold cross-validation technique. Results showed that self-reported information provides insight into predicting smartphone dependency correctly. Such an approach opens doors for future research aiming to include objective measures to increase accuracy and help to reduce the negative consequences of this new addiction form."
Situation assessment in air combat considering incomplete frame of discernment in the generalized evidence theory,"For situation assessment in air combat, there may be incomplete information because of new technologies and unknown or uncertain targets and threats. In this paper, an improved method of situation assessment for air combat environment considering incomplete frame of discernment in the evidence theory is proposed to get a more accurate fusion result for decision making in the battlefield environment. First, the situation in air combat is assessed with knowledge. Then, the incomplete frame of discernment in the generalized evidence theory, which is an extension of Dempster–Shafer evidence theory, is adopted to model the incomplete and unknown situation assessment. After that, the generalized combination rule in the generalized evidence theory is adopted for fusion of situations in intelligent air combat. Finally, real-time decision-making in situation assessment can be reached for actions to take. Experiments in situation assessment of air combat with incomplete and uncertain situations show the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed method."
Significance of thermal radiation and bioconvection for Williamson nanofluid transportation owing to cone rotation,"Numerical investigation for enhancement in thermal distribution of unsteady dynamics of Williamson nanofluids and ordinary nanofluids flow across extending surface of a rotating cone is represented in this communication. Bio-convection of gyrotactic micro-organisms and thermal radiative fluxes with magnetic fields are significant physical aspects of the study. The velocity slip conditions are considered along x and y directions. The leading formulation is transmuted into ordinary differential form via similarity functions. Five coupled equations with non-linear terms are resolved numerically through the utilization of Matlab code for the Runge–Kutta procedure. The parameters of buoyancy ratio and bio-convection Rayleigh number decrease the x-direction velocity. The slip parameter being proportional to viscosity reduces the speed of flow and hence rise in temperature. Also, the temperature rises with the rising values of magnetic field strength, radiative heat transportation, Brownian motion and thermophorsis."
To β or Not to β: Lack of Correlation Between APC Mutation and β-Catenin Nuclear Localization in Colorectal Cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) appears to arise from sequential genetic lesions in tumor suppressor genes (APC, SMAD4, and TP53) and oncogenes (KRAS) leading to the classical adenoma to carcinoma progression. Biallelic APC inactivating genetic aberrations are detected in about 70% of early microadenomas implicating APC inactivation as the first genetic hit in CRC. APC is an essential protein of the Wnt ‘destruction complex’; APC inactivation is believed to cause disruption of the complex allowing stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, resulting in transcriptional activation of cancer-promoting genes."
Prediction of probability distributions of molecular properties: towards more efficient virtual screening and better understanding of compound representations,"Various in silico approaches to predict activity and properties of chemical compounds constitute nowadays the basis of computer-aided drug design. While there is a general focus on the predictions of values, mathematically more appropriate is the prognosis of probability distributions, which offers additional possibilities, such as the evaluation of uncertainty, higher moments, and quantiles. In this study, we applied the Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction approach to assess several ADMET properties of chemical compounds. It uses multiple linear regression to independently assess multiple moments, which are then finally combined into predicted probability distribution. The method enables inexpensive selection of compounds with properties nearly certain to fall into the particular range during virtual screening and automatic rejection of predictions characterized by high rate of uncertainty; however, unlike to the currently used virtual screening methods, it focuses on the prediction of the property distribution, not its actual value. Moreover, the presented protocol enables detection of structural features, which should be carefully considered when optimizing compounds towards particular property, as well as it provides deeper understanding of the examined compound representations."
Sensitization of cervical cancer cells to radiation by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor dinaciclib,"Dinaciclib is a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, but its radiosensitizing effect remains unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the radiosensitizing effect of Dinaciclib on cervical cancer cells. Two cervical cancer cell lines, Hela and Siha, were selected, and the IC50 was determined by CCK8. The radiosensitizing effect of Dinaciclib was verified by plate cloning assay, and the G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis of IR cells were verified by flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence assay was used to verify the formation of γH2AX foci following DNA damage. Western blot was performed to detect cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy, and DNA damage-related pathways. Dinaciclib increased the cell sensitivity to IR. IR induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis, and Dinaciclib enhanced this effect. Further, Dinaciclib delayed DNA repair, including non-homologous end joining repair and homologous recombination repair, and reduced the expression of DNA repair proteins Ku80 (SiHa cells), Ku70, and RAD51, as well as the expression of apoptotic marker Bcl-2. The expression of autophagy marker Beclin1 induced tumor cell death and increased the formation of DNA damage marker γH2AX foci. Dinaciclib improves the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to IR by inducing cell cycle arrest, delaying DNA repair, and increasing apoptosis. However, further research is needed to unravel the complexity of DNA repair pathways."
Does Sex Improve With Experience?: A Latent Transition Analysis of College Students’ Penile-Vaginal Sex-related Consequences,"Sex researchers have primarily focused on first penile-vaginal sex and negative consequences. However, because sexual behaviors and attitudes change with age, sex-related consequences may also change. In this study, 275 college students reported on penile-vaginal sex-related consequences the prior day in 733 daily diaries across two or more semesters. Participants were primarily female (63%) and heterosexual (98%). The sample was racially and ethnically diverse, with 30% identifying as Hispanic and, of the non-Hispanic participants, 35% White, 24% Black/African American, 20% Asian-American/Alaskan Native, 2% American Indian, and 2% Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. During their first semester, participants were, on average, 18.4 years old (SD = 0.4). Latent class analysis identified three classes: High Positive (56%), Intimacy and Satisfaction Only (34%), and Moderate Positive With Health Concerns (10%). Over time, students were likely to transition out of the Moderate Positive With Health Concerns and High Positive classes, and into the Intimacy and Satisfaction Only class. The findings suggest that discussing protection from health concerns and positive aspects of sexuality may lead to better student engagement in safe sex programming."
"Effect of sintering temperature on structural, morphological, magnetic, and electrochemical properties of Mn0.3Co0.2Zn0.5Fe2O4 Ferrite","The sol-gel methodology was exploited for the production of Mn0.3Co0.2Zn0.5Fe2O4 ferrite nanoparticles, at different sintering temperatures (750, 950, and 1150 °C). The nanometer size crystallites were evaluated utilizing the Debye Scherrer formulae in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) study. The two bands manifested in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra near 600 cm−1 (tetrahedral site) and 400 cm−1 (octahedral site) ratify the formation of spinel structure for all sintering temperatures. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) micrographs estimate the average size of the particle by using ImageJ software and reveal the agglomerated grains, which are inhomogeneous in shape and size. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) study confirms the stoichiometry and composition of the synthesized specimens. For an enhancement in the sintering temperature, the enhancement in the saturation magnetization was perceived in the magnetic studies by using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). With regard to all incorporated samples, the squareness ratio was assessed to be under 0.5 which assimilates to a multi-domain structure. For all scan rates and current densities, the prepared Mn0.3Co0.2Zn0.5Fe2O4 (1150 °C) had the higher value of the specific capacitance as portrayed through the electrochemical study."
Characterization of Probiotic Pichia sp. DU2-Derived Exopolysaccharide with Oil-in-Water Emulsifying and Anti-biofilm Activities,"Probiotic-derived exopolysaccharides are considered as promising sources of carbohydrate with extensive applications in many industries. In the current study, yeast strains were isolated from chicken ingluvies and gizzard samples. According to molecular identification, EPS-producing yeast (Pichia sp. DU2) showed the most similarity to Pichia cactophila (99.67%). Pichia sp. DU2 showed probiotic properties. EPS of Pichia sp. DU2 showed emulsifying activity. The formed emulsions showed 53% (colza oil) and 100% (p-xylene) stability after 24 h. These emulsions were oil-in-water and have stability in the presence of NaCl, KCl, and also acidic and basic conditions. Also, the EPS showed anti-biofilm (29.7–47.6% and 19.06–55.26% against B. cereus and Y. enterocolitica, respectively) and flocculating activities (31.4%).

Leveraging blockchain in response to a pandemic through disaster risk management: an IF-MCDM framework,"The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the necessity for strategic approaches to manage global catastrophes. This study argues that disaster risk management (DRM) is an essential approach to mitigate the impact of global calamities, such as a pandemic. However, due to the uncertainty emerging from variables such as time and demand, managing DRM effectively involves high complexity. Blockchain technology (BcT) can be implemented to help address these challenges due to its potential to build trust, transparency, and accountability in complex operations. However, no research has quantitatively examined the applicability of BcT in the sub-dimensions of DRM to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal and scope of this study is to explore the role of BcT in DRM operations during the COVID-19 pandemic through an Intuitionistic Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making (IF-MCDM) framework. More specifically, the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (IF-ANP) method was utilized to calculate the weights of key criteria (i.e., BcT benefits), while Intuitionistic Fuzzy VIKOR (IF-VIKOR) was used to prioritize the alternatives (i.e., the sub-dimensions of DRM). The findings of this study are threefold. First, supporting effective coordination turned out to be the most essential benefit of BcT to build resilience in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, disaster management was found to be the most appropriate DRM sub-dimension for possible BcT implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, eleven distinct activities involved in disaster management and governance and financial protection were discovered to be the most applicable for BcT. The findings of this study could assist disaster risk managers to assess whether (or not) BcT is suitable for the sub-dimensions of DRM to build national and organizational resilience in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic."
Marker assisted backcross to introgress late leaf spot and rust resistance in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.),"Groundnut is affected by a variety of abiotic and biotic stressors, including late leaf spot and rust, which cause significant economic loss. In this study, QTL for resistance to late leaf spot and rust from donor variety GPBD 4 were incorporated into a popular groundnut variety (ICGV 00350) through marker assisted backcross (MABC) breeding."
Low-cost multiclass-image encryption based on compressive sensing and chaotic system,"In this paper, a compressible and low-cost cryptography system is investigated based a new memristor system for Internet of multimedia things to acquire and transmit multiclass-image signals, such as grayscale, color and 3D images (Stereolithography format). Compression sensing is first introduced to solve the limitation of computing and storage resources faced by detectors when sampling data from different scenarios. The batch data after sampling are fused into 3D cubes, and the confusion–diffusion framework is used to encrypt them in 3D space to ensure the privacy of information during transmission. For confusion procedure, a novel technique, like 3D jigsaw puzzles, is designed to improve the efficiency of scrambling. Furthermore, a new nonlinear primitive is proposed based on three-input majority gate , and the non-sequential diffusion path generated by depth-first search is used for diffusion operation. The experimental results and extensive security analysis show that the proposed encryption technique combined with the implementation of 3D space significantly improves the security and efficiency of batch image processing."
Mental images and false memories: the classical cognitive approach vs. embodied cognition,"This review aims to debate about the mechanisms involving in the false memories creation within the embodied cognition approach, this issue was not still explored in the scientific literature. Embodied cognition postulates that memories retrieval results in a mental simulation of the perceptual, motor, emotional and contextual characteristics of the event in question. However, the likelihood of false memories has rarely been examined from this theoretical approach. In this perspective, this article discusses the moderating effects of mental images on false memories (especially those obtained in the DRM paradigm) in light of the classical cognition and embodied cognition approach. After a brief recall of the debate about the mental images status between the propositional and analog currents in theories of cognition. In a second part, we address the concept of mental simulation specific to the theories of embodied cognition. Then, in a third part, we examine the effects of imagery on the creation of false memories. The fourth part is focused on the mechanisms involved in the reduction of false memories in the view of classical theories of memory and then of embodied cognition."
"“It gives me time, but does it give me freedom?”: a contextual understanding of anticipatory decision-making in social egg freezing","The ethics of social egg freezing is a much-debated topic, yet there is limited research using contextual approaches to understand the experiences and decision-making of women that have used this novel assisted reproductive technology. Based on a small-scale qualitative study in Belgium, this article explores how women’s social contexts have an impact on conceptions of time and anticipatory decision-making in relation to social egg freezing. We describe three recurrent themes that we identified in our qualitative study: waiting for the right time, planning and manipulating future time, and ambivalence through medical anticipation. Inspired by the analytical framework of Pierre Bourdieu, we discuss how social egg freezing generates a kind of biocapital for higher educated women within current neoliberal societies. The article also illustrates how women’s decisions are accompanied by feelings of ambivalence, and lasting mismatches between subjective expectations and structural tendencies in the fields of intimate relations, work, and medicine. As such the article contributes to a contextual understanding of normative issues concerning social egg freezing, in particular those related to questions of autonomy."
Spatiotemporal variability assessment and accuracy evaluation of Standardized Precipitation Index and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index in Malaysia,"Drought indices like Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) are applied to determine the drought occurrence. The drought characteristics are quantified based on the frequency, duration, peak and severity. The application of the two drought indices may provide different accuracy and indication on the drought characteristics. Thus, it is necessary to determine the better drought index for an accurate drought assessment in water resources planning and management. This study assessed the spatiotemporal variation of the drought characteristics in Malaysia based on SPI and SPEI. Furthermore, the novelty of this study is to evaluate the accuracy SPI and SPEI for the historical drought formation under the influence of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration trends. The temporal analysis results indicated the reducing dry conditions for both drought indices except the inland part of East Coast region for Peninsular Malaysia. Additionally, the spatial analysis results showed a higher drought frequency but shorter duration and less severe at the inland part of East Coast Region for Peninsular Malaysia and Northern region of East Malaysia for 1-month and 3-months time scales. Besides, there were lower occurrences of 6-months and 12-months drought with the overall increase in the rainfall trend in Malaysia. For the evaluation of accuracy, the SPEI was deemed more accurate as compared to SPI by achieving a higher true positive rate and negative predictive rate, lower false detection rate, false negative rate, and onset detection. The SPEI also provided a better description of the most severe drought events in year 1997/1998 and year 2015/2016. The outcomes are useful to develop mitigation strategies against the climate change."
Addressing the eco-gender gap in men through power and sustainability self-efficacy,"It is in society’s best interest for people to consume sustainably. However, some consumers are less likely to do so, with men (vs. women) being more resistant to engaging in sustainable consumption. This research explores this eco-gender gap by identifying methods to improve men’s responses (brand attitudes and self-brand connections) to sustainable brands. Three experiments demonstrate that men (self-identified) respond more favorably to sustainable brands when they feel powerful or have a sense of sustainability self-efficacy, meaning they believe their sustainable actions can have a positive societal impact. Study 1 finds that men respond more favorably to sustainable brands when experiencing a high (vs. low) sense of power, and this is mediated by their perceptions of sustainability self-efficacy. Study 2 demonstrates that a high (vs. low) sense of sustainability self-efficacy increases men’s responses to sustainable brands even when their sense of power is low. Study 3 confirms that the positive effect of power on men’s responses to sustainable brands only emerges for sustainable, not conventional brands. These findings indicate that promoting sustainable consumption among men should focus on making them feel powerful and/or capable of making a positive societal impact."
Solitary Fibrous Tumor of Parapharyngeal Space: A Rare Case Report,"Solitary fibrous tumors are rare vascular tumours, earlier referred to as hemangiopericytoma. Their occurrence in parapharyngeal space is very rare. Hence, they should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of parapharyngeal soft tissue tumours. This case is being reported to bring out an extremely rare vascular tumour at rare site and represents a surgical challenge because of difficult access in parapharyngeal space with difficult planes between tumour and rest of parapharyngeal space, approach to it is also difficult."
Post Surgical Outcomes in Paediatric Adenotonsillar Hypertrophy with Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Subjective and Objective Evaluation,"The aim of the study was to determine the post surgical outcomes in pediatric adenotonsillar hypertrophy with OSA using portable polysomnography (PSG), OSA 18 Questionnaire and Quality of life (QoL) scores. Secondly to correlate the subjective outcomes with objective scores of polysomonography. A prospective, single-arm, nonrandomized, single center study was performed at a tertiary care centre on children aged 3–12 years (n = 30) with adenoid hypertrophy/ tonsillar hypertrophy/adenotonsillar hypertrophy and symptoms suggestive of OSA. All subjects underwent appropriate surgical intervention. A portable PSG and OSA 18 questionnaire evaluation was performed pre surgery and 06 weeks post surgery to assess objective and clinical assessment for OSA. The mean age of children enrolled in the study was 8.68 ± 3 years. The mean pre treatment AHI was 12.56 ± 13.16 which improved to 1.72 ± 1.53 post surgery and was statistically significant (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test). There was a statistically significant improvement in other PSG indices such as RDI and ODI post surgery also. The mean total symptom score (TSS) and QoL score also showed a statistically significant improvement post treatment (p < 0.05). However there was no correlation between the PSG and OSA 18 questionnaire scores pre and post surgery. Children with OSA like symptoms can undergo a portable polysomnography pre and post surgery to demonstrate severity of OSA and objectively monitor improvement in OSA post treatment. In the absence of availability of PSG, OSA 18 questionnaire is a suitable alternative to monitor disease severity and outcomes. Further studies may plan to include impact of paediatric OSA on other function such as the cardiac, dentition & malocclusion and neurocognitive function."
A three-terminal heat engine based on resonant-tunneling multi-level quantum dots,"A three-terminal heat engine based on resonant-tunneling multi-level quantum dots is proposed. With the help of Landauer formula, the general expressions for the charge and heat currents, the power output and efficiency are derived. In the linear response regime an explicit analytic expressions for the charge and heat currents, the maximum power output and the corresponding efficiency is presented. Next, the performance characteristic and optimal performance of the heat engine is investigated in the nonlinear response regime by numerical calculation. Finally, the influence of the main parameters, including the asymmetry factor, the energy-level spacing, the energy difference, the number of discrete energy levels, the bias voltage, and the temperature difference on the optimal performance of the heat engine is analyzed in detail. By choosing appropriate parameters one can obtain the maximum power output and the corresponding efficiency at maximum output power."
Cu2+-mediated turn-on fluorescence biosensor based on DNA-templated silver nanoclusters for label-free and sensitive detection of adenosine triphosphate,"A Cu2+-mediated turn-on fluorescence biosensor based on the DNA-templated green-emitting silver nanoclusters (DNA@g-AgNCs) was developed for label-free and sensitive detection of adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP). Cu2+ was able to quench the bright green fluorescence of DNA@g-AgNCs because of the coordination and photoinduced electron transfer between DNA@g-AgNCs and Cu2+. Therefore, a unique and effective fluorescence biosensor can be constructed with the formation of DNA@g-AgNCs/Cu2+/ATP ternary-competition system. With the introduction of ATP, the DNA@g-AgNCs/Cu2+ fluorescence sensing system will be disrupted and the fluorescence of DNA@g-AgNCs was recovered due to higher affinity of ATP towards Cu2+. On the basis of this feature, the DNA@g-AgNCs/Cu2+ fluorescence sensing system demonstrated quantitative determination of ATP in the range 0.05 - 3 μM and a detection limit of 16 nM. Moreover, the fluorescence sensing system was successfully applied to the quantitative determination of ATP in human urine and serum samples with recoveries ranging from 98.6 to 106.5%, showing great promise to provide  a label-free, cost-efficient, and rapid platform for ATP-related clinical disease diagnosis."
Determination of E 472b emulsifiers in foamed food formulations by high-performance thin-layer chromatography‒fluorescence detection,"E 472b emulsifiers, defined as lactic acid esters of mono- and diacylglycerides, are food emulsifiers widely used in foamed food formulations. So far, only qualitative methods for analyzing E 472b emulsifiers have been published. Thus, a new method was developed for determining E 472b in different foamed food formulations by high-performance thin-layer chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPTLC‒FLD). The proposed method allows simple and fast E 472b emulsifier extraction from the food matrix and points out an analytical approach for quantifying these emulsifiers using a commercial E 472b emulsifier as the reference standard. Limits of decision with 56‒59 ng of E 472b emulsifier/zone and limits of quantification with 172‒179 ng of E 472b emulsifier/zone in three foamed model food formulations, respectively, as well as satisfactory repeatability (n = 6) and reproducibility (n = 6) exposed by low relative standard deviation < 8% proved the method suitable for the sensitive and reliable determination of E 472b emulsifiers. Recoveries between 96 and 109.3% were obtained for all investigated model systems. In commercial foamed food formulations from the German market, the E 472b emulsifier content ranged between 0.1 and 0.6 g/100 g."
The classification of wheat species based on deep convolutional neural networks using scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging,"With the increase in world population, decreased farmland, and global climate changes, the search for intelligent systems has become important to maintain product quality and productivity. For the continuous, quality, and clean production of wheat, which is a basic macronutrient for human health, it is necessary to use high-yield, high-quality, and unmixed clean seeds. The target of this review is to provide computer-aided identification of wheat species in the food industry and to offer taxonomists an opportunity to overcome classification difficulties. This research also highlights a systematic and functional wheat identification approach using scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging techniques. The review found that not only accurately classifies the SEM images of wheat species of deep learning methods but also yields them being distinguished under different environmental conditions (irrigated and non-irrigated). Recently, the EfficientNet models are noteworthy as providing higher training speed and better parameter efficiency compared to the previous models. Therefore, the EfficientNet-B4 and EfficientNetV2-M were utilized on the top of an effective pre-processing task. Findings confirm that SEM imaging is outstanding when it comes to diagnosis and classification in the agricultural industry. The experimental results show that the proposed technique provides significantly better quantitative results and higher accuracy rates than the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) algorithms."
Effect of high-temperature annealing on mechanical properties of spark plasma sintered TiCN-15WC-5Cr3C2-5 nano-TiB2 cermets modified with cobalt,"This paper reports the effect of high-temperature annealing on the mechanical properties of spark plasma sintered TiCN-15WC-5Cr3C2-5 nano-TiB2-based cermet modified with the addition of different percentages of cobalt (0 to 15%). The microstructure and mechanical properties such as hardness and toughness of the as sintered cermets were reported. The cermets were heated to different annealing temperatures (800 °C and 1000 °C) for the holding time of 4 h and 6 h. The effect of high-temperature annealing on the mechanical properties was evaluated by measuring the hardness, toughness and weight gain/loss. The results showed that the hardness and toughness decreased with an increase in the annealing temperature and time. The presence of Co in the cermets with 10% and 15% showed better hardness values after annealing at 800 °C and 1000 °C for 4 h and 6 h. The fracture toughness values did not change much compared to the blank and cermets with 5% Co. The cermet with 15% Co showed better mechanical properties compared to the blank. The weight gain increased with annealing temperature and time. The SEM analysis revealed that the microstructures were changed with respect to the annealing temperature and time. Annealing at 1000 °C for 4 h and 6 h showed a newly formed oxide layer and coarsening of grains. The new phases formed during annealing were examined by XRD, and it was found that the formation of different oxides leads to deteriorate the thermal stability of the cermets."
Understanding youths’ concerns about climate change: a binational qualitative study of ecological burden and resilience,"Climate change has been shown to have long-term effects on mental health, yet, to date, there have been few studies on how children and adolescents experience and respond to ecological changes and how and why they engage in climate action. We explored empirically young people’s views about climate change and how distinct cultural contexts influence individual climate action."
Performance Comparison of Recent Nature-Inspired Optimization Algorithms in Optimal Placement and Sizing of Distributed Energy Resources,"Through the integration of distributed generation into the distribution network, several benefits can be achieved, including minimization of system losses, enhancement of voltage profiles, and improvement of network reliability and security. One of the best ways to maximize the benefits of distributed generation units is to optimize the location and size of these units in the network. The main objective of this paper is the application and comparison of five recently developed optimization algorithms for optimizing the allocation of multiple distributed generators in the distribution network. The algorithms include the hybrid grey wolf optimizer and cuckoo search, bald eagle search, marine predator algorithm, artificial ecosystem optimizer, and slime mould algorithm. Three objectives are set in the problem of determining the optimal allocation of distributed generators, including the reduction of energy losses, enhancement of voltage profile, and improvement of voltage stability. The proposed optimization algorithms are evaluated and compared using IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 69-bus radial distribution networks. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms are very competitive in their ability to allocate distributed generators optimally. However, artificial ecosystem optimizer and bald eagle search outperform other algorithms."
Gender differences in the ideal cutoffs of visceral fat area for predicting MAFLD in China,"Since the discovery of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) in 2020, no report on the connection between the visceral fat area (VFA) and MAFLD has been published in China, and the ideal cutoffs of VFA for predicting MAFLD has not been determined so far. Thus, the purpose of this research was to clarify the relationship between VFA and MAFLD and the ideal cutoffs of VFA to predict MAFLD in the Chinese population."
"Analysis of Travel Satisfaction with Commuting in Developing Economy: A Case of New Delhi, India","This study presents a methodology for analyzing travel satisfaction associated with commuting based on a segmentation-based approach and suggests segment-specific policy recommendations for improving trip quality in urban India. A survey questionnaire was developed to collect (1) commuters’ socio-demographic, trip-specific information, (2) commuters’ perceived satisfaction related to daily-, work-, and non-work-/other trips and (3) commuters’ satisfaction associated with the performance of a set of built-environment factors (sidewalk, bus-stop), and (4) commuter’s perception towards the existing level of safety, comfort, and time-efficiency associated with bus, walk, and private-car from 898 respondents across New Delhi, the Indian capital. The Kruskal–Wallis H-test was used to test for heterogeneity in travel satisfaction across various subgroups. Subsequently, a two-step clustering approach was used to classify the commuters into five segments based on age, gender, and commuting mode. The segments are ‘captive bus commuters’, ‘young male choice commuters’, ‘private car commuters’, ‘middle-aged choice commuters’ and ‘female choice commuters’. The user perception towards built-environment, mode-specific characteristics and travel satisfaction levels were explored within each segment. Results indicated that bus-stop safety and security were perceived with low importance, whereas sidewalk quality was satisfactory. Similarly, bus travel's safety, comfort, and reliability aspects were unsatisfactory compared to walking, indicating immediate intervention toward bus-specific infrastructure. The proposed methodology would help formulate specific policy measures to improve the trip satisfaction of urban commuters and facilitate efficient budget allocation for infrastructure improvement programs."
Metabolic pathway analysis of hyperuricaemia patients with hyperlipidaemia based on high-throughput mass spectrometry: a case‒control study,"Both hyperuricaemia and hyperlipidaemia are common metabolic diseases that are closely related to each other, and both are independent risk factors for the development of a variety of diseases. HUA combined with hyperlipidaemia increases the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and coronary heart disease. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between HUA and hyperlipidaemia and study the metabolic pathway changes in patients with HUA associated with hyperlipidaemia using metabolomics."
Effects of syphilis infection among HIV-1-positive individuals on suppressive antiretroviral therapy,Incident syphilis leads to changes in plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 + T-cell level in people with HIV (PWH) with viraemia. Its effect in PWH on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) is less clear.
Expansion of regulatory T cells by CD28 superagonistic antibodies attenuates neurodegeneration in A53T-α-synuclein Parkinson’s disease mice,Regulatory CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells (Treg) are a subgroup of T lymphocytes involved in maintaining immune balance. Disturbance of Treg number and impaired suppressive function of Treg correlate with Parkinson’s disease severity. Superagonistic anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies (CD28SA) activate Treg and cause their expansion to create an anti-inflammatory environment.
Nanofibrillated cellulose-based superhydrophobic coating with antimicrobial performance,"Superhydrophobic coatings have been widely developed to endue the materials with antibacterial, self-cleaning, antiseptic, and some other multifunctionalities. Fluorochemicals are the most commonly used superhydrophobic coatings; however, the released toxic substances from fluorinated polymers are a significant source of water pollution and even a threat to human health. With the increasingly great attention to the environment, it is imperative to exploit green and effective hydrophobic coatings. Here, a nanofibrillated cellulose-based multifunctional superhydrophobic coating (NMSC) was fabricated by using an efficient silylation process from cellulose, tetraethyl orthosilicate, and cetyl trimethoxysilane. Microscopic, chemical structural, and thermal properties analyses revealed that the NMSC has nanoroughness, low surface energy, and good thermal stability. More importantly, the NMSC displayed an unprecedented hydrophobic and self-cleaning performance (water contact angle ~ 165°). The NMSC superhydrophobic coating can realize long-term effective barriers to many fluids, including strong acid (pH 1), strong alkali (pH 13), alcohols, alkanes, esters, and some other organic solvents. Moreover, the NMSC also exhibited a certain degree of antibacterial performance. This work provides a good approach for not only the high-value application of cellulose but also the development of ecological and sustainable multifunctional coatings."
Clinicopathological features and genomic profiles of a group of secretory breast carcinomas in which progressive cases have more complex genomic features,"Secretory breast carcinoma (SBC) is a rare malignant breast neoplasm with distinct histological features, including solid, microcystic, tubular, and rarely papillary structures, traditionally characterized by a t (12;15) (p13:q25) translocation, which usually leads to ETV6-NTRK3 fusion, suggesting an early event in tumorigenesis. Due to the rarity of this disease, very few genome sequencing studies have been performed on a series of cases, especially progressive cases."
Cultural experiences in the framework of “cultural cities”: measuring the socioeconomic impact of culture in urban performance,"This article defines ""cultural experience"" and places it in a holistic conceptual model; “the cultural city” where it plays a relevant role in improving the performing of cities. The conceptual model combines the basic elements of the heritage city, the smart city and the creative city. The city is interpreted from a threefold perspective; as a repository of resources, as a connective interface, and as the setting for citizens' life and social and professional experiences. In this context, each of these perspectives incorporates culture in a different way, enabling different models of value creation and different processes of production and reproduction of this value. In each of the urban models described above, production processes that combine symbolic, physical, financial, social, human and cultural capital in different ways and urban strategies are implemented to provide cultural experiences that ignite transformative effects through several spillovers. That means that culture, in its different dimensions, regains the role of a raw material and becomes the point of origin to activate development processes and improve urban performance. The integration of the dimensions of the heritage city, the creative city and the smart city through an enabling context is the core proposal of the “cultural city”. In alignment with the New European Agenda for Culture, we deepen the analysis in the specific spillovers on wellbeing and quality of life, citizen engagement and urban renewal as the backbone of a set of external effects of cultural experiences. In the final part of this article, we test the plausibility of this speculative proposal through some empirical evidence. We develop an OLS model with proxy indicators, that could be considered transitional indicators, for the three different potential strategies (heritage, smart, creative). The findings support the assertion that it is conceivable that the supply of cultural experiences through a variety of tactics (heritage city, smart city and creative city) can account in part for the growth of European cities in the years after the 2008 financial crisis. These strategies have contributed to the good performance of the urban device in a way that is positive, not negligible (accounting for around 50% of the variance in productivity) and statistically significant. The provision of a context that increases the cultural experiences for citizens has clearly improved the performance of European cities, and we develop some conceptual and empirical mechanisms to explain and measure the socioeconomic impacts of these processes."
The impact of emotional leadership on Chinese subordinates’ work engagement: role of intrinsic motivation and traditionality,"Leaders’ emotions and emotion regulation strategies influence subordinates’ attitudes and behaviors, while previous studies have mostly taken an emotional perspective. Leaders’ emotional competence also has an impact on subordinates through motivational and cognitive pathways. Based on self-determination theory, this study examined the impact of emotional leadership on subordinates’ work engagement, as well as the mediating role of subordinates’ intrinsic motivation and the moderating role of traditionality."

Cardiac adipose tissue volume assessed by computed tomography is a specific and independent predictor of early mortality and critical illness in COVID-19 in type 2-diabetic patients,"Patients with type 2-diabetes mellitus (T2D), are characterized by visceral and ectopic adipose tissue expansion, leading to systemic chronic low-grade inflammation. As visceral adiposity is associated with severe COVID-19 irrespective of obesity, we aimed to evaluate and compare the predictive value for early intensive care or death of three fat depots (cardiac, visceral and subcutaneous) using computed tomography (CT) at admission for COVID-19 in consecutive patients with and without T2D."
Wistar rats choose alcohol over social interaction in a discrete-choice model,"Animal models of substance use disorders have been criticized for their limited translation. One important factor behind seeking and taking that has so far been largely overlooked is the availability of alternative non-drug rewards. We recently reported that only about 15% of outbred Wistar rats will choose alcohol over a sweet solution of saccharin. It was also shown using a novel operant model of choice of drugs over social rewards that social interaction consistently attenuates self-administration and incubation of craving for stimulants and opioids. Whether this is also true for alcohol and choice of alcohol over a sweet reward translates to social rewards is currently unknown. We therefore evaluated choice between alcohol and a social reward in different experimental settings in both male and female Wistar rats. We found, in contrast to prior work that employed discrete choice of drugs vs. social reward, that rats almost exclusively prefer alcohol over social interaction, irrespective of the nature of the social partner (cagemate vs. novel rat), the length of interaction, housing conditions and sex. Alcohol choice was reduced when the response requirement for alcohol was increased. However, rats persisted in choosing alcohol, even when the effort required to obtain it was 10–16 times higher (for females and males respectively) than the one for the social reward. Altogether, these results indicate that the social choice model may not generalize to alcohol, pointing to the possibility that specific interactions between alcohol and social reward, not seen when a sweet solution is used as an alternative to the drug, may play a crucial role in alcohol vs. social choice experiments."
Relationship between characteristics of glioma treatment and surgical site infections,"Surgical site infections (SSIs) after neurosurgery are common in daily practice. Although numerous reports have described SSIs in neurosurgery, reports specific to gliomas are limited. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between SSIs and glioma treatment characteristics, such as reoperations, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy."
Mixed-mode I/II criterion based on combining Hill failure analysis and reinforcement isotropic solid model,"Several failure criteria for fibrous and non-fibrous anisotropic materials were proposed after considering numerous implementations in various industries. Failure theories are classified as including or excluding distinct failure modes, and the majority of them do not account for intrinsic properties and loading mode mixites. In this context, theories include the gradual micromechanical transition from anisotropic to isotropic media embedding reinforcement, referred to as the “reinforcement isotropic solid model.” In other words, the reinforcement isotropic solid model ensures the independence of the fiber effects by modeling fibers as a proportion of the isotropic matrix's active stress. The Hill criterion, in conjunction with the reinforcement isotropic solid model, is employed to propose a new fracture criterion for mixed-mode I/II loading, referred to here as “Extended HILL.” Additionally, experimental results have been established to validate the failure criteria based on reinforcement in the isotropic solid mode. This criterion produces good agreement between the fracture limit curves and the experimental data."
Degenerate scales for thin elastic plates with Dirichlet boundary conditions,"A degenerate scale occurs when a loss of uniqueness of the solution of the boundary integral equations happens for that scale of the problem. We consider here the biharmonic 2D problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions which models the bending behavior of a clamped isotropic Kirchhoff plate. We extend several results about degenerate scales previously found for the Laplace and Lamé equation to the biharmonic equation in 2 dimensions. The degenerate scales are obtained from a \(4\times 4\) discriminant matrix whose shape is provided for different kinds of domain symmetry. We show that degenerate scales can be obtained from a minimization problem. Then, we compare the degenerate scales of two boundaries, one included within the other. For smooth star-shaped curves, we show that there are only two degenerate scales, give sufficient conditions for not being at a degenerate scale and produce bounds to the degenerate scales. For symmetric smooth simply connected curves there are also only two degenerate scales. For these symmetric cases, the use of complex variables allows us to go further and to link the problem of biharmonic equation to the one of plane elasticity and to give information, including bounds and exact values of degenerate scales, for many cases, while until now only very few ones were known. Our results have some consequences for the biharmonic outer radius defined by Pólya and Szegö. The numerical computation of degenerate scales by using boundary elements confirms the theoretical results."
Stability and vibration of nanocomposite microbeams reinforced by graphene oxides using an MCST-based improved shear deformable computational framework,"A size-dependent improved third order shear deformable computational framework with the aid of modified couple stress theory (MCST) is developed to investigate the stability and free vibrations of polymer-based microbeams reinforced by graphene oxides (GOs). The nanocomposite microbeams are placed in an elastic substrate and have different immovable end restraints. The modulus of elasticity of the GOs-reinforced nanocomposite (GORC) is evaluated using the well-known Halpin–Tsai micromechanics model, and the equivalent mass density as well as Poisson's ratio is evaluated based on mixture rule. The equations governing the stability and vibration behaviors are derived by means of the Lagrange method with the help of the Gram–Schmidt process that is used to produce admissible functions in a general orthogonal polynomial form. The static stability and vibration characteristics of the GORC microbeams are analyzed. The influences of small-scale effect, GO nanofillers, and elastic foundation on the mechanical stability and vibration behaviors of the nanocomposite microbeams are illustrated using some numerical examples."
Computed tomography angiography features of children with ectopia cordis,"Ectopia cordis is a rare congenital defect with high mortality, and it remains challenging to radiologists, neonatologists and surgeons. CT angiography provides key information that aids in the decision-making process for possible surgical intervention. This pictorial essay describes CT angiography features in six neonates with ectopia cordis."
The impact of vacuum pressure on the effectiveness of SiO2 impregnation of spruce wood,"Wood is a widely used construction material that has many advantageous properties. However, it suffers from weaknesses such as low-dimensional stability and low durability in humid environments. These issues are associated with the porous vascular structure of wood that leads to a high water uptake capacity. This research aims to reduce the water uptake capacity of spruce wood by dip-coating samples in an aqueous colloid of silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanoparticles. SiO2 is a dense ceramic material with good chemical stability. It is readily available and affordable, making it an excellent candidate for this application. This study investigates the effect of SiO2 impregnation on the physico-mechanical properties of spruce wood. Density measurements, water uptake tests, microscopy examination, thermogravimetric analysis, and dynamic mechanical analysis were conducted on non-treated and SiO2-treated spruce wood samples. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrated that SiO2 impregnation performed under higher vacuum pressure was more effective compared to the atmospheric condition and exhibited a greater presence of SiO2 in the wood’s vascular system. SiO2 impregnation under vacuum pressure demonstrated an effective increase in the density of the wood. It also reduced the porosity, which led to a significant reduction in the water uptake of the spruce wood. The analysis of the wood viscoelastic properties revealed that SiO2 impregnation under atmospheric and vacuum conditions triggered two different reinforcing mechanisms. The results showed that a significant improvement of the spruce wood storage and loss moduli could be achieved when impregnation was performed at the highest vacuum pressure of − 90 kPa."
"Red beetroot juice fermented by water kefir grains: physicochemical, antioxidant profile and anticancer activity","This study determined the effects of red beetroot juice fermentation by water kefir grains on antioxidant and anticancer activities. The fermented red beetroot juice showed increased viable bacterial counts and titratable acidity, decreased pH, and reducing sugar. The colors of the fermented juice were purplish red and brighter than fresh juice. The capacity to scavenge free radicals of ·OH, ·O2−, ABTS·+, and DPPH· increased significantly the same as anti-proliferative activity against human hepatoma cell HepG2 by inducing apoptosis when fermented 24 h. Fourteen betalains in red beetroot juice fermented by water kefir grains at different fermentation times were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Pearson’s correlation analysis revealed that the increases in antioxidant and anticancer activities were positively correlated with the contents of 17-decarboxy-betanidin, betanidin, neobetain, and 6′-O-feruloyl-betanin following the fermentation."
Haplotype of CaSR gene is associated with risk of renal stone disease in West Indian population,"Calcium is the most abundant metabolite involved in the stone matrix. The CaSR gene controls calcium homeostasis, and genetic variation in the CaSR gene could lead to the development of renal stone disease. Therefore, the current study has been designed to assess the association of genetic variants of CaSR gene polymorphisms with renal stone disease. A single-centric prospective study has been carried out on a total of 300 participants (150 cases and 150 controls). Serum levels of calcium, creatinine, parathyroid hormone, and 24 h urine metabolites were measured. Two polymorphisms, rs1801725 and rs1042636, of the CaSR gene, have been genotyped for each participant. T test, binary logistic regression, and Chi-square analysis were used for statistical analysis. Renal stone patients had significantly higher levels of serum parathyroid hormone, creatinine, and 24-h urine metabolites in comparison to the controls. CaSR gene variants, rs1801725 (GG) and rs1042636 (AA), both have shown significant association with renal stone disease. In addition, individuals having specific genotypes along with metabolic abnormalities such as hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism are found to be at a higher significant risk of developing the renal stone disease. In the present study, the haplotype of the CaSR gene has shown an association with renal stone disease. Individuals with hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia and risk genotype have a higher susceptibility to developing renal stone disease."
Anti-biofilm activity of biochanin A against Staphylococcus aureus,"Biofilm-forming Staphylococcus aureus can easily accumulate on various food contact surfaces which induce cross-contamination and are difficult to eliminate in the food industry. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-biofilm effects of natural product biochanin A against S. aureus. Results showed that biochanin A effectively eradicated established S. aureus biofilms on different food-contact materials. Fluorescence microscopic analyses suggested that biochanin A disintegrated the established biofilms by dissociate extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) in matrix. In addition, biochanin A at the sub-MIC concentration also effectively inhibited the biofilm formation by regulating the expression of biofilm-related genes (icaA, srtA, eno) and suppressing the release of EPS in biofilm matrix. Molecular docking also demonstrated that biochanin A conducted strong interactions with biofilm-related proteins (Ica A, Sortase A, and Enolase). These findings demonstrated that biochanin A has the potential to be developed as a potent agent against S. aureus biofilm in food industries."
Physiological analysis of the improved ε-polylysine production induced by reactive oxygen species,"Epsilon-poly-L-lysine (ε-PL) is produced by Streptomyces species in acidic and aerobic conditions, which inevitably induces rapid generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The devastating effects of ROS on biomolecules and cell vitality have been well-studied, while the positive effects of ROS are rarely reported."
A Sorry Excuse for an Apology: Examining People’s Mental Representations of an Apologetic Face,"The goal of the current research was to gain an understanding of people’s mental representations of an apologetic face. In Study 1, participants’ responses were used to generate visual templates of apologetic faces through reverse correlation (Study 1a, n = 121), and a new set of participants (Study 1b, n  = 37 and 1c, n = 153) rated that image (group-level Classification Image, CI), as well as either the inverse image (group-level anti-CI in Study 1b) or base face (in Study 1c), on apology-related characteristics. Results demonstrated that people have a mental representation of an apologetic face, and that sadness is an important feature of this template. To examine similarities between mental representations of apologetic and sad faces, participants in Study 2 generated visual templates of sad faces using reverse correlation (Study 2a, n = 121). New participants (Study 2b, n = 162) were then randomly assigned to rate the averaged face, eyes, and mouths (group-level CIs) as well as the individual visual templates (individual-level CIs) generated from both studies for either how apologetic or sad they appeared. Visual templates of apologetic and sad faces were seen as apologetic, providing evidence of the prominence of sadness in mental representations of apology."
A hybrid approach to modelling and analyzing reconfiguration of photovoltaic arrays under partial shading conditions,"Partial shading is an intractable problem that reduces the power generated by the solar system. For the simple reason that it reduces the photovoltaic (PV) array power output, it is characterized by many peaks. This paper proposes four new hybrid approaches alternate total cross-tied bridge link connected (Al-TCT-BL), alternate total cross-tied triple-tied (Al-TCT-TT), double-tied (D-T), and alternate total cross-tied double-tied (Al-TCT-DT). The outcomes of the proposed methodologies are compared with the existing approaches like TCT and BL under different standard shading patterns. The output power, power loss, and the fill factor are taken into account for the analysis of the PV array. P–V and I–V characteristics are drawn for the standard pattern of shadings, and the output of the proposed topologies is compared with the existing topologies. Among the proposed hybrid topologies, the Al-TCT-TT configuration produces the maximum power under various shading patterns while decreasing the count of cross-links. The proposed hybrid reconfiguration technique is modelled in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment, and the electrical characteristics are drawn for the different shading patterns. The results obtained by the proposed techniques are compared with the existing popular approaches to find the competency of the proposed technique. The performance analysis proves the superiority of the proposed Al-TCT-TT reconfiguration approach compared to the existing approaches."
Improving Hospital Outpatient Clinics Appointment Schedules by Prediction Models,"Patient no-shows and suboptimal patient appointment length scheduling reduce clinical efficiency and impair the clinic’s quality of service. The main objective of this study is to improve appointment scheduling in hospital outpatient clinics. We developed generic supervised machine learning models to predict patient no-shows and patient’s length of appointment (LOA). We performed a retrospective study using more than 100,000 records of patient appointments in a hospital outpatient clinic. Several machine learning algorithms were used for the development of our prediction models. We trained our models on a dataset that contained patients’, physicians’, and appointments’ characteristics. Our feature set combines both unstudied features and features adopted from previous studies. In addition, we identified the influential features for predicting LOA and no-show. Our LOA model’s performance was 6.92 in terms of MAE, and our no-show model’s performance was 92.1% in terms of F-score. We compared our models’ performance to the performance of previous research models by applying their methods to our dataset; our models demonstrated better performance. We show that the major effector of such differences is the use of our novel features. To evaluate the effect of our prediction results on the quality of schedules produced by appointment systems (AS), we developed an interface layer between our prediction models and the AS, where prediction results comprise the AS input. Using our prediction models, there was an 80% improvement in the daily cumulative patient waiting time and a 33% reduction in the daily cumulative physician idle time."
How are Income and Assets Associated with Food Insecurity? An Application of the Growth Mixture Modeling,"Food insecurity remains prevalent in the United States, affecting millions of households. Research has confirmed that low income and limited assets are risk factors for food insecurity, but how income and assets are associated with food insecurity has not been fully explored in light of the fact that food insecurity endures or worsens over time for some people but not others. Using 2015, 2017, and 2019 waves of the panel study of income dynamics, this study (1) investigated the heterogeneity of food insecurity trajectories using Growth Mixture Modeling; (2) performed a multinomial logistic regression to examine how income and assets are associated with the relative risk of facing a more severe food insecurity trajectory; and (3) compared the coefficient of income with the coefficient of assets. Results of this study showed that both higher income and more assets are associated with a lower probability of facing food insecurity that worsens rather than improves with time. This study also observed that the association strength was stronger for income than for assets. These results offer insights for policies aimed at creating efficient financial support strategies (e.g., income assistance, asset building) that reduce recipients’ risk of experiencing long-term food insecurity."
Voorkeuren van patiënten bij dementiediagnostiek,"Er bestaat geen werkzaam medicijn tegen dementie. Bij (lichte) cognitieve klachten maken patiënten en hun naasten dan ook zeer verschillende afwegingen over dementiediagnostiek. We brachten de diverse persoonlijke voorkeuren in kaart in een systematisch literatuuronderzoek. Mede op basis daarvan ontwikkelden wij een keuzehulp ter ondersteuning van gezamenlijke besluitvorming tussen de patiënt, diens naasten en de huisarts."
‘Een goede organisatie van ouderenzorg begint met een gemeenschappelijke visie’,"In de oratie van hoogleraar Hein van Hout staat het perfectioneren van de ouderenzorg centraal. Enerzijds door efficiënt gebruik van beslisondersteuning. Anderzijds door betere organisatie van zorg. Dit kan helpen kwetsbare ouderen eerder op het spoor te komen, zodat ze de juiste zorg krijgen en zorgcrises vermeden worden."
Predicting Spatial and Decadal LULC Changes in the Singrauli District of Madhya Pradesh Through Artificial Neural Network Models Using Geospatial Technology,"The increasing energy demand of the burgeoning population in India has propelled the development of new thermal power plants in the country. Availability of plenty of power-grade coal and water in the form of Govind Ballabh Pant Sagar Dam led to the establishment of several thermal power plants (TPP) in the Singrauli district of Madhya Pradesh. After the construction and post-construction activities of these TPP in the district, the pristine dense forests have completely been transformed into degraded land. In the present work, change detection analysis is carried out for three-time gradients, i.e., from 2005 to 2015 at the interval of five years using Quantum GIS software to understand the land use dynamics. It is observed that the area has witnessed significant transformation during the three-time gradients, including approximately a 6.9% decline in forest cover and a 23% increase in the barren surface. Further, artificial neural network (ANN) is employed in the present work to simulate and predict land use of the year 2025. The projected LULC for 2025 reveals that as the power plants operational activities will continue and expand further, there will be a substantial increase in fallow land and scrub land by the year 2025. The percentage of the correctness of the predicted LULC map is 98.21 with an  overall Kappa index of 0.97 and a kappa histogram of 0.98. Details of the past, present and predicted LULC of an area aid the urban planners in informed decision making so as to choose, design, and implement future land use plans of the area in a sustainable manner."
Application program to detect unrecognized information regarding malignant tumors in radiology reports,Accurate disease diagnosis from radiology reports is important in medical treatment. Preventing physicians from overlooking the findings of relevant radiology reports is thus an important global issue. This study is part of a project that aims to develop and verify a program that detects and notifies physicians of diagnoses that do not appear in the patient’s medical records.
Rule selection invariance as a robustness check in collective choice and nonparametric statistical settings,"This study establishes conditional equivalence between Borda rule and rank sum collective choice. We apply the equivalence condition toward a comparison of the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney (WMW) rank sum test and sign test in non-parametric statistics, where the sign test is shown to be procedurally-equivalent to pairwise Borda rule aggregation. We further establish a social choice theoretic robustness check on the WMW test by determining whether a significant WMW rank sum winner could be a raw Borda loser (i.e., could have a p-value greater than 0.5 in a corresponding one-sided sign test). We then test whether a significant sign test winner could be a raw WMW winner. The WMW test is robust against significant victory by a raw Borda loser for almost all small sample cases (specifically, for \(\mathrm{n}<27\)) at any standard significance level (i.e., for \(\mathrm{\alpha }\le 0.10)\). The sign test is robust against significant victory by a raw rank sum loser only for \(\mathrm{n}<14\) at any standard significance level. The results provide caution against using the α = 0.10 significance level in some small sample cases of the WMW test. The robustness checks developed herein can be used generally or specifically to check whether a given set of non-parametric data passes the robustness check or whether significance for one test guarantees raw victory in the alternative test (for a given sample size n) in general. These robustness checks present a methodology to test for a weak form of qualitative equivalence across non-parametric tests. We develop a web application (http://avisss.com/visualization/RankSumHistograms.html) for such robustness checks."
Expressive voting versus information avoidance: experimental evidence in the context of climate change mitigation,"We theoretically and experimentally investigate the effect of self-serving information avoidance on moral bias in democratic and individual decisions in the context of climate change mitigation. Subjects choose between two allocations that differ in payoffs and contributions to climate change mitigation. We vary the observability of the environmental contribution, as well as the decision context associated with different levels of pivotality. If the contribution is directly observable, we find evidence for lower pivotality leading to higher levels of “green” decisions, as predicted by the low-cost theory of voting. This effect disappears if subjects can avoid information on the contribution. Instead, we find evidence for the exploitation of moral wiggle room via information avoidance in larger democracies as well as in the consumption context. Our results indicate that information avoidance substitutes expressive voting as an instrument to manage cognitive dissonance on the part of the voter. Hence, moral biases in elections might be less likely than previously thought."
Parallel volume integral equation method for three-dimensional multiple inclusion problems,"In this paper, the volume integral equation method (VIEM) is introduced for the analysis of multiple isotropic/anisotropic inclusions (or inhomogeneities) in an unbounded isotropic matrix. In order to introduce the VIEM as an accurate and efficient numerical method for the three-dimensional elastostatic inclusion (or inhomogeneity) problem, multiple isotropic/orthotropic spherical inclusions (or inhomogeneities) in an unbounded isotropic matrix under uniform remote tensile loading are investigated."
Fault diagnosis method of belt conveyor idler based on sound signal,"Damage to a belt conveyor idler will increase the downtime and maintenance cost, so it is very important to diagnose its fault. At present, the fault diagnosis of the idler of a belt conveyor is mostly based on vibration and temperature signal. However, contact fault diagnosis approaches are severely limited when sensors are inconvenient to install or when vibration and temperature signals cannot be returned. In this special case, the non-contact fault diagnosis method, represented by measuring acoustic signals, becomes a necessary means. To effectively extract mechanical state information from sound signals of belt conveyors and identify typical mechanical faults, we propose a fault detection method based on sample center distance weighted (support vector data description (SVDD)) and multi-frame fusion (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC)) features. Aiming at the disadvantage that single frame MFCC features and traditional SVDD are susceptible to noise, multi-frame fusion MFCC optimization features are used as samples, and the weighted SVDD model based on sample center distance is used for fault detection. Finally, the overall recognition accuracy of the experiment is greatly improved. It is proved that MFCC features of multi-frame fusion sound signal and weighted SVDD fault detection based on sample center distance can effectively determine whether there is a fault in the of belt conveyor idler."
Meshing characteristics of spur gear pairs with tooth modification under different assembly errors and sensitivity analysis for impact factors,"Assembly errors may change contact state of gear pairs, then induce failure and vibration. To reveal the effects of assembly errors and tooth modification on the meshing characteristics, the loaded tooth contact analysis (LTCA) is conducted through an improved algorithm. The time-varying meshing stiffness (TVMS), static transmission error (STE) and contact stress (CS) are calculated considering assembly errors and tooth modification. Then, sensitivity of meshing characteristics to coupling assembly errors are investigated based on the design of orthogonal experiment (DOE). The meshing characteristic analysis results show that assembly errors have a significant effect on mesh characteristics of the gear pair. The results of sensitivity analysis indicate that the meshing characteristic is the most sensitive to axial deviation for the model used in this paper."
An experimental investigation on upward solar air heater with impinging air jets,"This study presents and discuss the results of an experimental investigation conducted to understand and quantify the impact of air mass flow rate(m) over the heat transfer attributes of an upward solar air heater (SAHRR) utilizing impinging air jets. Experimental investigation was carried out for various mass flow rates ranging from 0.008 to 0.024 kg/s for various impinging air jet diameters (4, 6 and 8 mm). The thermal performance was evaluated based on the average value of Nusselt number, first law thermal efficiency, thermohydraulic efficiency and exergy efficiency. The lowest and the highest first law efficiency for an upward SAHRR employing 6 mm diameter jet is between 44 % and 88 %, respectively, when the solar radiation maintained is 1000 W/m2. Moreover, the final outcomes are compared with the base model (SAHRR without jet impingement) in order to highlight the positive impact of jet impingement on the performance of SAHRR."
Wind turbine airfoils optimization design by generalized regression neural network under small sample,"Neural network models can quickly and accurately predict the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine airfoils based on existing data, but the construction of a large number of learning samples requires a high upfront time cost. To address this problem, a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) model of wind turbine airfoils based on a small sample set is established, and an optimal design method for airfoil aerodynamic performance under multiple constraints is proposed. This method is used to improve the prediction accuracy of the model in the optimization process and to solve the problem of insufficient learning caused by poor training data. Based on the established optimal design model, we applied the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to complete the optimal design of NACA44XX series airfoils and obtained the optimized airfoils with maximum relative thicknesses of 15 %, 18 %, 21 %, and 24 %, respectively. The aerodynamic characteristics of the new airfoils were analyzed in comparison with the baseline airfoils. The results show that the aerodynamic properties of the new airfoils are significantly improved, with the maximum lift coefficient and maximum lift-to-drag ratio increasing by up to 16.93 % and 10.41 %. Moreover, the optimization efficiency of the method is much higher than that of the traditional one. Thus, it was verified that the method is feasible and effective."
Investigation on generating spherical gear with imaginary spherical cutter,"In this study, an imaginary spherical cutter with a straight edge was developed and used to create a spherical gear pair. First, the mathematical equation of the imaginary spherical cutter with a straight edge is established. A mathematical software package was used to display the imaginary spherical cutter. The coordinate systems relationship between the spherical gear pairs and the imaginary spherical cutter was defined. The equations of the family of the imaginary cutter surfaces were obtained by using the homogeneous coordinate transformation matrix, and a mathematical model of the spherical gear pair was created according to the theory of gearing. Using tooth contact analysis and assembly errors, the effect of assembly errors on the transmission errors of the spherical gear pairs was discussed. Through a finite element analysis software, the contact models under assembly errors were performed, and the contact stress distribution of the tooth surfaces under assembly errors was observed. As a result, the spherical gear pair was most sensitive to the assembly error of the center distance. It is the least sensitive to the vertical deviation angle of the misalignment assembly error."
"A comparative study of the detection of the fuel-injection start and stop timing of a diesel injector using a photo sensor, a shock sensor and a needle lift sensor","The fuel-injection start and stop timings of a diesel injector were measured using a photo sensor, a shock sensor, and a needle lift sensor. The fuel spray jet was detected by installing a photo sensor at the position closest to the fuel spray jet exiting the diesel injector nozzle hole. The shock sensor was mounted outside of the injector holder assembly and the fuel injection timing was measured by detecting the shock wave generated when the injector needle moved. The injector needle lift was measured by using an injector with a built-in needle lift sensor (TDI G80 sensor). The G80 sensor has an integrated solenoid allowing the detection of the movement of the injector needle. As the injector needle moves, an electrical signal is induced from the solenoid and the voltage is measured. The photo sensor, shock sensor, and needle lift sensor all confirm that the timing of the start of fuel injection by the injector can be accurately measured. The fuel injection stop timing could be measured by the photo sensor and the needle lift sensor. The variation of the fuel injection stop timing was greater than that of the fuel injection start timing. The shock sensor could not accurately measure the fuel injection stop timing. The detecting time order of the start of the fuel injection by the three sensors was in order of the needle lift sensor, the shock sensor and the photo sensor."
Moral principle explanations of supervenience,"Non-naturalists realists about morality face the challenge of explaining the supervenience of the moral facts on the natural facts. An influential recent suggestion, developed by Scanlon (2014) and Fogal and Risberg (2020), is that the non-naturalist can easily explain supervenience by appealing to explanatory moral principles, or metaphysical laws. The idea is that the general moral principles are necessary and so trivially supervene on the natural facts, while the particular moral facts are explained by the general, necessary, moral principles and the natural facts so they supervene on the natural facts too. I argue that such a strategy is unsuccessful. Either it (i) fails to explain supervenience because it doesn’t correctly identify the difference-makers for supervenience, or it (ii) does explain supervenience, but only by postulating another striking fact—and it cannot give a satisfactory explanation of this fact that properly identifies the difference-makers. Making sense of supervenience is one of the key challenges for a non-naturalist metaphysics of modality. Views based on moral principles look like they fail this challenge. Consequently, the non-naturalist should look to other metaphysical machinery to develop their view."
"Internalized stigma and associated factors among people with mental illness at University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest, Ethiopia, 2021","Internalized stigma has been found to be high among people with mental illness (PWMI) and it results in poor treatment outcome, increased disability and high economic burden. So, this study was designed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of high internalized stigma among PWMI attending psychiatric follow-up at University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest, Ethiopia, 2021."
A Comparison of the Female and Male Racial Disparities in Imprisonment,"We examine the behavior of the incarceration rate and the racial disparity in imprisonment for black women over the period 1978–2016 and compare this to the results for black men. At the beginning of our sample, the racial disparity is high and of similar magnitude for both groups. Black women and black men both experience a large run-up in incarceration between 1978 and 1999. This run-up can be entirely explained by the increase in overall incarceration in the USA during this period. Black women and black men both experience a decrease in incarceration between 1999 and 2016, but the decline for women is much steeper. The decline in incarceration for black women is entirely explained by a decline in the racial disparity, where for men, a decline in the disparity and a decline in the overall male incarceration rate are both important. At the state level, there are frequent upturns in the racial disparity in the 1980s for both black women and black men, followed by frequent downturns in the 1990s. The data provide no prima facie evidence that the 1994 Crime Bill exacerbated the racial disparity in imprisonment. By the end of the sample, the racial disparity for females is 1.8, and the disparity for males is 5.2, where this disparity measures the per capita black imprisonment rate divided by the per capita white imprisonment rate for each group."
Review on Flight Control Law Technologies of Fighter Jets for Flying Qualities,"Since the 1970s, designing flight control laws to ensure good flying qualities and increase mission efficiency has been an issue for many years. This is still regarded as a core technology challenge in aircraft development. When a fly-by-wire flight control system (FBW FCS) technology was adopted to the aircraft, the classical control technique in the form of single-input single-output (SISO) type was applied in early years. Meanwhile, a modern control theory tied with classical control in the form of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) such as eigenstructure assignment (EA) was recently applied, and the nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) has been also applied to the highly maneuverable fighters. In this paper, we identify major technologies such as aerodynamics, control stick and sensors, including flight control technologies which have been applied to the production fighter aircrafts so far, and analyze the trend of development of control law technologies. To the extent of education, these reviews regarding the prospects on flight control technologies would be most helpful to engineering."
Dual medial and anterior approach for excision of extraosseous synovial hip osteochondroma: a case report,"Osteochondromas are the most common benign bone tumors occurring near the end of long bones.

Effects of non-modifiable risk factors of Alzheimer’s disease on intracortical myelin content,"Non-modifiable risk factors of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have lifelong effects on cortical integrity that could be mitigated if identified at early stages. However, it remains unknown whether cortical microstructure is affected in older individuals with non-modifiable AD risk factors and whether altered cortical tissue integrity produces abnormalities in brain functional networks in this AD-risk population."
"Genetic variability of panicle architecture and nutritional parameters in indigenous finger millet genotypes from Koraput, Eastern Ghats of India","Exploration of genetic variability in indigenous germplasm is an essential step for future breeding programs. The present study evaluated the genetic variation on panicle traits, proximate compositions and nutraceuticals in 33 traditional finger millet genotypes and five improved varieties from Koraput, Eastern Ghats of India. Significant difference of panicle characteristics: panicle length, panicle number, panicle weight and seed weight were observed among finger millet genotypes under experimental field condition. The yield was varied from 13.2 to 32.4 q ha−1. The proximate compositions such as moisture significantly varied from 9.4 to 18.4 g 100 g−1, ash 1.2–3.5 g 100 g−1, fat 0.9–2.7 g 100 g−1, protein 4.7–14.25 g 100 g−1, carbohydrate 66.6–77.1 g 100 g−1, fiber 4.7–18.3 g 100 g−1 and energy 324–360 kcal 100 g−1. The phenol, flavonoid, vitamin C and antioxidant capacity of studied millets were varied from 5.6 to 25.36 mg 100 g−1, 2.75–39.36 mg 100 g−1, 7.2–76.80 µg g−1 and 1.9–15.75%, respectively. The first two axis of principal component analysis explained 39.7% of total variation, which reflected huge difference between explored genotypes. The highest positive loading was observed for seed weight followed by fiber, panicle weight, energy, protein, antioxidant and fat and are the major determinant for phenotypic variability. The heritability and genetic advance varied from 66.7 to 99.0% and 3.4 to 88.4%, respectively. Indigenous finger millet genotypes: Bhalu, Ladu, Telugu and Bada recorded superior panicle traits and energy content, whereas Mami, Janha and Bada rich in flavonoid and antioxidants. These genotypes can be utilized in future crop improvement program."
Finsler–Randers model for anisotropic constant-roll inflation,"In this work, we study constant-roll inflation driven by a scalar field with the Finsler model. In this scenario, using the Hamilton–Jacobi-like formalism, an ansatz for the Hubble parameter (as a function of the scalar field), and some restrictions on the model parameters, we found new exact solutions for the inflaton potential, which include power-law, and hybrid among others. In this model, even-order slow-roll parameters approach non-negligible constants while their odd-order is asymptotically zero."
Inferring turbulent environments via machine learning,"The problem of classifying turbulent environments from partial observation is key for some theoretical and applied fields, from engineering to earth observation and astrophysics, e.g., to precondition searching of optimal control policies in different turbulent backgrounds, to predict the probability of rare events and/or to infer physical parameters labeling different turbulent setups. To achieve such goal one can use different tools depending on the system’s knowledge and on the quality and quantity of the accessible data. In this context, we assume to work in a model-free setup completely blind to all dynamical laws, but with a large quantity of (good quality) data for training. As a prototype of complex flows with different attractors, and different multi-scale statistical properties we selected 10 turbulent ‘ensembles’ by changing the rotation frequency of the frame of reference of the 3d domain and we suppose to have access to a set of partial observations limited to the instantaneous kinetic energy distribution in a 2d plane, as it is often the case in geophysics and astrophysics. We compare results obtained by a machine learning (ML) approach consisting of a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) against Bayesian inference which exploits the information on velocity and entropy moments. First, we discuss the supremacy of the ML approach, presenting also results at changing the number of training data and of the hyper-parameters. Second, we present an ablation study on the input data aimed to perform a ranking on the importance of the flow features used by the DCNN, helping to identify the main physical contents used by the classifier. Finally, we discuss the main limitations of such data-driven methods and potential interesting applications."
Rule selection invariance as a robustness check in collective choice and nonparametric statistical settings,"This study establishes conditional equivalence between Borda rule and rank sum collective choice. We apply the equivalence condition toward a comparison of the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney (WMW) rank sum test and sign test in non-parametric statistics, where the sign test is shown to be procedurally-equivalent to pairwise Borda rule aggregation. We further establish a social choice theoretic robustness check on the WMW test by determining whether a significant WMW rank sum winner could be a raw Borda loser (i.e., could have a p-value greater than 0.5 in a corresponding one-sided sign test). We then test whether a significant sign test winner could be a raw WMW winner. The WMW test is robust against significant victory by a raw Borda loser for almost all small sample cases (specifically, for \(\mathrm{n}<27\)) at any standard significance level (i.e., for \(\mathrm{\alpha }\le 0.10)\). The sign test is robust against significant victory by a raw rank sum loser only for \(\mathrm{n}<14\) at any standard significance level. The results provide caution against using the α = 0.10 significance level in some small sample cases of the WMW test. The robustness checks developed herein can be used generally or specifically to check whether a given set of non-parametric data passes the robustness check or whether significance for one test guarantees raw victory in the alternative test (for a given sample size n) in general. These robustness checks present a methodology to test for a weak form of qualitative equivalence across non-parametric tests. We develop a web application (http://avisss.com/visualization/RankSumHistograms.html) for such robustness checks."
An intelligent fractional-order system for the biological parameters regulations,"In recent times, controllers have been widely used for tuning the biological parameters of the human body. Biological parameters play a vital role in determining the health status of the human body. Any change/difference in biological components leads the person to severe diseases and even death. Therefore, an effective tuning mechanism is necessary to tune these biological parameters optimally. Several tuning models were proposed in the past based on control systems, but those models require more resources for tuning the biological parameters. Also, those models are highly complex in design and computational time. To find a solution for this described issue, a novel hybrid controller named bat-based recurrent fractional-order system has been developed in this article. The bat fitness is incorporated into the controller to provide the finest tuning outcomes. Here, the designed model tunes the biological parameters such as glucose, insulin, and gene expression. Besides, the classification layer of the recurrent neural system is tuned by the bat functions that have afforded better biological parameter prediction outcomes in a very short time. Furthermore, the developed controller is executed in a MATLAB environment, and the performance has been checked for biological data acquisition. In addition, the outcomes were evaluated based on settling time, overshoot, accuracy, and error rate; sensitivity and stability assessments were made to prove the system's performance. Furthermore, to carry the present research work further, the unstable range of the proposed model has been discussed along with the error rate. Subsequently, the executed model's outcomes were compared with the existing controller to verify the results. The implementation and comparative assessment proved that the designed controller had earned the finest tuned results. Hence, the developed model is more suitable for the biological instrumentation application for predicting and tuning the parameters to the desired level."

Failure Envelopes for Strip Footings on Sand Overlying Non-homogeneous Clay Under Combined Loading,"This paper applies the finite element limit analysis by using the average of upper and lower bound theorems to evaluate the bearing capacity of rough strip footings on sand overlying non-homogeneous clay under eccentric-inclined loads. The adaptive meshing technique is used to improve the results of the bearing capacity factors. The effect of the thickness of the sand layer, the strength non-homogeneity, and the eccentric-inclined load are investigated. Both swipe and probe loadings are used to identify the failure envelopes and the failure mechanisms for a strip footing under vertical, horizontal, and moment loads. New results and failure envelopes are presented by considering the effects of the clay non-homogeneity."
Health-related quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease: a comparison of patients receiving nurse-led versus conventional follow-up care,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consisting of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic disorder with a considerable negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

Usefulness of the skeletal muscle index in postoperative ileus of colorectal cancer patients: a retrospective cohort study,"Postoperative complications of colorectal cancer mainly include infections (surgical site infection, remote infection, etc.), post-operative ileus (POI), and anastomosis leakage. POI reportedly prolongs the hospital stay and increases medical costs. Therefore, predicting POI is very important. There have been some reports on the relationships between sarcopenia and postoperative complications in colorectal cancer patients, but none have been limited to POI. We therefore conducted a retrospective clinical study with a logistic regression analysis to confirm the risk factors for ileus after colorectal cancer surgery."

"Clinical features of cancer with unknown primary site (clinical features, treatment, prognosis of cancer with unknown primary site)","Cancer of unknown primary site(CUPs) is a metastatic syndrome with an unidentifiable primary tumor, even after extensive workup to seek the primary site. CUPs accounts for about 3%-5% of the total number of all cancer diagnoses worldwide. The current precision medicine era has reclassified patients with CUPs into the favorable and unfavorable prognostic subset. In this study clinical characteristics and treatment of patients of CUPs were retropactively analysed. Thirty-two patients treated from July 2016 to October 2021 were included in the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Tianjin Medical University(Tianjin, China).Common symptoms were anemia, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, abdominal pain, edema/multiple serous cavity effusion. Patients with good prognostic factors achieved good outcomes with treatment, conversely, patients with poor prognosis were generally treated empirically and had poorer outcomes. After anti-tumor treatment, the total effective rate was 41 percent(41% was the percentage of patients who achievedtumour respons). To the end of follow-up, after anti-tumor treatment, the median Overall Survival(OS) of patients was 5.4 months."

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the efficacy of magnesium and vitamin B6 in alleviating the symptoms of RLS/WED."
Utilizing source code syntax patterns to detect bug inducing commits using machine learning models,"Detecting Bug Inducing Commit (BIC) or Just in Time (JIT) defect prediction using Machine Learning (ML) based models requires tabulated feature values extracted from the source code or historical maintenance data of a software system. Existing studies have utilized meta-data from source code repositories (we named them GitHub Statistics or GS), n-gram-based source code text processing, and developer’s information (e.g., the experience of a developer) as the feature values in ML-based bug detection models. However, these feature values do not represent the source code syntax styles or patterns that a developer might prefer over available valid alternatives provided by programming languages. This investigation proposed a method to extract features from its source code syntax patterns to represent software commits and investigate whether they are helpful in detecting bug proneness in software systems. We utilize six manually and two automatically labeled datasets from eight open-source software projects written in Java, C++, and Python programming languages. Our datasets contain 642 manually labeled and 4014 automatically labeled buggy and non-buggy commits from six and two subject systems, respectively. The subject systems contain a diverse number of revisions, and they are from various application domains. Our investigation shows the inclusion of the proposed features increases the performance of detecting buggy and non-buggy software commits using five different machine learning classification models. Our proposed features also perform better in detecting buggy commits using the Deep Belief Network generated features and classification model. This investigation also implemented a state-of-the-art tool to compare the explainability of predicted buggy commits using our proposed and traditional features and found that our proposed features provide better reasoning about buggy commit detection compared to the traditional features. The continuation of this study can lead us to enhance software effectiveness by identifying, minimizing, and fixing software bugs during its maintenance and evolution."
Simple preparation of environmentally friendly and durable superhydrophobic antibacterial paper,"As non-biodegradable single-use plastic packaging products have been restricted in recent years, paper-based materials have attracted considerable attention owing to their environmental benefits. However, the hydrophilic nature of paper-based materials limits their application as replacements for non-biodegradable plastics. In this study, an environmentally friendly and multifunctional superhydrophobic paper was developed using silane-modified superhydrophobic nanofibrillated cellulose (M-NFC) via a simple spraying method. This paper can reduce the white pollution caused by non-degradable single-use plastic packaging products. Upon spraying the base paper with 1.5 g/m2 of M-NFC, the coated paper (CP) exhibited excellent superhydrophobicity (water contact angle of 160°), water repellency (Cobb value of 7.5 g/m2), strong durability to sandpaper abrasion, finger-wipe, bending, folding, and sustained exposure to corrosion media (HCl with a pH of 1, NaOH with a pH of 10, high temperature treatment at 180 °C, and ultraviolet irradiation). Additionally, the CP surface directly prevented the adhesion of S. aureus and E. coli and also indirectly repelled solid contaminants upon washing with water, thereby demonstrating highly efficient antibacterial and anti-fouling properties. The durable and multifunctional superhydrophobic paper developed in this study provides a novel direction for solving white pollution and also presents a new research pathway for the potential applications of paper-based materials."
Fabrication of fabric-like Bacterial Cellulose/Collagen membranes by applying textile padding method for wound dressing applications,"Nowadays, more and more biomaterials have been studied to accelerate wound healing, especially Bacterial Cellulose (BC). Besides ideal properties, pristine BC has been challenged by modern wound dressing requirements (antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities, etc.). Despite previous studies to functionalize BC, high demand is still pressing for productive and efficient methods in creating functional BC wound dressings in composite form. In this work, functional fabric-like BC/Collagen membranes for wound dressing have been investigated using the textile padding method with Collagen, Lactic Acid, Tannic Acid, and Tween 80. The obtained BC/Collagen possesses an innovative grid-embossing surface morphology, high antibacterial activity (up to 94.25 ± 1.31% for Escherichia coli and 78.25 ± 8.50% for Staphylococcus aureus within just 2 min of contact), hydrophilicity (contact angle of less than 15\(^\circ\) within the first second) with water, wound exudate, acidic and alkaline sweats, impressive absorptive capacity (\(\approx\)10 g/100 \(\hbox {cm}^{2}\) within 30 min and \(\approx\)130 g/100 \(\hbox {cm}^{2}\)/30 days) and acidic pH (\(\approx\)2.9). Such properties have proven that these fabric-like BC/Collagen membranes can satisfy modern wound dressing requirements. As a result, this study has provided a pre-eminent finishing method for BC as compared with currently available methods (e.g. high substance distribution and penetration based on material topography, \(\approx\)30 times less needed chemical for environmental protection and resource saving)."
Comparison Between the Effect of Intra-Scalar Methylprednisolone and Sodium Hyaluronate in Impedance and Electrically Evoked Compound Action Potentials in Cochlear Implant Patients,"To evaluate and compare the effect of intra-scalar methylprednisolone and sodium hyaluronate on cochlear implants’ impedance and electrically evoked compound action potentials thresholds. In a prospective randomized clinical trial, 103 children with pre-lingual hearing loss candidates for cochlear implantation at a tertiary hospital were divided into three groups based on intervention. Intraoperatively, one group received intra-scalar methylprednisolone, the second sodium hyaluronate, and the third group was the control group. Impedance and electrically evoked compound action potentials (e-ECAP) thresholds on long-term follow-up were evaluated and compared in these three groups. Significant decrease in impedance and e-ECAP thresholds were observed in all groups in a 4-year follow-up. No statistically significant difference was observed among all mentioned groups. Impedance and e-ECAP thresholds decrease in the long term, and using topical intra-scalar Healon or methylprednisolone may not significantly affect these parameters."
Complicated nonlinear oscillations caused by maneuvering of a flexible spacecraft equipped with hinged solar arrays,"We present a general methodology for the nonlinear dynamical modeling of a three-axis stabilized spacecraft equipped with flexible solar arrays. The large-span multi-panel solar arrays are modeled as flexible thin plates that are connected to the rigid central body of the spacecraft by means of nonlinear flexible hinges. We construct a low-dimensional yet accurate dynamical model by using a Galerkin expansion in terms of global modes of the system that we compute first by using the Rayleigh–Ritz method. The hinged connections between the rigid and flexible parts of the system are imposed employing Lagrange multipliers. The model is used to study the spacecraft response triggered by various maneuvering scenarios. We in particular focus on the coupling between vibrations of the flexible components and the rigid motion of the spacecraft induced by hinge nonlinearities during these orbital and attitude maneuvering operations. In all cases considered, it is found that four global modes are sufficient to accurately compute the system’s response. We also observe other complicated nonlinear dynamical phenomena, such as hysteresis and superharmonic resonance that may be of concern in spacecraft design. Our modeling approach can be applied to other multibody systems directly."
"Interaction phenomena between solitons, lumps and breathers for the combined KP3-4 equation","The Hirota’s bilinear method is used to determine the N-soliton solutions of the combined KP3 and KP4 equation, from which the M-lump solutions that decay to zero in all directions in the plane are obtained by using long wave limit when \(N=2M\). Then, we discuss some novel hybrid solutions between lumps, breathers and solitons. In order to shade more light on the dynamical characteristics of the acquired solutions, numerical simulations have been performed by means of the 3D figures under careful choice of the values of the parameters involved. These results may be useful for understanding the propagation phenomena of nonlinear localized waves. The hybrid solutions describing molecules between lumps, breathers and solitons are also presented."
Motivating factors for frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A survey in Japan,"Healthcare workers (HCWs), who are at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic, treated COVID-19 patients under many types of stress for over a year. As an external motivating factor, incentives could be important for HCWs dealing with COVID-19. However, there has been no research regarding the change in the consciousness of HCWs during the unrelenting waves of COVID-19. Therefore, we conducted a survey of HCWs during different waves of COVID-19 (the second and fourth waves in Japan). An open web-based survey was conducted among HCWs who wore PPE while treating COVID-19 patients. The first survey of HCWs in Japan was conducted from August 27 to September 9, 2020, while the second survey was conducted from April 7 to May 10, 2021, during the second and fourth waves, respectively. The first and second surveys had 157 and 125 participants, respectively. There were no significant differences in the characteristics of the participants in the first and second survey groups regarding the types of occupation, age, sex, or full-time status. The percentage of HCWs who required financial incentives to maintain motivation remained high (88.5% vs. 82.7%). In addition, most frontline HCWs hope for regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, which will be provided free of charge, as a necessary incentive. External motivating factors, such as financial and other incentives, were important to maintain the motivation of HCWs during the second and fourth waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan."
Myositis ossificans of the chest wall in an 8-year-old boy: a case report of a diagnostic pitfall,"Myositis ossificans of the chest wall is extremely unusual with fewer than a dozen reported cases. In addition, the occurrence in children younger than 10 years is extremely rare. We report a case of an 8-year-old male who presented with painful and progressively enlarging left-sided chest wall mass. The tumor showed close histo-morphological mimicry with osteosarcoma. Moreover, the characteristic radiographic findings of myositis ossificans were absent. The age of the patient and the absence of attachment to the rib helped exclude extra-skeletal and parosteal osteosarcomas, respectively. The patient was doing well 4 months after surgery."
Densely Connected Dilated Residual Network for Image Denoising: DDR-Net,"Image denoising is an important ill-posed problem of image processing. The main goal in image denoising is to suppress noise while protecting textures of the image. A plethora of methods and different approaches have targeted image denoising problem. In this manuscript, we propose a novel method which brings dense and residual blocks together with dilated convolutions in image denoising applications. The proposed method introduces new strategies for proper combination of dense residual blocks and dilated convolution layers. The resulting approach is called as Densely connected Dilated Residual Network (DDR-Net). The proposed DDR-Net extracts multi-scale information by employing dilated convolutions. Use of dilated convolutions leads to improved receptive field performance while keeping the complexity of the network in check. Residual and dense connections on the other hand prevent loss of information along the DDR-Net pipeline. Simulations are performed in both color and grayscale image denoising settings. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate that the proposed network architecture leads to improved results when compared to multiple high performance convolutional denoising networks from the recent literature."
Adaptive Style Modulation for Artistic Style Transfer,"Arbitrary-style-per-model (ASPM) style transfer algorithms transfer arbitrary styles based on a single model. Statistics-based learning algorithms of ASPM, represented by adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN), conduct instance normalization and then perform an affine transformation on target features. These algorithms are computationally efficient and easy to embed in convolutional neural networks. Consequently, they are widely used in image synthesis tasks to control the style of the resulting images. However, the style of stylized images may be a combination of content and stylized images, which suggests that these methods do not transform styles accurately. In this work, we rethink the function of AdaIN in controlling style. We show that the role of AdaIN is to (1) give each input content image a specific optimization target, (2) dynamically set cross-channel correlations, and (3) act as a feature selector after combining it with an activation function. Accordingly, we propose adaptive style modulation (AdaSM), which fully leverages the three roles mentioned above and thereby enables more precise control of global style. Experimental results show that AdaSM provides superior style controllability, alleviates the style blending problem, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in artistic style transfer tasks."
HSF1 expression in tumor-associated macrophages promotes tumor cell proliferation and indicates poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), are crucial for the survival and development of tumor cells.

HSF1's clinical importance and biological role in TAMs are still unknown."

PRAME Staining in Sinonasal Mucosal Melanoma: A Single-Center Experience,"Sinonasal mucosal melanoma (MM) is a rare, aggressive melanoma subtype. Complete surgical excision, with or without adjuvant radiotherapy, remains the cornerstone of treatment and yields adequate locoregional control. Metastatic MM is managed similarly to metastatic cutaneous melanoma but with poorer survival. PReferentially expressed Antigen in MElanoma (PRAME) has been identified as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in the treatment of cutaneous melanoma."
A Wire-driven Elastic Robotic Fish and its Design and CPG-Based Control,"To simulate the complex and continuous undulation of fishtail in nature, the method of adopting the discrete Multi-Joint mechanism requires a certain number of degrees of freedom, which results in the complexities of mechanism and control necessarily. Compared with Multi-Joint, flexible tail is a better scheme due to continuum, robustness, and simpler control. Hence, this paper proposes a wire-driven elastic robotic fish with flexible tail, which simulates fish muscle through multi-wire drive and adopts a fishlike spine design based on elastic component. Due to these distinctive designs, our robotic fish not only realizes the compliant simulation of fishlike swimming gait, but also owns higher bionic degree. Further, the kinematics model and speed estimation model of the wire-driven elastic robotic fish are developed, and the error between the body wave and the desired fishlike swimming gait is further optimized so as to determine the appropriate parameters of central pattern generator. The results show that the optimized body wave of fishtail matches well with the desired fishlike swimming gait and the RMSE of the stable swimming speed between simulations and experiments is 0.045 m/s, which validates the proposed model and optimization method. Finally, the relationships between the frequency and swimming speed under small amplitude are explored, from which we find that amplitude has a greater impact on speed than frequency at high frequency, and the maximum swimming speed of about 0.54 m/s, i.e., 1.02 BL/s, is obtained."
The exhaustion of lymphocytes is the main factor that decreases the sensitivity of QFT-GIT detection in silicosis,"Tuberculosis infection is a major complication of silicosis, but there is no study on whether silicosis can affect the sensitivity of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assays. This study will analyze the relationship between silicosis and QFT-GIT, determine the main factor of the QFT-GIT sensitivity decrease in silicosis and explore the methods to increase the sensitivity."

Visual masking deficits in schizophrenia: a view into the genetics of the disease through an endophenotype,"Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder determined by a complex mixture of genetic and environmental factors. To better understand the contributions of human genetic variations to schizophrenia, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of a highly sensitive endophenotype. In this visual masking endophenotype, two vertical bars, slightly shifted in the horizontal direction, are briefly presented (vernier offset). Participants are asked to indicate the offset direction of the bars (either left or right). The bars are followed by a grating mask, which makes the task both spatially and temporally challenging. The inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between the vernier and the mask was determined in 206 patients with schizophrenia, 109 first-order relatives, and 143 controls. Usually, in GWAS studies, patients are compared to controls (i.e., a binary task) without considering the large differences in performance between patients and controls, as it occurs in many paradigms. The masking task allows for a particularly powerful analysis because the differences in ISI within the patient population are large. We genotyped all participants and searched for associations between human polymorphisms and the masking endophenotype using a linear mixed model. We did not identify any genome-wide significant associations (p < 5 × 10−8), indicating that common variants with strong effects are unlikely to contribute to the large inter-group differences in visual masking. However, we found significant differences in polygenetic risk scores (PRS) between patients and controls, and relatives and controls."
Novel role of AMPK in cocaine reinforcement via regulating CRTC1,"Repeated cocaine exposure causes compensatory neuroadaptations in neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region that mediates reinforcing effects of drugs. Previous studies suggested a role for adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor, in modulating neuronal morphology and membrane excitability. However, the potential involvement of AMPK in cocaine use disorder is still unclear. The present study employed a cocaine self-administration model in rats to investigate the effect of AMPK and its target cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein-regulated transcriptional co-activator 1 (CRTC1) on cocaine reinforcement and the motivation for cocaine. We found that intravenous cocaine self-administration significantly decreased AMPK activity in the NAc shell (NAcsh), which persisted for at least 7 days of withdrawal. Cocaine reinforcement, reflected by self-administration behavior, was significantly prevented or enhanced by augmenting or suppressing AMPK activity pharmacologically and genetically, respectively. No difference in sucrose self-administration behavior was found after the same manipulations. The inhibition of AMPK activity in the NAcsh also increased the motivation for cocaine in progressive-ratio schedules of reinforcement, whereas the activation of AMPK had no effect. The knockdown of CRTC1 in the NAcsh significantly impaired cocaine reinforcement, which was rescued by pharmacologically increasing AMPK activity. Altogether, these results indicate that AMPK in the NAcsh is critical for cocaine reinforcement, possibly via the regulation of CRTC1 signaling. These findings may help reveal potential therapeutic targets and have important implications for the treatment of cocaine use disorder and relapse."
CD52 and OXPHOS—potential targets in ibrutinib-treated mantle cell lymphoma,"Altered features of tumor cells acquired across therapy can result in the survival of treatment-resistant clones that may cause minimal residual disease (MRD). Despite the efficacy of ibrutinib in treating relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma, the obstacle of residual cells contributes to relapses of this mature B-cell neoplasm, and the disease remains incurable. RNA-seq analysis of an ibrutinib-sensitive mantle cell lymphoma cell line following ibrutinib incubation of up to 4 d, corroborated our previously postulated resistance mechanism of a metabolic switch to reliance on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in surviving cells. Besides, we had shown that treatment-persisting cells were characterized by increased CD52 expression. Therefore, we hypothesized that combining ibrutinib with another agent targeting these potential escape mechanisms could minimize the risk of survival of ibrutinib-resistant cells. Concomitant use of ibrutinib with OXPHOS-inhibitor IACS-010759 increased toxicity compared to ibrutinib alone. Targeting CD52 was even more efficient, as addition of CD52 mAb in combination with human serum following ibrutinib pretreatment led to rapid complement-dependent-cytotoxicity in an ibrutinib-sensitive cell line. In primary mantle cell lymphoma cells, a higher toxic effect with CD52 mAb was obtained, when cells were pretreated with ibrutinib, but only in an ibrutinib-sensitive cohort. Given the challenge of treating multi-resistant mantle cell lymphoma patients, this work highlights the potential use of anti-CD52 therapy as consolidation after ibrutinib treatment in patients who responded to the BTK inhibitor to achieve MRD negativity and prolong progression-free survival."
The relationship between primary school children’s inhibition and the processing of rational numbers,"Processing rational numbers is difficult for many children. The natural number bias is one possible explanation for why children struggle with rational numbers. It refers to the tendency to overgeneralize the properties of natural numbers. In this study, it is argued that in order to be successful in rational number tasks, individuals need to inhibit or suppress their unwanted impulses (in this case the tendency to apply natural number properties). It was investigated whether inhibition plays a role in the occurrence of the natural number bias among primary school children by administering two rational number tasks, two Stroop tasks and a questionnaire measuring inhibitory skills. The results indicated that primary school children were hampered by the natural number bias both in terms of accuracy rates and response times. Additionally, the results did not yield strong evidence for a relationship between inhibition and the occurrence of the natural number bias."
"Association of Phenotypic Aging Marker with comorbidities, frailty and inflammatory markers in people living with HIV","Aging characteristics in people living with HIV (PLWH) are heterogeneous, and the identification of risk factors associated with aging-related comorbidities such as neurocognitive impairment (NCI) and frailty is important. We evaluated predictors of novel aging markers, phenotypic age (PhenoAge) and phenotypic age acceleration (PAA) and their association with comorbidities, frailty, and NCI."
Hippo Signaling Regulates Blastema Formation During Limb Regeneration in Chinese Mitten Crab (Eriocheir sinensis),"Limb autotomy and regeneration are specific adaptations of crustaceans in response to external stress and attacks, which make them a suitable model to investigate the mechanism of organ regeneration in invertebrates. In this study, the Hippo gene of Eriocheir sinensis (EsHPO) was identified, and the effects of Hippo signaling on limb regeneration were evaluated. The expression of EsHPO and other key components of Hippo signaling was down-regulated during the basal growth phase in response to limb autotomy stress and then up-regulated during the proecdysial growth phase. The descending expression patterns of Hippo signal components were correlated with transcriptional activation of YKI and downstream target genes during the blastema formation stage, which suggested that Hippo signaling plays a key role during limb regeneration in E. sinensis. To further test the hypothesis, the transcription factor YKI was blocked via verteporfin injection after autotomy, which disrupted limb regeneration by repressing wound healing and preventing blastema emergence. Furthermore, our experiments revealed that the proliferation of blastema cells was blocked by verteporfin. In addition, the expression of genes related to ECM remodeling, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis resistance was down-regulated following the injection of verteporfin. Our findings therefore indicate that Hippo signaling is essential for successful wound healing and limb regeneration in E. sinensis by inducing ECM remodeling, as well as promoting the proliferation and repressing the apoptosis of blastema cells."
"Genetic variability of panicle architecture and nutritional parameters in indigenous finger millet genotypes from Koraput, Eastern Ghats of India","Exploration of genetic variability in indigenous germplasm is an essential step for future breeding programs. The present study evaluated the genetic variation on panicle traits, proximate compositions and nutraceuticals in 33 traditional finger millet genotypes and five improved varieties from Koraput, Eastern Ghats of India. Significant difference of panicle characteristics: panicle length, panicle number, panicle weight and seed weight were observed among finger millet genotypes under experimental field condition. The yield was varied from 13.2 to 32.4 q ha−1. The proximate compositions such as moisture significantly varied from 9.4 to 18.4 g 100 g−1, ash 1.2–3.5 g 100 g−1, fat 0.9–2.7 g 100 g−1, protein 4.7–14.25 g 100 g−1, carbohydrate 66.6–77.1 g 100 g−1, fiber 4.7–18.3 g 100 g−1 and energy 324–360 kcal 100 g−1. The phenol, flavonoid, vitamin C and antioxidant capacity of studied millets were varied from 5.6 to 25.36 mg 100 g−1, 2.75–39.36 mg 100 g−1, 7.2–76.80 µg g−1 and 1.9–15.75%, respectively. The first two axis of principal component analysis explained 39.7% of total variation, which reflected huge difference between explored genotypes. The highest positive loading was observed for seed weight followed by fiber, panicle weight, energy, protein, antioxidant and fat and are the major determinant for phenotypic variability. The heritability and genetic advance varied from 66.7 to 99.0% and 3.4 to 88.4%, respectively. Indigenous finger millet genotypes: Bhalu, Ladu, Telugu and Bada recorded superior panicle traits and energy content, whereas Mami, Janha and Bada rich in flavonoid and antioxidants. These genotypes can be utilized in future crop improvement program."
Dual medial and anterior approach for excision of extraosseous synovial hip osteochondroma: a case report,"Osteochondromas are the most common benign bone tumors occurring near the end of long bones. In this case report, we demonstrate the successful treatment of a proximal femoral osteochondroma in a pediatric patient excised through a dual medial and anterior approach with no hip dislocation."
An assessment of groundwater potential zones of Mal block of Dooars region (India) using remote sensing and GIS with AHP method,"Groundwater is a crucial natural resource for sustainable water supplies throughout the world. But over-exploitation of groundwater has led to water depletion. Due to anthropogenic activity, the demand for groundwater is increasing in Mal block of the Dooars region. The present paper focuses on assessing groundwater potential zones of Mal block of Dooars region in India. In this study, remote sensing and GIS with the AHP method were applied to combine different thematic layers for delineating groundwater potential zones. The result reveals gentle slope areas in the southern portion, namely Chapadanga, Rajadanga, Kranti, Neora, Uttar saripakuri, Changmari, and Gangadebi on the map, are considered as high potential for groundwater zones. The map identifies hilly terrains in the north-western part, namely Malbazar, Damdim, Odlabari, Bagrakote, Haihai pathar, and Rangamati tea garden, unsuitable for groundwater zone. The obtained data of groundwater fluctuation and various dug wells from the central Ground water board (CGWB) are used to validate the produced groundwater potential zones’ map. The findings of the present study will help water resource planners, managers and decision-makers in developing groundwater resources and ensuring sustainable use of groundwater in the future."
Assessment of lakes of Vadodara city in terms of water quality indices and their comparison,"The water quality index plays a vital role in defining the overall characteristics of a water body. The current article discusses and compares three different water quality indices, viz., the National Sanitation Foundation Index, the overall water quality index and the overall index of pollution, for assessing the quality of lake water bodies of Vadodara, Gujarat, India. Water quality parameters for three ponds were determined for 1 year and were used to compute the three water quality indices. All three indices showed different results in depicting the actual status of a water body from medium to non-polluted to polluted water body, and hence some modifications in indices have been proposed by changing the unit weightage in the individual index. Modification in unit weight in the National Sanitation Foundation Index and overall water quality index was done according to the parameter dominance. When adjustments are made to these indices based on the parameter dominance and pollution of the water body and compared to the WQI calculated with a pre-determined range and parameter weightage, the modified index helps determine the water body’s actual state."
Impact of early postoperative factors on changes in skeletal muscle mass after esophagectomy in older patients with esophageal cancer,"Loss of skeletal muscle mass, measured by the skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), after esophagectomy negatively impacts prognosis. However, the information to develop novel supportive care options for preventing loss of skeletal muscle mass is limited. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate the impact of early postoperative factors on change in SMI 4 months after curative esophagectomy in older patients with esophageal cancer."
A Comparison of the Female and Male Racial Disparities in Imprisonment,"We examine the behavior of the incarceration rate and the racial disparity in imprisonment for black women over the period 1978–2016 and compare this to the results for black men. At the beginning of our sample, the racial disparity is high and of similar magnitude for both groups. Black women and black men both experience a large run-up in incarceration between 1978 and 1999. This run-up can be entirely explained by the increase in overall incarceration in the USA during this period. Black women and black men both experience a decrease in incarceration between 1999 and 2016, but the decline for women is much steeper. The decline in incarceration for black women is entirely explained by a decline in the racial disparity, where for men, a decline in the disparity and a decline in the overall male incarceration rate are both important. At the state level, there are frequent upturns in the racial disparity in the 1980s for both black women and black men, followed by frequent downturns in the 1990s. The data provide no prima facie evidence that the 1994 Crime Bill exacerbated the racial disparity in imprisonment. By the end of the sample, the racial disparity for females is 1.8, and the disparity for males is 5.2, where this disparity measures the per capita black imprisonment rate divided by the per capita white imprisonment rate for each group."
Two Step Fabrication of Nano-ZnO-α-FeOOH Composite for Experimental and Modeling Studies of Removal of Indigo Carmine and Alizarin Red S in Batch Process,"Zinc oxide/goethite (Z-α-F) nanocomposite was prepared from Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and freshly prepared α-FeOOH (goethite) nanoparticles. The material was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron diffraction atomic X- ray (EDAX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), Brunauer–Emmette–Teller (BET) surface area, and thermo-gravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TGA/DTA) methods. The surface area and average sizes of the spherically rode-like embedded nanomaterial were 62.20 m2 g−2 and 41.11 nm. The adsorbent was used in single and binary adsorption of indigo carmine (IDC) and alizarin red S (ARS). The pseudo-second-order kinetics described the adsorption processes well with intraparticle diffusion model as rate limiting, while the Langmuir isotherm data fitted well indicating monolayer, and homogeneous adsorption. The ∆H values (+ 185.18 and + 131.59 kJ mol−1) and ∆S (+ 0.63 and + 0.45 kJ mol−1) for IDC and ARS respectively, for the single system revealed that the adsorption processes were endothermic and spontaneous at the Z-α-F-aqueous interface, while the negative ∆G values revealed spontaneous adsorption. The Ea values (+ 12.03 and 8.53 kJ mol−1) indicated diffusion controlled (physical adsorption) processes. The multiple isotherm data showed that the extended and modified Languir models gave good fit for adsorption of IDC and ARS dyes respectively suggesting that the energy of adsorption in the IDC-ARS system is constant and equal for each site, and no interaction between the components. The adsorption capacity ratio, R, values were all less than one (R < 1) indicating antagonistic effect in the IDC-ARS system."
Review on Flight Control Law Technologies of Fighter Jets for Flying Qualities,"Since the 1970s, designing flight control laws to ensure good flying qualities and increase mission efficiency has been an issue for many years. This is still regarded as a core technology challenge in aircraft development. When a fly-by-wire flight control system (FBW FCS) technology was adopted to the aircraft, the classical control technique in the form of single-input single-output (SISO) type was applied in early years. Meanwhile, a modern control theory tied with classical control in the form of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) such as eigenstructure assignment (EA) was recently applied, and the nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) has been also applied to the highly maneuverable fighters. In this paper, we identify major technologies such as aerodynamics, control stick and sensors, including flight control technologies which have been applied to the production fighter aircrafts so far, and analyze the trend of development of control law technologies. To the extent of education, these reviews regarding the prospects on flight control technologies would be most helpful to engineering."
Pre-braking behaviors analysis based on Hilbert–Huang transform,"Previous studies have shown that about 90% of traffic accidents are due to human error, which means that human factors may affect a driver's braking behaviors and thus their driving safety, especially when the driver makes a braking motion. However, most studies have mounted sensors on the brake pad, ignoring to some extent an analysis of the driver's behavior before the brake pad is pressed (pre-braking). Therefore, to determine the effect of different human factors on drivers' pre-braking behaviors, this study focused on analyzing drivers' local joints (knee, ankle, and toe) by a motion capture device. A Hilbert–Huang Transform (HHT)-based local human body movement analysis method was used to decompose the realistic complex pre-braking actions into sub-actions such as intrinsic mode functions (IMF1, IMF2, etc.). Analysis of the results showed that IMF1 is a common and necessary action when pre-braking for all drivers, and IMF2 may be the safety assurance action that allows right-foot transverse movement at the beginning part of the pre-braking process. We also found that the experienced, male, and Phys.50 groups may have consistent characteristics in the HHT scheme, which could mean that such drivers would have better performance and efficiency during the pre-braking process. The results of this study will be useful in decomposing and discerning the specific actions that lead to accidents, providing insights into driver training for novice drivers, and guiding the construction of daily automated driver assistance or accident prevention systems (advanced driver assistance systems, ADASs)."
Hemolysin function of Listeria is related to biofilm formation: transcriptomics analysis,"Listeriolysin O (LLO) is the main virulence protein of Listeria monocytogenes (LM), that helps LM escape lysosomes. We previously found that the cellular immune response elicited by L.ivanovii (LI) is weaker than that elicited by LM. We speculated that this may be related to the function of ivanolysin O (ILO). Here, we constructed hemolysin gene deletion strain, LIΔilo, and a modified strain, LIΔilo::hly, in which ilo was replaced by hly. Prokaryotic transcriptome sequencing was performed on LI, LIΔilo, and LIΔilo::hly. Transcriptome differences between the three strains were compared, and genes and pathways with significant differences between the three strains were analyzed. Prokaryotic transcriptome sequencing results revealed the relationship of ilo to the ribosome, quorum sensing, and phosphotransferase system (PTS) pathways, etc. LIΔilo exhibited attenuated biofilm formation ability compared to LI. Biofilm formation was significantly recovered or even increased after replenishing hly. After knocking out ilo, the relative expression levels of some virulence genes, including sigB, prfA, actA, smcL, and virR, were up-regulated compared to LI. After replenishing hly, these genes were down-regulated compared to LIΔilo. The trend and degree of such variation were not completely consistent when cultured in media containing only monosaccharides or disaccharides. The results confirmed that hemolysin is related to some important biological properties of Listeria, including biofilm formation and virulence gene expression levels. This is the first comprehensive study on ILO function at the transcriptomic level and the first evidence of a relationship between Listeria hemolysin and biofilm formation."
Effects of non-modifiable risk factors of Alzheimer’s disease on intracortical myelin content,"Non-modifiable risk factors of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have lifelong effects on cortical integrity that could be mitigated if identified at early stages. However, it remains unknown whether cortical microstructure is affected in older individuals with non-modifiable AD risk factors and whether altered cortical tissue integrity produces abnormalities in brain functional networks in this AD-risk population."
Modeling daily fluctuations in everyday cognition and health behaviors at general and person-specific levels: a GIMME analysis,"The non-ergodic nature of cognitive processes and the new person-specific paradigm suggest that psychological research should be conducted at both group and intra-individual levels. In this study, we applied the group iterative multiple model estimation (GIMME) approach to investigate the contemporaneous and lagged relationship between individuals’ everyday cognition (i.e., brief n-back test) and contextual health behavior states (i.e., mental sharpness, social engagement, physical activity, mental engagement, fatigue, and emotional state) measured using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). We focused on a community-dwelling middle-aged and older adult population. Results identified both group and individual patterns regarding the association between EMA captured everyday cognition and health variables."
A high-dimensional optimization method combining projection correlation-based Kriging and multimodal parallel computing,"In surrogate-based optimization (SBO), the recognized issues associated with the high-dimensional surrogate models focus on the prohibitive computational costs and the low model accuracy. However, there is a lack of effective solutions in the face of the ‘curse of dimensionality’. In this paper, we propose a novel Kriging metamodel to remedy this deficiency. The Kriging model based on projection correlation (KPC) introduces the projection correlation into the Kriging modeling process as prior information, taking into account the nature of hyperparameters. The effectiveness and accuracy of the KPC are illustrated through 10–70-dimensional numerical examples. Furthermore, a parallel computing strategy that combines the multi-peak characteristics of expected improvement and minimizing prediction (MEI&MP) is proposed to further improve high-dimensional optimization efficiency and potential. The global performance and optimization efficiency of our method are validated via typical test functions and structural optimization problems."
Intelligent Control of Double Boost Converter Interfaced with Multilevel Inverter for Electrical Vehicle Applications,"This work presents a double boost converter (DBC) integrated with three-level diode clamped multilevel inverter (TLDCI). The proposed converter can be used for renewable energy, grid or electric vehicle applications. The double boost converter provides twice the output voltage in comparison with convention boost converter. The DBC is modelled and simulated under open loop and closed loop operating conditions. Proportional integral (PI) and fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) are used in closed loop operation. The DBC further integrated with three-level diode clamped inverter. Sine and third harmonic pulse width modulation (SPWM and TH-PWM) is used to generate pulses for TLDCI. The proposed converter simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. Comparison results in open and closed loop such as output voltage error for double boost converter and line, phase voltages and total harmonic distortion for inverter output voltage and current are presented."
Multifunctional Grid Supported Solar Water Pumping System Utilizing Synchronous Reluctance Motor,"Synchronous reluctance motors (SyRMs) due to their attractive benefits over conventional ac machines, better efficiency, robust design and absence of rare-earth permanent magnets, offer an attractive solution to applications such as solar power-based water pumping. However, in the case of solar power, due to its diurnal nature, is unfeasible for an uninterruptible water supply. To overcome this drawback, a grid-interfaced system combined with a solar PV array is developed. In this work, a grid-PV interfaced system coupled with a water pumping load, driven by SyRM, and additional domestic loads are presented. Single-phase grid is integrated with the solar PV system (via a boost converter) and its DC link through a rectifier and power factor correction enabled boost converter, to enable unidirectional power flow from the grid. A single-phase H-bridge voltage source converter is also included in the system to enable supply from the DC link to the domestic loads. The unity power factor and reduced total harmonics distortion are achieved through the implemented control. The feasibility of the water pumping and load supply on the developed system is validated on a laboratory prototype designed to operate this system under simulated climatic conditions."
Approximation algorithms for the lower bounded correlation clustering problem,"Lower bounded correlation clustering problem (LBCorCP) is a new generalization of the correlation clustering problem (CorCP). In the LBCorCP, we are given an integer L and a complete labelled graph. Each edge in the graph is either positive or negative based on the similarity of its two endpoints. The goal is to find a clustering of the vertices, each cluster contains at least L vertices, so as to minimize the sum of the number of positive cut edges and negative uncut edges. In this paper, we first introduce the LBCorCP and give three algorithms for this problem. The first algorithm is a random algorithm, which is designed for the instances of the LBCorCP with fewer positive edges. The second one is that we let the set V itself as a cluster and prove that the algorithm works well on two specially instances with fewer negative edges. The last one is an LP-rounding based iterative algorithm, which is also provided for the instances with fewer negative edges. The above three algorithms can quickly solve some special instances in polynomial time and obtain a smaller approximation ratio. In addition, we conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of our algorithms."
Release of ranibizumab using a porous poly(dimethylsiloxane) capsule suppressed laser-induced choroidal neovascularization via the transscleral route,"The administration of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs in the posterior eye segment with sustained release through less invasive methods is a challenge in the treatment of age-related macular disease. We developed a flexible capsule device using porous poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) that was able to release ranibizumab. The porous PDMS sheet was fabricated by salt-leaching of a micro-sectioned PDMS sheet containing salt microparticles. Observation with scanning electron microscopy revealed that the pore densities could be adjusted by the concentration of salt. The in vitro release study showed that the release rate of fluorescein isothiocyanate-tagged albumin could be adjusted based on the pore density of the porous PDMS sheet. Ranibizumab could be released in a sustained-release manner for 16 weeks. The device was implanted on the sclera; its efficacy in terms of the suppression of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in rats was compared with that of monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab. At 8 and 18 weeks after implantation, the CNV area was significantly reduced in rats that received the ranibizumab-releasing device compared with those that received the placebo device. However, although monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab reduced CNV for 8 weeks, this reduction was not sustained for 18 weeks. In conclusion, we demonstrated a novel controlled-release device using a porous PDMS sheet that could suppress CNV via a less invasive transscleral route versus intravitreal injections. This device may also reduce the occurrence of side effects associated with frequent intravitreal injections."
Boosting fast interfacial Li+ transport in solid-state Li metal batteries via ultrathin Al buffer layer,"Na superionic conductor (NASICON)-type Li1.5Al0.5Ge0.5P3O12 (LAGP) solid state electrolytes (SSEs) have attracted significant interests thanks to the prominent ionic conductivity (> 10−4 S·cm−1) at room temperature and superb stability in air. Unfortunately, its application has been hindered by the lithium dendrites and the intrinsic interfacial instability of LAGP towards metallic Li, etc. Herein, by magnetron sputtering (MS), an ultrathin Al film is deposited on the surface of the LAGP pellet (Al-LAGP). By in-situ alloying reaction, the spontaneously formed LiAl buffer layer inhibits the side reaction between LAGP SSEs and Li metal, and induces the uniform distribution of interfacial electric field as well. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the LiAl alloy surface promotes the diffusion of lithium atoms due to the lower energy barrier, thereby inhibiting the formation of lithium dendrites. Consequently, the Li/Al-LAGP-Al/Li symmetric cells show a low resistance of 210 Ω and a durable lifespan over 1,200 h at a high current density of 0.1 mA·cm−2. Assembled all solid state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) with LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode significantly improve cycle stability and rate performance, proving a promising stabilization strategy towards the NASIOCN type electrolyte/anode interface in solid state Li metal batteries."
Boosted microwave absorption performance of transition metal doped TiN fibers at elevated temperature,"Due to the temperature and frequency response of electromagnetic (EM) loss, how to realize the effective design of microwave absorption materials (MWAMs) at elevated temperature is highly desirable for practical applications. Herein, transition metal-doped titanium nitride (M-TiN, M = Fe or Co) fibers were fabricated, the distortion of TiN lattice could cause the adjustable charge enrichment, which played a profound influence on the dielectric response and EM microwave absorption (EMWA) performances. Benefiting from the negative correlation between dielectric loss and temperature, more loss mechanism could be introduced, which would effectively enhance dielectric loss and EMWA performances at elevated temperature. The optimal EMWA performances of Fe-TiN fibers/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composites were realized with a wide temperature range (298–423 K): the reflection loss (RL) could reach 99% (RL < −20 dB) at 12.2 GHz with 1.8 mm, when the filler content was only 15.0 wt.%. Compared with the undoped-TiN fibers/PDMS and Co-TiN fibers/PDMS composites, the excellent EMWA of Fe-TiN fibers/PDMS composite could be attributed to the reasonably synergistic polarization loss and conduction loss. Based on systematic analysis of the variable-temperature EM parameters and EMWA performances, the optimization of EMWA performances in wide temperature domain could be realized by introducing appropriate polarization loss and its compensating. Hopefully, this work provides a new strategy for regulating the dielectric response and designing effective MWAMs at elevated temperature."
Electrospun Fe0.64Ni0.36/MXene/CNFs nanofibrous membranes with multicomponent heterostructures as flexible electromagnetic wave absorbers,"Two-dimensional metal carbide or nitride materials (MXenes) are widely used in electromagnetic wave absorption because of their unique structure. Herein, a novel composite preparation strategy has been proposed to design dendritic nanofibers based on the electrostatic spinning methods. The multifunctional MXene nanosheets are used as the dendritic matrix, and magnetic nanoparticles are embedded in the nanosheets as magnetic loss units. Multidimensional nanocomposites have interlaced carbon fiber networks, large-scale magnetically coupled networks, and a lot of multi-heterojunction interface structures, which endow the composites with extraordinary conduction loss, magnetic loss, and polarization loss capabilities, respectively. The impedance matching and loss mechanisms of the composites are improved by optimizing the synergistic relationship between the components and building a suitable structure. The optimum reflection loss (RL) of −54.1 dB is achieved at 2.7 mm and a wide effective absorption bandwidth (EAB, RL below −10 dB) of 7.76 GHz is obtained at a small thickness of 2.1 mm for the nanocomposites. The distinctive microstructures of the nanofibrous membranes give rise to their flexibility, waterproof, and electromagnetic wave absorption performance and endow the nanofibrous membranes potential to be utilized as lightweight, efficient electromagnetic wave protective fabric in harsh environment."
A self-activated NO-releasing hydrogel depot for photothermal enhanced sterilization,"The ascendant danger of bacterial infections has resulted in an urgent requirement for developing new antibacterial approaches. Recently, nitric oxide (NO) has shown a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity while avoiding resistance. However, achieving effective NO-based antibacterial therapies remains challenging, mired by the safety concerns of NO donor, residual toxicity by the ingredients, or complicated procedures. Herein, a self-activated NO-releasing hydrogel depot is fabricated by Ca2+-crosslinked sodium alginate doped with CaO2 nanoparticles, L-arginine, and oxidized mesoporous carbon nanoparticles (OMCN) for photothermal enhanced bacteria killing. The locally concentrated H2O2, generated from the reaction of CaO2 nanoparticles and water, could oxidize L-arginine to release NO. Meanwhile, benefiting from the remarkable photothermal effect of OMCN, the hybrid hydrogel possesses a synergistic sterilization behavior in combating both Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteria in vitro. Moreover, the dual therapeutic hydrogel displays high efficiency in treatment of bacteria-infected mice with back wound model while showing no distinct toxicity. In addition, the restricted environment of hydrogel makes it easy to remove all the components from the infected wound, alleviating possible side effects from exogenous H2O2. As such, the designed NO-synergistic photothermal hydrogel provides a promising strategy for treating bacterial infections."
Highly efficient tumor-targeted nanomedicine assembled from affibody-drug conjugate for colorectal cancer therapy,"Affibody is a new class of small non-immunoglobulin affinity proteins that possesses high affinity at the picomole level to several tumor overexpressed receptors. Owing to the simple framework, affibody is flexible for modification with payload, but the relatively low molecular weight of this construction simultaneously results in short half-life time which hinders its application in cancer therapy. In this work, we prepared a nanomedicine self-assembled from the conjugate of affibody (ZPDGFRβ:09591, PDGFRβ: platelet-derived growth factor receptor β) with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) through cathepsin B cleavable dipeptide linker for targeted colorectal cancer therapy. The nanoscale characteristics of ZPDGFRβ:09591-MMAE affibody-drug conjugate nanomedicine (ZPDGFRβ:09591-M ADCN) resulted in enhanced pharmacokinetics, improved drug accumulation, and promoted biosecurity performance than those of free drugs. As a result, ZPDGFRβ:09591-M ADCN exhibited excellent antitumor efficacy with tumor inhibition rates (TIR) over 99.0% in PDGFRβ-positive tumor models with small solid tumors (∼ 150 mm3) or large established tumors (∼ 500 mm3), indicating that ZPDGFRβ:09591-MMAE ADCN is promising for the clinic application in colorectal cancer therapy."
Thermal stability of Te nanowires and their crystallography-determined surface evolution at elevated temperatures,"Nanowires are fantastic nanostructures for designing new functional devices because of their extraordinary properties. However, nanowires usually suffer pronounced size and surface effects with decreasing diameter size. Whether their structure and thermal stability can still fill the requirements of practical applications is a critical issue to be figured out. Herein, Te nanowires with diameters ranging from sub-10 to over 80 nm are used as samples to probe into this issue. In situ heating experiments are performed on these Te nanowires using an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy combined with a chip-based heating holder. It is found that Te nanowires suffer sublimation at elevated temperatures rather than melting, showing size-dependent sublimation scenarios. The Te nanowires with diameter smaller than 20 nm sublimate below 205 °C, while the larger ones with diameter around 85 nm require a higher temperature of around 225 °C. During sublimation-induced shape evolution, the interfacial wetting equilibrium and crystal orientations play critical roles, leading to the formation of spherical surfaces or featured facets at the free surfaces. A mean contact angle of 107.5° is determined at the C—Te interface when the crystalline Te nanowires stay in a quasi-liquid equilibrium state. However, once the crystalline feature is overwhelming, e.g., at moderate temperatures, the \(\left({10\bar 11} \right)\), \(\left({11\bar 20} \right)\), and \(\left({10\bar 10} \right)\) facets govern the free surface, despite the wetting condition at the interfaces."
Aerosolized immunotherapeutic nanoparticle inhalation potentiates PD-L1 blockade for locally advanced lung cancer,"Despite therapeutic advancements, the prognosis of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LANSCLC), which has invaded multiple lobes or the other lung and intrapulmonary lymph nodes, remains poor. The emergence of immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is transforming cancer treatment. However, only a fraction of lung cancer patients benefit from ICB. Significant clinical evidence suggests that the proinflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression correlate positively with response to the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. We report here a liposomal nanoparticle loaded with cyclic dinucleotide and aerosolized (AeroNP-CDN) for inhalation delivery to deep-seated lung tumors and target CDN to activate stimulators of interferon (IFN) genes in macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Using a mouse model that recapitulates the clinical LANSCLC, we show that AeroNP-CDN efficiently mitigates the immunosuppressive TME by reprogramming tumor-associated macrophage from the M2 to M1 phenotype, activating DCs for effective tumor antigen presentation and increasing tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells for adaptive anticancer immunity. Intriguingly, activation of interferons by AeroNP-CDN also led to increased PD-L1 expression in lung tumors, which, however, set a stage for response to anti-PD-L1 treatment. Indeed, anti-PD-L1 antibody-mediated blockade of IFNs-induced immune inhibitory PD-1/PD-L1 signaling further prolonged the survival of the LANSCLC-bearing mice. Importantly, AeroNP-CDN alone or combination immunotherapy was safe without local or systemic immunotoxicity. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a potential nano-immunotherapy strategy for LANSCLC, and mechanistic insights into the evolution of adaptive immune resistance provide a rational combination immunotherapy to overcome it."
A composite peptide-supramolecular microneedle system for melanoma immunotherapy,"Despite recent advances in melanoma treatment through the use of antibody immunotherapy, the clinical benefit remains restricted by its inefficient infiltration and immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment (TME). In addition, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have often occurred due to the off-target binding of therapeutic drugs to normal tissues after systematic administration. Herein, we constructed an integrated and cascaded drug delivery system for the treatment of melanoma. In addition to blocking the programmed cell death protein 1 or its ligand (PD-1/PD-L1) axis, the PD-L1 targeting peptide (FE) with spherical micelle self-assembly characteristics could also effectively encapsulate the immune adjuvant resiquimod (R848), and form a complete nano drug. FER was further integrated into tumor-responsive microneedles (MNs) to establish FER@MN and could reach the cascaded functions. FER could be sustainedly released from the MN system and disassemble into monomers, achieving PD-1/PD-L1 axis blockade whilst reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME. Notably, FER@MN permits the controllable release and retention enhancement of the targeting peptide in the TME, thus causing prolonged PD-L1 blockade effect. It is demonstrated that this synergistic treatment could efficiently inhibit melanoma growth, providing a new strategy for the combination treatment of melanoma."
Disrupting Maternal Transmission of Depression: Using Integrative Data Analysis (IDA) to Examine Indirect Effects of the Family Check-Up (FCU) Across Three Randomized Trials,"Maternal depression is a well-established risk factor for the development of depression in offspring. As such, reducing maternal depression may be key to effective prevention efforts to reduce offspring’s depression. Based on the broad risk represented by maternal depression, examining cross-over effects of parent-focused interventions on maternal depression is important. The present study examined improvements in maternal depression as a mediator of the long-term effects of the Family Check-Up (FCU) prevention program on youth depression across three randomized controlled trials. The FCU is a family-focused intervention originally designed to reduce youth problem behaviors, particularly conduct problems and substance use, but has also been found to have cross-over effects on other youth problem behaviors, including internalizing symptoms. We utilized integrative data analysis that allows for powerful tests of prevention effects across trials, specifically moderated nonlinear factor analysis, to integrate data across three trials: one trial initiated in early childhood and two in early adolescence. Using a latent growth modeling approach, we first examined direct effects of the FCU on changes in maternal depression. Then we examined the mediating effect of maternal depression on changes in both parent and youth reports of youth depression. A significant intervention effect on maternal depression was observed across the three trials, with the FCU predicting improvements in maternal depression. In turn, such improvements predicted a reduction in the growth in both parent and youth reports of youth depressive symptoms across 10 years post baseline. These results demonstrate the utility in addressing cross-over effects of family-focused interventions in reducing the long-term development of depression in youth through mediating pathways."
A new generalized failure criterion and its plane strain strength characteristics,"The failure characteristics of geotechnical materials are quite complex, among which there are obvious differences between soil materials and rock materials. In order to describe the failure characteristics of soil materials and rock materials uniformly, a new failure and yield criterion, called VML criterion, is proposed in this paper. This strength criterion has the following characteristics. (1) On the deviatoric plane, the criterion can be expressed as a power parameter expression of von Mises criterion and spatial mobilized plane (SMP) criterion, so it can be used to describe cohesive materials such as metals or frictional materials such as sand. (2) On the meridian plane, another power parameter expression can be used to consider tensile stress strength. On the meridian plane, the material strength envelope can be expressed as a curve, so the hydrostatic pressure effect of soil material can be reasonably considered. (3) In order to consider the volumetric compression yield properties of soil materials under isotropic compression, a yield criterion considering the volumetric compression yield properties is also proposed on the deviatoric plane. Since geotechnical materials are often in plane strain condition in engineering, a VML criterion expression considering plane strain condition is proposed in this paper. The criterion shows that the internal friction angle of soil under plane strain is usually 1.1 times of that under conventional triaxial compression. The comparison between the predicted and tested data shows that the VML criterion proposed in this paper can be widely applied to the failure simulation of rock and soil materials, and the plane strain VML criterion can also be applied to the failure prediction with plane strain state."
The efficiency of endoscopic versus open surgical interventions in adult benign laryngotracheal stenosis: a meta-analysis,"The optimal treatments for adult benign laryngotracheal stenosis presently remains controversial. The majority of the disadvantages of endoscopic interventions with high recurrence rate and open surgical therapy accompanied by sophisticated techniques, complication and mortality, highlights the dilemma of option for treatments."
Can the extension of the global value chain production length promote carbon emissions reduction in China's equipment manufacturing industry?,"In the context of localization of Global Value Chain (GVC) and stricter carbon emission requirements, the impact of participating in GVC on carbon emission reduction has become one of the most crucial criteria for China's manufacturing industry to consider whether to deepen its participation in GVC. In order to clearly and directly reflect the change in the production distance between the original input and the final product, we use the GVC production length to express the degree of participation in GVC. And in order to make the research more targeted and typical, we select the equipment manufacturing industry as the research object. Using the data from the World Input–Output Database (WIOD), we empirically analyze the GVC production length under different cross-border production activities on the basis of the theoretical mechanism. The results show that the extension of the GVC production length can significantly promote the carbon emissions reduction. In the decomposition part, the extension of simple GVC production length can effectively promote carbon emissions reduction. Therefore, it is suggested that China's equipment manufacturing industry should continue to deeply participate in the high-end production links of GVC and improve its status in the complex GVC production activities."
Streamflow-based watershed resilience assessment in a tropical savannah region of India,"Watersheds are vital dynamic natural systems with varying climatic, hydro-geologic and land-use and land-cover conditions. Hence, the resilience assessment of watersheds is a cumbersome task and imperative for natural resources managers. The study of watershed resilience necessitates a large amount of data, time and process-based modelling approaches. To address this problem, the study put forward a framework for the watershed resilience assessment based on the changes and the signal given by the watershed during the transition from one state to another. Streamflow is considered the key parameter for the assessment of watershed resilience, which is the response of watersheds to hydro-climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities inside the watershed boundary. The proposed framework is demonstrated with the help of watersheds of the Budhabalanga River basin in the Odisha state of India. The study revealed that the flow of the Budhabalanga River is highly influenced by the hydro-climatic conditions as well as land-use and land-cover, which has varied due to various anthropogenic activities. The upstream area of the river basin is found to be more resilient compared to other parts. Further, the streamflow at the three stations, namely Baripada, Manitri and Govindpur, in the Budhabalanga River basin shows potential for critical transition or even possible drift towards a lower resilience condition after 2013. The study illustrates the usefulness of the framework to study watershed resilience where time and availability of data are key issues for studying the resilience of watershed systems through an integrated hydro-climatological and ecosystem model."
A tripartite evolutionary game for marine economy green development with consumer participation,"As buyers of marine final products, consumers are the beneficiaries of marine products and services. Only when marine products and services are accepted by consumers can they have market value. Therefore, making full use of consumers' value orientation and giving play to consumers' role in supervision, evaluation and selection can reduce the regulatory pressure and cost of local governments; it is of great significance to promote green transformation of marine-related producers and green development of marine economy. Therefore, the key to the healthy and sustainable development of the marine economy lies in how to play the automatic balance mechanism between the three main bodies of marine-related producers, local governments and consumers. Therefore, this paper applies the evolutionary game method to explore potential strategic changes for marine-related producers, local government, and consumers to promote marine economy green development under different scenarios, conducting an evidence-based simulation to verify the conclusions. The results indicate that marine-related producers’ green transformation is based on the condition of obvious profits and the degree of consumer participation needs the guidance of local government departments. As long as green awareness can be formed, consumers will always buy marine green products, continue to supervise and constrain the behavior of marine producers, and gradually reduce the administrative pressure of local government departments. Therefore, according to the above conclusions, this paper starts from the government, marine-related producers and consumers, respectively, and puts forward countermeasures and suggestions for the three to complement each other and realize the green development of marine economy."
Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose disease on avocado fruit in Taiwan,"Anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a limiting factor in avocado production worldwide. In Taiwan, Colletotrichum spp. cause post-harvest disease on avocado and greatly reduce the shelf life of the fruit. The aim of this study was to identify the species causing avocado anthracnose in Taiwan and characterize their pathogenicity. In this study, mature avocado fruits with brown lesions were collected from 13 orchards in avocado production areas in Taiwan from 2008 to 2010 and from 2019 to 2020. Eighty-seven Colletotrichum isolates were isolated from the lesions of avocado fruits. Eighty-six isolates were assigned to the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex according to the Apn2-Mat1-2 intergenic spacer and partial mating type (Mat1-2) gene (ApMat) sequence. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis based on ApMat sequences indicated that the 86 isolates formed four clades, C1 to C4. A multi-gene phylogeny based on partial actin, calmodulin, chitin synthase (CHS), GAPDH, ribosomal internal transcribed spacer, and beta-tubulin (TUB) sequences further confirmed the species in the four clades, namely Colletotrichum fructicola (C1), Colletotrichum siamense (C2 and C4), and Colletotrichum tropicale (C3). One isolate, Col-735, was identified to be Colletotrichum eriobotryae according to a phylogenetic tree constructed with the CHS, GAPDH, and TUB sequences. Pathogenicity tests on wounded ‘Choquette’ and ‘Zhongpu green peel’ avocado fruits showed the above four Colletotrichum species were pathogenic on these fruits. This is the first report studying Colletotrichum species and their pathogenicity on avocado in Taiwan, and C. eriobotryae is reported as an avocado fruit pathogen for the first time."
Airworthiness Qualification of a High-Pressure Turbine Disk for a Low Bypass Turbofan Engine,"A single stage high-pressure turbine disk has been designed for a low bypass turbofan engine. The turbine disk operates at extreme operating conditions of temperature and rotational speed with cyclic load due to high throttle excursion. The complex mission profile of these engines demands reliable operation of the turbine throughout the flight envelope maintaining structural integrity. Therefore, qualification of the HP turbine disk is a challenging task. This paper presents the analyses and qualification tests carried out on HP turbine disk to examine the structural integrity as well as the life of the turbine disk. Successful completion of the qualification tests assure the airworthiness of the turbine disk for the aero engine for safe and reliable operation within the flight envelope."
Exploiting wild sea buckthorn as a nutraceutical ingredient for the development of novel functional Himalayan cheese,"The demand for foods containing functional ingredients has increased to a great extent as people prefer foods with health-promoting properties. The present study was aimed to prepare chhurpi- a traditional Himalayan dried cheese, supplemented with sea buckthorn leaves (SBL) having inherent nutraceutical properties. The results revealed that the addition of SBL (1.5%, 2.5% and 3.5%) to chhurpi significantly changed its color and texture. The FT-IR spectra revealed that intensity of peaks between 3400–3200 cm−1 and 1200–800 cm−1 of the enriched chhurpi samples increased significantly. The total flavonoids and total phenolics of the chhurpi samples also increased significantly from 0.05–4.63 mg catechin equivalents/g and 7.55–63.04 mg GAE/g, respectively. Enriched chhurpi showed increased anti-diabetic, anti-obesity and anti-proliferative properties. The organoleptic characteristics of enriched chhurpi samples were modified considerably and the chhurpi with 2.5% SBL was given maximum scores. HPLC analysis of SBL confirmed the presence of phenolics (gallic acid, ferulic acid and vanillic acid) and flavonoid compounds (quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin)."
Tanshinone IIA (TSIIA) represses the progression of non-small cell lung cancer by the circ_0020123/miR-1299/HMGB3 pathway,"Tanshinone IIA (TSIIA), a multi-pharmaceutical compound, has been demonstrated to have anti-tumor properties. This study explores the potential regulatory mechanism of TSIIA on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression. The cytotoxicity of TSIIA was evaluated by MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) assays. Expression levels of circ_0020123 (hsa_circ_0020123) and microRNA-1299 (miR-1299) were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were analyzed by MTT, colony formation, transwell, wound-healing, or flow cytometry assays. The relationship between miR-1299 and circ_0020123 or HMGB3 (high mobility group box 3) was verified by the dual-luciferase reporter and/or RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. Protein level of HMGB3 was measured by western blotting. The relationship between TSIIA and circ_0020123 was confirmed by xenograft assay. TSIIA reduced xenograft tumor growth in vivo and repressed proliferation, migration, invasion, and facilitated apoptosis of NSCLC cells in vitro. TSIIA reduced circ_0020123 and HMGB3 expression, whereas elevated miR-1299 expression in NSCLC cells. Circ_0020123 knockdown enhanced the repressive influence of TSIIA treatment on the malignancy of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. Circ_0020123 sponged miR-1299 to regulate HMGB3 expression under TSIIA treatment. MiR-1299 inhibitor reversed circ_0020123 knockdown-mediated influence on malignant behaviors of NSCLC cells under TSIIA treatment. HMGB3 elevation offset the suppressive impact of miR-1299 mimic on the malignancy of NSCLC cells under TSIIA treatment. TSIIA curbed NSCLC progression by the circ_0020123/miR-1299/HMGB3 axis, manifesting that the TSIIA/circ_0020123/miR-1299/HMG regulatory network might be a potential treatment strategy for NSCLC."
A WRKY Transcription Factor PmWRKY57 from Prunus mume Improves Cold Tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana,"Prunus mume, a woody perennial tree, is valued for its ornamental traits and has been cultivated for a long history. Low temperature is the main environmental factor restricting the distribution and affecting the growth of P. mume. In plants, some WRKY transcription factors have been reported to participate in regulating cold tolerance. However, there were few researches about functional characterization of WRKYs involving in P. mume cold response. Here, a cold-induced WRKY gene named as PmWRKY57 was cloned from a P. mume cultivar ‘Guhong Zhusha.’ PmWRKY57 protein harboring a WRKY domain and a C2H2 zinc finger motif belongs to Group IIc of WRKY family. The PmWRKY57 protein was located to the nucleus and has transcriptional activation activity. PmWRKY57-overexpresing Arabidopsis thaliana lines showed improved cold tolerance, compared to wild-type plants. Under cold treatment, the leaves of transgenic lines contained significantly lower malondialdehyde content, and higher levels of superoxide dismutase activity, peroxidase activity, and proline content than wild-type plants. Furthermore, the expression levels of cold-response genes such as AtCOR6.6, AtCOR47, AtKIN1, and AtRCI2A were up-regulated in leaves of transgenic A. thaliana compared to those in wild-type plants. This study characterized the function of PmWRKY57 in improving cold tolerance of plants."
Rapid synthesis of MCM-41 and SBA-15 by microwave irradiation: promising adsorbents for CO2 adsorption,"It is known that the world scenario is one of constant search for sustainable technologies that can reduce the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. This is because CO2 is seen as the main responsible for the increase in the generation of greenhouse gases, which leads to global warming and climate change. The development of efficient adsorbents for CO2 capture is a current challenge. MCM-41 and SBA-15 were synthesized in a microwave reactor and used as adsorbents in this work. Microwave irradiation presents itself as an easy synthesis strategy with less preparation time and energy requirement. The silica synthesis period was extremely reduced (1 h) at a temperature of 60 and 80 °C in the microwave reactor, obtaining silica with good textural and chemical properties. The CO2 adsorption isotherms were performed at 0, 25, and 40 °C at 1 bar. The MCM-41 and SBA-15 present favorable results for CO2 capture processes, showing that pure silica synthesized by microwave already obtains promising results, reaching a maximum adsorption capacity of 2.16 mmol g−1 (1 bar—0 °C) and a good fit for the Langmuir, DsL and Toth models. Furthermore, to increase CO2 adsorption, the mesoporous silica was also modified via impregnation with branched polyethylene diamine (PEI) or tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA). It is worth mentioning that microwave irradiation reduced the synthesis steps and improved the properties and adsorption capacity of the silica. This work opens new opportunities in the efficient preparation of materials that require optimizing the adsorbent synthesis process."
Green synthesis spinel ferrite nanosheets and their cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity,"Spinel ferrite nanosheets have attracted particular attention in medical and applied sciences due to their high magnetic and flexible properties and biocompatibility. In this study, ferrite-spinel nanosheets were synthesized using Nepeta bornmuelleri. This synthesis method is a potentially low-cost and environmentally friendly method. The physicochemical properties of the synthesized nanosheets were determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and scanning electron microscopy (TEM). The functional groups present in the plant extract, which are possibly responsible for the synthesis of nanosheets, were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results showed that the nanosheets have a size in the range of less than 100 nm. Cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity of produced nanosheets were studied. The effect of cytotoxicity of spinel ferrite nanosheets on rat cells was evaluated. Spinel ferrite nanosheets are toxic. The results of antimicrobial tests showed that Streptococcus mutants, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to the concentration of 25–50 μg/mL of spinel ferrite nanosheets. Spinel ferrite nanosheets have an antimicrobial effect on these pathogenic pathogens. The anticancer effect of synthesized nanoparticles showed that increasing the concentration of nanosheets decreased the survival rate of cancer cells, which indicated the direct interaction effect of the dose on the inhibition rate of nanosheets."
Numerical Assessment of Microtunnelling Induced Pavement Settlement,"There is an increased demand on the use of microtunnelling for the installation of new buried pipelines. However, the effect of microtunnelling on the performance of pavements is poorly understood. Hence, this paper aims at addressing this gap in knowledge. A robust three-dimensional finite element model that considers the combined influence of the traffic load and microtunnelling has been developed to study the microtunnelling induced pavement settlement. The influence of the stress level and volume change on the behavior of the subgrade, subbase, and base has been considered using the appropriate soil constitutive model. In addition, a parametric study has been carried out to examine the effect of the presence of the traffic load, backfill height, thickness and stiffness of the surface layer, the diameter of the microtunnelling, and shear strength of the subgrade soil on the microtunnelling induced pavement settlement. It has been found that the traffic load has a remarkable influence on the trend of the relationship between the maximum microtunnelling induced pavement settlement and the backfill height. In addition, the percentage increase of settlement due to the presence of the traffic load ranges between 60 and 674%. Moreover, increasing the diameter of the microtunnelling dramatically rises the settlement of the pavement. Furthermore, the stiffness and thickness of the surface layer were also found to affect the microtunnelling induced pavement settlement. Thus, it is necessary to consider the effect of traffic load, microtunnelling diameter, and backfill height in the assessment of the influence of the microtunneling on the response of the pavement. Importantly, the reported results are beneficial to designers working on the assessment of the microtunnelling induced pavement settlement."
The Paradox of Organizational Double Jeopardy: PK-12 Equity Directors in Racialized and Gendered Educational Systems,"In an era of heightened anti-Black racism and aspirations of equity in education, equity directors are at the vanguard of district efforts to eradicate educational injustices. This study examined how the racialized and gendered organizational contexts of U.S. equity directors shaped their equity leadership to transform educational systems. Drawing on intersectionality with theory about racialized organizations, we found that equity directors who identified as Black and other women of color experienced “organizational double jeopardy” in the form of diminished agency, unequal resources, differential return to their academic credentials, and decoupled formal rules from practice in ways that constrained their efforts and exacted a significant psychological and emotional toll. However, the race-gendered experiences of equity directors also constituted vital forms of knowledge and expertise for reshaping their roles and increasing their access to valued organizational resources. Paradoxically, then, racialized-gendered organizations functioned to diminish the influence of Black and other women of color equity directors who used their racialized-gendered knowledge to make strategic organizational change. We conclude with a call for attention to the nexus of individual-organizational dynamics in the practice of equity-focused leaders in tandem with longitudinal examinations of equity leadership across educational systems."
"A Self-Powered, Highly Embedded and Sensitive Tribo-Label-Sensor for the Fast and Stable Label Printer","Label-sensor is an essential component of the label printer which is becoming a most significant tool for the development of Internet of Things (IoT). However, some drawbacks of the traditional infrared label-sensor make the printer fail to realize the high-speed recognition of labels as well as stable printing. Herein, we propose a self-powered and highly sensitive tribo-label-sensor (TLS) for accurate label identification, positioning and counting by embedding triboelectric nanogenerator into the indispensable roller structure of a label printer. The sensing mechanism, device parameters and deep comparison with infrared sensor are systematically studied both in theory and experiment. As the results, TLS delivers 6 times higher signal magnitude than traditional one. Moreover, TLS is immune to label jitter and temperature variation during fast printing and can also be used for transparent label directly and shows long-term robustness. This work may provide an alternative toolkit with outstanding advantages to improve current label printer and further promote the development of IoT."
High-density lipoprotein subclasses and cardiovascular disease and mortality in type 2 diabetes: analysis from the Hong Kong Diabetes Biobank,"High-density lipoproteins (HDL) comprise particles of different size, density and composition and their vasoprotective functions may differ. Diabetes modifies the composition and function of HDL. We assessed associations of HDL size-based subclasses with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality and their prognostic utility."
"Multiple grain-size fraction analysis of heavy minerals and the provenance identification of sediments from the abandoned Huanghe River, eastern China","The quantitative analysis of sediment sources in a sink is an important scientific topic and challenge in provenance research. The characteristics of heavy minerals, combined with the geochemical constituents of detrital grains, provide a reliable provenance-tracing approach. We developed a mineral identification method to analyze the multiple grain-size fraction of sediments, from which the elemental geochemistry of hornblende was used to compare the characteristics of sediments from the Huaihe River and Huanghe (Yellow) River in eastern China. Elements that were statistically identified as being able to discriminate sediment provenance were employed to perform a quantitative analysis of the sources of sediments of the abandoned Huanghe River. Results reveal that the Huaihe River is characterized by a high amphibole content of >60% and that the Huanghe and abandoned Huanghe rivers have greater abundances of limonite and carbonate minerals compared with those of the Huaihe River. The contents of trace elements and rare earth elements in hornblende show that the sediments of the abandoned Huanghe River are similar to those of the Huanghe River but different from those of the Huaihe River. Furthermore, chemical mass balance was used to calculate the relative contributions of different provenances of sediment from the abandoned Huanghe River, and nine trace elements of hornblende were identified as discriminators of provenance. Approximately 2% of the hornblende in the abandoned Huanghe River is derived from the Huaihe River and 98% from the Huanghe River. Considering the proportion of hornblende in the total sediment, it is inferred that the contribution of Huaihe River sediment to the abandoned Huanghe River is approximately 0.5%. This study shows that mineral analysis using multiple grain-size fractions (within the wide range of 1Φ to 6Φ) with assessment in elemental geochemistry of hornblende can characterize the provenance of fluvial material in coastal zones."
Selection of the appropriate reference genes by quantitative real-time PCR in leopard coral groupers Plectropomus leopardus,"Leopard coral groupers (Plectropomus leopardus), commercially bred in South China, are a significant economical fish species. In this study, by means of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) technology, we assessed the stability of six common reference genes expression and selected the appropriate reference genes in leopard coral groupers with or without Vibrio harveyi stimulation at different time points. These data produced by qRT-PCR was handled via the geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper software. The results revealed all the examined reference genes had manifest tissue-specific expression in different tissues. Prior to V. harveyi stimulation, RPL13 gene was the appropriate reference gene among eleven tissue types (blood, spleen, hepatopancreas, kidney, stomach, gill, heart, skin, muscle, intestine, brain) in leopard coral groupers. Under V. harveyi stimulation, the most reliable reference genes varied from tissue to tissue and were closely hinged upon different time points. At 6-h post-bacterial injection, the appropriate reference genes in hepatopancreas, spleen, kidney, and gill were Actin, B2M, UBCE, and Actin, respectively. At 9- and 12-h post-bacterial injection, the appropriate reference genes in hepatopancreas, spleen, kidney, and gill were RPL13, Actin, Actin, and Actin, respectively. If one reference gene was preferable, RPL13, Actin, Actin, and Actin could be selected as the reference gene in hepatopancreas, spleen, kidney, and gill of leopard coral groupers after V. harveyi infection, respectively. Expression profiles of two target genes (IL-6 and NK-lysin) were used to further validate reliability of these selected appropriate candidates. This study will lay a solid foundation for the future research on qRT-PCR analysis of gene expression in leopard coral groupers."
RM3D: Robust Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing via Traditional and Learnt 3D Descriptors-Based Semantic Region Merging,"Existing state-of-the-art 3D point clouds understanding methods merely perform well in a fully supervised manner. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no unified framework which simultaneously solves the downstream high-level understanding tasks including both segmentation and detection, especially when labels are extremely limited. This work presents a general and simple framework to tackle point clouds understanding when labels are limited. The first contribution is that we have done extensive methodology comparisons of traditional and learnt 3D descriptors for the task of weakly supervised 3D scene understanding, and validated that our adapted traditional PFH-based 3D descriptors show excellent generalization ability across different domains. The second contribution is that we proposed a learning-based region merging strategy based on the affinity provided by both the traditional/learnt 3D descriptors and learnt semantics. The merging process takes both low-level geometric and high-level semantic feature correlations into consideration. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework has the best performance among the three most important weakly supervised point clouds understanding tasks including semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection even when very limited number of points are labeled. Our method, termed Region Merging 3D (RM3D), has superior performance on ScanNet data-efficient learning online benchmarks and other four large-scale 3D understanding benchmarks under various experimental settings, outperforming current arts by a margin for various 3D understanding tasks without complicated learning strategies such as active learning."
Time interval between diagnosis to treatment of breast cancer and the impact of health insurance coverage: a sub analysis of the AMAZONA III Study (GBECAM 0115),"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of cancer among women in Brazil. Evidence shows that delayed treatment onset is associated with increased mortality. This study aimed to evaluate median days between diagnosis and treatment and factors associated with delayed start of treatment (> 60 days after diagnosis): stage, treatment received, subtype, epidemiological characteristics, and type of healthcare coverage."
The association of trastuzumab with atrial fibrillation and heart failure in breast cancer patients in routine clinical practice: a population-based propensity score matching and competing risk model analysis,"Trastuzumab, a potent anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) monoclonal antibody, is conditionally reimbursed by the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) for HER2-positive breast cancer (BC). Trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity studies have well characterized heart failure (HF) but fewer addressed arrhythmia, particularly the association of potential life threatening atrial fibrillation (Af) is poorly characterized. We aimed to study the trastuzumab-related risk of Af and HF using the claimed data of Taiwan NHI."
Structural and conductivity investigations of composite polymer electrolytes based on poly(oxyethylene),"The scope of this paper is to study in detail the influence of inorganic fillers on the structure of composite polymeric electrolytes based on high-molecular weight poly(oxyethylene). It was mostly driven by large discrepancies between results reported by different authors as well as lack of detailed and complete information on the properties of composite electrolytes in the numerous articles published in the last 30 years. To enhance the transport properties—annealing steps were applied. First just below the melting point of the crystalline poly(oxyethylene) phase—at 60 °C, and then at 80 °C, 100 °C and 120 °C. They led to a dramatic increase of the ionic conductivities, for both—reference, and composite electrolytes; however, the effect was most pronounced for micron-sized fillers. On the other hand, nano-powders filled samples exhibited the best mechanical stability. To study the mechanism of the conductivity enhancement, combined X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies were conducted. Appearance, disappearance, and changes in relative volume of different phases present in the electrolytes were observed. These are the first-reported results showing such changes upon annealing. Since these are multiphase systems and no obvious space groups can be applied to study the changes in the diffractograms, correlation analysis was employed to investigate this phenomenon."
Utilizing source code syntax patterns to detect bug inducing commits using machine learning models,"Detecting Bug Inducing Commit (BIC) or Just in Time (JIT) defect prediction using Machine Learning (ML) based models requires tabulated feature values extracted from the source code or historical maintenance data of a software system. Existing studies have utilized meta-data from source code repositories (we named them GitHub Statistics or GS), n-gram-based source code text processing, and developer’s information (e.g., the experience of a developer) as the feature values in ML-based bug detection models. However, these feature values do not represent the source code syntax styles or patterns that a developer might prefer over available valid alternatives provided by programming languages. This investigation proposed a method to extract features from its source code syntax patterns to represent software commits and investigate whether they are helpful in detecting bug proneness in software systems. We utilize six manually and two automatically labeled datasets from eight open-source software projects written in Java, C++, and Python programming languages. Our datasets contain 642 manually labeled and 4014 automatically labeled buggy and non-buggy commits from six and two subject systems, respectively. The subject systems contain a diverse number of revisions, and they are from various application domains. Our investigation shows the inclusion of the proposed features increases the performance of detecting buggy and non-buggy software commits using five different machine learning classification models. Our proposed features also perform better in detecting buggy commits using the Deep Belief Network generated features and classification model. This investigation also implemented a state-of-the-art tool to compare the explainability of predicted buggy commits using our proposed and traditional features and found that our proposed features provide better reasoning about buggy commit detection compared to the traditional features. The continuation of this study can lead us to enhance software effectiveness by identifying, minimizing, and fixing software bugs during its maintenance and evolution."
Rapid cold hardening response of the phytoseiid mite Neoseiulus striatus: increased cold tolerance but not reduced predation,"The predatory mite Neoseiulus striatus (Wu) (Acari: Phytoseiidae), which has been found on maize plants in Inner Mongolia, is regarded as a promising biological control agent of small sucking pests, especially Tetranychid mites. Temperature is an important abiotic factor, and a sudden drop in temperature may affect its performance when released in areas with big circadian temperature differences. Rapid cold hardening is a type of phenotypic plasticity that allows ectotherms to quickly enhance their cold tolerance in response to a brief chilling exposure. However, it is not clear whether N. striatus possesses such plasticity. To understand how this species of phytoseiid mite copes with short-term low-temperature stress, its rapid cold hardening response was studied in the laboratory by first exploring its critical temperature. Then, the effects of exposure to a series of temperatures (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 °C) for different durations on the survival of N. striatus were investigated to determine the optimal temperature and duration for cold hardening. Moreover, the effect of cold hardening on the consumption of Tetranychus urticae by N. striatus was also investigated, as was the response of immature stages. The critical temperature for N. striatus was − 15 °C, at which its survival dropped below 10%. An exposure to 5 °C for 2 h was optimal for rapid cold hardening, efficiently increasing survival in N. striatus. Rapid cold hardening was found in all developmental stages of N. striatus, and there was no significant effect of exposure on the consumption of spider mites. Our study shows that exposure to low temperatures during a limited period can enhance the cold hardiness but not reduce predation by N. striatus, which will be advantageous to its field applications during a period of large diurnal temperature fluctuations."
Selection bias in follow-up studies of stem cell transplantation survivors: an experience within the Maastricht Observational study of late effects after Stem cell trAnsplantation (MOSA),"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an important treatment for many malignant hematological and non-hematological diseases. Survivors of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) are at risk of long-term health problems and reduced quality of life related to previous treatments. Many studies about these long-term effects have been conducted over the last decades. However, selection bias is a concern in long-term follow-up studies and little is known about the non-participating group. As part of the Maastricht Observational study of late effects after Stem cell trAnsplantation (MOSA), investigating long-term health effects by extensively phenotyping HCT survivors, we conducted a survey to characterise the non-participating group. This survey mostly focused on quality of life and physical complaints. The survey responders were generally older than the MOSA group, had more history of relapsed disease, and described their general health as bad or mediocre significantly more often than the MOSA group. Also, more deaths occurred in the group of non-participants between the start of study inclusion in 2015 and analysis of the survey results in 2021. This study suggests that a selection of higher functioning HCT survivors with a relatively better quality of life participated in this long-term follow-up study of stem cell transplantation survivors. These results could also impact the results of other long-term follow-up studies in cancer survivors, knowing that possibly an unhealthier population is missed in these studies and some long-term negative effects of treatments might be underestimated."
Effects of L-shape and Raman second-order pumping scheme on the performance of double-pass hybrid fiber amplifier,"In this paper, a new wideband double-pass hybrid fiber amplifier utilizing L-shape and a second-order Raman pumping scheme (DP-L-shape-HFASO) is implemented and investigated via OptiSystem software. The combination of the Raman second-order pumping scheme and the L-shape configuration provides a new HFA with efficient and outstanding performance in many aspects. The results show the proposed HFA provided a wide flat bandwidth of 80 nm extended over the short, conventional, and long band (S+C+L) ranging from 1515 to 1595 nm due to use the second-order pumping scheme. In addition, a high average gain (Gav.) of 25.64 dB and a proper average noise figure (NFav.) of about 7 dB are achieved through the use of the L-shape configuration. Finally, the optimal Raman pump power was reduced by 37.5% due to a double-pass configuration as compared with the single pass design, thereby improving the pump conversion efficiency."
Morphodynamic study of the corona mortis using the SimLife® technology,"Open book pelvic ring fractures are potentially life-threatening, due to their instability and major hemorrhage risk. During the open reduction and internal fixation, the pelvic approach remains a technical challenge, as the surgeon wants to prevent any iatrogenic damage of the vascular loop located in the retro-pubic area called corona mortis (CMOR). Recently, the cadaver perfused SimLife® technology has been developed to improve the surgeon training, out of the operating room. This study aimed to compare two models of cadaveric dissection, to assess the interest of the perfused SimLife® in providing dynamic aspect of anatomy in the identification of CMOR and its topography."
"Massilia phyllostachyos sp. nov., Isolated from the Roots of Moso Bamboo in China","A Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, motile, and rod-shaped bacterial strain G4R7T was isolated from the roots of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) in Zhejiang, Hangzhou Province, China. After comparing 16S rRNA gene sequences, strain G4R7T exhibited the highest similarities with Massilia neuiana PTW21T (98.3%), followed by M. agri K-3-1T (98.3%), M. consociate CCUG 58010T (97.7%), M. niastensis 5516S-1T (97.7%) and M. yuzhufengensis ZD1-4T (97.6%). The phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain G4R7T belonged to the genus Massilia. The draft genome of strain G4R7T was 5.81 Mb, and the G+C content was 64.4%. The average nucleotide identity values between G4R7T and another related member of the genus Massilia ranged from 76.6 to 87.2%, and the digital DNA–DNA hybridization ranged from 20.7 to 27.9%. Strain G4R7T grew at 15–37 °C (optimum 25–30 °C) and pH 6.0–9.0 (optimum pH 7.0) in the presence of 0–3% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 0%). The respiratory quinone was Q-8, and the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and aminophospholipid. The major cellular fatty acids were C10:0 3OH, C12:0, C12:0 2OH, and C16:0, summed feature 3 (C16:1 ω6c and/or C16:1 ω7c). As per the data from chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic, and phenotypic evidence, strain G4R7T represents a new species of genus Massilia, for which the name Massilia phyllostachyos sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is G4R7T (=ACCC 61911T=GDMCC 1.2961T=JCM 35225T)."
LncRNA BBOX1-AS1 Contributes to the Progression of Esophageal Carcinoma by Targeting the miR-361-3p/COL5A1 Axis,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to participate in the progression of several cancers, including esophageal carcinoma (EC), a common malignancy of the digestive system. Although the role of the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network is crucial for the growth and progression of EC, the regulation of lncRNA BBOX1-AS1 (BBOX1 antisense RNA1) remains unclear. We performed reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blotting to evaluate miR-361-3p, collagen type V alpha 1 chain (COL5A1), and BBOX1-AS1 expression levels in EC cells and tissues. The colony formation assay (CFA) and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) were employed to identify EC cell proliferation, while western blotting was used to examine EC cell apoptosis and Bax and Bcl-2 expression levels. The effect of BBOX1-AS1 on EC proliferation was determined using an in vivo carcinogenesis assay. Correlation between COL5A1, BBOX1-AS1, and miR-361-3p was examined using the luciferase reporter system and RNA immunoprecipitation assay (RIP). Herein, we observed that BBOX1-AS1 expression levels were upregulated in EC cells and tissues. BBOX1-AS1 knockdown inhibited EC cell proliferation and conferred a pro-apoptotic effect. These results indicated a positive interaction between BBOX1-AS1 and miR-361-3p in EC and a negative association with miR-361-3p. COL5A1 was recognized as a downstream miR-361-3p target and was inversely related to miR-361-3p in EC. Therefore, BBOX1-AS1 expression suppressed cell apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation via the downregulation of miR-361-3p and upregulation of COL5A1 expression. Overall, BBOX1-AS1 facilitates EC progression via the miR-361-3p or COL5A1 axis, indicating that BBOX1-AS1 might be a potential therapeutic target for EC therapy."
Party school rankings: do we have anything to worry about?,"Annual rankings provide easily consumable quantitative information that prospective students and their families use to make decisions about applications and admissions offers. One popular ranking is Princeton Review’s Party Schools, which receives national attention and condemnation by institutional leaders. We analyzed IPEDS and Clery Act data using Generalized Estimating Equations to examine institutional effects and changes in student behaviors associated with appearing in this ranking. We found that appearing in the Party School rankings is associated with several important changes in applications, admissions, and student behaviors. We offer explanations for institutional leaders to consider before taking actions they believe will help ensure their institution no longer appears in the Party Schools rankings."
Capturing time-dependent activation of genes and stress-response pathways using transcriptomics in iPSC-derived renal proximal tubule cells,"Transcriptomic analysis is a powerful method in the utilization of New Approach Methods (NAMs) for identifying mechanisms of toxicity and application to hazard characterization. With this regard, mapping toxicological events to time of exposure would be helpful to characterize early events. Here, we investigated time-dependent changes in gene expression levels in iPSC-derived renal proximal tubular-like cells (PTL) treated with five diverse compounds using TempO-Seq transcriptomics with the aims to evaluate the application of PTL for toxicity prediction and to report on temporal effects for the activation of cellular stress response pathways. PTL were treated with either 50 μM amiodarone, 10 μM sodium arsenate, 5 nM rotenone, or 300 nM tunicamycin over a temporal time course between 1 and 24 h. The TGFβ-type I receptor kinase inhibitor GW788388 (1 μM) was used as a negative control. Pathway analysis revealed the induction of key stress-response pathways, including Nrf2 oxidative stress response, unfolding protein response, and metal stress response. Early response genes per pathway were identified much earlier than 24 h and included HMOX1, ATF3, DDIT3, and several MT1 isotypes. GW788388 did not induce any genes within the stress response pathways above, but showed deregulation of genes involved in TGFβ inhibition, including downregulation of CYP24A1 and SERPINE1 and upregulation of WT1. This study highlights the application of iPSC-derived renal cells for prediction of cellular toxicity and sheds new light on the temporal and early effects of key genes that are involved in cellular stress response pathways."
Electrochemical Deposited Amorphous Bimetallic Nickle-Iron (Oxy)hydroxides Electrocatalysts for Highly Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction,"The low-cost and high-performance electrocatalysts, especially metal (oxy)hydroxides, for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have attracted considerable attention due to their promising OER activity. Amorphous electrocatalysts are often superior to their crystalline counterparts due to their more actives and structural flexibility. However, using traditional preparation techniques still presents a significant barrier. Herein, the amorphous NiFe (oxy)hydroxides on nickel foam (NF) with large surface area and small charge transfer resistance were fabricated by electrodeposition technique. The as-fabricated NiFe (oxy)hydroxides (Ni:Fe = 1:3) exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability for OER with a low overpotential of 245 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm–2, a small Tafel slope of 76.9 mV dec−1, which was superior to that of noble metal electrocatalysts (RuO2) and most NiFe-based electrocatalysts. This work provides a facile and effective way to synthesis metal (oxy)hydroxide catalysts towards high-efficiency water splitting."
Enhanced Photocatalytic Degradation and Antibacterial Performance by Cu2O/ZIF-8/AgBr Composites Under Visible Light,"In this study, double heterojunction Cu2O/ZIF-8/AgBr photocatalysts were fabricated through an in situ growth method. The photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the composite photocatalyst for oxytetracycline (OTC), tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCl) and tetracycline (TC) is obviously higher than that of the pure Cu2O, ZIF-8 and AgBr. The Cu2O/ZIF-8/20wtAgBr composite material can effectively inactivate E.coli under visible light. The importance of ·O2– and ·OH in the photocatalytic process had been verified in the active species trapping experiment and electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR). Through transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), it could be known that the double type-I heterojunction system significantly improved the efficiency of charge transfer and separation. The novel Cu2O/ZIF-8/20wtAgBr composite material is expected to become a promising candidate photocatalyst for environmental applications."
Fabrication of fabric-like Bacterial Cellulose/Collagen membranes by applying textile padding method for wound dressing applications,"Nowadays, more and more biomaterials have been studied to accelerate wound healing, especially Bacterial Cellulose (BC). Besides ideal properties, pristine BC has been challenged by modern wound dressing requirements (antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities, etc.). Despite previous studies to functionalize BC, high demand is still pressing for productive and efficient methods in creating functional BC wound dressings in composite form. In this work, functional fabric-like BC/Collagen membranes for wound dressing have been investigated using the textile padding method with Collagen, Lactic Acid, Tannic Acid, and Tween 80. The obtained BC/Collagen possesses an innovative grid-embossing surface morphology, high antibacterial activity (up to 94.25 ± 1.31% for Escherichia coli and 78.25 ± 8.50% for Staphylococcus aureus within just 2 min of contact), hydrophilicity (contact angle of less than 15\(^\circ\) within the first second) with water, wound exudate, acidic and alkaline sweats, impressive absorptive capacity (\(\approx\)10 g/100 \(\hbox {cm}^{2}\) within 30 min and \(\approx\)130 g/100 \(\hbox {cm}^{2}\)/30 days) and acidic pH (\(\approx\)2.9). Such properties have proven that these fabric-like BC/Collagen membranes can satisfy modern wound dressing requirements. As a result, this study has provided a pre-eminent finishing method for BC as compared with currently available methods (e.g. high substance distribution and penetration based on material topography, \(\approx\)30 times less needed chemical for environmental protection and resource saving)."
Preparation and characterization of oxidized pectin/N-succinyl chitosan/graphene oxide hydrogels,"Oxidized pectin/N-succinyl chitosan (OP/NSC) hydrogel containing graphene oxide (GO) was developed as a self-healing, injectable and conductive hydrogel. The OP/NSC/GO hydrogel showed rapid gelation and excellent injectability due to the hydrogen bonding between GO nanosheets and NSC and OP macromolecules and Schiff-based crosslinking by amino and aldehyde functional groups of polysaccharide derivatives. The hydrogel had the best overall performance when the GO content was adjusted to 6 (mg/mL). The healing and gelation time of the hydrogel was 10 min and 13 s, respectively. The hydrogel also showed adequate swelling ability, appropriate conductivity, and good mechanical characteristics. Hemolysis tests indicated that all prepared hydrogels were non-hemolytic materials. In addition, GOs-loaded hydrogels showed low toxicity to fibroblast cells (L929), thus indicating good biocompatibility. These findings demonstrated the hydrogel's potential as a conductive, injectable, self-healing hydrogel for biomedical applications, particularly in tissue engineering."
Simple preparation of environmentally friendly and durable superhydrophobic antibacterial paper,"As non-biodegradable single-use plastic packaging products have been restricted in recent years, paper-based materials have attracted considerable attention owing to their environmental benefits. However, the hydrophilic nature of paper-based materials limits their application as replacements for non-biodegradable plastics. In this study, an environmentally friendly and multifunctional superhydrophobic paper was developed using silane-modified superhydrophobic nanofibrillated cellulose (M-NFC) via a simple spraying method. This paper can reduce the white pollution caused by non-degradable single-use plastic packaging products. Upon spraying the base paper with 1.5 g/m2 of M-NFC, the coated paper (CP) exhibited excellent superhydrophobicity (water contact angle of 160°), water repellency (Cobb value of 7.5 g/m2), strong durability to sandpaper abrasion, finger-wipe, bending, folding, and sustained exposure to corrosion media (HCl with a pH of 1, NaOH with a pH of 10, high temperature treatment at 180 °C, and ultraviolet irradiation). Additionally, the CP surface directly prevented the adhesion of S. aureus and E. coli and also indirectly repelled solid contaminants upon washing with water, thereby demonstrating highly efficient antibacterial and anti-fouling properties. The durable and multifunctional superhydrophobic paper developed in this study provides a novel direction for solving white pollution and also presents a new research pathway for the potential applications of paper-based materials."
Assessment and application of optical flow in background-oriented schlieren for compressible flows,"Optical flow provides an opportunity to elevate the resolution and sensitivity of deflection sensing in background-oriented schlieren (BOS). Despite extensive relevant literature within the field of computer vision, there is a lack of proper quantification of its abilities and limitations with regard to the state-of-the-art BOS experiments. Thus, this study performs an assessment of accuracy and resolution limits in different flow field scenarios utilizing background patterns generated with random dot and wavelet noise distributions. Accordingly, a synthetic assessment over a theoretically generated Prandtl–Meyer expansion fan is conducted with variations introduced in the background patterns and operational parameters of optical flow. A clear superiority of accuracy and resolvable range of density gradient amplitudes over cross-correlation is demonstrated. Moreover, an experimental assessment of supersonic flow features over multiple wind tunnel models is performed. The influence of experimental constraints, limitations and uncertainties related to the application of optical flow in BOS and its comparative performance against the block-matching counterpart is characterized."
Unraveling the nature of spin excitations disentangled from charge contributions in a doped cuprate superconductor,"The nature of the spin excitations in superconducting cuprates is a key question toward a unified understanding of the cuprate physics from long-range antiferromagnetism to superconductivity. The intense spin excitations up to the over-doped regime revealed by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering bring new insights as well as questions like how to understand their persistence or their relation to the collective excitations in ordered magnets (magnons). Here, we study the evolution of the spin excitations upon hole-doping the superconducting cuprate Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ by disentangling the spin from the charge excitations in the experimental cross section. We compare our experimental results against density matrix renormalization group calculations for a t-J-like model on a square lattice. Our results unambiguously confirm the persistence of the spin excitations, which are closely connected to the persistence of short-range magnetic correlations up to high doping. This suggests that the spin excitations in hole-doped cuprates are related to magnons—albeit short-ranged."
An efficient management education in developing women entrepreneurial aspirations,"In the latest era, opportunity recognition is a critical factor of entrepreneurship and plays an important role in business management. It helps to analyze the market trends and decreases the risk in failure of business organizations. Women entrepreneurship development is an essential part of human resource development. Entrepreneurship amongst women has been a recent concern. Women have become aware of their existence their rights and their work situation. This paper addresses the effects of entrepreneurship education on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition. It is evident from the study that the women entrepreneurs have high scope of being successful in their entrepreneurship journey, provided they have been guided and given relevant and required management education opportunities. It’s been significant from this research work that the future of the women entrepreneurs is bright, hence there is a need to work on their Management education."
Is it Possible to Diagnose “Non-Invasive Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm with Papillary-Like Nuclear Features” Preoperatively?,"There is no accepted consensus or algorithm for the preoperative diagnosis of non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) in patients with thyroid nodules. In this study, we evaluated the importance of preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio in the differential diagnosis of NIFTP. Pathology preparations of 209 patients with a follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC) diagnosed after thyroid surgery in a tertiary health center between January 2010 and January 2020 were re-evaluated. Patients were divided into NIFTP and encapsulated follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma (EFVPTC) to compare. Of the patients, 58 (27.7%) were NIFTP, and 151 (72.3%) were EFVPTC. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of age (p = 0.46), tumor size (p = 0.51), gender (p = 0.48), and surgical technique (p = 0.78) between the groups. The probability of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) > 2 is more common in the EFVPTC group. It was statistically significant that the NIFTP group was 1.96 times more likely to have NLR > 2 (OR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.06–3.63) (p < 0.05). However, there was no risk difference between the groups in terms of the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.41–1.43) (p > 0.05). The diagnosis of NIFTP should be kept in mind in the evaluation of patients whose thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy results are in the intermediate group. NIFTP exhibits better prognostic findings than classic thyroid papillary cancer and EFVPTC. Therefore, preoperative diagnosis of NIFTP in line with laboratory, ultrasonography, and FNA findings will save the patient from unnecessary overtreatment."
“What Kind of Person Do You Want to Become?”: Analyzing Young Children’s Drawings on Gender Ideals,"This study explores South Korean kindergarteners’ drawings on gender ideals in order to understand how they perceive the ideal man and woman with respect to gender. The data were collected based on drawings and interviews of 189 children aged 5–6 years in South Korea. The researchers identified themes using qualitative content analysis. Overall, the results showed that South Korean kindergarteners exhibited gender-stereotyped perceptions of occupations, appearances, roles/values, and visual features in their human figure drawings. Gender ideals were also influenced by pop culture. Additionally, this study found that some children possess gender ideals that are gender-neutral and prosocial rather than stereotypical. The significance of this study lies in gaining deeper understanding of young children’s gender development and in providing approaches for early childhood educators to promote views of gender diversity."
Flood pulse as a driving force of Pb variation in four fish guilds from Puruzinho Lake (western Amazon),"The Brazilian Amazon is heavily impacted by mining activities, especially by gold and cassiterite mining. Pb is a contaminant released during cassiterite extraction, and it stands out for its high toxicity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of flood pulse on Pb dynamics in four fish species with different feeding habits (Cichlapleiozona: carnivorous, Mylossomaduriventre: herbivorous, Prochilodus nigricans: detritivorous, and Serrasalmus rhombeus: piscivorous) over four hydrological periods in Puruzinho Lake (Brazilian Amazon), which receives water from the Madeira River. The risk assessment for daily Pb intake through the consumption of these fish by the local riverside population was also carried out. Fish species were sampled during four Amazonian hydrological periods: rising water, high water, falling water, and low water. Pb and stable isotopes (δ15N and δ13C) measurements were carried out on fish muscle. The flood pulse had the same effect on Pb concentrations of all the fish species regardless of their feeding habits, as we found a nonsignificant interaction between these variables. The Pb in fish muscle increased in the flood season (rising and high water) and decreased in the dry season (falling and low water). The Pb concentration in fish increased significantly with their trophic level (δ15N), evidencing the occurrence of biomagnification of the element along the trophic chain (R2 = 0.24). The main food source of the herbivorous fish (δ13C) was very distinct from that of the others, which had a large overlap in their values. Regarding risk assessment, the daily Pb intake through consumption of the herbivorous species during high water (17.82 ± 19.68 µg∙day−1) exceeded the limit determined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of 12.5 µg∙day−1, representing a health risk to the riverside population of Puruzinho Lake."
Microplastics pollution in the river Karnaphuli: a preliminary study on a tidal confluence river in the southeast coast of Bangladesh,"Bangladesh is a deltaic country in Asia, and its riverine systems ultimately drain into the Bay of Bengal. Plastic is a severe environmental issue for coastal-marine ecosystems due to the indiscriminate usage and discarding of plastic items in the upstream river that eventually find their route into the Bay of Bengal. Microplastics (MPs) are widespread pollutants in almost all environmental compartments, including aquatic environments. This study aimed to quantify and understand the distribution of microplastics in surface water and sediments of the river Karnaphuli, a tidal confluence river adjacent to the Chattogram seaport city of Bangladesh, a highly inhabited and industrial area on the southeast coast of the Bay of Bengal. A manta trawl net (300-µm mesh size) was used to collect surface water samples, while an Ekman dredge was used to collect sediment samples. The concentrations of microplastics in the surface water of the river Karnaphuli during late monsoon, winter, and early summer were recorded to be 120,111.11, 152,222.22, and 164,444.44 items/km2, respectively, while in sediments, those were recorded to be 103.83, 137.50, and 103.67 items/kg, respectively. A higher abundance of microplastics was observed in downstream surface water (228,888.88 items/km2) and sediments (164.17 items/kg). Smaller sizes (0.3 to 0.5 mm) of microplastics were predominant, fibers or threads were the frequent types, and black was the most common color in the river Karnaphuli. The Fourier transform infrared analysis revealed that polyethylene terephthalate (surface water: 22%, sediments: 19%), polyamide (surface water: 15%, sediments: 13%), polyethylene (surface water: 12%, sediments: 18%), polystyrene (surface water: 13%, sediments: 11%), and alkyd resin (surface water: 13%, sediments: 10%) were the most prevalent polymers in the river Karnaphuli. Moreover, there was a moderate positive correlation between MPs abundance in surface water and sediments. Therefore, improved long-term research (in different seasons with horizontal and vertical monitoring) is necessary in order to accurately determine the flux of microplastics from the river Karnaphuli to the Bay of Bengal."
Empirical relationship between creativity and carbon intensity: a case of OPEC countries,"This article attempts to examine the role of creativity on carbon intensity in case of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) countries. The panel estimation techniques are used for annual data for the period of 1990–2018. The empirical evidence affirms that patent rights and innovation act as a policy factor in controlling carbon intensity, i.e. creativity leads to energy-efficient and environment friendly society. However, innovations have higher magnitude compared to patent. Contrarily, urbanization and economic growth are the key determinants in enhancing carbon intensity, while renewable energy has insignificant impact on carbon intensity. The empirical analysis, especially for creativity, can add practical implications for related authorities in controlling carbon intensity and improving energy efficiency."
Biochar and activated carbon derived from oil palm kernel shell as a framework for the preparation of sustainable controlled release urea fertiliser,"The oil palm kernel shell biochar (OPKS-B) and oil palm kernel shell activated carbon (OPKS-AC) were used as a framework to entrap urea using adsorption method. Batch adsorption studies were performed to gauge the influence of contact time on the adsorption of urea onto both OPKS-B and OPKS-AC. To evaluate the physicochemical traits of the studied materials, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), N2-sorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), elemental analysis, differential thermal gravity (TG/DTG) and thermal gravity were applied. Result shows OPKS-AC has a better sorption capacity for urea compared to OPKS-B. The Langmuir isotherm model better justified the sorption isotherms of urea. For the adsorption process for both OPKS-B and OPKS-AC, the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was picked as it best fitted the experimental sorption outcome with the superior R2 values of > 65.1% and > 74.5%, respectively. The outcome of the experiments showcased that the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of the OPKS-AC towards urea was 239.68 mg/g. OPKS-AC has showed promising attributes to be picked as an organic framework in the production of controlled release urea fertiliser for a greener and environmentally friendly agricultural practices."
Effects of urinary of organophosphate metabolites on nerve conduction and neurobehavioral performance among farmers in northern Thailand,"Farmers are regarded as a high-risk population for pesticide exposure because of the frequency of their occupational exposure to organophosphate (OP) pesticides. The purposes of this study were 1) to compare urinary OP metabolites, nerve conduction, and neurobehavioral (NB) performance between farmers and a control group, as well as between baseline measurement and after spraying OP pesticides; 2) to investigate the factors associated with increased urinary OP metabolites after spraying OP pesticides; and 3) to investigate the effects of OP metabolites on changes in nerve conduction and NB performance after spraying OP pesticides. This study was conducted with a sample size of 71 farmers and a control group of 26. The findings showed that after spraying OP pesticides total dialkylphosphate (DAP) levels were significantly higher than baseline levels. Multiple linear regression showed that increased urinary OP metabolites among farmers after spraying pesticides were negatively associated with wearing a mask when spraying OP pesticides and positively associated with the number of years of farm work and type of sprayer equipment. The results also showed a positive association between the increased urinary total diethylphosphate (DEP) levels and the decreased amplitude of motor nerve conduction. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between increased urinary total DEP and decreased right amplitude of sympathetic skin response (SSR). An increase in urinary total DMP was positively associated with a decrease in raw score and a standard score of visual-motor integration (VMI). Our findings provide evidence that exposure to OP pesticides can cause a deficit in nerve conduction and NB performance in farmers. These findings may contribute to the early detection of neurological disease and inform strategies to prevent damage to the peripheral and central nervous systems."
Association between rare earth element exposure during pregnancy and newborn telomere length,"Telomere length (TL) is considered a marker of biological aging and lifetime health, and some epidemiological studies report that the environmental exposures may influence TL at birth. We aimed to investigate the associations between prenatal rare earth elements (REE) exposure and newborn TL. A total of 587 mother-newborn pairs were recruited during 2013 to 2015 in Wuhan, China. Maternal urinary concentrations of REE collected during three trimesters were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure relative cord blood TL. The trimester-specific associations between prenatal REE exposure and cord blood TL were evaluated using multiple informant models. Weighted quantile sum regression was used to estimate the mixture effect of urinary REE on cord blood TL. After adjustment for potential confounders, per doubling of urinary REE (Dy, Yb, Pr, Nd, and Tm) concentrations (μg/g creatinine) during the second trimester was respectively associated with 1.94% (95% CI 0.19%, 3.72%), 2.10% (95% CI 0.31%, 3.92%), 2.11% (95% CI 0.35%, 3.89%), 2.08% (95% CI 0.01%, 4.20%), and 1.38% (95% CI 0.09%, 2.70%) increase in cord blood TL. Furthermore, exposure to the mixture of REE during the second trimester was also significantly associated with increased cord blood TL (percent change 1.20%, 95% CI 0.30%, 2.11%). However, these associations were not statistically significant in the first and third trimesters. This study provides new evidence on the potential effect of prenatal REE exposure on the initial (newborn) setting of offspring’s telomere biology. Further epidemiological studies are warranted to confirm our findings."
Early multi-class ensemble-based fake news detection using content features,"Nowadays, social media plays an essential role in spreading the news with low cost and high speed in publishing, and easy availability. Given that, anyone can publish any news on social networks, with some of them to be fake. These fake stories should be detected as soon as possible since they might have negative impacts on the society. To address this issue, most researches consider fake news detection as a binary classification problem. However, as some news are half-true, recently, multi-class detection has gained more attention. This paper investigates an early detection of fake news using multi-class classification. This is achieved by extracting the content features, such as sentiment and semantic features, from the news. The proposed model employs five classifiers (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, LightGBM, and XGBoost) as primary classifiers. Furthermore, AdaBoost is used for the meta-learning algorithm to develop a stacking generalization model. Stacking generalization is an ensemble learning method that uses all data produced by the first-level algorithms. We trained our model with PolitiFact data for the evaluation, and the model performance was evaluated by Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score. Excremental evaluation of the real-world datasets showed that our proposed model outperformed all previous works in both binary and multi-class classifications."
"Human Nature, Metaphysics and Evolutionary Theory","This paper argues that the substance concept, as discussed by Aristotle in his Categories, aids us to improve our understanding of human nature. Aristotle distinguished the primary from the secondary substance, and substantial from accidental change. We explain these distinctions, their use for understanding phenomena, and discuss how we can integrate them with evolutionary explanations of human nature. For explaining of how the typical human characteristics evolved, we extend our investigations with a discussion of the concept of person. It is argued that psychological attributes, used to characterize persons, are not attributes of a separate mental substance, as Cartesians believe. The concept of a person, though not a substance concept, qualifies a substance concept of a human being possessing rational powers. The latter evolved as the result of language evolution."
Chaos-enhanced multi-objective tunicate swarm algorithm for economic-emission load dispatch problem,"Climate change and environmental protection have a significant impact on thermal plants. So, the main principles of combined economic-emission dispatch (CEED) problem are indeed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fuel costs. Many approaches have demonstrated their efficacy in addressing CEED problem. However, designing a robust algorithm capable of achieving the Pareto optimal solutions under its multimodality and non-convexity natures caused by valve ripple effects is a true challenge. In this paper, chaos-enhanced multi-objective tunicate swarm algorithm (CMOTSA) for CEED problem. To promote the exploration and exploitation abilities of the basic tunicate swarm algorithm (TSA), an exponential strategy based on chaotic logistic map (ESCL) is incorporated. Based on ESCL in CMOTSA, it can improve the possibility of diversification feature to search different areas within the solution space, and then, gradually with the progress of iterative process it converts to emphasize the intensification ability. The efficacy of CMOTSA is approved by applying it to some of multi-objective benchmarking functions which have different Pareto front characteristics including convex, discrete, and non-convex. The inverted generational distance (IGD) and generational distance (GD) are employed to assess the robustness and the good quality of CMOTSA against some successful algorithms. Additionally, the computational time is evaluated, the CMOTSA consumes less time for most functions. The CMOTSA is applied to one of the practical engineering problems such as combined economic and emission dispatch (CEED) with including the valve ripples. By using three different systems (IEEE 30-bus with 6 generators system, 10 units system and IEEE 118-bus with 14 generating units), the methodology validation is made. It can be stated for the large-scale case of 118-bus systems that the results of the CMOTSA are equal to 8741.3 $/h for the minimum cost and 2747.6 ton/h for the minimum emission which are very viable to others. It can be pointed out that the cropped results of the proposed CMOTSA based methodology as an efficient tool for CEED is proven."
The collaborative governance mechanism of emergency information to coastal cities of China,"To establish and improve the theoretical framework and operation mechanism of emergency information sharing, and to establish the index system and evaluation method of the efficiency of emergency information sharing are the key work to improve the disaster prevention and mitigation capacity of coastal cities in China. In this paper, the synergetic theory is introduced into the construction of emergency information sharing framework. By clarifying the operation relationship between the participants and the information transmission, the framework and operation mechanism of emergency information sharing are constructed. Around the 3 dimensions of emergency information sharing mechanism construction, resource guarantee ability and collaborative driving force of emergency information sharing, the evaluation index system of emergency information sharing collaborative efficiency in coastal cities is proposed, and the evaluation method of emergency information sharing collaborative efficiency based on coupling degree model is proposed. The empirical results show that the efficiency of emergency information sharing in coastal cities in China is generally on the rise, and the contribution rate of the construction level of emergency information sharing mechanism is higher than that of the resource guarantee ability and the collaborative driving force of emergency information sharing, but the efficiency of emergency information sharing in coastal cities in China is still at the bottom level. The research results provide theoretical basis and methods for the emergency management departments of coastal cities in China."
A WRKY Transcription Factor PmWRKY57 from Prunus mume Improves Cold Tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana,"Prunus mume, a woody perennial tree, is valued for its ornamental traits and has been cultivated for a long history. Low temperature is the main environmental factor restricting the distribution and affecting the growth of P. mume. In plants, some WRKY transcription factors have been reported to participate in regulating cold tolerance. However, there were few researches about functional characterization of WRKYs involving in P. mume cold response. Here, a cold-induced WRKY gene named as PmWRKY57 was cloned from a P. mume cultivar ‘Guhong Zhusha.’ PmWRKY57 protein harboring a WRKY domain and a C2H2 zinc finger motif belongs to Group IIc of WRKY family. The PmWRKY57 protein was located to the nucleus and has transcriptional activation activity. PmWRKY57-overexpresing Arabidopsis thaliana lines showed improved cold tolerance, compared to wild-type plants. Under cold treatment, the leaves of transgenic lines contained significantly lower malondialdehyde content, and higher levels of superoxide dismutase activity, peroxidase activity, and proline content than wild-type plants. Furthermore, the expression levels of cold-response genes such as AtCOR6.6, AtCOR47, AtKIN1, and AtRCI2A were up-regulated in leaves of transgenic A. thaliana compared to those in wild-type plants. This study characterized the function of PmWRKY57 in improving cold tolerance of plants."
PRAME Staining in Sinonasal Mucosal Melanoma: A Single-Center Experience,"Sinonasal mucosal melanoma (MM) is a rare, aggressive melanoma subtype. Complete surgical excision, with or without adjuvant radiotherapy, remains the cornerstone of treatment and yields adequate locoregional control. Metastatic MM is managed similarly to metastatic cutaneous melanoma but with poorer survival. PReferentially expressed Antigen in MElanoma (PRAME) has been identified as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in the treatment of cutaneous melanoma."

Densely Connected Dilated Residual Network for Image Denoising: DDR-Net,"Image denoising is an important ill-posed problem of image processing. The main goal in image denoising is to suppress noise while protecting textures of the image. A plethora of methods and different approaches have targeted image denoising problem. In this manuscript, we propose a novel method which brings dense and residual blocks together with dilated convolutions in image denoising applications. The proposed method introduces new strategies for proper combination of dense residual blocks and dilated convolution layers. The resulting approach is called as Densely connected Dilated Residual Network (DDR-Net). The proposed DDR-Net extracts multi-scale information by employing dilated convolutions. Use of dilated convolutions leads to improved receptive field performance while keeping the complexity of the network in check. Residual and dense connections on the other hand prevent loss of information along the DDR-Net pipeline. Simulations are performed in both color and grayscale image denoising settings. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate that the proposed network architecture leads to improved results when compared to multiple high performance convolutional denoising networks from the recent literature."
Adaptive Style Modulation for Artistic Style Transfer,"Arbitrary-style-per-model (ASPM) style transfer algorithms transfer arbitrary styles based on a single model. Statistics-based learning algorithms of ASPM, represented by adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN), conduct instance normalization and then perform an affine transformation on target features. These algorithms are computationally efficient and easy to embed in convolutional neural networks. Consequently, they are widely used in image synthesis tasks to control the style of the resulting images. However, the style of stylized images may be a combination of content and stylized images, which suggests that these methods do not transform styles accurately. In this work, we rethink the function of AdaIN in controlling style. We show that the role of AdaIN is to (1) give each input content image a specific optimization target, (2) dynamically set cross-channel correlations, and (3) act as a feature selector after combining it with an activation function. Accordingly, we propose adaptive style modulation (AdaSM), which fully leverages the three roles mentioned above and thereby enables more precise control of global style. Experimental results show that AdaSM provides superior style controllability, alleviates the style blending problem, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in artistic style transfer tasks."
Motivating factors for frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A survey in Japan,"Healthcare workers (HCWs), who are at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic, treated COVID-19 patients under many types of stress for over a year. As an external motivating factor, incentives could be important for HCWs dealing with COVID-19. However, there has been no research regarding the change in the consciousness of HCWs during the unrelenting waves of COVID-19. Therefore, we conducted a survey of HCWs during different waves of COVID-19 (the second and fourth waves in Japan). An open web-based survey was conducted among HCWs who wore PPE while treating COVID-19 patients. The first survey of HCWs in Japan was conducted from August 27 to September 9, 2020, while the second survey was conducted from April 7 to May 10, 2021, during the second and fourth waves, respectively. The first and second surveys had 157 and 125 participants, respectively. There were no significant differences in the characteristics of the participants in the first and second survey groups regarding the types of occupation, age, sex, or full-time status. The percentage of HCWs who required financial incentives to maintain motivation remained high (88.5% vs. 82.7%). In addition, most frontline HCWs hope for regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, which will be provided free of charge, as a necessary incentive. External motivating factors, such as financial and other incentives, were important to maintain the motivation of HCWs during the second and fourth waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan."
Myositis ossificans of the chest wall in an 8-year-old boy: a case report of a diagnostic pitfall,"Myositis ossificans of the chest wall is extremely unusual with fewer than a dozen reported cases. In addition, the occurrence in children younger than 10 years is extremely rare. We report a case of an 8-year-old male who presented with painful and progressively enlarging left-sided chest wall mass. The tumor showed close histo-morphological mimicry with osteosarcoma. Moreover, the characteristic radiographic findings of myositis ossificans were absent. The age of the patient and the absence of attachment to the rib helped exclude extra-skeletal and parosteal osteosarcomas, respectively. The patient was doing well 4 months after surgery."
Comparison Between the Effect of Intra-Scalar Methylprednisolone and Sodium Hyaluronate in Impedance and Electrically Evoked Compound Action Potentials in Cochlear Implant Patients,"To evaluate and compare the effect of intra-scalar methylprednisolone and sodium hyaluronate on cochlear implants’ impedance and electrically evoked compound action potentials thresholds. In a prospective randomized clinical trial, 103 children with pre-lingual hearing loss candidates for cochlear implantation at a tertiary hospital were divided into three groups based on intervention. Intraoperatively, one group received intra-scalar methylprednisolone, the second sodium hyaluronate, and the third group was the control group. Impedance and electrically evoked compound action potentials (e-ECAP) thresholds on long-term follow-up were evaluated and compared in these three groups. Significant decrease in impedance and e-ECAP thresholds were observed in all groups in a 4-year follow-up. No statistically significant difference was observed among all mentioned groups. Impedance and e-ECAP thresholds decrease in the long term, and using topical intra-scalar Healon or methylprednisolone may not significantly affect these parameters."
Distributed lags using elastic-net regularization for market response models: focus on predictive and explanatory capacity,"For many decades, considerable research has been conducted on Market Response models. Mostly without any attempts to validate the results in strictly predictive tasks and often ignoring if the methods comply with the underlying assumptions and conditions, like the method’s ability to outline the broadly accepted effects of advertising actions. This work presents an enhanced method for market response models consistent with the underlying assumptions of such. Our method is based on Distributed Lag Models with the novelty of introducing regularization in its estimation, a cross-validation framework, and hold-out testing, next to present an empirical manner of extracting its effects. This approach allows the construction of models in an exploratory and simple manner, unlocking the possibility of extracting the underlying effects and being suitable for large samples and many variables. Last, we conduct a practical example using real-world data, accompanied by an unprecedented set of empirical explainability assessments next to a high level of predictive capability in similar circumstances to how it would be used for decision-making in a corporate setup."
How are Income and Assets Associated with Food Insecurity? An Application of the Growth Mixture Modeling,"Food insecurity remains prevalent in the United States, affecting millions of households. Research has confirmed that low income and limited assets are risk factors for food insecurity, but how income and assets are associated with food insecurity has not been fully explored in light of the fact that food insecurity endures or worsens over time for some people but not others. Using 2015, 2017, and 2019 waves of the panel study of income dynamics, this study (1) investigated the heterogeneity of food insecurity trajectories using Growth Mixture Modeling; (2) performed a multinomial logistic regression to examine how income and assets are associated with the relative risk of facing a more severe food insecurity trajectory; and (3) compared the coefficient of income with the coefficient of assets. Results of this study showed that both higher income and more assets are associated with a lower probability of facing food insecurity that worsens rather than improves with time. This study also observed that the association strength was stronger for income than for assets. These results offer insights for policies aimed at creating efficient financial support strategies (e.g., income assistance, asset building) that reduce recipients’ risk of experiencing long-term food insecurity."
Long-term vonoprazan administration causes gastric fundic gland-type hyperplastic polyps and chronic bleeding,"A patient experienced gastric fundic gland-type hyperplastic polyps, consisting of foveolar epithelium and parietal cells, complicated with chronic bleeding due to long-term treatment with vonoprazan. The patient had progressive anemia, probably caused by bleeding from the polyps. After switching from vonoprazan to a histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonist, the polyps markedly shrank and the anemia improved. Vonoprazan can produce reversible hyperplastic polyps and anemia. In case of anemia in patients receiving long-term vonoprazan, it is important to consider drug cessation or change to an H2 blocker."
Clinical course and treatment of radiation-induced hemorrhagic gastritis: a case series study,"Radiation-induced hemorrhagic gastritis is a relatively uncommon complication of irradiation that can be severe. However, appropriate treatment guidelines have not yet been established because of the small number of known cases. At our hospital, we encountered nine cases of radiation-induced hemorrhagic gastritis between July 2005 and July 2018. All patients initially underwent argon plasma coagulation (APC) for hemostasis. The treatment was highly effective, and hemostasis was successfully achieved in eight of the cases. Hemostasis could not be achieved in one case treated with APC; therefore, surgical resection was required. This patient had risk factors, such as liver cirrhosis and a history of abdominal surgery. Our case series suggests that APC is an effective hemostatic method that should be considered as the initial treatment option for radiation-induced hemorrhagic gastritis; however, surgical resection may be considered when the patient is at high risk for rebleeding."
Axillary staging and management of cN + breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy: results of a survey among breast cancer surgeons in Spain,"Given the high rate of complete nodal response, the role of axillary lymph node dissection on staging the axilla has been questioned. This survey, addressed to breast cancer surgeons in Spain, has the objective of assessing current clinical trends on axillary staging of cN + patients treated with NAC."
HSF1 expression in tumor-associated macrophages promotes tumor cell proliferation and indicates poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), are crucial for the survival and development of tumor cells. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is a potent, complex carcinogenesis modulator, and esophageal cancer (EC) patients have a bad prognosis when HSF1 is highly expressed. HSF1's clinical importance and biological role in TAMs are still unknown."
"Interaction phenomena between solitons, lumps and breathers for the combined KP3-4 equation","The Hirota’s bilinear method is used to determine the N-soliton solutions of the combined KP3 and KP4 equation, from which the M-lump solutions that decay to zero in all directions in the plane are obtained by using long wave limit when \(N=2M\). Then, we discuss some novel hybrid solutions between lumps, breathers and solitons. In order to shade more light on the dynamical characteristics of the acquired solutions, numerical simulations have been performed by means of the 3D figures under careful choice of the values of the parameters involved. These results may be useful for understanding the propagation phenomena of nonlinear localized waves. The hybrid solutions describing molecules between lumps, breathers and solitons are also presented."
Complicated nonlinear oscillations caused by maneuvering of a flexible spacecraft equipped with hinged solar arrays,"We present a general methodology for the nonlinear dynamical modeling of a three-axis stabilized spacecraft equipped with flexible solar arrays. The large-span multi-panel solar arrays are modeled as flexible thin plates that are connected to the rigid central body of the spacecraft by means of nonlinear flexible hinges. We construct a low-dimensional yet accurate dynamical model by using a Galerkin expansion in terms of global modes of the system that we compute first by using the Rayleigh–Ritz method. The hinged connections between the rigid and flexible parts of the system are imposed employing Lagrange multipliers. The model is used to study the spacecraft response triggered by various maneuvering scenarios. We in particular focus on the coupling between vibrations of the flexible components and the rigid motion of the spacecraft induced by hinge nonlinearities during these orbital and attitude maneuvering operations. In all cases considered, it is found that four global modes are sufficient to accurately compute the system’s response. We also observe other complicated nonlinear dynamical phenomena, such as hysteresis and superharmonic resonance that may be of concern in spacecraft design. Our modeling approach can be applied to other multibody systems directly."
Investigation on generating spherical gear with imaginary spherical cutter,"In this study, an imaginary spherical cutter with a straight edge was developed and used to create a spherical gear pair. First, the mathematical equation of the imaginary spherical cutter with a straight edge is established. A mathematical software package was used to display the imaginary spherical cutter. The coordinate systems relationship between the spherical gear pairs and the imaginary spherical cutter was defined. The equations of the family of the imaginary cutter surfaces were obtained by using the homogeneous coordinate transformation matrix, and a mathematical model of the spherical gear pair was created according to the theory of gearing. Using tooth contact analysis and assembly errors, the effect of assembly errors on the transmission errors of the spherical gear pairs was discussed. Through a finite element analysis software, the contact models under assembly errors were performed, and the contact stress distribution of the tooth surfaces under assembly errors was observed. As a result, the spherical gear pair was most sensitive to the assembly error of the center distance. It is the least sensitive to the vertical deviation angle of the misalignment assembly error."
"A comparative study of the detection of the fuel-injection start and stop timing of a diesel injector using a photo sensor, a shock sensor and a needle lift sensor","The fuel-injection start and stop timings of a diesel injector were measured using a photo sensor, a shock sensor, and a needle lift sensor. The fuel spray jet was detected by installing a photo sensor at the position closest to the fuel spray jet exiting the diesel injector nozzle hole. The shock sensor was mounted outside of the injector holder assembly and the fuel injection timing was measured by detecting the shock wave generated when the injector needle moved. The injector needle lift was measured by using an injector with a built-in needle lift sensor (TDI G80 sensor). The G80 sensor has an integrated solenoid allowing the detection of the movement of the injector needle. As the injector needle moves, an electrical signal is induced from the solenoid and the voltage is measured. The photo sensor, shock sensor, and needle lift sensor all confirm that the timing of the start of fuel injection by the injector can be accurately measured. The fuel injection stop timing could be measured by the photo sensor and the needle lift sensor. The variation of the fuel injection stop timing was greater than that of the fuel injection start timing. The shock sensor could not accurately measure the fuel injection stop timing. The detecting time order of the start of the fuel injection by the three sensors was in order of the needle lift sensor, the shock sensor and the photo sensor."
Parallel volume integral equation method for three-dimensional multiple inclusion problems,"In this paper, the volume integral equation method (VIEM) is introduced for the analysis of multiple isotropic/anisotropic inclusions (or inhomogeneities) in an unbounded isotropic matrix. In order to introduce the VIEM as an accurate and efficient numerical method for the three-dimensional elastostatic inclusion (or inhomogeneity) problem, multiple isotropic/orthotropic spherical inclusions (or inhomogeneities) in an unbounded isotropic matrix under uniform remote tensile loading are investigated."
Fault diagnosis method of belt conveyor idler based on sound signal,"Damage to a belt conveyor idler will increase the downtime and maintenance cost, so it is very important to diagnose its fault. At present, the fault diagnosis of the idler of a belt conveyor is mostly based on vibration and temperature signal. However, contact fault diagnosis approaches are severely limited when sensors are inconvenient to install or when vibration and temperature signals cannot be returned. In this special case, the non-contact fault diagnosis method, represented by measuring acoustic signals, becomes a necessary means. To effectively extract mechanical state information from sound signals of belt conveyors and identify typical mechanical faults, we propose a fault detection method based on sample center distance weighted (support vector data description (SVDD)) and multi-frame fusion (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC)) features. Aiming at the disadvantage that single frame MFCC features and traditional SVDD are susceptible to noise, multi-frame fusion MFCC optimization features are used as samples, and the weighted SVDD model based on sample center distance is used for fault detection. Finally, the overall recognition accuracy of the experiment is greatly improved. It is proved that MFCC features of multi-frame fusion sound signal and weighted SVDD fault detection based on sample center distance can effectively determine whether there is a fault in the of belt conveyor idler."
A high-dimensional optimization method combining projection correlation-based Kriging and multimodal parallel computing,"In surrogate-based optimization (SBO), the recognized issues associated with the high-dimensional surrogate models focus on the prohibitive computational costs and the low model accuracy. However, there is a lack of effective solutions in the face of the ‘curse of dimensionality’. In this paper, we propose a novel Kriging metamodel to remedy this deficiency. The Kriging model based on projection correlation (KPC) introduces the projection correlation into the Kriging modeling process as prior information, taking into account the nature of hyperparameters. The effectiveness and accuracy of the KPC are illustrated through 10–70-dimensional numerical examples. Furthermore, a parallel computing strategy that combines the multi-peak characteristics of expected improvement and minimizing prediction (MEI&MP) is proposed to further improve high-dimensional optimization efficiency and potential. The global performance and optimization efficiency of our method are validated via typical test functions and structural optimization problems."
"2H-Pyrano[3,2-c]chromene-2,5(6H)-diones: Synthesis, Characterization, Photophysical and Redox Studies for Potential Optoelectronic Applications","Herein, we report the preparation of 2H-pyrano[3,2-c]chromene-2,5(6H)-diones 3a-x by reacting 4-hydroxycoumarins 1a-b with Baylis–Hillman adducts 2a-w having electron releasing or electron withdrawing groups on benzyl ring of the pyranochromene moiety and study of their photophysical properties. The study of optical and electrochemical properties of the prepared compounds reveals that the electron releasing and electron withdrawing groups has not much impact on ground and excited state electronic behavior on pyranochromene moiety. The density functional theory suggests the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals spread on coumarin moiety of pyranochromene unit. Further, these compounds are thermally stable (up to 200 °C) and lead to blue or green emission that should facilitate the development of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)."
Intergenerational mobility measurement with latent transition matrices,"We propose a multivariate approach for the estimation of intergenerational transition matrices. Our methodology is grounded on the assumption that individuals’ social status is unobservable and must be estimated. In this framework, parents and offspring are clustered on the basis of the observed levels of income and occupational categories, thus avoiding any discretionary rule in the definition of class boundaries. The resulting transition matrix is a function of the posterior probabilities of parents and young adults of belonging to each class. Estimation is carried out via maximum likelihood by means of an expectation-maximization algorithm. We illustrate the proposed method using National Longitudinal Survey Data from the United States in the period 1978-2006."
Approximation algorithms for the lower bounded correlation clustering problem,"Lower bounded correlation clustering problem (LBCorCP) is a new generalization of the correlation clustering problem (CorCP). In the LBCorCP, we are given an integer L and a complete labelled graph. Each edge in the graph is either positive or negative based on the similarity of its two endpoints. The goal is to find a clustering of the vertices, each cluster contains at least L vertices, so as to minimize the sum of the number of positive cut edges and negative uncut edges. In this paper, we first introduce the LBCorCP and give three algorithms for this problem. The first algorithm is a random algorithm, which is designed for the instances of the LBCorCP with fewer positive edges. The second one is that we let the set V itself as a cluster and prove that the algorithm works well on two specially instances with fewer negative edges. The last one is an LP-rounding based iterative algorithm, which is also provided for the instances with fewer negative edges. The above three algorithms can quickly solve some special instances in polynomial time and obtain a smaller approximation ratio. In addition, we conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of our algorithms."
Intelligent Control of Double Boost Converter Interfaced with Multilevel Inverter for Electrical Vehicle Applications,"This work presents a double boost converter (DBC) integrated with three-level diode clamped multilevel inverter (TLDCI). The proposed converter can be used for renewable energy, grid or electric vehicle applications. The double boost converter provides twice the output voltage in comparison with convention boost converter. The DBC is modelled and simulated under open loop and closed loop operating conditions. Proportional integral (PI) and fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) are used in closed loop operation. The DBC further integrated with three-level diode clamped inverter. Sine and third harmonic pulse width modulation (SPWM and TH-PWM) is used to generate pulses for TLDCI. The proposed converter simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. Comparison results in open and closed loop such as output voltage error for double boost converter and line, phase voltages and total harmonic distortion for inverter output voltage and current are presented."
Multifunctional Grid Supported Solar Water Pumping System Utilizing Synchronous Reluctance Motor,"Synchronous reluctance motors (SyRMs) due to their attractive benefits over conventional ac machines, better efficiency, robust design and absence of rare-earth permanent magnets, offer an attractive solution to applications such as solar power-based water pumping. However, in the case of solar power, due to its diurnal nature, is unfeasible for an uninterruptible water supply. To overcome this drawback, a grid-interfaced system combined with a solar PV array is developed. In this work, a grid-PV interfaced system coupled with a water pumping load, driven by SyRM, and additional domestic loads are presented. Single-phase grid is integrated with the solar PV system (via a boost converter) and its DC link through a rectifier and power factor correction enabled boost converter, to enable unidirectional power flow from the grid. A single-phase H-bridge voltage source converter is also included in the system to enable supply from the DC link to the domestic loads. The unity power factor and reduced total harmonics distortion are achieved through the implemented control. The feasibility of the water pumping and load supply on the developed system is validated on a laboratory prototype designed to operate this system under simulated climatic conditions."
An averaged space–time discretization of the stochastic p-Laplace system,"We study the stochastic p-Laplace system in a bounded domain. We propose two new space–time discretizations based on the approximation of time-averaged values. We establish linear convergence in space and 1/2 convergence in time. Additionally, we provide a sampling algorithm to construct the necessary random input in an efficient way. The theoretical error analysis is complemented by numerical experiments."
Combining channel-wise joint attention and temporal attention in graph convolutional networks for skeleton-based action recognition,"Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been shown to be effective in performing skeleton-based action recognition, as graph topology has advantages in representing the natural connectivity of the human bodies. Nevertheless, it is challenging to effectively model the human joints spatially and temporally, and we are lacking attentional mechanisms for critical temporal frames and important skeletal points. In this work, we propose a novel GCNs combined with channel-wise joints and temporal attention for skeleton-based action recognition. Our temporal attention module captures the long-term dependence of time and then enhances the temporal semantics of key frames. In addition, we design a channel-wise attention module that fuses multi-channel joint weights with the topological map to capture the attention of nodes at different actions along the channel dimension. We propose to concatenate joint and bone together along the channel dimension as the joint& bone (J& B) modality, J& B modality can extract hybrid action patterns under the coalition of channel-wise joint attention. We prove the powerful spatio-temporal modeling capability of our model on three widely used dataset, NTU-RGB D, NTU RGB+D 120 and Northwestern-UCLA. Compared with leading GCN-based methods, we achieve performance comparable to the-state-of-art."
Effects of process parameters on friability and surface quality in the rapid investment casting process,"This research investigates surface erosion of ceramic shells in the rapid investment casting (RIC) process using a friability test and microscopy analysis. The impact of different pattern materials, shell facecoat composition, and burnout temperature is explored. Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), and polyvinyl butyral (PVB) feedstock are used to make patterns by 3D printing, while a fourth benchmark set is produced from foundry wax in a rubber mold. The patterns are made in a cylindrical shape and invested in silica-based ceramic shells. The facecoat composition is varied by the addition or the absence of stucco in the primary slurry coat. The shells are burned out at temperatures of 700, 900, and 1100 °C and used for a friability test. Additionally, a set of smaller shell samples is made for microscopic analysis of shell erosion at the pattern-ceramic interface. Results show that among 3D printing feedstock, ABS produces the most surface erosion as revealed by friability measurements and micrographs, while PVB is the least and is comparable to conventional foundry wax. The absence of stucco in the facecoat reduces friability by 25%, 35%, 55%, and 80% for ABS, PLA, PVB, and wax, respectively. Burnout temperature has a varying effect on friability depending on the pattern material. A strong link between the surface quality of castings and friability is found."
Grinding force model for gear profile grinding based on material removal mechanism,"Traditional force models fail to predict the grinding force for gear profile grinding accurately owing to the specific grinding geometry and kinematics. On the other hand, few researchers about gear profile grinding concern the grinding force. To address this issue, a model to predict the grinding force for gear profile grinding is proposed. This comprehensive study consists of three aspects, namely, the wheel model, the kinematics model, and the force model. Unlike other wheel models for the grinding process, the cumulative number of grinding points in this wheel model is a variable depending on the radius infeed depth. A specific model for grinding geometry and kinematics of gear profile grinding are established based on the processing principle and grain-workpiece contact. Then, the force model is proposed considering the effect of grinding stages and the transformation matrix of the local coordinate system for abrasive grain. To verify the proposed model, experiments are conducted based on specific operations to overcome measurement restrictions, and the effects of grinding parameters on force components are investigated. The proposed models not only predict the grinding force but also reveal the differences between the material removal mechanism for gear profile grinding and that for surface grinding."
Synthesis and characterization of spark plasma sintered zirconia and ferrotitanium reinforced hybrid aluminium composite,"This research reports on the microstructural characterization and nanomechanical evaluation of hybrid aluminium-based composite, fabricated by reinforcing pure aluminium matrix with zirconia (ZrO2) and ferrotitanium (TiFe) particles. The composites were consolidated using the spark plasma sintering technique, and the properties of the reinforced composites were examined and compared with pure aluminium samples fabricated using the same sintering parameters. The formation of new phases in the hybrid composites was ascertained using the X-ray diffraction technique, while the morphologies of the starting powders and as-sintered specimens were analysed using optical and scanning electron microscopes. Mechanical tests such as Vickers microhardness and frictional coefficient were determined to ascertain the respective strength and tribological performance. Nanoindentation test was also carried out to evaluate the nanomechanical properties such as penetration depth, elastic modulus, work indentation, and indentation creep. The results from this study revealed that mixing and sintering the admixed powders at sufficiently high temperature resulted in the formation of new phases which contributed to improved mechanical performance of the hybrid composites. The absence of pinning effect in loading and unloading curves from the nanoindentation test conducted confirmed the homogeneous dispersion of the reinforcement particles. Overall, the sample reinforced with 5% TiFe and 5% ZrO2 exhibited the most improved mechanical properties, while the unreinforced aluminium sample recorded the least mechanical and nanomechanical performance."
Development and application of a novel model to predict the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease among lean pre-diabetics with normal blood lipid levels,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been associated with type 2 diabetes, but its relationship with pre-diabetes is still unknown. This study aims to determine whether pre-diabetes is associated with NAFLD, followed by establishing a NAFLD predictive nomogram for lean Chinese pre-diabetics with normal blood lipids."
Chlorine Removal from Water by Biochar Derived from Various Food Waste Natural Materials,"The aim of this paper was to investigate the effectiveness of pyrolyzed low-cost food waste natural materials from the food industry on the removal of chlorine from water. Biochar was produced after pyrolysis at 850 oC from malt spent rootlets (MSR), walnut shells, and apricot, olive, carob and grape kernels. The biochars were characterized for their surface area, microporosity, functional groups and pH. Continuous flow column experiments were conducted at varying flow rates to evaluate the efficiency of biochars to remove free and total chlorine. The initial free and total chlorine concentrations in water fed to the columns were 2.0 and 2.2 mg/L, respectively. The chlorine removal of free and total chlorine of all materials tested ranged from 76 to 92% and 80 to 95%, respectively, with the MSR exhibiting the highest removal. MSR biochar was subjected to the highest cumulative water volume passed through the column (162 L/g) and exhibited the highest total chlorine removal capacity (6 to 330 mg/g). Olive kernel also reached high chlorine removal (99%), while apricot kernel, grape kernel, carob seed and pulp presented poor chlorine removals."
A fault diagnosis network based on domain adversarial learning and distribution matching for rotating machine vibration signal with noise and across-load conditions,"In the practice of deep learning-based rotating machinery fault diagnosis method, how to improve the accuracy of cross-working condition diagnosis under noise background is an urgent problem to be solved, which limits the application of deep learning method in engineering practice. Although domain adaptation methods have been widely researched to solve the problem, they often face the problem of domain shift. In this paper, two domain adaptation methods: domain adversarial learning and distribution matching methods, are used to train the deep network, to make the model realize the fault diagnosis across load conditions and signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, in order to suppress the domain shift phenomenon which often occurred in domain adaptation tasks. A new network architecture based on the wide convolution kernel, multi-scale attention module, and self-adaptive soft threshold function is proposed so that the network is more suitable for feature extraction in cross-working condition fault diagnosis, and can avoid the influence of noise in vibration signals. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has good performance in faults diagnosis across load conditions and under noise. Feature visualization proved that the proposed network can effectively extract the conjoint fault features across different load conditions from the signal; hence, the fault diagnosis across load conditions and under the noise background can be realized and the domain shift can be suppressed effectively."
An intelligent fractional-order system for the biological parameters regulations,"In recent times, controllers have been widely used for tuning the biological parameters of the human body. Biological parameters play a vital role in determining the health status of the human body. Any change/difference in biological components leads the person to severe diseases and even death. Therefore, an effective tuning mechanism is necessary to tune these biological parameters optimally. Several tuning models were proposed in the past based on control systems, but those models require more resources for tuning the biological parameters. Also, those models are highly complex in design and computational time. To find a solution for this described issue, a novel hybrid controller named bat-based recurrent fractional-order system has been developed in this article. The bat fitness is incorporated into the controller to provide the finest tuning outcomes. Here, the designed model tunes the biological parameters such as glucose, insulin, and gene expression. Besides, the classification layer of the recurrent neural system is tuned by the bat functions that have afforded better biological parameter prediction outcomes in a very short time. Furthermore, the developed controller is executed in a MATLAB environment, and the performance has been checked for biological data acquisition. In addition, the outcomes were evaluated based on settling time, overshoot, accuracy, and error rate; sensitivity and stability assessments were made to prove the system's performance. Furthermore, to carry the present research work further, the unstable range of the proposed model has been discussed along with the error rate. Subsequently, the executed model's outcomes were compared with the existing controller to verify the results. The implementation and comparative assessment proved that the designed controller had earned the finest tuned results. Hence, the developed model is more suitable for the biological instrumentation application for predicting and tuning the parameters to the desired level."
Therapeutic effects of magnesium and vitamin B6 in alleviating the symptoms of restless legs syndrome: a randomized controlled clinical trial,"Restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom Disease (RLS/WED) is one of the most prevalent sleep disorders. There are contradicting data about the effectiveness of magnesium and vitamin B6 in alleviating the symptoms of this condition. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the efficacy of magnesium and vitamin B6 in alleviating the symptoms of RLS/WED."
Health-related quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease: a comparison of patients receiving nurse-led versus conventional follow-up care,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consisting of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic disorder with a considerable negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). During the past decade, IBD nurse specialists have been increasingly involved in follow-up care of IBD outpatients, in a consultative and coordinating role, closely cooperating with gastroenterologists."
Failure Envelopes for Strip Footings on Sand Overlying Non-homogeneous Clay Under Combined Loading,"This paper applies the finite element limit analysis by using the average of upper and lower bound theorems to evaluate the bearing capacity of rough strip footings on sand overlying non-homogeneous clay under eccentric-inclined loads. The adaptive meshing technique is used to improve the results of the bearing capacity factors. The effect of the thickness of the sand layer, the strength non-homogeneity, and the eccentric-inclined load are investigated. Both swipe and probe loadings are used to identify the failure envelopes and the failure mechanisms for a strip footing under vertical, horizontal, and moment loads. New results and failure envelopes are presented by considering the effects of the clay non-homogeneity."

Experiences of mothers of NICU preterm infants in milk management out of the hospital: a qualitative study,Human milk is important for the health and development of preterm infants. China’s neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have adopted the management system of maternal–infant separation. Human milk received and used by NICUs is managed by the infants’ families in the out-of-hospital environment. There is scant publication on mothers’ opinions on out-of-hospital human milk management. This study aimed to explore the experiences of Chinese mothers providing their infants in the NICUs with human milk expressed outside of the hospital.
High Hepcidin expression predicts poor prognosis in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a growing public health challenge worldwide. Hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (HAMP) is differentially expressed in various tumors. However, the roles and functions of HAMP in ccRCC remain unclear. In the present study, we integrated systematic bioinformatics approaches to investigate the roles and functions of HAMP and its association with immune cell infiltration in ccRCC. Compared with paracancerous tissue, HAMP expression was significantly upregulated in ccRCC patients. Meanwhile, we found good diagnostic performance of HAMP for ccRCC patients and its close associations with the clinicopathological features of ccRCC patients. In addition, we found that HAMP is closely related to multiple immune pathways and positively correlated with various immune cells. HAMP was a significant independent predictor for ccRCC. High expression of HAMP was associated with worse clinical prognosis and more immune cell infiltration in ccRCC patients. HAMP may offer potential as a biomarker to predict prognosis and the clinical treatment outcome of ccRCC patients."
Calibration and evaluation of the relative biological effectiveness for carbon-ion radiotherapy in a new relative to a clinically applied treatment planning system,The study objective was to validate the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) in RayStation for carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) using the Syngo treatment planning system as reference.
The deserving or undeserving rich? New survey evidence on multimillionaire households in Europe,"This article addresses two questions. First, when do people consider the rich to be deserving? A literature survey reveals that it is first and foremost the origin of great wealth that determine public attitudes towards the rich. Rich people “deserve” to be rich if their wealth is perceived as having resulted from competence and hard work rather than from inheritance. Second, who are the rich? Drawing on data from the second wave of the European Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), it is found that multimillionaire households benefit disproportionately from wealth transfers. Large gifts and bequests alone, however, are not good predictors of rich household status. It is rather the highly educated top heir running a (family) business that best represents the rich in Europe. Such entrepreneurs who benefit from earned and unearned financial resources neither fully correspond to nor contradict the existing public beliefs in the “deservingness” of the rich. It is argued that, while still underresearched, it is the “hybrid rich” that dominate in the twenty-first-century capitalism that is marked by historically high levels of wealth inequality alongside inefficiencies in tax systems."
Hemolysin function of Listeria is related to biofilm formation: transcriptomics analysis,"Listeriolysin O (LLO) is the main virulence protein of Listeria monocytogenes (LM), that helps LM escape lysosomes. We previously found that the cellular immune response elicited by L.ivanovii (LI) is weaker than that elicited by LM. We speculated that this may be related to the function of ivanolysin O (ILO). Here, we constructed hemolysin gene deletion strain, LIΔilo, and a modified strain, LIΔilo::hly, in which ilo was replaced by hly. Prokaryotic transcriptome sequencing was performed on LI, LIΔilo, and LIΔilo::hly. Transcriptome differences between the three strains were compared, and genes and pathways with significant differences between the three strains were analyzed. Prokaryotic transcriptome sequencing results revealed the relationship of ilo to the ribosome, quorum sensing, and phosphotransferase system (PTS) pathways, etc. LIΔilo exhibited attenuated biofilm formation ability compared to LI. Biofilm formation was significantly recovered or even increased after replenishing hly. After knocking out ilo, the relative expression levels of some virulence genes, including sigB, prfA, actA, smcL, and virR, were up-regulated compared to LI. After replenishing hly, these genes were down-regulated compared to LIΔilo. The trend and degree of such variation were not completely consistent when cultured in media containing only monosaccharides or disaccharides. The results confirmed that hemolysin is related to some important biological properties of Listeria, including biofilm formation and virulence gene expression levels. This is the first comprehensive study on ILO function at the transcriptomic level and the first evidence of a relationship between Listeria hemolysin and biofilm formation."
Two Step Fabrication of Nano-ZnO-α-FeOOH Composite for Experimental and Modeling Studies of Removal of Indigo Carmine and Alizarin Red S in Batch Process,"Zinc oxide/goethite (Z-α-F) nanocomposite was prepared from Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and freshly prepared α-FeOOH (goethite) nanoparticles. The material was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron diffraction atomic X- ray (EDAX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), Brunauer–Emmette–Teller (BET) surface area, and thermo-gravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TGA/DTA) methods. The surface area and average sizes of the spherically rode-like embedded nanomaterial were 62.20 m2 g−2 and 41.11 nm. The adsorbent was used in single and binary adsorption of indigo carmine (IDC) and alizarin red S (ARS). The pseudo-second-order kinetics described the adsorption processes well with intraparticle diffusion model as rate limiting, while the Langmuir isotherm data fitted well indicating monolayer, and homogeneous adsorption. The ∆H values (+ 185.18 and + 131.59 kJ mol−1) and ∆S (+ 0.63 and + 0.45 kJ mol−1) for IDC and ARS respectively, for the single system revealed that the adsorption processes were endothermic and spontaneous at the Z-α-F-aqueous interface, while the negative ∆G values revealed spontaneous adsorption. The Ea values (+ 12.03 and 8.53 kJ mol−1) indicated diffusion controlled (physical adsorption) processes. The multiple isotherm data showed that the extended and modified Languir models gave good fit for adsorption of IDC and ARS dyes respectively suggesting that the energy of adsorption in the IDC-ARS system is constant and equal for each site, and no interaction between the components. The adsorption capacity ratio, R, values were all less than one (R < 1) indicating antagonistic effect in the IDC-ARS system."
Health Disparities Experienced by Hispanic Americans with Multiple Myeloma: A Systematic Review,"Health disparities in multiple myeloma (MM) disproportionately affect minorities. Characterization of health disparities encountered by Hispanic Americans with MM is necessary to identify gaps and inform future strategies to eliminate them. We performed a systematic review of publications that described health disparities relevant to Hispanic Americans with MM through December 2021. We included all original studies which compared incidence, treatment, and/or outcomes of Hispanic Americans with other ethnic groups. Eight hundred and sixty-eight articles were identified of which 22 original study articles were included in our systematic review. The number of publications varied over time with the highest number of studies (32%) published in 2021. Most of the published studies (59%) reported worse outcomes for Hispanic Americans with MM compared to other ethnic groups. There is growing evidence that Hispanic Americans with MM are facing a multitude of disparities that require immediate attention and solutions."
Dandelion (Taraxacum mongolicum Hand.-Mazz.) suppresses the decrease in physical strength and exercise capacity caused by insufficient liver function,"In this study, D-galactose was used to establish a model of liver dysfunction caused by oxidative stress in mice, and the effect of dandelion on improving the exercise capacity of mice with liver dysfunction was observed and its mechanism was expounded. This study examined the role and mechanism of dandelion in improving running ability, swimming endurance, blood biochemical indices, histopathological changes, and tissue mRNA expression changes. The animal results showed that dandelion extended the running and swimming time to exhaustion in liver dysfunctional mice, reduced the serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood lactic acid (BLA) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver, and increased hepatic glycogen (HG) and muscle glycogen (MG) levels as well as uperoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities. Histopathological observations suggested that dandelion alleviated lesions in the liver. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis results showed that dandelion downregulated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) mRNA expression and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), and catalase (CAT) expression in the liver and skeletal muscle of the liver-dysfunctional mice. In contrast, dandelion downregulated syncytin-1 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle of mice with a dysregulated liver. The positional analysis showed that the main components of dandelion were gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, rutin, myricitrin, isoquercitrin, isochlorogenic acid A, and luteolin."
"Knowledge and practices on childhood anaemia, thalassaemia and iron deficiency among mothers of children aged between 6 and 59 months in a suburban area of Sri Lanka","Childhood anaemia is one of the most common public health problems worldwide.

"Development and Validation of a New Staging System for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients Based on Combined Pathological TNM, Radiomics, and Proteomics","This study aimed to construct a new staging system for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) based on combined pathological TNM (pTNM) stage, radiomics, and proteomics."
Label-free retraining for improved ground plane segmentation,"Due to increased potential applications of unmanned aerial vehicles over urban areas, algorithms for the safe landing of these devices have become more critical. One way to ensure a safe landing is to locate the ground plane regions of images captured by the device camera that are free of obstacles by deep semantic segmentation networks. In this paper, we study the performance of semantic segmentation networks trained for this purpose at a particular altitude and location. We show that a variation in altitude and location significantly decreases network performance. We then propose an approach to retrain the network using only a new set of images and without marking the ground regions in this novel training set. Our experiments show that we can convert a network’s operating range from low to high altitudes and vice versa by label-free retraining."
Patient-reported needs for coping with worry or fear about cancer recurrence and the extent to which they are being met: a survey study,"Many cancer patients and survivors experience fear or worry about cancer recurrence (FCR). Evidence suggests support for FCR is their largest unmet need. We aimed to assess which types of support are needed, which providers are preferred and to what extent patients’ needs are being met."
"Earliest Vallesian suid remains from Creu de Conill 20 (Vallès-Penedès Basin, NE Iberian Peninsula)","Although the suid assemblages from the Miocene of the Vallès-Penedès Basin (NE Iberian Peninsula) are reasonably well known, taxonomic studies devoted to them have lagged behind in recent decades. We describe the unpublished suid dentognathic remains from the earliest Vallesian (MN9) of Creu de Conill 20 (CCN20; 11.18 Ma), which represents the First Appearance Datum of hipparionin equids in western Europe. The sample includes 118 specimens, mostly isolated teeth, and a few maxillary and mandibular fragments. More than three-quarters of the specimens are assigned to the suine Propotamochoerus palaeochoerus, which is characteristic of MN9, albeit the described remains are slightly larger than average for the species. The rest of the sample belongs to a large tetraconodontine that is assigned to Parachleuastochoerus valentini, recorded elsewhere from MN7+8 to MN9, except for two specimens attributed to the small suid cf. Albanohyus sp. Our results support a synchronous dispersal of Hippotherium and P. palaeochoerus into Western Europe at ~ 11.2 Ma, suggesting that the latter is a suitable biochronological marker of the Vallesian. In turn, the remains of Pa. valentini refine our knowledge of the dental morphology of this species and strengthen the view that this species (unlike Conohyus doati and Conohyus melendezi) is not a junior synonym of Conohyus simorrensis. The lack of Listriodon splendens and Versoporcus sp. from CCN20, together with the scarcity of Albanohyus, contrasts with their abundance in the roughly coeval site of Castell de Barberà, hinting at local paleoenvironmental differences."
Machinability and chip morphology evolution of hardened stainless steel using liquid nitrogen cryogenic,"The impeller material FV520B-hardened stainless steel is a typical difficult-to-machine material. During the cutting process, the force and thermal load are large, and the chip breaking is difficult, resulting in poor processing quality and serious tool wear. Low temperature cooling can improve the machinability of materials by significantly reducing the temperature of the cutting zone. It is an important development direction of clean cutting in the future. In this paper, the effects of low temperature cooling (18 ~  − 196℃) on cutting machinability and chip morphology evolution of FV520B were systematically studied from macroscopic and microscopic aspects by setting triaxial milling and orthogonal turning experiments respectively based on low-temperature jet formed by mixing liquid nitrogen and compressed air. The experimental results show that liquid nitrogen cryogenic cutting can significantly improve the machinability of material FV520B and promote the formation of serrated chips. Under the condition of cutting speed of 80 m/min, axial cutting depth of 1 mm and feed per tooth of 0.25 mm/r, the cutting force, cutting vibration, and surface roughness of FV520B at − 100℃ are reduced by 30%, 62%, and 18% respectively compared with those at 18℃. When the cutting speed is 80 m/min, the axial cutting depth is 1 mm, and the feed per tooth is 0.1 mm/z, the tool life at − 100℃ is 43% higher than that at 18℃. With the increase of cutting speed and the decrease of jet temperature, the serration degree, pitch, and shear angle of chips increase and the deformation coefficient of chips decreases."
Experimental study of EDM characteristics using a 5-DOF controllable magnetic levitation actuator,"The efficiency and accuracy of conventional electrical discharge machining (EDM) are limited by the stability of the voltage between the poles. To improve the efficiency of EDM, this paper presents a machining method that combines a self-developed 5-degree-of-freedom (5-DOF) controllable magnetic levitation actuator with a conventional EDM machine tool. The stability of the interpole voltage is improved by actuator microadjustment of the electrodes of the EDM machine tool. First, an EDM control system with local current feedback and decoupling control elements is designed based on the EDM servo drive principle to improve the response speed and positioning accuracy of the actuator. Second, the actuator is connected to the spindle of a conventional EDM machine tool, and machining experiments are carried out. The experimental results show that the EDM machine tool connected to the actuator can control the electrode position more quickly, adjust the discharge state quickly, and increase the number of discharges per unit time. The average machining speed increases from 1.108 to 3.925 µm/s, which is 3.54 times as fast as conventional EDM. Finally, complex shape machining experiments are carried out, and the machining results showed that by adjusting the target value of the radial direction of the actuator, the various trajectories of the electrode can be controlled to depict arbitrary shapes."
High reliability model of mechanical response in drilling of CFRP/Al stacks,"CFRP/Al laminate material is widely used in aerospace due to its advantages of light weight and high machinability. For assembling, crowded assembly holes need to be drilled for CFRP/Al laminate products. However, the damages of burr, delamination, and tearing appear frequently in drilling without precise guidance by mechanical response model. In order to reduce the machining damages, in this paper, a high-reliability mechanical response model is established for each stage in laminate materials drilling to ascertain the matching method between materials, tools, and cutting parameters. The theoretical expression of drilling thrust based on the thin plate theory is established considering the influence of cutting parameters, and further corrected with the cutting parameter correction terms to predict drilling thrust force, and further guiding the optimization of drilling parameters. According to the experimental results, the proposed model has a reliability greater than 97.3% and a prediction deviation lower than 13.2% in CFRP/Al laminate material drilling thrust force prediction. In the cutting with optimized parameters from the proposed model, the inlet orifice of the laminated material has no flanging burr, and the CFRP layer exit orifice has no defects as burr, delamination, or tearing."
Setting a quality indicator for actual surgery time relative to scheduled surgery time in the context of increasing robotic-assisted thoracic surgery cases,This study aimed to demonstrate to the involved departments the goal of increasing the number of robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) cases/surgeons and acceptable surgery times.
Open Chest Duration Following Congenital Cardiac Surgery Increases Risk for Surgical Site Infection,"Surgical site infections (SSI) following congenital heart surgery (CHS) remain a significant source of morbidity. Delayed sternal closure (DSC) is often required to minimize the potential for hemodynamic instability. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of SSI among patients undergoing DSC versus primary chest closure (PCC) and to define a potential inflection point for increased risk of SSI as a function of open chest duration (OCD).A retrospective review of our institutional Society of Thoracic Surgeons dataset is to identify patients undergoing CHS at our institution between 2015 and 2020. Incidences of SSI were compared between DSC and PCC patients. DSC patients were evaluated to determine the association of OCD and the incidence of SSI.2582 operations were performed at our institution between 2015 and 2020, including 195 DSC and 2387 PCC cases. The incidence of SSI within the cohort was 1.8% (47/2,582). DSC patients had significantly higher incidences of SSI (17/195, 8.7%) than PCC patients (30/2387, 1.3%, p < 0.001). Further, patients with an OCD of four or more days had a significantly higher incidence of SSI (11/62, 17.7%, p = 0.006) than patients with an OCD less than 4 days (6/115, 5.3%).The incidence of SSI following CHS is higher in DSC patients compared to PCC patients. Prolonged OCD of 4 days or more significantly increases the risk of SSI and represents a potentially modifiable risk factor for SSI predisposition. These data support dedicated, daily post-operative assessment of candidacy for chest closure to minimize the risk of SSI."
Hocus POCUS! Parental Quantification of Left-Ventricular Ejection Fraction Using Point of Care Ultrasound: Fiction or Reality?,"Point of care ultrasound has become increasingly utilized in pediatric settings. The assessment of cardiac function is one such implementation of this. This study aimed to determine the feasibility of parents in acquiring images to assess function using a handheld ultrasound probe and the correlation of fractional shortening measurements by handheld ultrasound with hospital acquired echocardiography. This was a single-center prospective study of parents of pediatric patients admitted to the hospital. Parents underwent a 25-min education session on how to use the handheld ultrasound probe and then were asked to acquire a parasternal short-axis and apical four-chamber image on their own. Acquired images were reviewed by two physicians to determine adequacy of images to assess systolic cardiac function subjectively and objectively. Fractional shortening was measured using parent-acquired images and then compared to recent hospital acquired fractional shortening. A total of 25 parents of 21 patients enrolled and completed the study. Of the enrolled parents, 96% of both parasternal short-axis and apical four-chamber images acquired were deemed appropriate for subjective assessment of systolic function. Inter-reader variability of fractional shortening was moderate between two readers. Correlation of fractional shortening measured from parent-acquired images versus hospital acquired images was moderate. Parents were able to successfully obtain a parasternal short-axis and apical four-chamber image adequate to assess function and quantify fractional shortening after a 25-min education session. This pilot data demonstrate that further exploration of parent-performed point of care cardiac assessment may be warranted."

Response to neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy in Chinese patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: the role of tumor immune microenvironment,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) through programmed cell death 1 blockade improve the survival outcomes of patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Recently, the use of neoadjuvant immunotherapy for the treatment of ESCC has been gradually increasing. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment of ICIs with chemotherapy and explore tumor microenvironment (TME) immune profiles of ESCC samples during neoadjuvant therapy."
Optogenetic rejuvenation of mitochondrial membrane potential extends C. elegans lifespan,"Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in aging but the exact biological causes are still being determined. Here, we show that optogenetically increasing mitochondrial membrane potential during adulthood using a light-activated proton pump improves age-associated phenotypes and extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our findings provide direct causal evidence that rescuing the age-related decline in mitochondrial membrane potential is sufficient to slow the rate of aging and extend healthspan and lifespan."
Linoleic Acid Promotes Emission of Bark Beetle Semiochemicals by Fungal Symbionts,"Tree-killing bark beetles in conifer forests vector symbiotic fungi that are thought to help the beetles kill trees. Fungal symbionts emit diverse volatile blends that include bark beetle semiochemicals involved in mating and host localization. In this study, all 12 tested fungal isolates emitted beetle semiochemicals when growing in medium amended with linoleic acid. These semiochemicals included the spiroacetals chalcogran, trans-conophthorin and exo-brevicomin, as well as 2-methyl-3-buten-1-ol, the main aggregation pheromone component of the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus. The emission of these compounds was affected by the type of fatty acid present (linoleic vs. oleic acid). Accumulating evidence shows that the fatty acid composition in conifer bark can facilitate colonization by bark beetles and symbiotic fungi, whereas the fatty acid composition of non-host trees can be detrimental for beetle larvae or fungi. We hypothesize that beetles probe the fatty acid composition of potential host trees to test their suitability for beetle development and release of semiochemicals by symbiotic fungi."
Influence of Bifurcated Fracture Angle on Mechanical Behavior of Rock Blocks,"The bifurcated fracture is distributed in nature, and its deformation and destruction occur under natural and man-made force. The study is carried out based on experiments and simulations to analyze the behavior of rock with bifurcated fractures under pressure. Bifurcated fracture causes the bending of the rock blocks on both sides and produces the tensile fractures under pressure. The lateral blocks with tensile fracture lead to the displacement of the intermediate block. By changing the bifurcated angle between fractures, the displacement characteristics of rock caused by block fractures are studied. The angle affects deformation, stress field, fracture mechanism, and displacement of rock with bifurcated fractures. The angle changes the stress magnitude and distribution of the rock blocks, affecting the initiation and expansion of the tension fractures at the bending side of the rock. Peak value of stress decreases with the decrease in bifurcated angle. The displacement difference between the two blocks will become larger. With the decrease in the pressure, deformation increases with time and the deformation rate decreases with time. The smaller the angle, the more difficult it is for the intermediate block to move out. Bifurcated angle of rock fracture has significant effects on the stability of the rock. The results could provide a reference for the stability of rock engineering."
The application of fuzzy transform method to the initial value problems of linear differential–algebraic equations,"In this study, we propose a method based on the direct and inverse fuzzy transforms (\({\mathcal {F}}\)-transforms) to approximate solutions of the system of linear differential–algebraic equations. We obtain an analytical solution to the initial value problem in terms of basic functions using this method. Since the basic functions have compact support, by employing fuzzy transform to the problem, we obtain the system of linear algebraic equations with lower Hessenberg coefficient matrix. We discuss the solvability of this system and give the error analysis using the consistency of the initial value. We present several examples to illustrate the efficiency and the performance of this new method."
Fault tolerant control strategy for modular PWM current source inverter,"In this paper, a fault-tolerant control method for an input-series output-parallel modular grid-tied pulse-width modulation (PWM) current source inverter is proposed to address the most commonly seen single symmetrical gate-commutated thyristor (SGCT) open-circuit fault problems. This method actively offsets the neutral point of the current space vector to ensure a sinusoidal output of the grid current, and it can achieve the upper limit power of the inverter under the condition of a single SGCT open-circuit fault. In addition, an active damping control method based on grid harmonic current feedback is proposed after analyzing the influence of the transformer ferromagnetic resonance caused by the neutral point offset on the power quality of the grid current. It has been demonstrated that the proposed method effectively suppresses the resonance caused by the transformer and the modified modulation, improving the grid current’s power quality."
Active-reactive power scheduling of integrated electricity-gas network with multi-microgrids,"Advances in natural gas-fired technologies have deepened the coupling between electricity and gas networks, promoting the development of the integrated electricity-gas network (IEGN) and strengthening the interaction between the active-reactive power flow in the power distribution network (PDN) and the natural gas flow in the gas distribution network (GDN). This paper proposes a day-ahead active-reactive power scheduling model for the IEGN with multi-microgrids (MMGs) to minimize the total operating cost. Through the tight coupling relationship between the subsystems of the IEGN, the potentialities of the IEGN with MMGs toward multi-energy cooperative interaction is optimized. Important component models are elaborated in the PDN, GDN, and coupled MMGs. Besides, motivated by the non-negligible impact of the reactive power, optimal inverter dispatch (OID) is considered to optimize the active and reactive power capabilities of the inverters of distributed generators. Further, a second-order cone (SOC) relaxation technology is utilized to transform the proposed active-reactive power scheduling model into a convex optimization problem that the commercial solver can directly solve. A test system consisting of an IEEE-33 test system and a 7-node natural gas network is adopted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling method. The results show that the proposed scheduling method can effectively reduce the power losses of the PDN in the IEGN by 9.86%, increase the flexibility of the joint operation of the subsystems of the IEGN, reduce the total operation costs by $32.20, and effectively enhance the operation economy of the IEGN."
Design and modeling of a free-piston engine generator,"Free-piston engine generators (FPEGs) can be applied as decarbonized range extenders for electric vehicles because of their high thermal efficiency, low friction loss, and ultimate fuel flexibility. In this paper, a parameter-decoupling approach is proposed to model the design of an FPEG. The parameter-decoupling approach first divides the FPEG into three parts: a two-stroke engine, an integrated scavenging pump, and a linear permanent magnet synchronous machine (LPMSM). Then, each of these is designed according to predefined specifications and performance targets. Using this decoupling approach, a numerical model of the FPEG, including the three aforementioned parts, was developed. Empirical equations were adopted to design the engine and scavenging pump, while special considerations were applied for the LPMSM. A finite element model with a multi-objective genetic algorithm was adopted for its design. The finite element model results were fed back to the numerical model to update the LPMSM with increased fidelity. The designed FPEG produced 10.2 kW of electric power with an overall system efficiency of 38.5% in a stable manner. The model provides a solid foundation for the manufacturing of related FPEG prototypes."
Topology optimization under microscale uncertainty using stochastic gradients,"This paper considers the design of structures made of engineered materials, accounting for uncertainty in material properties. We present a topology optimization approach that optimizes the structural shape and topology at the macroscale assuming design-independent uncertain microstructures. The structural geometry at the macroscale is described by an explicit level set approach, and the macroscopic structural response is predicted by the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM). We describe the microscopic layout by either an analytic geometric model with uncertain parameters or a level-cut from a Gaussian random field. The macroscale properties of the microstructured material are predicted by homogenization. Considering the large number of possible microscale configurations, one of the main challenges of solving such topology optimization problems is the computational cost of estimating the statistical moments of the cost and constraint functions and their gradients with respect to the design variables. Methods for predicting these moments, such as Monte Carlo sampling, and Taylor series and polynomial chaos expansions often require a large number of random samples resulting in an impractical computation. To reduce this cost, we propose an approach wherein, at every design iteration, we only use a small number of microstructure configurations to generate an independent, stochastic approximation of the gradients. These gradients are then used either with a gradient descent algorithm, namely Adaptive Moment (Adam), or the globally convergent method of moving asymptotes (GCMMA). Three numerical examples from structural mechanics are used to show that the proposed approach provides a computationally efficient way for macroscale topology optimization in the presence of microstructural uncertainty and enables the designers to consider a new class of problems that are out of reach today with conventional tools."
Application of SiC and Graphite reinforced Aluminium Metal Matrix Composite in Braking Systems and its Validation Through Finite Element Analysis,"Smooth and efficient braking has always been a crucial factor to influence the efficiency of an automobile. This factor has prompted several researchers to indulge in the never-ending chase for a constant development and innovation in the domain of braking systems. Recent progress in this field is evident from the implementation of the new disc brake systems replacing the conventionally used drum type brakes. However, the conventionally existing disc braking systems are continuously exposed to the significant thermal and mechanical stresses that causes structural deformation, overheating, thermal cracking, and squeals of the rotor, which pose a threat to the lifetime and future performance of the rotor pads. Generally, in industrial automobiles, grey cast iron is used as rotor material since it exhibits positive results to thermal and mechanical loads, however investigations demonstrated that superior results can be obtained using other materials as well. Hence in the present study, an attempt to use SiC/Graphite reinforced Aluminium alloy (LM6) as an efficient alternative has been made. Consequently, the performance of the fabricated material was initially estimated through several thermal and mechanical investigations of tensile tests, compression tests, thermal conductivity, thermo-mechanical analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Moreover, with an intention to validate the experimental observations, and to predict the real-life performance, finite element analysis on disc brake rotor of Maruti Alto 800 was conducted. The 3D model of the rotor was designed on Catia V5R20 using actual measurements of the disc brake prototype. This 3D model and measured parameters were used as an input feed for the accurate simulation of modal, structural and thermal behaviour in ANSYS 18.1 FEA software. The results of the experimentations were observed to be in good agreement with the simulation results, indicating the accuracy of the experimental predictions."
Fill in the blank for fashion complementary outfit product Retrieval: VISUM summer school competition,"Every year, the VISion Understanding and Machine intelligence (VISUM) summer school runs a competition where participants can learn and share knowledge about Computer Vision and Machine Learning in a vibrant environment. 2021 VISUM’s focused on applying those methodologies in fashion. Recently, there has been an increase of interest within the scientific community in applying computer vision methodologies to the fashion domain. That is highly motivated by fashion being one of the world’s largest industries presenting a rapid development in e-commerce mainly since the COVID-19 pandemic. Computer Vision for Fashion enables a wide range of innovations, from personalized recommendations to outfit matching. The competition enabled students to apply the knowledge acquired in the summer school to a real-world problem. The ambition was to foster research and development in fashion outfit complementary product retrieval by leveraging vast visual and textual data with domain knowledge. For this, a new fashion outfit dataset (acquired and curated by FARFETCH) for research and benchmark purposes is introduced. Additionally, a competitive baseline with an original negative sampling process for triplet mining was implemented and served as a starting point for participants. The top 3 performing methods are described in this paper since they constitute the reference state-of-the-art for this particular problem. To our knowledge, this is the first challenge in fashion outfit complementary product retrieval. Moreover, this joint project between academia and industry brings several relevant contributions to disseminating science and technology, promoting economic and social development, and helping to connect early-career researchers to real-world industry challenges."
Genome-wide assessment of population genetic and demographic history in Magnolia odoratissima based on SLAF-seq,"Magnolia odoratissima is a highly threatened species, with small distribution and scattered populations due to habitat fragmentation and human activity. In this study, the genetic diversity and population structure of the five remaining natural populations and two cultivated populations of M. odoratissima were analyzed using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived from specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing. A total of 180,650 SNPs were identified in seventy M. odoratissima individuals. The Nei’s and Shannon-Wiener diversity index across all M. odoratissima population were 0.35 and 0.51, respectively, while the observed heterozygosity (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He) were 0.27 and 0.34, respectively. Our results suggest that M. odoratissima has relatively high genetic diversity at the genomic level. The FST and AMOVA indicated that high genetic differentiation exists among populations, and a phylogenetic neighbor-joining tree, Bayesian model–based clustering and discriminant function analysis of principal component all divided the M. odoratissima individuals into three distinct clusters. The Treemix analysis showed that there was low gene flow among the natural populations. Demographic history inferences indicated show that three clusters of M. odoratissima experienced at least three bottlenecks and resulted in a decrease of effective population size. Our results suggest that three distinct evolutionary significant units should be set up to conserve this critically endangered species."
"Highly stable, antiviral, antibacterial cotton textiles via molecular engineering","Cotton textiles are ubiquitous in daily life and are also one of the primary mediums for transmitting viruses and bacteria. Conventional approaches to fabricating antiviral and antibacterial textiles generally load functional additives onto the surface of the fabric and/or their microfibres. However, such modifications are susceptible to deterioration after long-term use due to leaching of the additives. Here we show a different method to impregnate copper ions into the cellulose matrix to form a copper ion-textile (Cu-IT), in which the copper ions strongly coordinate with the oxygen-containing polar functional groups (for example, hydroxyl) of the cellulose chains. The Cu-IT displays high antiviral and antibacterial performance against tobacco mosaic virus and influenza A virus, and Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis bacteria due to the antimicrobial properties of copper. Furthermore, the strong coordination bonding of copper ions with the hydroxyl functionalities endows the Cu-IT with excellent air/water retainability and superior mechanical stability, which can meet daily use and resist repeated washing. This method to fabricate Cu-IT is cost-effective, ecofriendly and highly scalable, and this textile appears very promising for use in household products, public facilities and medical settings."
Hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne-assisted ultrafast sparking synthesis of metastable nanomaterials,"Metastable nanomaterials, such as single-atom and high-entropy systems, with exciting physical and chemical properties are increasingly important for next-generation technologies. Here, we developed a hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne-assisted ultrafast sparking synthesis (GAUSS) platform for the preparation of metastable nanomaterials. The GAUSS platform can reach an ultra-high reaction temperature of 3,286 K within 8 ms, a rate exceeding 105 K s−1. Controlling the composition and chemistry of the hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne aerogel framework, the reaction temperature can be tuned from 1,640 K to 3,286 K. We demonstrate the versatility of the GAUSS platform with the successful synthesis of single atoms, high-entropy alloys and high-entropy oxides. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory show that single atoms synthesized by GAUSS enhance the lithium–sulfur redox reaction kinetics in all-solid-state lithium–sulfur batteries. Our design of the GAUSS platform offers a powerful way to synthesize a variety of metastable nanomaterials."
"Intrinsic D614G and P681R/H mutations in SARS-CoV-2 VoCs Alpha, Delta, Omicron and viruses with D614G plus key signature mutations in spike protein alters fusogenicity and infectivity","The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been rapidly evolving over the time and the genetic variation has led to the generation of Variants of Concerns (VoC), which have shown increased fitness. These VoC viruses contain the key mutations in the spike protein which have allowed better survival and evasion of host defense mechanisms. The D614G mutation in the spike domain is found in the majority of VoC; additionally, the P681R/H mutation at the S1/S2 furin cleavage site junction is also found to be highly conserved in major VoCs; Alpha, Delta, Omicron, and its’ current variants. The impact of these genetic alterations of the SARS-CoV-2 VoCs on the host cell entry, transmissibility, and infectivity has not been clearly identified. In our study, Delta and D614G + P681R synthetic double mutant pseudoviruses showed a significant increase in the cell entry, cell-to-cell fusion and infectivity. In contrast, the Omicron and P681H synthetic single mutant pseudoviruses showed TMPRSS2 independent cell entry, less fusion and infectivity as compared to Delta and D614G + P681R double mutants. Addition of exogenous trypsin further enhanced fusion in Delta viruses as compared to Omicron. Furthermore, Delta viruses showed susceptibility to both E64d and Camostat mesylate inhibitors suggesting, that the Delta virus could exploit both endosomal and TMPRSS2 dependent entry pathways as compared to the Omicron virus. Taken together, these results indicate that the D614G and P681R/H mutations in the spike protein are pivotal which might be favoring the VoC replication in different host compartments, and thus allowing a balance of mutation vs selection for better long-term adaptation."
Development of Neural Network-Based Asphalt Mix Design Parameters Prediction Tool,"Mix design of asphalt concrete is carried out in order to produce a mixture of asphalt bitumen and aggregate that satisfies both minimum design requirements and cost-effectiveness. Marshall mix design, similar to other mix design methods, aims to determine an optimum mix for a given design criteria, having an optimum bitumen content, and has still been one of the most used asphalt mix design method in the world. Marshall mix design procedure requires significant amount of time and skilled workmanship for lengthy laboratory experiments. Time required for the mix design may negatively affect construction schedule especially during the peak construction season. In Marshall mix design procedure, optimum bitumen content is determined based on Marshall stability and flow test results, and other volumetric properties of the mixes. Prediction models that quickly predict all required Marshall mix design parameters based on very few numbers of input parameters requiring significantly less amount of time to obtain compared to the time needed to obtain all Marshall mix design parameters through lengthy laboratory experiments could be quite useful. In this study, artificial neural network-based prediction models based on the data of 200 asphalt mixes designed for asphalt wearing course, obtained from 5th district of the General Directorate of Highways of Turkey, were developed to predict all required Marshall mix design parameters. As part of the paper, a Microsoft Excel Macro-based tool, to be potentially used by 5th district of the General Directorate of Highways of Turkey, was also developed that makes prediction of all required mix design parameters for any given mix in seconds using the developed models and very few numbers of user-defined input parameters requiring significantly less amount time to obtain so that optimum bitumen content could be quickly determined. This will significantly reduce the amount of time and other resources required to determine optimum bitumen content."
Convolutional neural networks prediction of the factor of safety of random layered slopes by the strength reduction method,"The strength reduction method is often used to predict the stability of soil slopes with complex soil properties and failure mechanisms. However, it requires a considerable computational effort. In this paper, we make use of a convolutional neural network to reduce the computational cost. The factor of safety of 600 slopes with different inclination and soil properties is first calculated with the strength reduction method. A convolutional neural network is then trained and validated. We demonstrate the performance of our approach and show how to augment the dataset to further enhance its capability and prevent overfitting."
"Synthesis and Characterization of Nylon 6,6-Polyvinyl Alcohol-Based Polyelectrolytic Membrane","This work presents the preparation and investigation of blended nylon (N)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based polyelectrolytic membranes that are modified with different concentrations of sulfuric acid (SA), chlorosulfonic acid (CSA), and sulfonated activated carbon (SAC) as a filler. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs illustrated good membrane homogeneity, and no cracks or phase separation were detected. Chemical interaction between N, PVA, and other membrane components was confirmed by Raman scattering spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). In addition, the molecular structure is verified by energy depressive X-ray (EDX). Furthermore, water and methanol uptake, gel fraction, and IEC were determined as functions of varied membrane modification components. The results revealed that increasing the portion of SA, CSA and SAC led to an increase in IEC and ionic conductivity values reached 2.12 meq/g–0.076 S/cm for (N/PVA-4.0% SA-4.0% SAC), respectively, and 2.71 meq/g–0.087 S/cm for (N/PVA-4.0% CSA-4.0% SAC), respectively, while the IEC and ionic conductivity value for non-modified N/PVA membrane was 0.02 meq/g and zero, respectively. Such results enhance the potential feasibility of modified N/PVA electrolytic membranes for fuel cell (FC) applications."
"Modeling and simulation of high flow medical CO2 insufflator using PID-P, PID-PQT, and MPC-PQT controllers","In laparoscopic minimally invasive surgeries (MIS), high flow medical Carbon Dioxide (CO2) insufflator is employed to supply CO2 gas forming a gas-filled room inside the abdominal cavity with an evident outlook of intramural parts of the body. Three models of high flow medical CO2 insufflator are presented using MATLAB/SIMULINK-Simscape tool. Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers are selected to separately control pressure, flow, and temperature variables of the first two models (PID-P and PID-PQT). Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is another type of controllers that is favored to control these variables simultaneously for the third model (MPC-PQT). Parameters, specified measurements, and compartments were tuned to achieve smooth running of the systems. Tuning of the controllers is considered to boost the simulation of the models and bring forth preferable results of pressure 0.073 bar (≈ 55 mmHg) in the peritoneal cavity for overweighed patients, in addition to maintaining a temperature of 37 °C as time continues. These outcomes with stability and more realistic curvatures are provided in reasonable short-time scales of few seconds, and of less than one second in the case of MPC-PQT model emphasizing the importance of high flow concept for insufflation purposes in the laparoscopic MIS domain."
Compact and asymmetric fed modified hexagonal shaped multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna for 5G sub: 6 GHz (N77/N78 & N79) and WLAN applications,"A new compact and modified hexagonal-shaped circular MIMO antenna that operates in the band of 2.95–6.3 GHz is presented in this paper. This antenna covers the complete range of 5G sub: 6 GHZ (N77/N78 & N79) and WLAN bands. The design consists of two element MIMO antenna fabricated on low cost FR-4 substrate. In order to improve the isolation a vertical stub is placed between two elements. Isolation greater than 15 dB is achieved over the entire operating band. The suggested MIMO antenna is excited using an asymmetric feeding approach. Simulated and measured results from fabricated prototypes are in good agreement.

Exploring the Role of Religious Ideology in English Language Teachers’ Identity Construction: A Community of Practice Perspective,"This study drew on a community of practice (CoP) perspective and examined the role of religious ideology in 10 Iranian English language teachers’ identity construction. The study was situated within a narrative inquiry methodology. Data were collected from semi-structured interviews and narrative frames to capture how Islamic principles contribute to the teachers’ professional practice and identity construction. Our findings revealed that religious ideology shaped the teachers’ identity construction across teaching materials, institutional relationships, and tensions between the normative and personalized ideologies of the teachers. We show how religious ideology, as extended to the context of the school CoP, functions as a source of tensions for the teachers by promoting materials that clash with their internal feelings and creates detachment in their institutional relationships. Moreover, the religious ideology served as a source of marginalization, detachment from the dominant religious principles, and attachment to personal values as practical alternatives facilitating teachers’ membership. We further provide implications for running professional development courses that enhance teachers’ awareness of the role of religious ideology in their professional practice."
"Quotas, disclosure, and a rule called Rooney: diversity and the NFL as a corporation","In recent regulatory memory, we have seen several tools proposed to enhance boardroom diversity. Scholars situate these tools on a spectrum between “hard” and “soft,” with quotas at the former end and disclosure at the latter end. In 2003, the Rooney Rule, an NFL policy, entered the scene. The Rule mandates that when a head coach vacancy arises, teams must interview at least two racialized candidates. Can the Rule fill the space between quotas and disclosure on the regulatory spectrum? In proposing a response, I draw on and compare corporate legal, sociological, and critical race theory and commentary. I evaluate the Rule as a “third way” to diversify hiring practices by conducting a literature review and analysis. My research seeks to determine the most useful approaches to examining how the Rule has redefined hiring within the NFL and whether the Rule can be applied to Silicon Valley."

Conversion of unresponsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibition by fecal microbiota transplantation in patients with metastatic melanoma: study protocol for a randomized phase Ib/IIa trial,"The gut microbiome plays an important role in immune modulation. Specifically, presence or absence of certain gut bacterial taxa has been associated with better antitumor immune responses. Furthermore, in trials using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to treat melanoma patients unresponsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), complete responses (CR), partial responses (PR), and durable stable disease (SD) have been observed. However, the underlying mechanism determining which patients will or will not respond and what the optimal FMT composition is, has not been fully elucidated, and a discrepancy in microbial taxa associated with clinical response has been observed between studies. Furthermore, it is unknown whether a change in the microbiome itself, irrespective of its origin, or FMT from ICI responding donors, is required for reversion of ICI-unresponsiveness. To address this, we will transfer microbiota of either ICI responder or nonresponder metastatic melanoma patients via FMT."

Accurate trajectory tracking control with adaptive neural networks for omnidirectional mobile robots subject to unmodeled dynamics,"Omnidirectional mobile robots have gained a lot of attention in recent years due to their maneuverability capabilities. However, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking with this class of robots is still challenging control system designers. In this work, a novel intelligent controller is introduced for accurate trajectory tracking of omnidirectional robots subject to unstructured uncertainties. An adaptive neural network is adopted within a Lyapunov-based nonlinear control scheme to deal with frictional forces and other unmodeled dynamics or external disturbances that may occur. Online learning, rather than supervised offline training, is employed to allow the robot to learn on its own how to compensate for uncertainties and disturbances by interacting with the environment. The adoption of a combined error signal as the single input in the neural network significantly reduces the computational complexity of the disturbance compensation scheme and enables the resulting intelligent controller to be implemented in the embedded hardware of mobile robots. The boundedness and convergence properties of the proposed control scheme are proved by means of a Lyapunov-like stability analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed intelligent controller is numerically evaluated and experimentally validated using an omnidirectional mobile robot. The comparative analyses of the obtained results show that the adoption of an intelligent compensation scheme based on adaptive neural networks allows reductions of more than \(95\%\) in the tracking error, thus guaranteeing an accurate tracking and confirming the great superiority of the proposed control strategy."

Triple-stage Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer to Determine Ubiquitously Present Per- and Polyfluorinated Alkyl Substances in Drinking Water at Part Per Trillion Levels Using Solid Phase Extraction Approach,"An accurate analytical method was developed to determine selected per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) at the level of parts per trillion (ppt or ng/L) in drinking water. The method included a concentration step using solid phase extraction (SPE) approach in combination with a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system (LC-MS/MS). This method was optimized and validated for the common PFAS contaminants in drinking water. An initial demonstration of capability was established with an acceptable initial calibration, minimum reporting limit (MRL), limit of detection (LOD), initial demonstration of low system background, and initial demonstration of precision (IDP). Isotopically labeled internal standards were used for quantification. Surrogate standards were used to monitor method performance. The current method will help in better understanding of PFAS crisis by providing an efficient measurement of PFAS in water. In this study, the recoveries of four surrogates were between 84 and 113%, and calculated limit of detection (DL) and minimum reporting limits (MRL) were generally 1.0–3.0 and 5–10 ng/L, respectively."
Network-based assessment of HDAC6 activity predicts preclinical and clinical responses to the HDAC6 inhibitor ricolinostat in breast cancer,"Inhibiting individual histone deacetylase (HDAC) is emerging as well-tolerated anticancer strategy compared with pan-HDAC inhibitors. Through preclinical studies, we demonstrated that the sensitivity to the leading HDAC6 inhibitor (HDAC6i) ricolinstat can be predicted by a computational network-based algorithm (HDAC6 score). Analysis of ~3,000 human breast cancers (BCs) showed that ~30% of them could benefice from HDAC6i therapy. Thus, we designed a phase 1b dose-escalation clinical trial to evaluate the activity of ricolinostat plus nab-paclitaxel in patients with metastatic BC (MBC) (NCT02632071). Study results showed that the two agents can be safely combined, that clinical activity is identified in patients with HR+/HER2− disease and that the HDAC6 score has potential as predictive biomarker. Analysis of other tumor types also identified multiple cohorts with predicted sensitivity to HDAC6i’s. Mechanistically, we have linked the anticancer activity of HDAC6i’s to their ability to induce c-Myc hyperacetylation (ac-K148) promoting its proteasome-mediated degradation in sensitive cancer cells."

Dynamic visualization of high-dimensional data,"Dimensionality reduction (DR) is commonly used to project high-dimensional data into lower dimensions for visualization, which could then generate new insights and hypotheses. However, DR algorithms introduce distortions in the visualization and cannot faithfully represent all relations in the data. Thus, there is a need for methods to assess the reliability of DR visualizations. Here we present DynamicViz, a framework for generating dynamic visualizations that capture the sensitivity of DR visualizations to perturbations in the data resulting from bootstrap sampling. DynamicViz can be applied to all commonly used DR methods. We show the utility of dynamic visualizations in diagnosing common interpretative pitfalls of static visualizations and extending existing single-cell analyses. We introduce the variance score to quantify the dynamic variability of observations in these visualizations. The variance score characterizes natural variability in the data and can be used to optimize DR algorithm implementations."

Association of MARCH7 with tumor progression and T-cell infiltration in esophageal cancer,"MARCH7 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase known to regulate neuronal development,T-cell proliferation, and cell and tissue differentiation. But, the altered expression of MARCH7 has been observed in various malignancies. Herein, the cellular localization and role of MARCH7 have been elucidated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the information regarding which is currently limited. To check the expression of MARCH7 and its correlation with immune cells infiltration in ESCC, immunohistochemical analysis was performed. RNAi approach was used to investigate the role of MARCH7 in esophageal cancer cells. Interestingly, we found a significantly higher expression of MARCH7 protein in 84% of ESCC tissues than in distant matched non-malignant tissues (p ≤ 0.001). In addition to this, immunohistochemistry results have shown a negative correlation between MARCH7 protein expression and tumor-infiltrating immune cells such as CD8 + T cells (r = − 0.633, p = 0.001) and PD1 + T cells (r = − 0.560, p = 0.005). Furthermore, MARCH7 silencing inhibited the ESCC cell growth and reduced the clonogenic and invasion/migration potential of ESCC cells. MARCH7 silencing also significantly increased E-cadherin protein levels in ESCC cells relative to those in negative control cells (p < 0.05). Thus, MARCH7 is oncogenic and might have a possible role in esophageal carcinogenesis. Moreover, E-cadherin may be a downstream target of MARCH7 in ESCC."
A new strategy for capturing a noncooperative spacecraft by a robotic arm,"In robotic arm-based noncooperative spacecraft-capture missions, the gripper of the robotic arm collides with the target’s surface and graspable structure. The former can cause the graspable structure to collide with the gripper multiple times or escape from the gripper. The adverse of the latter is that the momentum transfer can result in a sudden change in motion of the service spacecraft. If the service spacecraft is required to be in the desired configuration, the control system needs to generate a considerable control output. This paper designs a new capturing strategy to avoid these adverse phenomena, which divides the capture process into two phases: colliding and locking. In the colliding phase, the gripper will actively contact the target’s surface and should maintain the contact, i.e., form a stable contact. This study proposes an improved damping-control scheme for forming a stable contact to realize this objective. Unlike the existing control scheme, this one allows the base of the service spacecraft to move, which helps to reduce the control force acting on the base, saving fuel. After establishing the stable contact, the gripper begins to close. The locking phase starts after forming a force-closure grasp. In this phase, the gripper will continue to close in a controlled manner. However, the states of the service spacecraft’s base and robotic arm should transform from the controlled state to the uncontrolled state. A significant benefit is that the control system does not need to produce large control outputs to resist the colliding impact. Meanwhile, since the service spacecraft has a large inertia, the momentum transfer caused by the collision does not cause significant changes in its configuration. Numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the validity of the proposed control scheme and capturing strategy at the end of this paper. The results indicate that the proposals allow the space robot to grasp the target spacecraft with less control cost."

One Website to Gather them All: Usability Testing of the New German SKin Cancer INFOrmation (SKINFO) Website—A Mixed-methods Approach,"Skin cancer patients increasingly search the internet to acquire disease-related information. However, information on the internet may be misleading. Recently, SKINFO has been launched, a website exclusively created for German-speaking skin cancer patients providing information as well as additional resources of verified quality. Here, we describe the results of the first usability test of SKINFO using a mixed-methods approach. Ten adult patients with skin cancer were recruited for usability testing in the skin cancer units of the University Hospitals of Erlangen and Dresden, Germany. Testing consisted of three different scenarios where patients were asked to find specific information on the SKINFO website guided by the think-aloud method. Descriptive analysis and content analyses were performed. All patients would recommend SKINFO and appreciated its content, design, and structure. Think-aloud analysis identified the topics layout, navigation, and content and structure which would benefit from refinement. Major criticism included the navigation through the website, and the desire for more specific information addressing patients’ relatives and the latest, up-to-date information. Overall, usability testing showed that the unique web-based information platform has the potential to support patients coping with skin cancer and thus strengthen informed decision-making."
Genome-wide assessment of population genetic and demographic history in Magnolia odoratissima based on SLAF-seq,"Magnolia odoratissima is a highly threatened species, with small distribution and scattered populations due to habitat fragmentation and human activity. In this study, the genetic diversity and population structure of the five remaining natural populations and two cultivated populations of M. odoratissima were analyzed using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived from specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing. A total of 180,650 SNPs were identified in seventy M. odoratissima individuals. The Nei’s and Shannon-Wiener diversity index across all M. odoratissima population were 0.35 and 0.51, respectively, while the observed heterozygosity (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He) were 0.27 and 0.34, respectively. Our results suggest that M. odoratissima has relatively high genetic diversity at the genomic level. The FST and AMOVA indicated that high genetic differentiation exists among populations, and a phylogenetic neighbor-joining tree, Bayesian model–based clustering and discriminant function analysis of principal component all divided the M. odoratissima individuals into three distinct clusters. The Treemix analysis showed that there was low gene flow among the natural populations. Demographic history inferences indicated show that three clusters of M. odoratissima experienced at least three bottlenecks and resulted in a decrease of effective population size. Our results suggest that three distinct evolutionary significant units should be set up to conserve this critically endangered species."
Contextual and pure time coding for self and other in the hippocampus,"Navigation and episodic memory depend critically on representing temporal sequences. Hippocampal ‘time cells’ form temporal sequences, but it is unknown whether they represent context-dependent experience or time per se. Here we report on time cells in bat hippocampal area CA1, which, surprisingly, formed two distinct populations. One population of time cells generated different temporal sequences when the bat hung at different locations, thus conjunctively encoding spatial context and time—‘contextual time cells’. A second population exhibited similar preferred times across different spatial contexts, thus purely encoding elapsed time. When examining neural responses after the landing moment of another bat, in a social imitation task, we found time cells that encoded temporal sequences aligned to the other’s landing. We propose that these diverse time codes may support the perception of interval timing, episodic memory and temporal coordination between self and others."
"Lead, cadmium, and other trace elements in the liver of golden eagles and white-tailed eagles: recent data from Poland and a systematic review of previous studies","The golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) and the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), being apex predators and facultative scavengers, can bioaccumulate different environmental contaminants, including toxic elements that may adversely affect their health. We analyzed the levels of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and other metals and metalloids, including arsenic (As), barium (Ba), beryllium (Be), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), selenium (Se), thorium (Th), thallium (Tl), uranium (U), vanadium (V), and zinc (Zn) in liver samples taken from three golden eagles and 36 white-tailed eagles that were found dead across Poland to verify their exposure. We also used a systematic review to summarize the available literature data on Cd, Pb, and other studied elements in the liver of both eagle species. Analyses of trace elements in the liver samples of the Polish eagles revealed interspecific differences in Cd, Cu, and Mn and differences in Co, Mn, Tl, and Zn among study regions. All elements tested except Pb were below the suggested thresholds linked with adverse health effects in birds. The hepatic Pb found in almost half of all the tested individuals suggests environmental exposure to this toxic element. One of the tested white-tailed eagles had hepatic Pb above the threshold of sublethal poisoning. Although our results seem optimistic, as previous Polish studies showed a higher prevalence of birds with hepatic Pb exceeding the toxicity threshold, they indicate that exposure to this toxic metal could still pose an additional threat to the health of Polish eagles."
Novel gC3N4/MgZnAl-MMO derived from LDH for solar-based photocatalytic ammonia production using atmospheric nitrogen,"The development of catalysis technologies for sustainable environmental applications, especially an alternative to ammonia (NH3) production under the Haber–Bosch process, has gained a lot of scope in recent days. The current work demonstrated a green synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride (gC3N4) containing magnesium-zinc-aluminium mixed metal oxides (MgZnAl-MMO) derived from layered double hydroxide (LDH) for visible light aided catalytic production of ammonia. Pyrolysis-hydrothermal techniques were adopted for the synthesis and fabrication of the gC3N4/MgZnAl-MMO catalytic composite. Characterization results of field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV–visible spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), etc. showed the desired properties and functionalities like semi-crystalline structure with rough surface morphology that enhance the sorption reactions. Catalytic composite gC3N4/MgZnAl-MMO showed a bandgap energy of 2.16 eV that is considerably shifted toward the visible range when compared to gC3N4 (2.39 eV) and MgZnAl-MMO (2.93 eV). The results were also well complied with XPS results obtained that promote solar-based photocatalysis. The gC3N4/MgZnAl-MMO assisted photocatalytic production of NH3 in an aqueous media proved to be acceptable by the production of a maximum 47.56 μmol/L NH3 under visible spectrum employing a light emitting diode (LED) source. The results showed that the advancement of catalyst for desired functionalities and NH3 production using LED simulating solar light-aided catalysis would be an alternative to the Haber–Bosch process and solar-based sustainable processes for NH3 production."
Maliciously circuit-private multi-key FHE and MPC based on LWE,"In this paper, we construct multi-key homomorphic and fully homomorphic encryption (resp. MKHE and MKFHE) schemes with malicious circuit privacy. Our schemes are based on learning with errors (LWE) besides appropriate circular security assumptions. In contrast, the previous maliciously circuit-private MKFHE scheme by Chongchitmate and Ostrovsky (PKC, 2017) is based on the non-standard decisional small polynomial ratio (DSPR) assumption with a super-polynomial modulus, besides ring learning with errors and circular security assumptions. We note that it was shown by Albrecht et al. (CRYPTO, 2016) that there exists a sub-exponential time attack against this type of DSPR assumption. The main building block of our maliciously circuit-private MKFHE scheme is a (plain) MKFHE scheme by Brakerski et al. (TCC, 2017), and the security of our schemes is proven under the hardness of LWE with sub-exponential modulus-to-noise ratio and circular security assumptions related to the Brakerski et al. scheme. Furthermore, based on our MKFHE schemes, we construct four-round multi-party computation (MPC) protocols with circuit privacy against a semi-honest server and malicious clients in the plain model. The protocols are obtained by combining our schemes with a maliciously sender-private oblivious transfer protocol and a circuit garbling scheme, all of which can be instantiated only assuming LWE."
Biochar-blended manure modified by polyacrylamide to reduce soil colloidal phosphorus leaching loss,"Combined application of biochar and organic fertilizer improves soil structure and crop yield but may lead to increased loss of phosphorus (P). To reduce the P loss risk in this case, rice straw biochar (BC) and sheep manure (SM) were modified using polyacrylamide (PAM). The effects of using organic amendments (BC, SM, and PAM-modified organic mixtures) and no amendments (CK) on soil total and colloidal P leaching loss from paddy soils were evaluated through soil column leaching experiments. The soil leachate volume was increased by 8.91% with BC treatment and reduced by 15.3% with SM treatment. The total P leaching loss (973.9 μg kg−1) from the BC-treated soil was higher than that from other treatments (541.4–963.5 μg kg−1). However, there was much more colloidal P loss (480.0 μg kg−1) from SM treatment. The optimal conditions for the preparation of BC and SM modified using polyacrylamide (PSB) for reducing P leaching loss were SM/BC = 4:1, 1% PAM, and 100 °C. Molybdate-unreactive P accounts for 58.61–86.89% of the colloidal P in the soil leachate with organic amendments. PSB reduced colloidal P loss (particularly in 10–220 nm range) by ~ 50% compared with BC and SM treatments. The colloidal P concentration in the leaching solutions was significantly correlated with TOC and susceptible to Fe and Al concentrations. Using PAM-modified mixture instead of manure and biochar as a soil amendment can effectively control P leaching from fields."
Remediation effects and mechanisms of typical minerals combined with inorganic amendment on cadmium-contaminated soil: a field study in wheat,"The remediation of cadmium (Cd)–contaminated soil has gained much attention recently because Cd in soil threatens human health through the food chain. Although tremendous progress has been made in the remediation of Cd-contaminated soil in rice acid soil system, the mechanism and effects of Cd-contaminated soil remediation under these amendments in wheat weak alkaline soil are still limited. In this study, the remediation effect and related mechanism of Cd in weakly alkaline soil were carried out using zeolite, diatomite, and sodium bentonite as the main remediation components, supplemented by calcium dihydrogen phosphate and fulvic acid. The results of field experiments showed that the concentration of Cd reduced by 27.3 ~ 31.2% in rhizosphere soil and 34.3 ~ 54.2% in non-rhizosphere soil, and the maximum reduction rate of Cd concentration in wheat grain was 25.5%. The main factors affecting the concentration of Cd in wheat grains include the change in exchangeable Cd, the absorption capacity of wheat root, and the inhibitory effect on Cd transport from stem to grain in this paper. In general, this work provides a new potential management feasible pathway to alleviate the Cd toxicity of weakly alkaline soil and wheat grain."
Composite nanofiber formation using a mixture of cellulose acetate and activated carbon for oil spill treatment,"Oil and organic pollutants are significant disasters affecting the aquatic ecosystem and human health. A novel nanofiber composite from cellulose acetate/activated carbon (CA/AC) was successfully fabricated by the electrospinning technique. CA/AC nanofiber composites were prepared from 10% (w/v) polymer solutions dissolving in DMA/acetone ratio 1:3 (v/v) with adding three different percentages of AC (3.7, 5.5, and 6.7%) to the total weight of CA. The prepared CA/AC nanofiber composite morphology reveals randomly oriented bead-free fibers with submicron fiber diameter. CA/AC nanofiber composites were further characterized by TGA, DSC, and surface area analysis. Water uptake was investigated for fabricated fibers at different pH. Oil adsorption was conducted in both static (oil only) and dynamic (oil/water) systems to estimate the adsorption capacity of prepared composites to treat heavy and light machine oils. The results showed increased oil adsorption capacity incorporating activated carbon into CA nanofiber mats. The maximum sorption capacity reached 8.3 and 5.5 g/g for heavy and light machine oils obtained by CA/AC5.5 (AC, 5.5%). A higher oil uptake was reported for the CA/AC composite nanofibers and showed a constant sorption capacity after the second recycles in the reusability test. Of isotherm models, the most applicable model was the Freundlich isotherm model. The result of kinetic models proved the fit of the pseudo-second-order kinetic model to the adsorption system."
Optimizing multiplexed imaging experimental design through tissue spatial segregation estimation,"Recent advances in multiplexed imaging methods allow simultaneous detection of dozens of proteins and hundreds of RNAs, enabling deep spatial characterization of both healthy and diseased tissues. Parameters for the design of optimal multiplex imaging studies, especially those estimating how much area has to be imaged to capture all cell phenotype clusters, are lacking. Here, using a spatial transcriptomic atlas of healthy and tumor human tissues, we developed a statistical framework that determines the number and area of fields of view necessary to accurately identify all cell phenotypes that are part of a tissue. Using this strategy on imaging mass cytometry data, we identified a measurement of tissue spatial segregation that enables optimal experimental design. This strategy will enable an improved design of multiplexed imaging studies."
All for striving status: how and when do overqualified employees engage in OCB towards individual,"The issue of how overqualified employees engage in organizational citizenship behavior towards individual (OCBI) is gaining traction. Existing literatures have mostly explored the relationship between perceived overqualification and OCBI from cognitive and affective perspectives, ignoring the motivational perspective. However, motivation, as an importance mechanism, has a great impact on overqualified employees’ OCBI. Based on status-striving motivation, we focus on the positive aspect of perceived overqualification and investigates the mechanism of perceived overqualification on OCBI. Two studies, a scenario study (N = 110) and a time-lagged field study (N = 249), are used to test our hypotheses. Study 1 and 2 show that perceived overqualification positively affects OCBI through status-striving motivation. In addition, Study 2 finds that ambition not only moderates the direct relationship between perceived overqualification and status-striving motivation, but also the indirect effect of perceived overqualification on OCBI via status-striving motivation. However, the moderating role of task interdependence is not supported. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings."
Career counselling for adults with newly acquired mobility disability,"Mobility disabilities are common in Canada and impact over two million Canadians. As such, there is a need for career counsellors to better understand and address the challenges. This literature review article outlines various challenges that this population encounters, including adapting to mobility disabilities, requiring accommodations, facing financial needs, and experiencing loss. It also examines the interplay between the personal and career development needs of individuals with a mobility disability (i.e., people who are unable to engage in job-related activities due to mobility issues). Interventions from Super’s life-span theory and Cochran’s narrative career counselling theory will be discussed in relation to supporting individuals with mobility disabilities across their career challenges. The article concludes with pertinent considerations for career counsellors, raising awareness on unique issues like accommodation needs, misconceptions, and discrimination when working with this population."
Pt/PbSe optoelectronic receivers designed for 6G and terahertz communication technologies,"Herein PbSe thin films are coated onto glass and semitransparent platinum substrates. The films which are treated as optoelectronic signal receivers are deposited by the thermal evaporation technique under a vacuum pressure of 10−5 mbar. The structural investigations have shown that (glass, Pt)/PbSe films are of polycrystalline nature. Optically, Pt substrates increased the transparency and reflectivity of PbSe films. The energy band gap of PbSe is also increased by 0.12 eV when films are coated onto Pt substrates. In addition the dielectric constant also increased as a result of strong interaction between Pt plasmonic particles and lead selenide. On the other hand, fitting of the imaginary part of the dielectric constant using Drude–Lorentz model has shown that coating of PbSe onto semitransparent Pt substrates increased the drift mobility of lead selenide by four times. Pt substrates resulted in a decrease in the density of free charge carriers and increases the scattering time constant at femtosecond levels. (Glass, Pt)/PbSe optoelectronic receivers displayed plasmon frequencies up to ~ 13 GHz and showed terahertz cutoff frequency of ~ 1.0 THz. In addition, allowing the propagation of an ac signal of low amplitude in the Pt/PbSe/Pt receivers has shown that the devices exhibit wide range of resistance tunability. The microwave cutoff frequency also reached 14 GHz. Both of the optical and electrical measurements proved the suitability of the Pt/PbSe devices for 6G and terahertz communication technologies."
The application of blockchain algorithms to the management of education certificates,"Blockchain is a new application technology in many sectors and the same is true in the world of education. Therefore, there is an increasingly emerging need to research blockchain technology, as it is still taking its first steps in different sectors, such as education. This article presents a review of the state of the art of blockchain technology in the education sector, focusing on identifying the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges associated with the introduction of blockchain technology in the education sector. In addition, the implementation of a title certificate solution through blockchain technology through the BeCertify project is presented. In this solution, the development stages of the platform, the system architecture, and the operation of the API have been carried out, resulting in a platform that constitutes the first step towards a more transparent and technologically advanced way of managing the certifications of the students’ qualifications."
Photosensitivity sources of dissolved organic matter from wastewater treatment plants and their mediation effect on 17α-ethinylestradiol photodegradation,"Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from each treatment process of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) contains abundant photosensitive substances, which could significantly affect the photodegradation of 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2). Nevertheless, information about EE2 photodegradation behavior mediated by DOM from diverse WWTPs and the photosensitivity sources of such DOM are inadequate. This study explored the photodegradation behavior of EE2 mediated by four typical WWTPs’ DOM solutions and investigated the photosensitivity sources of DOM in the anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A2/O) process. The parallel factor analysis identified three varying fluorescing components of these DOM, tryptophan-like substances or protein-like substances, microbial humuslike substances, and humic-like components. The photodegradation rate constants of EE2 were positively associated with the humification degree of DOM (P < 0.05). The triplet state substances were responsible for the degradation of EE2. DOM extracted from the A2/O process, especially in the secondary treatment process had the fastest EE2 photodegradation rate compared to that of the other three processes. Four types of components (water-soluble organic matter (WSOM), extracellular polymeric substance, humic acid, and fulvic acid) were separated from the A2/O process DOM. WSOM had the highest promotion effect on EE2 photodegradation. Fulvic acid-like components and humic acid-like organic compounds in WSOM were speculated to be important photosensitivity substances that can generate triplet state substances. This research explored the physicochemical properties and photosensitive sources of DOM in WWTPs, and explained the fate of estrogens photodegradation in natural waters."
Abductive Inference and C. S. Peirce: 150 Years Later,"This paper is about two things: (i) Charles Sanders Peirce (1837–1914)—an iconoclastic philosopher and polymath who is among the greatest of American minds. (ii) Abductive inference—a term coined by C. S. Peirce, which he defined as “the process of forming explanatory hypotheses. It is the only logical operation which introduces any new idea.”"
The Benefits and Challenges of Shifting to Telehealth During COVID-19: Qualitative Feedback from Kentucky’s Sexual Violence Resource Centers and Children’s Advocacy Centers,"The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic presented novel challenges for service providers addressing mental health issues with a large shift to the utilization of telehealth. While previous research has examined the benefits and challenges of providing mental health and crisis services remotely through telehealth, little research exists examining the use of telehealth in children’s advocacy centers (CACs) and sexual violence resource centers (SVRCs). CACs and SVRCs are multi-disciplinary agencies taking a holistic approach to addressing interpersonal violence, making them unique in that they provide a range of direct services beyond mental health counseling (e.g., legal advocacy, medical exams, and prevention education) but all geared toward public health and safety. The current study explored the experiences of direct service providers in Kentucky CACs and SVRCs and their opinions about the most significant challenges and benefits of adapting their practices at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 118 providers participated in the study, and 88 reported using telehealth (defined as communicating with clients via technology such as videoconferencing, phone calls, or email) since the onset of COVID-19. Qualitative data from those 88 respondents regarding the challenges and benefits of using telehealth were collected and coded using a thematic content analysis. 78.6% of the sample indicated that they served primarily rural areas. Benefits noted included increasing treatment access, increasing treatment flexibility, and advancing continuity of care, while challenges included difficulties with technology, client engagement, privacy, and logistical challenges. Responses highlighted that telehealth presented both a number of advantages and difficulties and that more formal guidance for providers at CACs and SVRCs was desired."
Green Synthesis of Nano-Zero-Valent Copper for the D-Blue 60 Textile Dye Removal from Aqueous Medium,"Green synthesis of zero-valent copper nanoparticles successfully performed using Ficus benjamina leaves. The novel adsorbent Ficus nano-zero-valent copper (FB-nZVCu) characterized by utilizing scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The size of these nanoparticles typically ranges from 16 to 18 nm. This adsorbent investigated for removal of D-blue 60 from textile wastewater. The impact of different operating parameters, including pH, adsorbent dose, stirring rate, time, and initial dye concentration, had been tested, and optimum conditions were selected to gauge the optimum dye removal performance of the adsorbent. The maximum removal efficiency of D-blue 60 reached 87% under the following proper conditions: adsorbent dose 0.3 g L−1, time 30 min, and pH 8. The Langmuir isotherm was found to be the most appropriate system for the adsorption process (R2 = 0.9994) and (qmax = 30.03 mg g−1). The pseudo-second-order model defined the adsorption. From the data obtained and the fruitful discussion, it detected that the FB-nZVCu green adsorbent strongly recommended as a hopeful substance for removing D-blue 60 from both synthetic and actual waste samples."
Copy number variation analysis in 189 Romanian patients with global developmental delay/intellectual disability,"Developmental delay and intellectual disability represent a common pathology in general population, involving about 3% of the pediatric age population, the genetic etiology being often involved. The aim of this study was to determine the clinically relevant copy number variants in patients diagnosed with global developmental delay/intellectual disability in our population, using the chromosomal microarray analysis."
The whole-of-society approach of mass COVID-19 vaccination in China: a qualitative study,"Many countries have an inefficient vaccination system, which hinders global exit from the COVID-19 pandemic. It is vital to summarize COVID-19 vaccination practices in countries with high vaccination coverage and provide implications for other countries. This study aimed to investigate China’s COVID-19 vaccination system and to summarize its implementation experience from a health system perspective."
"lncRNA ZNRD1-AS1 promotes malignant lung cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis via the miR-942/TNS1 axis and is positively regulated by the m6A reader YTHDC2","Lung cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer and has a high mortality rate, making it a global public health concern. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is a highly dynamic and reversible process that is involved in a variety of essential biological processes. Using in vitro, in vivo, and multi-omics bioinformatics, the present study aims to determine the function and regulatory mechanisms of the long non-coding (lnc)RNA zinc ribbon domain-containing 1-antisense 1 (ZNRD1-AS1)."
"Autologous Blood Patch Pleurodesis for Secondary Spontaneous Pneumothorax: A Narrative Review, a Retrospective Case Series and State of Play in the UK",Treatment of prolonged air leak due to secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is challenging. Autologous blood patch pleurodesis (ABPP) is a treatment option. Previous evidence is reliant on single-centre series and underpowered trials and is mostly described in air leaks post cardiothoracic intervention. There are no United Kingdom (UK) wide data.
Highly efficacious and safe neutralizing DNA aptamer of SARS-CoV-2 as an emerging therapy for COVID-19 disease,"The paucity of SARS-CoV-2-specific virulence factors has greatly hampered the therapeutic management of patients with COVID-19 disease. Although available vaccines and approved therapies have shown tremendous benefits, the continuous emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and side effects of existing treatments continue to challenge therapy, necessitating the development of a novel effective therapy. We have previously shown that our developed novel single-stranded DNA aptamers not only target the trimer S protein of SARS-CoV-2, but also block the interaction between ACE2 receptors and trimer S protein of Wuhan origin, Delta, Delta plus, Alpha, Lambda, Mu, and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2. We herein performed in vivo experiments that administer the aptamer to the lungs by intubation as well as in vitro studies utilizing PBMCs to prove the efficacy and safety of our most effective aptamer, AYA2012004_L."
Modular hip exoskeleton improves walking function and reduces sedentary time in community-dwelling older adults,"Despite the benefits of physical activity for healthy physical and cognitive aging, 35% of adults over the age of 75 in the United States are inactive. Robotic exoskeleton-based exercise studies have shown benefits in improving walking function, but most are conducted in clinical settings with a neurologically impaired population. Emerging technology is starting to enable easy-to-use, lightweight, wearable robots, but their impact in the otherwise healthy older adult population remains mostly unknown. For the first time, this study investigates the feasibility and efficacy of using a lightweight, modular hip exoskeleton for in-community gait training in the older adult population to improve walking function."
Subannular repair for functional mitral regurgitation with reduced systolic ventricle function: rationale and design of REFORM-MR registry,"Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) is one of the most common heart valve diseases that is a sequel of left ventricular remodelling. Although mitral valve annuloplasty is a standard treatment of FMR, the recurrence of FMR is a major drawback and occurs in 10–50% of patients. The REFORM-MR registry aims to investigate the effectiveness of standardized papillary muscle relocation and ring annuloplasty and to identify the risk factors associated with recurrent FMR."
Aonchotheca (Nematoda: Capillariidae) is validated as a separated genus from Capillaria by both mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal DNA,"The family Capillariidae is a group of thread-like nematodes of 27 genera and over 300 species that infect a great variety of hosts including humans. Among these, some taxa such as the genus Aonchotheca have remained controversial regarding their systematic status for decades. The aim of the current study was to verify Aonchotheca’s systemic status and to further determine whether it is a distinct genus from Capillaria using molecular and phylogenetic analyses."
Relation of dietary insulin index and dietary insulin load to metabolic syndrome depending on the lifestyle factors: Tehran lipid and glucose study,"The hypothesis of the effect of the insulinogenic effects of diet on the development of cardiovascular diseases has been proposed, but the findings of previous studies are very contradictory. We investigated the association between dietary insulin index (DII) and dietary insulin load (DIL), and metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk. Another objective was to examine the extent to which lifestyle (physical activity, smoking status, and weight change) and sex influence the relationship between DII, DIL, and MetS risk."
"Effects of pre-operative oral carbohydrates on insulin resistance and postoperative recovery in diabetic patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting: study protocol for a prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial","Preoperative carbohydrates (CHO) supplement has been widely investigated in nondiabetic patients undergoing a variety of surgeries. It has been proved that preoperative CHO could alleviate postoperative insulin resistance (IR) and improve patients’ well-being in nondiabetic patients. However, it remains controversial whether preoperative CHO could yield similar effects in diabetic patients. Till now, seldom has the administration of preoperative CHO been investigated in diabetic patients and there are limited studies reporting IR and postoperative recovery of diabetic patients undergoing cardiac surgery."
Stockwell Transform of Quadrature Stator Current-Based Fault Assessment in Induction Machine at Different Load Condition,"Conventional sensor-based fault detection techniques lead to huge manpower, high cost and requires a greater number of sensors. To overcome these flaws, current signature-based fault estimation is proposed. This method does not require any additional current sensors and is done with existed sensors employed for motor speed control. Further, the stator current is divided into two phase currents using Parks vector approach to get better resolution. The higher order noise due to data acquisition, EMI and other sources is removed using wavelet de-noising and the resolution on current spectrum is improved using advanced spectral analysis namely Stockwell Transform (ST). All the faults faced by induction motor like bearing damage, broken rotor, and stator inter turn faults are tested at different load conditions. The severity of the fault is identified using feature parameters like RMS and Standard Deviation of stator current after proposed signal processing. A 1.5 KW, 440 V and 50 Hz induction motor is used for expermental verification of proposed fault assessment criteria."
"Removal of Crystal Violet Cationic Dye from Aqueous Solution by Adsorption onto Bentonite Clay: Experimental, DFT, NBO, and Molecular Dynamics Studies","Raw (RB) and activated (AB) bentonite clay have been used to investigate adsorption of crystal violet (CV) dye from aqueous solution. Adsorbents physicochemical properties were characterized using X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, specific surface area, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared analysis. In addition, the adsorption experiments were carried out in a series of batch equilibration studies and conducted under various conditions: initial dye concentration, contact time, solid–liquid ratio, initial pH, temperature, and agitation speed. As a result, RB and AB clays have proven a high potential removal rate of CV dye with a maximum retention, reduced contact time and solid–liquid ratio. Moreover, favorable sorption has been observed in an alkaline medium for raw clay, whereas pH has revealed non-significant impact on activated clay sorption. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model fits the adsorption process. Different mathematical isothermal models were used to examine the adsorption data, the results have shown that the process is well represented by the Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm for the raw clay and the Freundlich isotherm for the activated clay. Furthermore, thermodynamic parameters revealed that adsorption process for both sorbents was spontaneous and endothermic. The theoretical calculations according to the density functional theory (DFT), natural bond orbitals (NBO) theory and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) were used to investigate the adsorption mechanism of crystal violet dye on the bentonite clay surface."
Designing and Implementing a Family Literacy Program Through Smartphones: How Does Recruitment Method Influence Uptake and Attrition?,"Texting-based programs are increasingly used to support parents as their child’s first teacher and create links between home and school. However, there is scant evidence about the influence of program implementation on parent uptake and attrition—a key component of such programs. This article describes the design and delivery of Kindytxt, a literacy-based text-messaging program for parents with a child at Kindergarten in Western Australia, and examines the influence of recruitment method, area socioeconomic status, and teacher participation on parent uptake and attrition. Results indicate that embedding Kindytxt into a well-established family literacy program provided the infrastructure and mechanism for extensive program reach, and the recruitment method, specifically the involvement of the kindergarten teacher, significantly influenced parent registration. However, attrition rates were not significantly affected by the area socioeconomic status of participating schools, recruitment method, nor teacher participation in Kindytxt. The results suggest that teacher involvement may be the crucial factor in enabling parents to access texting programs, regardless of the socioeconomic status of the school community. The design elements may be used to inform future program development, and the research results highlight the importance of documenting and including the method of delivery as variables in the evaluation of program implementation."
Epidemiology of suicide in the Tri-City metropolitan area in Poland in 2010–2019,"The paper, which is a continuation of our previous epidemiological studies on the phenomenon of suicide in the Tri-City metropolitan area, presents the results of statistical analyses of suicides in the autopsy material of the Department of Forensic Medicine of the Medical University of Gdańsk in the years 2010–2019. The purpose of the study was to analyse in detail demographic data of suicides (age, sex, place of death), as well as to assess suicide methods and the impact of alcohol on suicides in the study area. During the 10-year study period, 8495 autopsies were performed, of which 1261 were suicides (14.8%). Statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical data analysis software system STATISTICA, version 13 (StatSoft, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA). The results of the study indicate a continuing downward trend in the number of suicides since the beginning of the 21th century, with the number of suicides in rural areas increasing over the same period. In the analysed cohort, suicides were committed in particular by middle-aged men and the number of suicides among older people (65 +) increased at the same time. The increase in suicide occurred in late autumn and early spring. The most common method of suicide was hanging. There was a high percentage of inebriated victims (45%), and a comparison of the present studies with previous ones indicates the increasing impact of alcohol on suicide."
Downregulation of SLC9A8 Promotes Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition and Metastasis in Colorectal Cancer Cells via the IL6-JAK1/STAT3 Signaling Pathway,"SLC9A8 has been shown to be involved in mucus layer formation, intestinal mucosal integrity, and hyperproliferation of colitis-associated tumor development. However, its effects on the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unknown."
Identification of light nonaqueous phase liquid groundwater contamination source based on empirical mode decomposition and deep learning,"The simulation optimization method was used to the identification of light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) groundwater contamination source (GCS) with the help of a hypothetical case in this study. When applying the simulation optimization method to identify GCS, it was a common technical means to establish surrogate model for the simulation model to participate in the iterative calculation to reduce the calculation load and calculation time. However, it was difficult for a single modeling method to establish surrogate model with high accuracy for the LNAPL contamination multiphase flow simulation model (MFSM). To give full play to advantages of single surrogate model and improve the accuracy of the surrogate model to the MFSM, a combination of deep belief neural network (DBNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network was used to establish artificial intelligence ensemble surrogate model (AIESM) for the MFSM. At the same time, to reduce the influence of noise in observed concentrations on the accuracy of the identification results, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet analysis methods were used to denoise the observed concentrations, and their noise reduction effects were compared. The observed concentrations with better noise reduction effect and the observed concentrations without denoising were used to construct the objective function, and constraints of the optimization model were determined meanwhile. Then, the objective function and the constraints were integrated to build the optimization model to identify GCS and simulation model parameters. Applying the AIESM instead of the MFSM to embed in the optimization model and participate in the iterative calculation. Finally, the genetic algorithm (GA) was used to solve the optimization model to obtain the identification results of GCS and simulation model parameters. The results showed that compared with the single DBNN and LSTM surrogate models, AIESM obtained the highest accuracy and could replace the MFSM to participate in the iterative calculation, thereby reducing the calculation load and calculation time by more than 99%. Comparing with the wavelet analysis, EMD could reduce the noise in the concentrations more effectively, improved the accuracy of the approximated concentrations to the actual values, and increased the accuracy of the GCSs identification results by 1.45%."
Topology optimization under microscale uncertainty using stochastic gradients,"This paper considers the design of structures made of engineered materials, accounting for uncertainty in material properties. We present a topology optimization approach that optimizes the structural shape and topology at the macroscale assuming design-independent uncertain microstructures. The structural geometry at the macroscale is described by an explicit level set approach, and the macroscopic structural response is predicted by the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM). We describe the microscopic layout by either an analytic geometric model with uncertain parameters or a level-cut from a Gaussian random field. The macroscale properties of the microstructured material are predicted by homogenization. Considering the large number of possible microscale configurations, one of the main challenges of solving such topology optimization problems is the computational cost of estimating the statistical moments of the cost and constraint functions and their gradients with respect to the design variables. Methods for predicting these moments, such as Monte Carlo sampling, and Taylor series and polynomial chaos expansions often require a large number of random samples resulting in an impractical computation. To reduce this cost, we propose an approach wherein, at every design iteration, we only use a small number of microstructure configurations to generate an independent, stochastic approximation of the gradients. These gradients are then used either with a gradient descent algorithm, namely Adaptive Moment (Adam), or the globally convergent method of moving asymptotes (GCMMA). Three numerical examples from structural mechanics are used to show that the proposed approach provides a computationally efficient way for macroscale topology optimization in the presence of microstructural uncertainty and enables the designers to consider a new class of problems that are out of reach today with conventional tools."
Treatment of Kitchen Wastewater in a Batch Electrochemical Reactor,"The wastewater from commercial kitchens contains fertilizers, colouring agents, pesticides, oils, cleaning liquids, and taste-enhancing additives. These constituents are generally biorefractory in nature. Kitchen wastewater (KW) is disposed of without any proper treatment into the environment in most of the developing countries. Hence, the development of suitable treatment techniques is essential. This study investigates the electrochemical degradation of KW in a batch reactor consisting of titanium coated with mixed metal oxide (RuO2/IrO2) anode and stainless steel cathode. The influence of operating parameters such as current density, electrolyte concentration, electrode distance, pH, and secondary oxidizing agent (H2O2) addition on the COD reduction was investigated and such parameters were optimized by one factor at a time method. The highest COD removal of ~ 99% was obtained at a current density of 0.75 A/dm2, NaCl concentration of 1.5 mg/L, and electrode gap of 1 cm. The ex-situ oxidizing agent, H2O2, addition improved the COD removal. The results indicated that the electrochemical oxidation method is an expedient technique for treating KW."
Optimum Site Suitability Analysis for Urban Open Space Facilities using Geospatial Techniques,"Fast economic development and expansive urban growth necessitates an urban development agenda that emphasis on adequate urban open space facility spatial planning and developmental initiatives aimed at ensuring proximity and accessibility to essential urban facilities for all urban residents. Locating suitable site in the disparity region for open space facilities such as parks and playgrounds enhances the quality of citizen’s life. To address the necessitating concern of the existing trend of uneven distribution, the Gravity-based spatial accessibility model i.e. Three-step floating catchment area method is opted to identify the derprived region and Multi-criteria decision analysis model is used to locate optimum site in the deprived region. Tiruchirappalli city has 37 parks and 14 playgrounds, out of which 14 parks closed due to improper maintenance. Among the 65 wards, it was observed that 33 wards had no accessibility to parks within the threshold distance of 3 km with the 73.5% of the city population. The questionnaire of 821 samples was collected in both well-served region and unserved region of parks and playgrounds facilities, it states that the 82% of residences in well-served region residents access frequently whereas only 23% of residences access in the unserved region. Hence, to maximize the accessibility, the new open space can be provided in the optimum sites obtained by Analytical Hierarchy Process that shows the area of 7.68 km2 as very highly suitable category and 48.48 km2 as highly suitable category. Thereby it becomes important to focus on proper spatial planning of urban facilities and transportation services needed for the establishment of an efficiently functioning city."
AI and the expert; a blueprint for the ethical use of opaque AI,"The increasing demand for transparency in AI has recently come under scrutiny. The question is often posted in terms of “epistemic double standards”, and whether the standards for transparency in AI ought to be higher than, or equivalent to, our standards for ordinary human reasoners. I agree that the push for increased transparency in AI deserves closer examination, and that comparing these standards to our standards of transparency for other opaque systems is an appropriate starting point. I suggest that a more fruitful exploration of this question will involve a different comparison class. We routinely treat judgments made by highly trained experts in specialized fields as fair or well grounded even though—by the nature of expert/layperson division of epistemic labor—an expert will not be able to provide an explanation of the reasoning behind these judgments that makes sense to most other people. Regardless, laypeople are thought to be acting reasonably—and ethically—in deferring to the judgments of experts that concern their areas of specialization. I suggest that we reframe our question regarding the appropriate standards of transparency in AI as one that asks when, why, and to what degree it would be ethical to accept opacity in AI. I argue that our epistemic relation to certain opaque AI technology  may be relevantly similar to the layperson’s epistemic relation to the expert in certain respects, such that the successful expert/layperson division of epistemic labor can serve as a blueprint for the ethical use of opaque AI."
Application of SiC and Graphite reinforced Aluminium Metal Matrix Composite in Braking Systems and its Validation Through Finite Element Analysis,"Smooth and efficient braking has always been a crucial factor to influence the efficiency of an automobile. This factor has prompted several researchers to indulge in the never-ending chase for a constant development and innovation in the domain of braking systems. Recent progress in this field is evident from the implementation of the new disc brake systems replacing the conventionally used drum type brakes. However, the conventionally existing disc braking systems are continuously exposed to the significant thermal and mechanical stresses that causes structural deformation, overheating, thermal cracking, and squeals of the rotor, which pose a threat to the lifetime and future performance of the rotor pads. Generally, in industrial automobiles, grey cast iron is used as rotor material since it exhibits positive results to thermal and mechanical loads, however investigations demonstrated that superior results can be obtained using other materials as well. Hence in the present study, an attempt to use SiC/Graphite reinforced Aluminium alloy (LM6) as an efficient alternative has been made. Consequently, the performance of the fabricated material was initially estimated through several thermal and mechanical investigations of tensile tests, compression tests, thermal conductivity, thermo-mechanical analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Moreover, with an intention to validate the experimental observations, and to predict the real-life performance, finite element analysis on disc brake rotor of Maruti Alto 800 was conducted. The 3D model of the rotor was designed on Catia V5R20 using actual measurements of the disc brake prototype. This 3D model and measured parameters were used as an input feed for the accurate simulation of modal, structural and thermal behaviour in ANSYS 18.1 FEA software. The results of the experimentations were observed to be in good agreement with the simulation results, indicating the accuracy of the experimental predictions."
Taguchi Analysis of the Deformation Characteristics of Single-Point Cutting Tool with Micro-Tool Coatings During Orthogonal Machining,"Machining, the art of processing materials, has progressed significantly over the past century. Advances in tool materials look at blended advantages of conventional and modern tool materials through coatings at micro-scales. Tool coatings improve the hot hardness and wear resistance of tool tip and faces. The current study utilizes the Taguchi technique to analyze the deformation response of HSS tools with three different tool coatings—titanium carbide, titanium nitride and titanium aluminum nitride. The coating thicknesses of 10, 50 and 100 \(\upmu\)m were employed on the rake face and the flank faces of the single-point cutting tool. The response of the tools while machining medium carbon steel 42CrMo4 has been studied using the finite element approach—transient structural analysis module on ANSYS®. The tool deformation was taken up as the key metric."
Topology-independent end-to-end learning model for improving the voltage profile in microgrids-integrated power distribution networks,"With multiple microgrids (MGs) integrated into power distribution networks in a distributed manner, the penetration of renewable energy like photovoltaic (PV) power generation surges. However, the operation of power distribution networks is challenged by the issues of multiple power flow directions and voltage security. Accordingly, an efficient voltage control strategy is needed to ensure voltage security against ever-changing operating conditions, especially when the network topology information is absent or inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven voltage profile improvement model, denoted as system-wide composite adaptive network (SCAN), which depends on operational data instead of network topology details in the context of power distribution networks integrated with multiple MGs. Unlike existing studies that realize topology identification and decisionmaking optimization in sequence, the proposed end-to-end model determines the optimal voltage control decisions in one shot. More specifically, the proposed model consists of four modules, Pre-training Network and modified interior point methods with adversarial networks (Modified IPMAN) as core modules, and discriminator generative adversarial network (Dis-GAN) and Volt convolutional neural network (Volt-CNN) as ancillary modules. In particular, the generator in SCAN is trained by the core modules in sequence so as to form an end-to-end mode from data to decision. Numerical experiments based on IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus systems have validated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method."
Fault tolerant control strategy for modular PWM current source inverter,"In this paper, a fault-tolerant control method for an input-series output-parallel modular grid-tied pulse-width modulation (PWM) current source inverter is proposed to address the most commonly seen single symmetrical gate-commutated thyristor (SGCT) open-circuit fault problems. This method actively offsets the neutral point of the current space vector to ensure a sinusoidal output of the grid current, and it can achieve the upper limit power of the inverter under the condition of a single SGCT open-circuit fault. In addition, an active damping control method based on grid harmonic current feedback is proposed after analyzing the influence of the transformer ferromagnetic resonance caused by the neutral point offset on the power quality of the grid current. It has been demonstrated that the proposed method effectively suppresses the resonance caused by the transformer and the modified modulation, improving the grid current’s power quality."
Design and modeling of a free-piston engine generator,"Free-piston engine generators (FPEGs) can be applied as decarbonized range extenders for electric vehicles because of their high thermal efficiency, low friction loss, and ultimate fuel flexibility. In this paper, a parameter-decoupling approach is proposed to model the design of an FPEG. The parameter-decoupling approach first divides the FPEG into three parts: a two-stroke engine, an integrated scavenging pump, and a linear permanent magnet synchronous machine (LPMSM). Then, each of these is designed according to predefined specifications and performance targets. Using this decoupling approach, a numerical model of the FPEG, including the three aforementioned parts, was developed. Empirical equations were adopted to design the engine and scavenging pump, while special considerations were applied for the LPMSM. A finite element model with a multi-objective genetic algorithm was adopted for its design. The finite element model results were fed back to the numerical model to update the LPMSM with increased fidelity. The designed FPEG produced 10.2 kW of electric power with an overall system efficiency of 38.5% in a stable manner. The model provides a solid foundation for the manufacturing of related FPEG prototypes."
Active-reactive power scheduling of integrated electricity-gas network with multi-microgrids,"Advances in natural gas-fired technologies have deepened the coupling between electricity and gas networks, promoting the development of the integrated electricity-gas network (IEGN) and strengthening the interaction between the active-reactive power flow in the power distribution network (PDN) and the natural gas flow in the gas distribution network (GDN). This paper proposes a day-ahead active-reactive power scheduling model for the IEGN with multi-microgrids (MMGs) to minimize the total operating cost. Through the tight coupling relationship between the subsystems of the IEGN, the potentialities of the IEGN with MMGs toward multi-energy cooperative interaction is optimized. Important component models are elaborated in the PDN, GDN, and coupled MMGs. Besides, motivated by the non-negligible impact of the reactive power, optimal inverter dispatch (OID) is considered to optimize the active and reactive power capabilities of the inverters of distributed generators. Further, a second-order cone (SOC) relaxation technology is utilized to transform the proposed active-reactive power scheduling model into a convex optimization problem that the commercial solver can directly solve. A test system consisting of an IEEE-33 test system and a 7-node natural gas network is adopted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling method. The results show that the proposed scheduling method can effectively reduce the power losses of the PDN in the IEGN by 9.86%, increase the flexibility of the joint operation of the subsystems of the IEGN, reduce the total operation costs by $32.20, and effectively enhance the operation economy of the IEGN."
Influence of Bifurcated Fracture Angle on Mechanical Behavior of Rock Blocks,"The bifurcated fracture is distributed in nature, and its deformation and destruction occur under natural and man-made force. The study is carried out based on experiments and simulations to analyze the behavior of rock with bifurcated fractures under pressure. Bifurcated fracture causes the bending of the rock blocks on both sides and produces the tensile fractures under pressure. The lateral blocks with tensile fracture lead to the displacement of the intermediate block. By changing the bifurcated angle between fractures, the displacement characteristics of rock caused by block fractures are studied. The angle affects deformation, stress field, fracture mechanism, and displacement of rock with bifurcated fractures. The angle changes the stress magnitude and distribution of the rock blocks, affecting the initiation and expansion of the tension fractures at the bending side of the rock. Peak value of stress decreases with the decrease in bifurcated angle. The displacement difference between the two blocks will become larger. With the decrease in the pressure, deformation increases with time and the deformation rate decreases with time. The smaller the angle, the more difficult it is for the intermediate block to move out. Bifurcated angle of rock fracture has significant effects on the stability of the rock. The results could provide a reference for the stability of rock engineering."
The application of fuzzy transform method to the initial value problems of linear differential–algebraic equations,"In this study, we propose a method based on the direct and inverse fuzzy transforms (\({\mathcal {F}}\)-transforms) to approximate solutions of the system of linear differential–algebraic equations. We obtain an analytical solution to the initial value problem in terms of basic functions using this method. Since the basic functions have compact support, by employing fuzzy transform to the problem, we obtain the system of linear algebraic equations with lower Hessenberg coefficient matrix. We discuss the solvability of this system and give the error analysis using the consistency of the initial value. We present several examples to illustrate the efficiency and the performance of this new method."
No risk of iatrogenic peroneal nerve injury in all-inside lateral meniscal repair with either 14- or 18-mm needles through the popliteus tendon in the standard arthroscopic knee conditions,The objectives of this prospective study were to evaluate the risk of peroneal nerve (PN) injury in simulated all-inside lateral meniscal repair with sutures placed through the popliteus tendon (PT) and to determine the optimal needle length.
Linoleic Acid Promotes Emission of Bark Beetle Semiochemicals by Fungal Symbionts,"Tree-killing bark beetles in conifer forests vector symbiotic fungi that are thought to help the beetles kill trees. Fungal symbionts emit diverse volatile blends that include bark beetle semiochemicals involved in mating and host localization. In this study, all 12 tested fungal isolates emitted beetle semiochemicals when growing in medium amended with linoleic acid. These semiochemicals included the spiroacetals chalcogran, trans-conophthorin and exo-brevicomin, as well as 2-methyl-3-buten-1-ol, the main aggregation pheromone component of the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus. The emission of these compounds was affected by the type of fatty acid present (linoleic vs. oleic acid). Accumulating evidence shows that the fatty acid composition in conifer bark can facilitate colonization by bark beetles and symbiotic fungi, whereas the fatty acid composition of non-host trees can be detrimental for beetle larvae or fungi. We hypothesize that beetles probe the fatty acid composition of potential host trees to test their suitability for beetle development and release of semiochemicals by symbiotic fungi."
Redox Regulatory System in Semi-Sessile Amphibious Indian Apple Snail Pila Globosa for Future Ecotoxic Studies,"Studies on oxidative stress on organisms especially on invertebrates are widely used as biomarkers in relation to the redox regulatory system to assess the freshwater environment. Despite broad availability of Indian apple snail Pila globosa, no data on its antioxidant and oxidative stress status are available. Therefore, determination of tissue-specific redox regulatory systems in P. globosa was the aim of this study. Snails were sampled from a non-polluted site by determination of oxidative stress parameters in hepatopancreas and foot muscle tissues. The levels of lipid peroxidation and total antioxidant capacity were found to be ten- and two fold higher, respectively, in hepatopancreas than foot muscle. Activity of different antioxidant enzymes was 20 to 100% higher in hepatopancreas than foot muscle. The concentration of small redox regulatory antioxidant such as GSH and AA was found to be 25 and 128% higher, respectively, in hepatopancreas. Thus, above tissue-specific antioxidant data can be used as base line data in P. globosa that may be used as biomarker species."
Network-based assessment of HDAC6 activity predicts preclinical and clinical responses to the HDAC6 inhibitor ricolinostat in breast cancer,"Inhibiting individual histone deacetylase (HDAC) is emerging as well-tolerated anticancer strategy compared with pan-HDAC inhibitors. Through preclinical studies, we demonstrated that the sensitivity to the leading HDAC6 inhibitor (HDAC6i) ricolinstat can be predicted by a computational network-based algorithm (HDAC6 score). Analysis of ~3,000 human breast cancers (BCs) showed that ~30% of them could benefice from HDAC6i therapy. Thus, we designed a phase 1b dose-escalation clinical trial to evaluate the activity of ricolinostat plus nab-paclitaxel in patients with metastatic BC (MBC) (NCT02632071). Study results showed that the two agents can be safely combined, that clinical activity is identified in patients with HR+/HER2− disease and that the HDAC6 score has potential as predictive biomarker. Analysis of other tumor types also identified multiple cohorts with predicted sensitivity to HDAC6i’s. Mechanistically, we have linked the anticancer activity of HDAC6i’s to their ability to induce c-Myc hyperacetylation (ac-K148) promoting its proteasome-mediated degradation in sensitive cancer cells."
Triple-stage Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer to Determine Ubiquitously Present Per- and Polyfluorinated Alkyl Substances in Drinking Water at Part Per Trillion Levels Using Solid Phase Extraction Approach,"An accurate analytical method was developed to determine selected per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) at the level of parts per trillion (ppt or ng/L) in drinking water. The method included a concentration step using solid phase extraction (SPE) approach in combination with a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system (LC-MS/MS). This method was optimized and validated for the common PFAS contaminants in drinking water. An initial demonstration of capability was established with an acceptable initial calibration, minimum reporting limit (MRL), limit of detection (LOD), initial demonstration of low system background, and initial demonstration of precision (IDP). Isotopically labeled internal standards were used for quantification. Surrogate standards were used to monitor method performance. The current method will help in better understanding of PFAS crisis by providing an efficient measurement of PFAS in water. In this study, the recoveries of four surrogates were between 84 and 113%, and calculated limit of detection (DL) and minimum reporting limits (MRL) were generally 1.0–3.0 and 5–10 ng/L, respectively."
Impact Analysis and Mathematical Modeling of Humic Acid on the Denitrification Process in a Nitrite–Denitrifying Anaerobic Methane Oxidation System,"Nitrite–denitrification anaerobic methane oxidation (nitrite–DAMO) bacteria live in deep layers of freshwater sediments such as rivers and lakes. Humic acid (HA) usually exists in soil and sediments and can act as an electron shuttle or terminal electron acceptor to promote the redox biotransformation of metals and organic molecules. To determine the influence of humic acid on the nitrite–DAMO process, batch experiments were conducted to study the denitrification and methane oxidation capabilities of the nitrite–DAMO system under different humic acid concentrations. The results showed that the denitrification and methane oxidation capacity of the system was continuously promoted at 0–750 mg HA/L, reached the best at 750 mg HA/L, and was suppressed at humic acid concentrations higher than 750 mg HA/L. At 750 mg HA/L, the denitrification rate was 1.06 mg N/(L·d), and the methane oxidation rate was 0.68 mg/(L·d). Under the action of 750 mg/L humic acid, the effect of 15–40 mg N/L nitrite on the denitrification performance of the system was first promoted and then inhibited. When the nitrite concentration was 30 mg N/L, the denitrification rate was the highest, which was 1.15 mg/(L·d). The effect of 75–125 mg/L methane on the system was continuously promoted. When the methane concentration was 125 mg/L, the denitrification rate was 1.22 mg/(L·d). The kinetic analytical results showed that the prediction of the quantitative relationship between the nitrite–DAMO system and humic acid performed by the half-order substrate removal model resulted in a good fit. The denitrification process of the nitrite–DAMO system under the influence of 750 mg/L humic acid conformed to the Monod and Haldane models, and the theoretical optimum denitrification rate was 2.31 mg N/(L·d). Through the analysis of the thermodynamic state of the nitrite–DAMO system, the biomass yield of the nitrite–DAMO bacteria was obtained. The stoichiometric calculation results showed that humic acid (0–2000 mg/L) had a significant impact on the biomass yield of the nitrite–DAMO system. When the addition amount was 750 mg HA/L, the system biomass yield was the highest, but the actual biomass yield of the system was generally low in theory."
Cryo-EM structure of the respiratory I + III2 supercomplex from Arabidopsis thaliana at 2 Å resolution,"Protein complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain assemble into respiratory supercomplexes. Here we present the high-resolution electron cryo-microscopy structure of the Arabidopsis respiratory supercomplex consisting of complex I and a complex III dimer, with a total of 68 protein subunits and numerous bound cofactors. A complex I-ferredoxin, subunit B14.7 and P9, a newly defined subunit of plant complex I, mediate supercomplex formation. The component complexes stabilize one another, enabling new detailed insights into their structure. We describe (1) an interrupted aqueous passage for proton translocation in the membrane arm of complex I; (2) a new coenzyme A within the carbonic anhydrase module of plant complex I defining a second catalytic centre; and (3) the water structure at the proton exit pathway of complex III2 with a co-purified ubiquinone in the QO site. We propose that the main role of the plant supercomplex is to stabilize its components in the membrane."
Anterior fibromuscular stroma-preserved endoscopic enucleation of the prostate: a precision anatomical approach,"Benign prostate obstruction (BOO) is becoming increasingly important in this aging society. Some urge/stress urinary incontinence (UUI/SUI) still occurs after endoscopic enucleation of the prostate (EEP). It remains unclear how post-EEP incontinence can be avoided. Currently, early apical release to ameliorate the traction of the external sphincter is the best technique for incontinence prevention."
Procedural Fairness in Exchange Matching Systems,"The move from open outcry to electronic trading added another responsibility to futures exchanges—that of matching orders between buyers and sellers. Matching systems can affect the level and speed of price discovery, the distribution of revenue, as well as the level of price efficiency of a given market. Whether the matching system is procedurally fair is another important consideration. I argue that while FIFO (First In First Out) is a fair procedure in principle and is perceived as the default matching system, it is not a fair procedure in practice. Likewise, while pro rata is a fair procedure in principle, it is not so in practice. Nevertheless, both FIFO and pro rata are relics of an open outcry system. Instead, I propose an alternative approach to matching systems that builds on the strengths of electronic trading—the ability to randomize in real time. I introduce random selection for service (RSS) as a matching system that is procedurally fair both in principle and in practice."
Optimal Inversion of Manning’s Roughness in Unsteady Open Flow Simulations Using Adaptive Parallel Genetic Algorithm,"Manning’s roughness coefficient (\(n\)) is a comprehensive indicator of flow resistance, and significantly affects the accuracy of one-dimensional (1D) unsteady flow simulations. Most previous studies on roughness inversion have focused on the variation of the \(n\) values along the reach—the variations of \(n\) with the discharge or water stage have seldom been investigated. To address this issue, an optimization model based on an adaptive parallel genetic algorithm (APGA) is proposed. This model enables better estimations of \(n\) in 1D unsteady flow simulations by considering the effects of both distance and discharge on \(n\). The objective of the proposed model is to determine the optimal \(n\) values under different discharge strata for every sub-reach by minimizing the discrepancies between the simulated and measured water elevations and discharges. Moreover, a successive-approximation-based stepwise optimizing (SABSO) strategy is developed to improve the performance of the APGA-based optimization model in long natural rivers. The proposed model is evaluated through a case study on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, China, and compared with models where the \(n\) values are considered to vary with distance or discharge. The results show that the APGA with the SABSO strategy yields better solutions than the APGA alone, and that the proposed model outperforms models that do not consider variations of \(n\) with both discharge and distance. This research provides a novel approach for the inverse estimation of roughness in long river flows."
Vaccination with an HIV T-cell immunogen induces alterations in the mouse gut microbiota,"The gut microbiota is emerging as a crucial factor modulating vaccine responses; however, few studies have investigated if vaccines, in turn, can alter the microbiota and to what extent such changes may improve vaccine efficacy. To understand the effect of T-cell vaccination on the gut microbiome, we administered an HIV-1 T-cell immunogen (HTI arm) or PBS (control, Mock arm) to C57Bl/6 mice following a heterologous prime-boost scheme. The longitudinal dynamics of the mice gut microbiota was characterized by 16 S ribosomal RNA sequencing in fecal samples collected from cages, as well as from three gut sections (cecum, small and large intestine). Serum and spleen cells were obtained at the last time point of the study to assess immune correlates using IFNγ ELISPOT and cytokine Luminex® assays. Compared with Mock, HTI-vaccinated mice were enriched in Clostridiales genera (Eubacterium xylanophilum group, Roseburia and Ruminococcus) known as primary contributors of anti-inflammatory metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids. Such shift was observed after the first HTI dose and remained throughout the study follow-up (18 weeks). However, the enriched Clostridiales genera were different between feces and gut sections. The abundance of bacteria enriched in vaccinated animals positively correlated with HTI-specific T-cell responses and a set of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6. This longitudinal analysis indicates that, in mice, T-cell vaccination may promote an increase in gut bacteria known to produce anti-inflammatory molecules, which in turn correlate with proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting an adaptation of the gut microbial milieu to T-cell-induced systemic inflammation."
"RETRACTED ARTICLE: The Species Composition and Quantitative Characteristics of the Sea Ice Microalgal Community from the Coast of Russky Island (Peter the Great Bay, Sea of Japan)","This pioneering project was conducted to study the sea ice microalgae community collected along the coast of Russky Island, which is located in the Peter the Great Bay, Sea of Japan. We examined the sea ice microalgae species composition and its quantitative characteristics. Eighty-eight microalga taxa assigned to 50 genera and 7 divisions have been identified. The greatest species diversity was noted for algae of the Bacillariophyta where it reached 57 to 99% of the total assemblage. The most abundant taxa were planktonic, marine, mainly ice-neritic diatoms: Chaetoceros socialis f. radians, Detonula confervacea, Entomoneis gigantea var. decussata, Navicula granii, N. septentrionalis, Nitzschia frigida, Thalassiosira gravida and T. nordenskioeldii. The total number of microalgae collected in 2020 from ice horizons in Novik Bay varied from 23.8 to 68.6 cells/mL, while in Voevoda Bay it ranged from 21.1 to 1296.2 cells/mL. In samples collected in 2021, the number of microalgae in Novik Bay changed from 1160.9 to 3296.9 cells/mL, and in Voevoda Bay it varied from 32.3 to 1607.5 cells/mL. The quantitative characteristics of the ice algal flora in the two areas of our study, Novik Bay and Voevoda Bay, were found to differ depending on the year of study, water area, and ice core layer."
Symbiotisches Wirtschaften als Ansatz zur Weiterentwicklung von Bestandsgewerbegebieten,"Die Weiterentwicklung von Bestandsgewerbegebieten spielte in den letzten Jahrzehnten eine untergeordnete Rolle in Planung und Wirtschaftsförderung. Vor dem Hintergrund der Transformation hin zu einem ressourcenschonenderen Wirtschaftssystem gilt es, diesen Räumen neue Aufmerksamkeit zu schenken und neue Ansätze zu erproben. Das Konzept der industriellen Symbiose zielt auf das Herstellen von Energie- und Stoffströmen, in Form einer komplementären Nutzung von Nebenprodukten durch benachbarte Industrien, ab. Kooperationen benachbarter Unternehmen, die auf eine betriebsübergreifende Erhöhung von Energie- und Ressourceneffizienz abzielen, existieren auch in Deutschland. Während diese nicht unbedingt Netzwerke umfassen, zeigen die existierenden Querverbindungen zwischen Unternehmen dennoch Möglichkeiten auf, durch die Vernetzung von Akteuren in Industrie- und Gewerbegebiete neue Potenziale zu erschließen. Der Artikel untersucht, inwiefern das Konzept der Symbiose zur Implementation in heterogenen Bestandsgewerbegebieten geeignet ist. Hierzu wurden leitfadengestützte Interviews mit Akteuren aus Wirtschaftsförderung, Gebietsmanagement und Planung geführt."
Thermal arrest analysis of the reverse martensitic transformation in a Ni55Fe19Ga26 Heusler alloy obtained by melt-spinning,"Ni55Fe19Ga26 ribbons obtained by melt-spinning technique exhibit a martensitic transformation from L21 cubic austenite phase to 14 M martensite phase above room temperature. We have taken advantage of the existence of thermal hysteresis of the martensitic phase transition (~ 11 K) to analyze the effect of isothermal treatments on the reverse martensitic transformation, which has been analyzed by means of interrupted heating using differential scanning calorimetry. The experimental findings clearly indicate a time-depending effect in the martensitic transformation at temperatures between the austenite start and finish temperatures. Moreover, it has been observed that two successive martensitic transformations take place after the isothermal arrest was performed."
Asterarcys quadricellulare (Chlorophyceae) protects H9c2 cardiomyoblasts from H2O2-induced oxidative stress,"Oxidative stress has recently been identified as an important mediator of cardiovascular diseases. The need to find efficient antioxidant molecules is essential in the disease’s prevention. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the potential of microalgae bioactive in protecting H9c2 cardiomyoblasts from H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Four microalgal species were investigated for their antioxidant capacity. A qualitative assessment of oxidative stress in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts stained with DCFH-DA, treated with the highly active microalgae extracts, was performed. The protein expression of total caspase-3 was also examined to investigate whether the extract protects H9c2 cardimyoblasts from H2O2-induced apoptosis. High antioxidant activity was observed for the hexanoic extracts after 10 days of cultivation. Asterarcys quadricellulare exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity of 110.59 ± 1.75 mg TE g−1 dry weight and was tested against H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, which were initially subjected to H2O2-induced oxidative stress. This hexanoic extract protected against H2O2 induced oxidative stress with a similar scavenging capacity as N-Acetylcysteine. Furthermore, total caspase-3 was increased following treatment with the hexanoic extract, suggesting that A. quadricellulare also had anti-apoptotic properties. The outcome of our study highlighted the possible use of the local A. quadricellulare strain QUCCCM10 as a natural, safe, and efficient antioxidant to prevent cardiovascular diseases."
"Therapeutic role of kaempferol and myricetin in streptozotocin-induced diabetes synergistically via modulation in pancreatic amylase, glycogen storage and insulin secretion","Kaempferol and Myricetin alone have promising benefits on diabetes and related complications, yet the effectiveness of cotreating the two compounds on diabetes have not been studied. The existing investigation was to study the combined anti-diabetic effect of kaempferol and myricetin in Streptozotocin (STZ)-activated diabetes in rats. To evaluate the anti-diabetic activity, 36 Wistar rats were segregated into six groups; Normal, 50 mg/kg STZ-induced diabetes, and four (50 mg/kg kaempferol, 50 mg/kg myricetin, 25 mg/kg kaempferol + myricetin, and 5 mg/kg glibenclamide) compound-treated diabetic groups. The effects of co-treatment on parameters, glucose, insulin, lipid profile, liver enzymes, antioxidant biomarkers, and inflammatory cytokines were measured. The study revealed that combined treatment restored the assessed parameters including glucose levels, inflammatory cytokines, oxidative markers, and lipid and liver enzymes in diabetic rats. The results indicate that cotreatment of kaempferol and myricetin has a beneficial role against diabetes suggesting that cotreatment of these compounds can be used therapeutically in treating diabetes."
"Assessment of environmental gamma dose in air in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam","Measurement of environmental gamma dose in air in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam has been conducted at 2245 locations using a portable dosimeter installed on a motobike with GPS integrated and positioned 1 m above the ground surface. Cumulative gamma dose rates have also been measured using the TLD dosimeters located at 20 fixed locations around the city to evaluate the total component and the contribution of cosmic rays in the rainy and dry seasons. The gamma dose rates in the city were found in the range of 0.05–0.18 μSv/h with the average value of 0.10 μSv/h. The cumulative gamma dose in the dry season is greater than that in the rainy season by about 15%."
Numerical simulation of cooling performance in microchannel heat sinks made of AlN ceramics,"The problem of generating a high amount of heat in microelectronic equipment should be minimized properly. Allowing systems to run for long periods of time in high temperatures can reduce the performance and reliability of equipment. The microchannel heat sink is an efficient cooling technology to prevent the generation of very high heat fluxes. In the present study, the effect of the applied heat fluxes and geometric parameters such as rib width on the entire thermal resistance and cooling capacity of the heat sink is examined numerically. Besides, the substrate’s material changed from silicon to AlN ceramic. Because of the higher thermal conductivity of AlN, a more unfluctuating temperature distribution in the battom wall and a reduction of about 31% in the entire thermal resistance of the heat sink are reported. Additionally, the entire thermal resistance of heat sinks is greatly dependent on its geometric parameters such as rib width. Reducing the rib width results in a considerable diminish in total thermal resistance and betterment in the cooling capacity of the microchannel heat sink."
Bowel obstruction secondary to internal hernia in a hereditary angioedema patient: a case report,"Gastrointestinal attacks are frequent symptoms in patients diagnosed with hereditary angioedema (HAE). Cases of self-limited bowel intussusception and unneeded exploratory laparotomy due to lack of knowledge about HAE have been reported. Furthermore, after the introduction of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrate, the recommended medication for HAE attacks, treatment has become typically medical in nature. We share a rare case where operative exploration was indicated to resolve a mechanical small bowel obstruction secondary to an HAE attack."
The antennal transcriptome of Triatoma infestans reveals substantial expression changes triggered by a blood meal,"Triatoma infestans is the main vector of Chagas disease in the Americas, currently transmitting it in Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. Many T. infestans populations present insecticide resistance, reducing the efficiency of control campaigns. Alternative vector control methods are needed, and molecular targets mediating fundamental physiological processes can be a promising option to manipulate kissing bug behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to characterize the main sensory targets, as well as to determine whether they are modulated by physiological factors. In order to identify gene candidates potentially mediating host cue detection, the antennal transcripts of T. infestans fifth instar larvae were sequenced and assembled. Besides, we evaluated whether a blood meal had an effect on transcriptional profiles, as responsiveness to host-emitted sensory cues depends on bug starvation."
Risk factors and prognostic implications of surgery-related strokes following resection of high-grade glioma,"Surgery-related strokes are an important cause of morbidity following resection of high-grade glioma (HGG). We explored the incidence, risk factors and clinical consequences of intra-operative ischemic strokes in surgeries for resection of HGG. We retrospectively followed a cohort of 239 patients who underwent surgical resection of HGG between 2013 and 2017. Tumor types included both isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wildtype glioblastoma and IDH-mutant WHO grade 4 astrocytoma. We analyzed pre- and post-operative demographic, clinical, radiological, anesthesiology and intraoperative neurophysiology data, including overall survival and functional outcomes. Acute ischemic strokes were seen on postoperative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in 30 patients (12.5%), 13 of whom (43%) developed new neurological deficits. Infarcts were more common in insular (23%, p = 0.019) and temporal surgeries (57%, p = 0.01). Immediately after surgery, 35% of patients without infarcts and 57% of those with infarcts experienced motor deficits (p = 0.022). Six months later, rates of motor deficits decreased to 25% in the non-infarcts group and 37% in the infarcts group (p = 0.023 and 0.105, respectively) with a significantly lower Karnofsky-Performance Score (KPS, p = 0.001). Intra-operative language decline in awake procedures was a significant indicator of the occurrence of intra-operative stroke (p = 0.029). In conclusion, intraoperative ischemic events are more common in insular and temporal surgeries for resection of HGG and their intra-operative detection is limited. These strokes can impair motor and speech functions as well as patients’ performance status."
Optimum Site Suitability Analysis for Urban Open Space Facilities using Geospatial Techniques,"Fast economic development and expansive urban growth necessitates an urban development agenda that emphasis on adequate urban open space facility spatial planning and developmental initiatives aimed at ensuring proximity and accessibility to essential urban facilities for all urban residents. Locating suitable site in the disparity region for open space facilities such as parks and playgrounds enhances the quality of citizen’s life. To address the necessitating concern of the existing trend of uneven distribution, the Gravity-based spatial accessibility model i.e. Three-step floating catchment area method is opted to identify the derprived region and Multi-criteria decision analysis model is used to locate optimum site in the deprived region. Tiruchirappalli city has 37 parks and 14 playgrounds, out of which 14 parks closed due to improper maintenance. Among the 65 wards, it was observed that 33 wards had no accessibility to parks within the threshold distance of 3 km with the 73.5% of the city population. The questionnaire of 821 samples was collected in both well-served region and unserved region of parks and playgrounds facilities, it states that the 82% of residences in well-served region residents access frequently whereas only 23% of residences access in the unserved region. Hence, to maximize the accessibility, the new open space can be provided in the optimum sites obtained by Analytical Hierarchy Process that shows the area of 7.68 km2 as very highly suitable category and 48.48 km2 as highly suitable category. Thereby it becomes important to focus on proper spatial planning of urban facilities and transportation services needed for the establishment of an efficiently functioning city."

Semiotically Mediated Human-Bee Communication in the Practice of Brazilian Meliponiculture,"Stingless bees are among the most dominant pollinators in the south tropics. As such, the rational beekeeping of stingless bee species, called meliponiculture, is an ancient and relevant activity, related to sustainable agricultural development, and which connects traditional knowledge to innovation and novelty. Given the relevance of this topic, this paper discusses the possibilities of a semiotically mediated communication between humans and Meliponini (stingless bees). Zoosemiotics, as the studies of animal views of the world, is the ideal modelling system for the investigation of the possibilities of mutual understanding between these two species. Starting from the premise that, for there to be inter-specific communication, there must be a shared code, and that this depends on the biological makeup and sensory apparatus of both organisms involved in the communication process, this research suggests that a possible way to communicate with stingless bees is with the use of olfactory (chemical) signals, since this channel seems to be common to both humans and bees. Considering that for human-animal relations one party must be able to recognize the other (iconic learning), it is revealed that chemical signals do allow bees to recognize individual humans, even going so far as profiling this person as ‘not a threat’. Finally, bees are seen to act cooperatively while the beekeeper is taking action to protect and maintain the nest, something that can be interpreted as an opening of semiotic relations, where the bees are deeming the beekeeper as part of their social group."
"Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes of Schiff base ligands: synthesis, characterization, DFT, in vitro antimicrobial activity and molecular docking studies","Three Schiff base ligands [H2L1–H2L3] containing nitrogen/oxygen donor atoms and their Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes were synthesized by stirring metal acetates with Schiff base ligands obtained from condensation reaction of 2-amino-6-chloro-4-nitrophenol with 5-chloro salicylaldehyde/3,5-dibromo salicylaldehyde/3-methoxy-5–nitro salicylaldehyde. The structural traits of the synthesized compounds were done by using elemental analysis, spectroscopic techniques (UV–Vis, 1H and 13C NMR, FT-IR), mass spectrometry and some physical studies (XRD, TGA). According to spectral data, ligands behave as a tridentate (ONO) and formed complexes with octahedral geometry. The thermogravimetric analysis revealed that metal complexes decay in multi-steps leaving metal oxide as an end product. Powder XRD study suggested crystalline nature of the compounds. The energy gap (HOMO–LUMO) and molecular electrostatic potential calculation were computed by using DFT/B3LYP/6-31G** basis set. Derived ligands and complexes were explored for in vitro antimicrobial potential toward two gram-positive bacteria, two gram-negative bacteria, i.e., S. aureus, B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and two fungal strains, i.e., A. niger, C. albicans, through serial dilution method taking ciprofloxacin and fluconazole as standard. The investigated results showed that complexes are more potent than free Schiff base ligands. The Cu(L2)(H2O)3 (0.0115 μmol/mL) and Zn(L2)(H2O)3 (0.0115 μmol/mL) complexes were found to be more active among all the investigated compounds. Additionally, molecular docking studies were also performed for some compounds in the active site of DNA Gyrase enzyme (PDB code: 1AJ6), suggesting good hydrophobic interactions of compounds with the enzyme."
Looking for COVID side effects in the EU through the analysis of health and behavioural profiles,"More than two years after the great outbreak of COVID suffered in almost the whole world, and in particular in Europe, we have gradually learned about the direct effects of this virus on our health and what consequences it can have if we become infected. However, this pandemic also had great economic and social consequences that affected people in an indirect way, which we can call COVID side effects. In this work we carried out an innovative type of analysis based on the concept of archetypoids in order to find extreme observations in a database of mixed-type data and used them to classify individuals yielding to different health and behavioural profiles in coping with the COVID outbreak in the EU. We use data from the first COVID-19 Survey of the SHARE project (Survey on Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe). The resulting profiles are easier to interpret than others based on central observations, and help to understand how the situations of restrictions and lock-downs affected people since the outbreak of the pandemic. Another key point of the work was to analyse how determinant are some aspects such as gender, age group or even geographical location in how each person experienced the pandemic. The method that we propose is wide enough to be used in other health and wellbeing surveys."
Supporting inference-making during COVID-19 through individualized scaffolding and feedback: a natural experiment,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of the Early Language Comprehension Individualized Instruction (ELCII) program in supporting kindergarteners’ learning of inference-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two different cohorts of pre- and in-pandemic students completed the ELCII program, which was designed to teach them how to make inferences. Results suggest that kindergarteners during COVID-19 made slower growth over the course of the intervention compared to their counterparts who completed the intervention before the pandemic. However, when growth rates between the two cohorts were compared accounting for the scaffolding and feedback provided by the ELCII program, the growth rates were similar. These findings suggest that the individualized scaffolding and feedback component of ELCII may have supported kindergarteners’ learning of inference-making during the pandemic."
Synthesis N-Doped Ni@C-PTA-N-T Catalysts for Highly Selective Hydrogenation of Phenol to Cyclohexanol,"A facile and simple approach for the synthesis of N-doped porous carbon supported Ni composites (Ni@C-PTA-N) from Ni-MOF-PTA-N was proposed. And the as-prepared Ni@C-PTA-N-T composites with different pyrolysis temperatures (T) were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effect of T on the selective hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol over Ni@C-PTA-N-T was studied. Results showed that the Ni@C-PTA-N-450 obtained at pyrolysis temperature of 450°C had the best hydrogenation performance. It showed 98.0% phenol conversion with 100% cyclohexanol selectivity under mild conditions within 2 h. This can be attributed to the uniformly dispersed smaller Ni nanoparticles owing to doping of N, and the strong interaction between the metal Ni to N–C support, which can facilitate H2 spillover on surface of catalyst."
Ruthenium(III) Catalyzed Oxidation of Methenamine by Cerium(IV) in Aqueous Sulfuric Acid Medium—A Kinetic and Mechanistic Approach,"Reduction of cerium(IV) when it is in the form of an oxidant is done by adding methenamine as a substrate. This can be carried out in a sulfuric acid (H+) medium by using the method of visible spectrophotometry. The change in absorbance of oxidant at λmax 360 nm was noted as being the rate of reaction. The next reaction to be observed was the oxidation due to the presence of various experimental parameters, for example, a change in concentration of methenamine, Ce(IV), H+, and ruthenium(III). The results exhibit first-order kinetics regarding Ce(IV) and Ru(III). Also noticeable is an inverse fractional order with respect to H+ in addition to the fractional order with respect to [methenamine]. A change in ionic strength (I) is seen to have a positive effect on the reaction rate constant. But the dielectric constant has no visible effect on the reaction velocity. Worthy of note was the rate of oxidation of methenamine which increased after the addition of Ru(III). The rate constant was deduced with respect to the cases of slow step and effect of temperature on the reaction. These had to be studied to evaluate the activation parameters. Subsequently, the reaction product was isolated and confirmed by IR studies and a suitable mechanism that was consistent with experimental observations and rate law was proposed."
The Transfer Free Energetics of L-Cysteine in Aqueous Sodium Chloride Solutions,"The solubility of few amino acids is very significant in biological action of biomolecules like proteins. In the current work the solubilities of L-cysteine in NaCl aqueous solution with variation of temperature were measured by gravimetric technique. The thermodynamical energetics and interactions effects were estimated under the experimental conditions as mentioned above. Other essential and associated solvent parameters like molar volume, molar mass, etc., were also calculated in this study. Different interactions mainly molecular interactions were clarified to discuss the role of solute and solvent in solvation phenomenon."
Adsorption of Zr(IV) Ions from Aqueous Acidic Solutions onto TANB Adsorbent,"Adsorption is a process that can be used effectively to remove metal ions from aqueous solutions. Natural and modified bentonite are widely used as low-cost materials to increase the competitive advantage of the process. In recent years, extensive research has been carried out among articles on the adsorption of heavy metal ions on natural and modified bentonite. The investigated working parameters are initial metal ion concentration, solution pH, adsorbent dosage and temperature. The optimum condition for the adsorption process of thermally activated natural bentonite (TANB) is 125 mesh, which is at a contact time of 180 min at a concentration of 100 mg/L and has an adsorption capacity of 15.432 mg/g. The adsorption process on the prepared bentonite includes chemical adsorption and follows the Langmuir adsorption isotherm pattern. It was found that the adsorption of Zr(IV) metal ions on TANB adsorbent occurs exothermically. TANB adsorbent has proven to be sufficient materials to remove Zr(IV) metal ions from aqueous solutions."
Tribocorrosion Behaviors of NiTi/AlNi2Ti Intermetallic Alloy in NaCl Solution,"A novel NiTi/AlNi2Ti ternary intermetallic alloy were prepared by arc melting. Tribocorrosion behaviors of the NiTi/AlNi2Ti alloy were investigated by tribocorrosion tests. The results showed that NiTi/AlNi2Ti alloy had an excellent tribocorrosion resistance in NaCl solution and is more suitable as a tribocorrosion resistant material than 1Cr18Ni9Ti stainless steel. With the onset of sliding, the OCP of NiTi/AlNi2Ti alloy decreases and the corrosion current density increases during tribocorrosion test, and the decrease of the OCP is proportional to the increase of the frictional force, showing a strong corrosion-wear synergy effect. The corrosion current density and wear loss volume of the NiTi/AlNi2Ti alloy increase with the increase of applied potentials."
First-Principles Studies of Ethylene Oxide Adsorption on Pristine and Doped Graphenes,"The adsorption interactions between ethylene oxide molecule (EO) and pristine graphene (PG), silicon- (SiG), aluminum- (AlG), and boron-doped graphene (BG) were studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to examine the potential applicability of the doped graphenes as EO gas sensors. The geometry optimizations and adsorption of EO on the PG and doped graphene have been done by using the 6-31G(d) basis. The calculated adsorption energies (Ead) of EO on the PG, SiG, AlG, and BG corresponding to the most stable configurations were 0.54, –6.07, –24.55, and 0.50 kcal mol–1, respectively, which revealed that the adsorption of EO on the SiG and AlG systems was much stronger than pristine graphene. For all the studied systems, band-gap energy (Eg), chemical potential (μ), electrophilicity index (ω), the maximum amount of electronic charge (ΔNmax), molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps, Mulliken charge transfer, global hardness (η), and softness (S), were measured and discussed. Based on the acquired outcomes, the sensitivity of graphene-based chemical gas sensors for EO finding could be observably advanced through recommending the Al- and Si-dopants."
Effect of Alumina Replacing Calcium Oxide on Vitrification of Molybdenum in Borosilicate Glass,"Borosilicate glasses are the most potential matrices to vitrify high-level nuclear wastes. However, the low solubility of Mo, which is usually one of the main elements in HLWs coming from the nuclear power stations, is a main limitation for their application in vitrification. In this paper, the effect of the substitution of Al2O3 for CaO on Mo solubility in a modified SiO2–B2O3–Na2O–CaO borosilicate glass is investigated in detail. The results show that the solubility of Mo can be increased up to 4 mol % at least in the borosilicate glasses. The mechanism of Al2O3 substitution for CaO to improve the solubility of Mo has been explained in detail by analyzing the changes of the cations for compensating \({\text{MoO}}_{4}^{{2 - }}\) units and the depolymerized regions. It can be concluded that the borosilicate glasses with high substitution of Al2O3 (15 or 20 mol %) are potential matrices to immobilize molybdenum-rich high-level nuclear wastes."
Template-Free Synthesis of ZnNiAl-LDH and LDO Microspheres for Adsorption of Methyl Orange,"ZnNiAl-layered double hydroxide (ZnNiAl-LDH) microspheres were synthesized using a facile hydrothermal method without any templates. After being calcined, ZnNiAl-layered double oxide (ZnNiAl-LDO) micropheres were obtained. The as-prepared samples were used as adsorbents to remove of methyl orange (MO) from aqueous solution. Results show the adsorption kinetics and isotherms can be fitted well with the pseudo-second-ordered and Langmuir models for both adsorbents. ZnNiAl-LDO has higher adsorption capacity, faster adsorption rate and better recyclability than ZnNiAl-LDH. The maximum capacity for ZnNiAl-LDO is 1226.84 mg g–1 at 298 K. After five adsorption-desorption cycles, the removal efficiency of ZnNiAl-LDO still retains at 98.1%. The adsorption mechanisms for ZnNiAl-LDH are attributed to ion exchange, electrostatic interaction and accompanied by surface complexation. Excepting for above, the structure reconstruction and hydrogen bond also play a part in the adsorption of MO onto ZnNiAl-LDO."
"Density Functional Study on the Hydrogenation of Phosphorus Oxides: Structural, Electronic, and Spectral Properties","Based on density functional theory (DFT), the geometric structures of POmHn (1 ≤ m ≤ 5, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) clusters are optimized, and their relative stability, electronic and spectral properties are calculated systematically. It is found that the H atoms in the clusters are more likely to combine with O atoms to form hydroxyl groups except PO3H. Due to the stronger bonding, the average binding energy, energy gap and stability of the clusters is relatively higher. All the clusters are polar molecules, with PO4H3 having the smallest dipole. The electronic properties of POmHn clusters are related to the geometric structure and m value, especially the phosphate clusters show the highest electronic stability. The infrared and Raman spectra of POmHn clusters have more vibration peaks at m = 3 and 4, both showing relatively high infrared and Raman activities."
Synthesis N-Doped Ni@C-PTA-N-T Catalysts for Highly Selective Hydrogenation of Phenol to Cyclohexanol,"A facile and simple approach for the synthesis of N-doped porous carbon supported Ni composites (Ni@C-PTA-N) from Ni-MOF-PTA-N was proposed. And the as-prepared Ni@C-PTA-N-T composites with different pyrolysis temperatures (T) were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effect of T on the selective hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol over Ni@C-PTA-N-T was studied. Results showed that the Ni@C-PTA-N-450 obtained at pyrolysis temperature of 450°C had the best hydrogenation performance. It showed 98.0% phenol conversion with 100% cyclohexanol selectivity under mild conditions within 2 h. This can be attributed to the uniformly dispersed smaller Ni nanoparticles owing to doping of N, and the strong interaction between the metal Ni to N–C support, which can facilitate H2 spillover on surface of catalyst."
Novel Double Z-Scheme Heterojunction g-C3N4/BiNbO4@AgI Composite Catalyst with Good Response to Visible Light,"The g-C3N4/BiNbO4@AgI ternary composite catalyst was successfully prepared by the in-situ growth method. The structure and micro-morphology of the catalyst were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The element composition and valence state of the catalyst were analyzed by energy spectrum analysis (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is found that the catalyst has good dispersibility and no impurities. Visible light catalytic degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) experiment results show that the 30 wt % g-C3N4/BiNbO4@AgI ternary composite catalyst has the best photocatalytic activity. Cycling experiments found that the catalyst has good stability. Combined with the capture experiment of active free radicals, the possible photocatalytic degradation mechanism of the 30 wt % g-C3N4/BiNbO4@AgI ternary composite catalyst was speculated."
Structural and Thermodynamic Properties of Van der Waals Fluids via a Hard-Core Sutherland Potential,"The structural and thermodynamic properties of the Van der Waals fluids are determined at a wide range of densities and temperatures. For this purpose, the second-order Barker and Henderson perturbation approach is used with an effective pair intermolecular interaction model involving a hard-core repulsion coupled with an attractive tail in the Sutherland function. A developed analytical expression for the radial distribution function of hard spheres is used to account for the reference fluid contribution. A good prediction is made for calculating the static structure factor S(k), Helmholtz free energy (A), compressibility factor (Z), and isothermal compressibility (κT) for the argon and nitrogen fluids. Furthermore, the calculated results are developed when the contribution of many-body interactions is accounted for using an effective pair potential in which its intermolecular parameters are dependent on the thermodynamic states."
Flower-Like SrTiO3/BiVO4 Heterojunction Nanocomposite Photocatalyst for Effective Degradation of Tetracycline,"Flower-like SrTiO3 was prepared by hydrothermal method and BiVO4 was prepared by sol–gel method, and then the two materials were fully mixed under the condition of calcination at 500°C for 2 h. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results showed that the BiVO4 nanoparticles were embedded on the flower-like SrTiO3, and the heterojunction between BiVO4 and SrTiO3 was formed which effectively improved the migration efficiency of photogenerated carriers. The UV–Vis test results indicated that the corresponding range of STO–10 wt % BVO composite photocatalyst changes from 380 to 490 nm, and the photocatalytic efficiency reached 72% by degrading tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) under simulated sunlight. Mechanism analysis shows that the type I heterojunction is successfully built between SrTiO3 and BiVO4, which promotes the migration and separation of photogenerated carriers and reduces the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes."
"DFT Study Adsorption of Hydroxychloroquine for Treatment COVID-19 by SiC Nanotube and Al, Si Doping on Carbon Nanotube Surface: A Drug Delivery Simulation","This study aims to investigate the capability of aluminum-doped nanotubes, silicon-doped nanotubes, and silicon carbide nanotubes to adsorb Hydroxychloroquine (C18H26ClN3O) molecular using DFT theory at 6-31G** basis set and M062x level of theory. The calculated results indicate that the distance between nanotubes and the drug from the N site is lower than from all other locations sites for all investigated nanotubes, and adsorption is more favorable, especially for Al-CNT nanotube. The adsorption energy, hardness, softness, and fermi energy results reveal that the interaction of Hydroxychloroquine with Al-CNT is stronger than Si-CNT and SiC-NT. The results clarify that Al-CNT is a promising adsorbent for this drug as Eads of Hydroxychloroquine/Al-CNT complexes are –45.07, –15.78, –45.15, –93.53 kcal/mol in the gas phase and –43.02, –14.43, –43.86, –88.97 kcal/mol for aqueous solution. The energy gap of the Hydroxychloroquine/Al-CNT system is in the range of 2.32 to 3.84 eV."
Theoretical Studies of Rate Constant and Anharmonic Effect of Cracking Reaction Steps in Reaction C2H3Cl + OH,"In order to study the reaction mechanism of the reaction C2H3Cl + OH, the harmonic and anharmonic rate constants in canonical and microcanonical systems were calculated by the transition state (TS) theory and Yao–Lin (YL) method at MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level, respectively. In addition, A, n, and E in Arrhenius formula were calculated considering the anharmonic effect. The rate constants increase with the increasing of temperature and energy, and the difference between the harmonic and anharmonic rate constants are more obvious in high temperature and energy range than low temperature and energy in some reaction steps. On the whole, the anharmonic effect of the reaction steps in C2H3Cl + OH is significant and can’t be neglected at high temperature and energy. This study will provide theoretical basis for the reaction C2H3Cl + OH, which is one of the reactions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere."
Quick continual kernel learning on bounded memory space based on balancing between adaptation and forgetting,"Concomitant with developments in artificial intelligence, small computer systems are being required to both perform reasoning and have quick incremental learning abilities. This can be achieved using a class of few-shot learning methods comprising a predetermined deep-feature extractor followed by a traditional instance-based (nearest neighbor) learner. However, when tasks must be performed on a limited-memory-space microcomputer, its learning ability is constrained by the memory capacity. We propose a new projection-based quick incremental learning method for the Nadaraya–Watson kernel regression model as the instance-based learner utilizing a lightweight calculation in embedded systems. Owing to the limitation of storage capacity in incremental learning on a budget, the number of kernels in the system is bounded; when the upper bound is reached, the algorithm prunes part of the kernels to make space for recording a new instance. However, kernel pruning causes the system to forget certain aspects. Therefore, the appropriate balance between forgetting and adjustment of the current instance is important for obtaining a higher generalization capability. Thus, we also propose a novel method to obtain the optimum balance for the class of Nadaraya–Watson kernel regression models without referring to past given instances by predicting the magnitude of forgetting due to learning and by controlling the learning ratio in the kernel regression model. Experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to other continual kernel-based learning methods with performance on par with the best existing prototype-selection methods, which evaluate their results with all given learning samples."
Corncob bio-waste and boron nitride particles reinforced epoxy-based composites for lightweight applications: fabrication and characterization,"In the present investigation, corncob waste obtained from local agricultural fields in conjunction with boron nitride particles has been used as the reinforcement material to fabricate epoxy–based composite. The purpose of this research work is to use bio-waste in composite fabrication due to its low cost, non-abrasive, and eco-friendly nature. Aim of this investigation is to provide effective measure for waste disposal and enhance the flexural and tensile strength of the epoxy-based composites to increase its application in day to day life. Fabricated composite material is been characterized through tensile strength, flexural strength, the water up-take test, and fire resistance test. Nine different laminates are prepared with different proportions of corncob and epoxy through the hand layup process. Natural fibers may play important role in developing bio-degradable composite to resolve the current ecological and environmental problems. This report shows that natural water reinforcement also possesses good mechanical properties, and then, fiber composite can also be used in various engineering applications. Results shows that 3.5/3.5 boron nitride and corncob ratio (wt./wt.) composition possess the best flexural strength of about 36.7 N/mm2, and further characterization has been done only to this composition composite. 3.5/3.5 boron nitride and corncob ratio (wt./wt.) composite shows 2 to 3 times improvement in tensile strength as compared to the neat epoxy resin. Moreover, thermal decomposition of laminate occurs in three phases corresponding to 34%, 16%, and 27% of weight loss."
"Intrinsic D614G and P681R/H mutations in SARS-CoV-2 VoCs Alpha, Delta, Omicron and viruses with D614G plus key signature mutations in spike protein alters fusogenicity and infectivity","The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been rapidly evolving over the time and the genetic variation has led to the generation of Variants of Concerns (VoC), which have shown increased fitness. These VoC viruses contain the key mutations in the spike protein which have allowed better survival and evasion of host defense mechanisms. The D614G mutation in the spike domain is found in the majority of VoC; additionally, the P681R/H mutation at the S1/S2 furin cleavage site junction is also found to be highly conserved in major VoCs; Alpha, Delta, Omicron, and its’ current variants. The impact of these genetic alterations of the SARS-CoV-2 VoCs on the host cell entry, transmissibility, and infectivity has not been clearly identified. In our study, Delta and D614G + P681R synthetic double mutant pseudoviruses showed a significant increase in the cell entry, cell-to-cell fusion and infectivity. In contrast, the Omicron and P681H synthetic single mutant pseudoviruses showed TMPRSS2 independent cell entry, less fusion and infectivity as compared to Delta and D614G + P681R double mutants. Addition of exogenous trypsin further enhanced fusion in Delta viruses as compared to Omicron. Furthermore, Delta viruses showed susceptibility to both E64d and Camostat mesylate inhibitors suggesting, that the Delta virus could exploit both endosomal and TMPRSS2 dependent entry pathways as compared to the Omicron virus. Taken together, these results indicate that the D614G and P681R/H mutations in the spike protein are pivotal which might be favoring the VoC replication in different host compartments, and thus allowing a balance of mutation vs selection for better long-term adaptation."
"Synthesis and Characterization of Nylon 6,6-Polyvinyl Alcohol-Based Polyelectrolytic Membrane","This work presents the preparation and investigation of blended nylon (N)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based polyelectrolytic membranes that are modified with different concentrations of sulfuric acid (SA), chlorosulfonic acid (CSA), and sulfonated activated carbon (SAC) as a filler. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs illustrated good membrane homogeneity, and no cracks or phase separation were detected. Chemical interaction between N, PVA, and other membrane components was confirmed by Raman scattering spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). In addition, the molecular structure is verified by energy depressive X-ray (EDX). Furthermore, water and methanol uptake, gel fraction, and IEC were determined as functions of varied membrane modification components. The results revealed that increasing the portion of SA, CSA and SAC led to an increase in IEC and ionic conductivity values reached 2.12 meq/g–0.076 S/cm for (N/PVA-4.0% SA-4.0% SAC), respectively, and 2.71 meq/g–0.087 S/cm for (N/PVA-4.0% CSA-4.0% SAC), respectively, while the IEC and ionic conductivity value for non-modified N/PVA membrane was 0.02 meq/g and zero, respectively. Such results enhance the potential feasibility of modified N/PVA electrolytic membranes for fuel cell (FC) applications."
Development of Neural Network-Based Asphalt Mix Design Parameters Prediction Tool,"Mix design of asphalt concrete is carried out in order to produce a mixture of asphalt bitumen and aggregate that satisfies both minimum design requirements and cost-effectiveness. Marshall mix design, similar to other mix design methods, aims to determine an optimum mix for a given design criteria, having an optimum bitumen content, and has still been one of the most used asphalt mix design method in the world. Marshall mix design procedure requires significant amount of time and skilled workmanship for lengthy laboratory experiments. Time required for the mix design may negatively affect construction schedule especially during the peak construction season. In Marshall mix design procedure, optimum bitumen content is determined based on Marshall stability and flow test results, and other volumetric properties of the mixes. Prediction models that quickly predict all required Marshall mix design parameters based on very few numbers of input parameters requiring significantly less amount of time to obtain compared to the time needed to obtain all Marshall mix design parameters through lengthy laboratory experiments could be quite useful. In this study, artificial neural network-based prediction models based on the data of 200 asphalt mixes designed for asphalt wearing course, obtained from 5th district of the General Directorate of Highways of Turkey, were developed to predict all required Marshall mix design parameters. As part of the paper, a Microsoft Excel Macro-based tool, to be potentially used by 5th district of the General Directorate of Highways of Turkey, was also developed that makes prediction of all required mix design parameters for any given mix in seconds using the developed models and very few numbers of user-defined input parameters requiring significantly less amount time to obtain so that optimum bitumen content could be quickly determined. This will significantly reduce the amount of time and other resources required to determine optimum bitumen content."
Convolutional neural networks prediction of the factor of safety of random layered slopes by the strength reduction method,"The strength reduction method is often used to predict the stability of soil slopes with complex soil properties and failure mechanisms. However, it requires a considerable computational effort. In this paper, we make use of a convolutional neural network to reduce the computational cost. The factor of safety of 600 slopes with different inclination and soil properties is first calculated with the strength reduction method. A convolutional neural network is then trained and validated. We demonstrate the performance of our approach and show how to augment the dataset to further enhance its capability and prevent overfitting."
Bacterial metabolite butyrate in modulating sorafenib-targeted microRNAs to curtail its resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma,"The host dietary fibre is fermented into short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) by intestinal microbiota as bacterial metabolites like propionate, acetate and butyrate. Among these metabolites, the role of butyrate is well documented to provide energy to intestinal epithelial cells. Also, butyrate has anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour properties and decrease in its level by unbalanced diet can develops cancer. Lately, some research has suggested that sodium butyrate as an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) may have anticancer potential for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer. Since, HCC is asymptomatic it is usually diagnosed at its advanced stage. Sorafenib with antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects is the first line of treatment in advanced HCC. However, prolonged drug treatment to HCC patients develops adaptive resistance towards the sorafenib. Sorafenib resistance can also be enhanced by differentially expressed microRNAs. However, the significance of butyrate in HCC sorafenib resistance and its association with sorafenib-targeted microRNAs is yet to be unfurled. Here, an attempt has been made to explore the role of bacterial metabolite butyrate on sorafenib resistant HCC as well as on sorafenib-targeted microRNAs (miR-7641 and miR-199) to curtail sorafenib resistance in HCC."
GaN Nanorods Gas Sensor for Highly Sensitive n-butanol Detection at room Temperature,"Safe and efficient detection of hazardous n-butanol gas is very great significance to the health of workers and researchers in chemical environments. In this work, we successfully developed a GaN gas sensor by a simple solvothermal method and a low-temperature nitridation process. Material characterization results show that one-dimensional nanorods structures were obtained and the products presented a superior growth orientation along with (101) plane. The gas sensing test results show that the sensor exhibits excellent responsivity, repeatability, and selectivity to n-butanol at room temperature. The response and recovery time of the sensor to 200 ppm n-butanol gas was 45 s/34 s. Gas adsorption model and electron depletion layer theory were established to understand the n-butanol sensing mechanism. This work provides the possibility for its real application in n-butanol detection with safe and efficient at room temperature."
A spike-trimer protein-based tetravalent COVID-19 vaccine elicits enhanced breadth of neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants and other variants,"Multivalent vaccines combining crucial mutations from phylogenetically divergent variants could be an effective approach to defend against existing and future SARS-CoV-2 variants. In this study, we developed a tetravalent COVID-19 vaccine SCTV01E, based on the trimeric Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1, with a squalene-based oil-in-water adjuvant SCT-VA02B. In the immunogenicity studies in naïve BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice, SCTV01E exhibited the most favorable immunogenic characteristics to induce balanced and broad-spectrum neutralizing potencies against pre-Omicron variants (D614G, Alpha, Beta, and Delta) and newly emerging Omicron subvariants (BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.3, and BA.4/5). Booster studies in C57BL/6J mice previously immunized with D614G monovalent vaccine demonstrated superior neutralizing capacities of SCTV01E against Omicron subvariants, compared with the D614G booster regimen. Furthermore, SCTV01E vaccination elicited naïve and central memory T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain and Omicron spike peptides. Together, our comprehensive immunogenicity evaluation results indicate that SCTV01E could become an important COVID-19 vaccine platform to combat surging infections caused by the highly immune evasive BA.4/5 variants. SCTV01E is currently being studied in a head-to-head immunogenicity comparison phase 3 clinical study with inactivated and mRNA vaccines (NCT05323461)."
Determination of selected elements in two commercially available edible aquatic insects (Coleoptera) and their worldwide updated list,"Many nations and ethnic groups from underdeveloped and developed countries have used insects as human food since ancient times, a practice that has continued into modern times. In many traditionally entomophagous countries, insects are not a “famine food,” and demand for edible insects is clearly a “food of choice” rather than a necessity. From a nutritional point of view, depending on the insect species, gender, insect’s diet, and seasons, some species of edible insects have significant amounts of fat, protein, carbohydrates, and vitamins, as well as minerals required for human health, thus representing an alternative food source. In addition to their nutritious content, they may also accumulate pesticide residues, microplastics, and heavy metals from their ecosystems. Therefore, this study analyses some mineral (Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn, Se, Co, Cr, As, and Pb) contents of two selected commercialized aquatic edible beetles, Dytiscus marginalis and Cybister tripunctatus (Dytiscidae), via inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and reviews the contemporary list of aquatic edible beetles of the world, summarizing the nutritional characteristics of water beetles with a synthesis of the risks and benefits of edible aquatic beetles in recent literature. The mineral composition of the aquatic beetles is briefly discussed. Antinutritional elements (Pb and As) were detected in aquatic insects, but their contents are below toxic levels for humans. A list of 92 edible aquatic beetle species from Dytiscidae, Gyrinidae, Elmidae, Histeridae, Hydrophilidae, Haliplidae, and Noteridae (Coleoptera) was compiled and updated."
Enhancing sustainability of polypropylene band and bamboo-reinforced structural elements for rural low cost housing,"In search of sustainable development this study gives the vision of evolutionary growth in construction industry. As said by Buckminster Fuller “You never change things by fighting the reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete. “The dream of having a house is a challenging task for low and moderate-income earners in developing countries. Low-cost housing techniques can be adapted to achieve an environmentally friendly and innovative construction to overcome the problem. The materials like Bamboo and Polypropylene band (PP) have been considered as sustainable building materials for the replacement of steel in this present research. Bamboo is a construction material that has been used for a long period for rural housing techniques. Many researchers have determined that bamboo has high tensile strength properties and is also easily available. It is possible to lower the cost of the construction by using bamboo as the main reinforcement. Polypropylene (PP) band, which is rarely used as a building material in India which is strong has heat resistance, and is lighter in weight. The main objective of this study includes that, strength parameters such as flexural strength, compressive strength of the reinforced concrete beam can be achieved by using bamboo as the main reinforcement and Polypropylene band as vertical stirrup that can reduce the cost by 85% and also helps to achieve lightweight structure. The establishment of stable analytical model proves to be cost effective by reducing the number of test specimens for experimental work. This research targets to compare experimental investigations with FEA approach. The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is carried out using ABAQUS for model geometry to observe experimental study. MATLAB application has been used to validate the structural behaviour through parametric studies like shear force and bending moment diagram using 3-point loading beam."
The antennal transcriptome of Triatoma infestans reveals substantial expression changes triggered by a blood meal,"Triatoma infestans is the main vector of Chagas disease in the Americas, currently transmitting it in Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. Many T. infestans populations present insecticide resistance, reducing the efficiency of control campaigns. Alternative vector control methods are needed, and molecular targets mediating fundamental physiological processes can be a promising option to manipulate kissing bug behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to characterize the main sensory targets, as well as to determine whether they are modulated by physiological factors. In order to identify gene candidates potentially mediating host cue detection, the antennal transcripts of T. infestans fifth instar larvae were sequenced and assembled. Besides, we evaluated whether a blood meal had an effect on transcriptional profiles, as responsiveness to host-emitted sensory cues depends on bug starvation."
Optogenetic rejuvenation of mitochondrial membrane potential extends C. elegans lifespan,"Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in aging but the exact biological causes are still being determined. Here, we show that optogenetically increasing mitochondrial membrane potential during adulthood using a light-activated proton pump improves age-associated phenotypes and extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our findings provide direct causal evidence that rescuing the age-related decline in mitochondrial membrane potential is sufficient to slow the rate of aging and extend healthspan and lifespan."
Dynamic visualization of high-dimensional data,"Dimensionality reduction (DR) is commonly used to project high-dimensional data into lower dimensions for visualization, which could then generate new insights and hypotheses. However, DR algorithms introduce distortions in the visualization and cannot faithfully represent all relations in the data. Thus, there is a need for methods to assess the reliability of DR visualizations. Here we present DynamicViz, a framework for generating dynamic visualizations that capture the sensitivity of DR visualizations to perturbations in the data resulting from bootstrap sampling. DynamicViz can be applied to all commonly used DR methods. We show the utility of dynamic visualizations in diagnosing common interpretative pitfalls of static visualizations and extending existing single-cell analyses. We introduce the variance score to quantify the dynamic variability of observations in these visualizations. The variance score characterizes natural variability in the data and can be used to optimize DR algorithm implementations."

"Quotas, disclosure, and a rule called Rooney: diversity and the NFL as a corporation","In recent regulatory memory, we have seen several tools proposed to enhance boardroom diversity. Scholars situate these tools on a spectrum between “hard” and “soft,” with quotas at the former end and disclosure at the latter end. In 2003, the Rooney Rule, an NFL policy, entered the scene. The Rule mandates that when a head coach vacancy arises, teams must interview at least two racialized candidates. Can the Rule fill the space between quotas and disclosure on the regulatory spectrum? In proposing a response, I draw on and compare corporate legal, sociological, and critical race theory and commentary. I evaluate the Rule as a “third way” to diversify hiring practices by conducting a literature review and analysis. My research seeks to determine the most useful approaches to examining how the Rule has redefined hiring within the NFL and whether the Rule can be applied to Silicon Valley."

Comprehensive Control Strategy and Verification for PEM Fuel Cell/Battery/Supercapacitor Hybrid Power Source,"Using renewable energy is becoming a new tendency for vehicular applications to reduce fossil fuel consumption and minimize greenhouse gas emissions. Well-known as an eco-friendly energy source, the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is extensively used in hybrid power systems to achieve the objective of zero-emission and air protection. However, this type of fuel cell offers slow dynamics and cannot adapt to abrupt load variations when used as a primary energy source. To overcome this shortcoming, battery (BAT) and/or supercapacitor (SC) are supplemented as auxiliary sources. In this paper, an innovative energy management strategy (EMS) for a PEMFC/BAT/SC hybrid power source (HPS) is proposed to improve the accuracy of power distribution from energy sources to the load. In detail, according to different characteristics of energy sources, a frequency decoupling (FD) method is designed to determine the required currents for PEMFC, BAT, and SC based on the load power demand. Besides, an adaptive DC bus control loop is utilized to guarantee a stable DC output voltage by using the BAT. The proposed EMS is simulated in a MATLAB/Simulink environment and experimentally implemented with a real-time DSP TMS320F28379D controller board. Subsequently, a test bench of a 200 W PEMFC, 24 V–12 Ah battery, and 25 V–60 F supercapacitor is conducted for experimental validation. The obtained results show that the proposed EMS is effective to coordinate energy flows between the three used sources and enhance the fuel cell performance in a hybrid power system."
m6A regulator-mediated methylation modification patterns and immune microenvironment infiltration characterization in osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disease in orthopedics. RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) exerts an essential effect in a variety of biological processes in the eukaryotes. In this study, we determined the effect of m6A regulators in the OA along with performing the subtype classification. Differential analysis of OA and normal samples in the database of Gene Expression Omnibus identified 9 significantly differentially expressed m6A regulators. These regulators were monitored by a random forest algorithm so as to evaluate the risk of developing OA disease. On the basis of these 9 moderators, a nomogram was established. The results of decision curve analysis suggested that the patients could benefit from a nomogram model. The OA sample was classified as 2 m6A models through a consensus clustering algorithm in accordance with these 9 regulators. These 2 m6A patterns were then assessed with principal component analysis. We also determined the m6A scores for the 2 m6A patterns and their correlation with immune infiltration. The results indicated that type A had a higher m6A score than type B. Thus, we suggest that the m6A pattern may provide a new approach for diagnose and provide novel ideas for molecular targeted therapy of OA."
An Amorphous Anode for Proton Battery,"Developing advanced electrode materials is crucial for improving the electrochemical performances of proton batteries. Currently, the anodes are primarily crystalline materials which suffer from inferior cyclic stability and high electrode potential. Herein, we propose amorphous electrode materials for proton batteries by using a general ion-exchange protocol to introduce multivalent metal cations for activating the host material. Taking Al3+ as an example, theoretical and experimental analysis demonstrates electrostatic interaction between metal cations and lattice oxygen, which is the primary barrier for direct introduction of the multivalent cations, is effectively weakened through ion exchange between Al3+ and pre-intercalated K+. The as-prepared Al-MoOx anode therefore delivered a remarkable capacity and outstanding cycling stability that outperforms most of the state-of-the-art counterparts. The assembled full cell also achieved a high voltage of 1.37 V. This work opens up new opportunities for developing high-performance electrodes of proton batteries by introducing amorphous materials."

What is the agreement between intraoperative fluoroscopy and postoperative radiographs in Bernese periacetabular osteotomy?,"It is important to reorient the acetabular fragment into an optimal position and version to ensure a good long-term outcome after Bernese periacetabular osteotomy (PAO). Unfortunately, the intraoperative balance between overcorrection and undercorrection remains challenging for the surgeon. The purpose of this study was to answer two questions: (1) Does the femoral head coverage measured on intraoperative fluoroscopy agree with that measured on postoperative radiography? (2) What is the reliability of intraoperative fluoroscopy in identifying hip center correction in PAO?"
Exploring the Role of Religious Ideology in English Language Teachers’ Identity Construction: A Community of Practice Perspective,"This study drew on a community of practice (CoP) perspective and examined the role of religious ideology in 10 Iranian English language teachers’ identity construction. The study was situated within a narrative inquiry methodology. Data were collected from semi-structured interviews and narrative frames to capture how Islamic principles contribute to the teachers’ professional practice and identity construction. Our findings revealed that religious ideology shaped the teachers’ identity construction across teaching materials, institutional relationships, and tensions between the normative and personalized ideologies of the teachers. We show how religious ideology, as extended to the context of the school CoP, functions as a source of tensions for the teachers by promoting materials that clash with their internal feelings and creates detachment in their institutional relationships. Moreover, the religious ideology served as a source of marginalization, detachment from the dominant religious principles, and attachment to personal values as practical alternatives facilitating teachers’ membership. We further provide implications for running professional development courses that enhance teachers’ awareness of the role of religious ideology in their professional practice."

Accurate trajectory tracking control with adaptive neural networks for omnidirectional mobile robots subject to unmodeled dynamics,"Omnidirectional mobile robots have gained a lot of attention in recent years due to their maneuverability capabilities. However, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking with this class of robots is still challenging control system designers. In this work, a novel intelligent controller is introduced for accurate trajectory tracking of omnidirectional robots subject to unstructured uncertainties. An adaptive neural network is adopted within a Lyapunov-based nonlinear control scheme to deal with frictional forces and other unmodeled dynamics or external disturbances that may occur. Online learning, rather than supervised offline training, is employed to allow the robot to learn on its own how to compensate for uncertainties and disturbances by interacting with the environment. The adoption of a combined error signal as the single input in the neural network significantly reduces the computational complexity of the disturbance compensation scheme and enables the resulting intelligent controller to be implemented in the embedded hardware of mobile robots. The boundedness and convergence properties of the proposed control scheme are proved by means of a Lyapunov-like stability analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed intelligent controller is numerically evaluated and experimentally validated using an omnidirectional mobile robot. The comparative analyses of the obtained results show that the adoption of an intelligent compensation scheme based on adaptive neural networks allows reductions of more than \(95\%\) in the tracking error, thus guaranteeing an accurate tracking and confirming the great superiority of the proposed control strategy."

On Antipodes of Immaculate Functions,"The immaculate basis of the Hopf algebra \(\textsf {NSym}\) of noncommutative symmetric functions is a Schur-like basis of \(\textsf {NSym}\) that has been applied in many areas in the field of algebraic combinatorics. The problem of determining a cancellation-free formula for the antipode of \(\textsf {NSym}\) evaluated at an arbitrary immaculate function \( {\mathfrak {S}}_{\alpha } \) remains open, letting \(\alpha \) denote an integer composition. However, for the cases whereby we let \(\alpha \) be a hook or consist of at most two rows, Benedetti and Sagan (J Combin Theory Ser A 148:275–315, 2017) have determined cancellation-free formulas for expanding \(S({\mathfrak {S}}_{\alpha })\) in the \({\mathfrak {S}}\)-basis. According to a Jacobi–Trudi-like formula for expanding immaculate functions in the ribbon basis that we had previously proved bijectively (Discrete Math 340(7):1716–1726, 2017), by applying the antipode S of \(\textsf {NSym}\) to both sides of this formula, we obtain a cancellation-free formula for expressing \(S({\mathfrak {S}}_{(m^{n})})\) in the R-basis, for an arbitrary rectangle \((m^{n})\). We explore the idea of using this R-expansion, together with sign-reversing involutions, to determine combinatorial interpretations of the \({\mathfrak {S}}\)-coefficients of antipodes of rectangular immaculate functions. We then determine cancellation-free formulas for antipodes of immaculate functions much more generally, using a Jacobi–Trudi-like formula recently introduced by Allen and Mason that generalizes Campbell’s formulas for expanding \({\mathfrak {S}}\)-elements into the R-basis, and we further explore how new families of composition tableaux may be used to obtain combinatorial interpretations for expanding \(S({\mathfrak {S}}_{\alpha })\) into the \({\mathfrak {S}}\)-basis."
Lifespan estimates for critical semilinear wave equations and scale invariant damped wave equations in exterior domain in high dimensions,"In this paper, we consider semilinear wave equations with critical power and scale invariant damping term \(2(1+t)^{-1}u_{t}\) in exterior domain in high dimensions (\(n\ge 3\)). Upper bound lifespan estimates of solution are established by employing test function method. The novelty is that we show the asymptotic behavior of the test function by using maximum principle. Comparing with the method utilized in Sobajima (J Math Anal Appl 484:123667, 2019), we avoid using the modified Bessel functions to construct the test function. It is worth to mention that the method employed in this paper is also different from the one in Lai (Nonlinear Anal 125: 550–560, 2015) and Lai (Nonlinear Anal. 143: 89–104, 2016)."
Note on the lifespan estimate of solutions for non-gauge invariant semilinear massless semirelativistic equations with some scaling critical nonlinearity,"In this manuscript, in the \(L^1\) scaling critical case, a lifespan estimate of solutions to the Cauchy problem for non-gauge invariant semilinear semirelativistic equations is considered. The lifespan estimate is given by the modified test function method with a fractional Laplace operator. The main obstacle to obtaining the lifespan estimate is the non-locality of the fractional Laplace operator. To treat the non-locality, special test functions are introduced."
Thermal performance of indirect solar dryer and drying kinetics of guava without and with thermal energy storage,"In the present study, an indirect solar dryer (ISD) was analyzed without thermal energy storage (TES) device (case-1) and with a TES device (case-2) during drying guava slices to appraise the quality of the dryer. The average drying efficiency was 5.41% and 9.29% in case-1 and case-2, respectively, with an improvement of 71.4% in case-2. A 42.86% decrement in specific energy consumption and a 75.02% increment in specific moisture extraction rate were observed in case-2 due to the TES device than case-1. The drying time was saved by 9 h in case-2. The average drying rate was 0.3062 and 0.3392 kg/h in cases-1 and 2, respectively, with an improvement of 10.77% in case-2. The average effective diffusion, mass and heat transfer coefficients were 7.75 × 10−9 and 7.58 × 10−9 m2/s, 0.0040 and 0.0039 m/s, 4.645 and 4.503 W/m2K, for cases-1 and 2, respectively. The activation energy was calculated as 136.98 and 130.72 kJ/mol in cases-1 and 2, respectively. Case-2 performed well with better drying efficiency and drying was completed within a day, whereas case-1 took two days. The TES device installed in case-2 improved the thermal and performance parameters of ISD."
On the firefighter problem with spreading vaccination for maximizing the number of saved nodes: the IP model and LP rounding algorithms,"When an infectious disease spreads, how to quickly vaccinate with a limited budget per time step to reduce the impact of the virus is very important. Specifically, vaccination will be carried out in every time step, and vaccinated nodes will no longer be infected. Meanwhile, the protection from vaccination can spread to the neighbors of a vaccinated node. Our goal is to efficiently find optimal and approximation solutions to our problem with various algorithms. In this paper, we first design an integer linear program to solve this problem. We then propose approximation algorithms of (1) Linear programming (LP) deterministic threshold rounding, (2) LP dependent randomized rounding, and (3) LP independent randomized rounding. We prove that the LP independent randomized rounding algorithm has a high probability of finding a feasible solution that gives an approximation ratio of \((1-\delta )\), where a small constant \(\delta \) between 0 and 1 reduces the lower bound on the feasibility probability. We also provide experimental results for three different rounding algorithms to show that they perform numerically well in terms of approximation ratios. These analytical and numerical studies allow each individual to adopt the most appropriate approximation algorithm to efficiently resolve the vaccination problem when her reliance on commercial optimization solvers is costly."
"Analysis of Temperature Data Using the Innovative Trend Pivot Analysis Method and Trend Polygon Star Concept: A Case Study of Soan River Basin, Potohar, Pakistan","The trend analysis approach is used to estimate changing climate and its impact on the environment, agriculture and water resources. Innovative polygonal trend analyses are qualitative methods applied to detect changes in the environment. In this study, the Innovative Trend Pivot Analysis Method (ITPAM) and Trend Polygon Star Concept Method were applied for temperature trend detection in Soan River Basin (SRB), Potohar region, Pakistan. The average monthly temperature data (1995–2020) for 11 stations were used to create polygon graphics. Trend length and slope were calculated separately for arithmetic mean and standard deviation. The innovative methods produced useful scientific information, with the identification of monthly shifts and trend behaviors of temperature data at different stations. Some stations showed an increasing trend and others showed decreasing behavior. This increasing and decreasing variability is the result of climate change. The winter season temperature is increasing, and the months of December to February are getting warmer. Summer is expanding and pushing autumn towards winter, swallowing the early period of the cold season. The monthly polygonal trends with risk graphs depicted a clear picture of climate change in the Potohar region of Pakistan. The phenomena of observed average temperature changes, indicated by both qualitative methods, are interesting and have the potential to aid water managers’ understanding of the cropping system of the Potohar region."
Thermal arrest analysis of the reverse martensitic transformation in a Ni55Fe19Ga26 Heusler alloy obtained by melt-spinning,"Ni55Fe19Ga26 ribbons obtained by melt-spinning technique exhibit a martensitic transformation from L21 cubic austenite phase to 14 M martensite phase above room temperature. We have taken advantage of the existence of thermal hysteresis of the martensitic phase transition (~ 11 K) to analyze the effect of isothermal treatments on the reverse martensitic transformation, which has been analyzed by means of interrupted heating using differential scanning calorimetry. The experimental findings clearly indicate a time-depending effect in the martensitic transformation at temperatures between the austenite start and finish temperatures. Moreover, it has been observed that two successive martensitic transformations take place after the isothermal arrest was performed."
"Assessment of environmental gamma dose in air in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam","Measurement of environmental gamma dose in air in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam has been conducted at 2245 locations using a portable dosimeter installed on a motobike with GPS integrated and positioned 1 m above the ground surface. Cumulative gamma dose rates have also been measured using the TLD dosimeters located at 20 fixed locations around the city to evaluate the total component and the contribution of cosmic rays in the rainy and dry seasons. The gamma dose rates in the city were found in the range of 0.05–0.18 μSv/h with the average value of 0.10 μSv/h. The cumulative gamma dose in the dry season is greater than that in the rainy season by about 15%."

Porous space — biomimetic of tafoni in computational design,"Porous urban spaces not only improve interactions, but also increase natural ventilation. Weathered rocks are where porous spaces exist in nature. This paper investigates the biomimicry of tafoni, a type of weathered rock that contains pores of varying sizes. The formation of tafoni inspires architectural design, but its complex shape makes manual modeling challenging. The objective of studying the biomimetics of tafoni is to apply its benefits to design applications. Using biomimetic techniques, computation algorithms for tafoni morphogenesis are developed. This paper investigates the inherent characteristics of tafoni and reclassifies them based on architectural geometric elements. It then describes the reclassified tafoni and explains the formation process. This paper develops a 3D evolutionary algorithm and a 2.5D descriptive algorithm based on diagrams. After a comparison, the 2.5D algorithm is chosen because it is more controllable and operable for computational design. This paper also conducts experiments on the results obtained by the 2.5D algorithm to demonstrate its adaptability and architectural design application potential, as well as its application schemes in various design disciplines, including urban planning, architectural design, and landscape design. This paper proposes an algorithm that can be utilized in various fields of computational design. It is computationally efficient while retaining its biological form."
Seismic waves of the 10 December 2020 M6.6 Yilan earthquake observed by interferometric fiber-optic gyroscope,"A newly developed cost-effective fiber-optic gyroscope (FOG) and an existing seismometer co-locating at the campus of National Central University (NCU) recorded seismic waves of a M6.6 Yilan earthquake and aftershock events occurring at around 24.74° N 122.03° E (88 km away from NCU) during 10–11 December 2020. Two nearest accessible broadband seismographs located in Hsinchu have also been employed as measurement references for facilitating the analysis of the detected seismic signals. Conventional seismometers usually detect the translational components of the seismic waves, while the FOG observes the rotational component. The recorded FOG data exhibit high-resolution details of the rotational component of shockwaves, which provides additional information of seismic waves. The shock waveforms of the translational and rotational components, analyzed under the conservation of the shock wave energy density received by FOG and seismograph, are found to be significantly correlated. The correlation coefficients of 60-s data are > 0.85 for the main shock and > 0.86 for the aftershock, while those of the 10-s peak periods are as high as 0.9064 and 0.8953, respectively. The highly correlated data imply that the energy registered by the two devices are equivalent. The optical interference-based rotation senor of the cost-effective FOG provides a high sensitivity of better than 3.6 deg/h and an extended dynamic sensing range as high as 55 dB with the fully sensing ability from \(\pm\) 3.6 deg/h to \(\pm\) 720,000 deg/h. The FOG seismometer sheds some light on building an earthquake six-degree-of-freedom observation array to have a bettering on the understanding of the seismicity."

We aimed to assess the association of CT-defined neurological complications with functional outcomes of critically ill IE patients."
Modelling Response of Soil Stabilized Low Volume Roads by Mechanistic-Empirical Approach,"This paper presents a semi-analytical approach to assess the structural responses of low-volume roads using StabilRoad stabilizer and its application with cement for low-volume roads. A finite-element response model is developed using ABAQUS to catechize the suitability of this stabilizer on the base and subgrade layer of low-volume flexible pavement sections. Aspects related to strength characteristics, rutting deformation, microscopic behaviour are analyzed. Vertical subgrade stress and surface deflections are considerably reduced with the inclusion of StabilRoad stabilized base. More importantly, this mechanistic-empirical approach clearly demonstrates the potentiality of this stabilizer to be effectively applied in unbound layers of such pavement systems. As of the increase in the intensity of C–S–H peaks, the strength properties of the cement-modified soil mixture are improved with the incorporation of this stabilizer. Considerable reduction in the thickness of the pavement was observed with the introduction of the stabilized base by offsetting to the tune of about 40–50% to that of conventional pavement and thereby saving the overall cost of pavement."

Hydrogen sulfide attenuates lung injury instigated by Bisphenol-A via suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress,"The xenoestrogen bisphenol A (BPA), a commonly used industrial chemical, has been linked to endocrine disruption. The point of the study was to consider the effects of chronic BPA exposure on the respiratory system of adult female rats, and the potential mitigating benefits of Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a donor of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) administration. Detect biomarkers in Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), including total protein content, Total cell counts, Neutrophils %, ICAM (intercellular adhesion molecule)-1 and TGF-β (Transforming growth factor beta). NaHS significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-β and MCAF,) also reduce (i.e. VCAM-1, VEGF, VIM, MMP-2, MMP-9), and reduced malondialdehyde and augmented activities of SOD and GSH-PX. Notably, H2S induced a marked decrease in the expression levels of p-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (p-ERK), p–c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), and p-p38, H2S inhibits BPA-induced inflammation and injury in alveolar epithelial cells. These results suggest NaHS may prevent inflammation via the suppression of the ERK/JNK/ p-p38MAPK signaling pathway, Subsequent inhibition of inflammation, epithelial cell injury, and apoptosis may be providing insight into potential avenues for the treatment of lung injury."
"Prescribing pattern of anti-hypertensive medications among hypertensive outpatients at selected hospitals of South Gondar Zone, Amhara, Ethiopia: a hospital based cross sectional study","Irrational prescription has a lion share for uncontrolled blood pressure.

Therefore, the objective of the current study was to evaluate prescription patterns for hypertension and blood pressure (BP) control at randomly selected hospitals of South Gondar Zone."
"On Questions Posed by Shemetkov, Ballester-Bolinches,     and Perez-Ramos in Finite Group Theory","A chief factor \(H/K\) of a group \(G\) is said to be \(\mathfrak{F}\)-central if \((H/K)\rtimes (G/C_G(H/K))\in\mathfrak{F}\).  In 1997, Shemetkov posed the problem of describing finite group formations \(\mathfrak{F}\) such that \(\mathfrak{F}\) coincides with the class of groups for which all chief factors are \(\mathfrak{F}\)-central.  We refer to such formations as centrally saturated.  We prove that the centrally saturated formations form  a complete distributive lattice.  As an answer to a question posed by Ballester-Bolinches and Perez-Ramos, conditions for a centrally saturated formation to be saturated and solvably saturated in the class of all groups are found.  As a consequence, a criterion for hereditary Fitting formations  to be solvably saturated is obtained."

Career counselling for adults with newly acquired mobility disability,"Mobility disabilities are common in Canada and impact over two million Canadians. As such, there is a need for career counsellors to better understand and address the challenges. This literature review article outlines various challenges that this population encounters, including adapting to mobility disabilities, requiring accommodations, facing financial needs, and experiencing loss. It also examines the interplay between the personal and career development needs of individuals with a mobility disability (i.e., people who are unable to engage in job-related activities due to mobility issues). Interventions from Super’s life-span theory and Cochran’s narrative career counselling theory will be discussed in relation to supporting individuals with mobility disabilities across their career challenges. The article concludes with pertinent considerations for career counsellors, raising awareness on unique issues like accommodation needs, misconceptions, and discrimination when working with this population."
All for striving status: how and when do overqualified employees engage in OCB towards individual,"The issue of how overqualified employees engage in organizational citizenship behavior towards individual (OCBI) is gaining traction. Existing literatures have mostly explored the relationship between perceived overqualification and OCBI from cognitive and affective perspectives, ignoring the motivational perspective. However, motivation, as an importance mechanism, has a great impact on overqualified employees’ OCBI. Based on status-striving motivation, we focus on the positive aspect of perceived overqualification and investigates the mechanism of perceived overqualification on OCBI. Two studies, a scenario study (N = 110) and a time-lagged field study (N = 249), are used to test our hypotheses. Study 1 and 2 show that perceived overqualification positively affects OCBI through status-striving motivation. In addition, Study 2 finds that ambition not only moderates the direct relationship between perceived overqualification and status-striving motivation, but also the indirect effect of perceived overqualification on OCBI via status-striving motivation. However, the moderating role of task interdependence is not supported. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings."
Efficient and interpretable SRU combined with TabNet for network intrusion detection in the big data environment,"While digital application infrastructure services are becoming increasingly abundant and the scale of the network continues to expand, many new network vulnerabilities and attacks (such as DoS, Botnet, and MITM) have emerged in an endless stream. The timely and accurate detection of network anomalies is of extraordinary importance for the stability of the network. Previous works designed based on deep learning have faced difficulties in their adoption in practice due to the lack of interpretability. Recently, Recurrent Neural Networks perform a superior ability to analyze high-dimensional complex network flow. However, these methods have the problems of limited parallelizability and time-consuming training, so they cannot meet the particular requirements of intrusion detection. To solve the above issues, we propose an efficient and interpretable intrusion detection scheme based on simple recurrent networks (Tab-AttSRU) to identify abnormal network traffic patterns accurately. Concretely, to obtain high-quality interpretation, we utilize model-specific feature importance and a learnable mask of TabNet for soft selection. The sequential attention mechanism is used to select the decision-making features for necessary interpretability. To realize efficient parallel computing, we combine SRU with attention mechanism to capture latent connections between traffic at different times and implement it on Spark. The performance of proposed method is assessed on the benchmark UNSW-NB15 and a real-world dataset UKM-IDS20. Experimental results have demonstrated the efficiency and interpretability of proposed method."
The performance assessment framework (PPAFR) for RPA implementation in a loan application process using process mining,"When a company decides to automate its business processes by means of RPA (Robotic Process Automation), there are two fundamental questions that need to be answered. Firstly, what activities should the company automate and what characteristics make them suitable for RPA. The aim of the presented research is to design and demonstrate a data-driven performance framework assessing the impact of RPA implementation using process mining (PPAFR). Firstly, we comment on and summarise existing trends in process mining and RPA. Secondly, we describe research objectives and methods following the Design Science Research Methodology. Then, we identify critical factors for RPA implementation and design process stages of PPAFR. We demonstrate the design on real data from a loan application process. The demonstration consists of a process discovery using process mining methods, process analysis, and process simulation with assessment of RPA candidates. Based on the research results, a redesign of the process is proposed with emphasis on RPA implementation. Finally, we discuss the usefulness of PPAFR by helping companies to identify potentially suitable activities for RPA implementation and not overestimating potential gains. Obtained results show that within the loan application process, waiting times are the main causes of extended cases. If the waiting times are generated internally, it will be much easier for the company to address them. If the automation is focused mainly on processing times, the impact of automation on the overall performance of the process is insignificant or very low. Moreover, the research identified several characteristics which have to be considered when implementing RPA due to the impact on the overall performance of the process."
Integrated Management of Grape Gray Mold Disease Agent Botrytis cinerea in Vitro and Post-harvest,"Gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea is one of the most important diseases of fresh grapes in the field and during the post-harvest period. To control this disease, many fungicides are used. One of the sustainable solutions to replace chemical fungicides is using Trichoderma mycoparasite, medicinal plant essential oils, and new chemical fungicides. In the B. cinerea pathogenesis test, most of them showed the ability to cause disease, and among them the A91 isolate showed the highest pathogenicity. In a cross-culture experiment, most isolates of Trichoderma grew on the A91 isolate colony, and among them, the T39 isolate with 72.47% inhibition showed the highest inhibitory power. Regarding the effect of volatile metabolites, the maximum inhibition rate by the G2 isolate of the T. harzianum antagonist was 42.62%. Nordox fungicide showed the highest inhibition in vitro, with 95.99% inhibition of the pathogen. In the test of the effect of medicinal plant essential oils, the highest inhibition amount of 96.22% was seen for the essential oil of Trachyspermum with a concentration of 1000 mg/L. In cold storage conditions (5 °C), without wounding and wound formation, the highest inhibition of pathogenic fungal growth was achieved with 93.5% and 85%, respectively, by the combined treatment of Trichoderma and potassium phosphide. At a temperature of 20 °C, this compound showed the highest inhibition of B. cinerea A91 mycelium growth. This study showed that essential oils of medicinal plants and the combined application of Trichoderma and chemical fungicides could be the best way to control gray mold."

Till now, seldom has the administration of preoperative CHO been investigated in diabetic patients and there are limited studies reporting IR and postoperative recovery of diabetic patients undergoing cardiac surgery."
Green Synthesis of Nano-Zero-Valent Copper for the D-Blue 60 Textile Dye Removal from Aqueous Medium,"Green synthesis of zero-valent copper nanoparticles successfully performed using Ficus benjamina leaves. The novel adsorbent Ficus nano-zero-valent copper (FB-nZVCu) characterized by utilizing scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The size of these nanoparticles typically ranges from 16 to 18 nm. This adsorbent investigated for removal of D-blue 60 from textile wastewater. The impact of different operating parameters, including pH, adsorbent dose, stirring rate, time, and initial dye concentration, had been tested, and optimum conditions were selected to gauge the optimum dye removal performance of the adsorbent. The maximum removal efficiency of D-blue 60 reached 87% under the following proper conditions: adsorbent dose 0.3 g L−1, time 30 min, and pH 8. The Langmuir isotherm was found to be the most appropriate system for the adsorption process (R2 = 0.9994) and (qmax = 30.03 mg g−1). The pseudo-second-order model defined the adsorption. From the data obtained and the fruitful discussion, it detected that the FB-nZVCu green adsorbent strongly recommended as a hopeful substance for removing D-blue 60 from both synthetic and actual waste samples."

Porous space — biomimetic of tafoni in computational design,"Porous urban spaces not only improve interactions, but also increase natural ventilation. Weathered rocks are where porous spaces exist in nature. This paper investigates the biomimicry of tafoni, a type of weathered rock that contains pores of varying sizes. The formation of tafoni inspires architectural design, but its complex shape makes manual modeling challenging.

Stockwell Transform of Quadrature Stator Current-Based Fault Assessment in Induction Machine at Different Load Condition,"Conventional sensor-based fault detection techniques lead to huge manpower, high cost and requires a greater number of sensors. To overcome these flaws, current signature-based fault estimation is proposed. This method does not require any additional current sensors and is done with existed sensors employed for motor speed control. Further, the stator current is divided into two phase currents using Parks vector approach to get better resolution. The higher order noise due to data acquisition, EMI and other sources is removed using wavelet de-noising and the resolution on current spectrum is improved using advanced spectral analysis namely Stockwell Transform (ST). All the faults faced by induction motor like bearing damage, broken rotor, and stator inter turn faults are tested at different load conditions. The severity of the fault is identified using feature parameters like RMS and Standard Deviation of stator current after proposed signal processing. A 1.5 KW, 440 V and 50 Hz induction motor is used for expermental verification of proposed fault assessment criteria."
"Removal of Crystal Violet Cationic Dye from Aqueous Solution by Adsorption onto Bentonite Clay: Experimental, DFT, NBO, and Molecular Dynamics Studies","Raw (RB) and activated (AB) bentonite clay have been used to investigate adsorption of crystal violet (CV) dye from aqueous solution. Adsorbents physicochemical properties were characterized using X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, specific surface area, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared analysis. In addition, the adsorption experiments were carried out in a series of batch equilibration studies and conducted under various conditions: initial dye concentration, contact time, solid–liquid ratio, initial pH, temperature, and agitation speed. As a result, RB and AB clays have proven a high potential removal rate of CV dye with a maximum retention, reduced contact time and solid–liquid ratio. Moreover, favorable sorption has been observed in an alkaline medium for raw clay, whereas pH has revealed non-significant impact on activated clay sorption. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model fits the adsorption process. Different mathematical isothermal models were used to examine the adsorption data, the results have shown that the process is well represented by the Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm for the raw clay and the Freundlich isotherm for the activated clay. Furthermore, thermodynamic parameters revealed that adsorption process for both sorbents was spontaneous and endothermic. The theoretical calculations according to the density functional theory (DFT), natural bond orbitals (NBO) theory and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) were used to investigate the adsorption mechanism of crystal violet dye on the bentonite clay surface."

Boosting ensembles for estimation of discharge coefficient and through flow discharge in broad-crested gabion weirs,"Gabion weirs are environment-friendly structures widely used for irrigation and drainage network purposes. These structures' hydraulic performance is fundamentally different from solid weirs' due to their porosity and the existence of a through-flow discharge. This paper investigates the reliability and suitability of a number of Machine learning models for estimation of hydraulic performance of gabion weirs.  Generally, three different Boosting ensemble models, including Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and CatBoost, are compared to the well-known Random Forest and a Stacked Regression model, with respect to their accuracy in prediction of the discharge coefficient and through-flow discharge ratio of gabion weirs in free flow conditions. The Bayesian optimization approach is used to fine-tune model hyper-parameters automatically. Recursive feature elimination analysis is also performed to find optimum combination of features for each model. Results indicate that the CatBoost model has outperformed other models in terms of estimating the through flow discharge ratio (Qin/Qt) with R2 = 0.982, while both XGBoost and CatBoost models have shown close performance in terms of estimating the discharge coefficient (Cd) with R2 of CatBoost equal to 0.994 and R2 of XGBoost equal to 0.992. Weakest results were also produced by Decision tree regressor with R2 = 0.821 and 0.865 for estimation of Cd and Qin/Qt values."
The ozonation effect on flocculation and polymer consumption reduction in the hybrid treatment of Iran Central iron ore companies' effluent: a cost–benefit study,"Iran's most important iron ore mine is located in the central region, and because of the water shortage in this area, the need to reuse the effluent from this mine is essential. On the other hand, there are no suitable conditions for treating large effluent volumes in iron mine in central Iran. For this reason, produced effluent should be reduced and returned to the consumption cycle by using appropriate technology. This study aimed to investigate the ozonation/lime effect on polymer consumption reduction and evaluate the treatment and economic efficiency compared to the currently used treatment method (coagulation-flocculation without ozonation/lime)."
"Application of ANFIS, ELM, and ANN models to assess water productivity indicators based on agronomic techniques in the Lake Urmia Basin","Water productivity (WP) is one of the most important critical indicators in the essential planning of water consumption in the agricultural sector. For this purpose, the WP and economic water productivity (WPe) were estimated using agronomic technologies. The impact of agronomic technologies on WP and WPe was carried out in two parts of field monitoring and modeling using novel intelligent approaches. Extreme learning machine (ELM), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and artificial neural network (ANN) methods were used to model WP and WPe. A dataset including 200 field data was collected from five treatment and control sections in the Malekan region, located in the southeast of Lake Urmia, Iran, for the crop year 2020–2021. Six different input combinations were introduced to estimate WP and WPe. The models used were evaluated using mean squared error (RMSE), relative mean squared error (RRMSE), and efficiency measures (NSE). Field monitoring results showed that in the treatment fields, with the application of agronomic technologies, the crop yield, WP, and WPe increased by 17.9%, 30.1%, and 19.9%, respectively. The results explained that irrigation water in farms W1, W2, W3, W4, and W5 decreased by 23.9%, 21.3%, 29.5%, 16.5%, and 2.7%, respectively. The modeling results indicated that the ANFIS model with values of RMSE = 0.016, RRMSE = 0.018, and NSE = 0.960 performed better in estimating WP and WPe than ANN and ELM models. The results confirmed that the crop variety, fertilizer, and irrigation plot dimensions are the most critical influencing parameters in improving WP and WPe."

To obtain the optimum conditions of RR-141 removal using the BBD model, the main factors such as the initial RR-141 level (10–70 mg/L), pH (3–9), contact time (10–70 min), and γ-Al2O3 NPs dose (0.2–0.8 g/L) were tested. According to the quadratic model, the highest removal rate (97.74%) was found at the pH of 4.81, the contact time of 51.61 min, the γ-Al2O3 NPs dose of 0.38 g/L, and the RR-141 level of 10 mg/L. The RR-141 removal follows the pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models. The highest absorption capacity for RR-141 was 40.65 mg/g. The results of this study showed that γ-Al2O3 NPs significantly removed RR-141 from aqueous solution."
Electrical properties of hematite and pure sand synthetic homogeneous mixture,"Substances' electrical properties react promptly to minor alterations in the specimens (texture). This electrical characteristics response depends on pH and, hence, on the surface charge. In this article, we attempt to keep the synthetic specimens homogeneous. Sand and pure hematite is smashed independently and aggregated (hematite were collected from Eastern Desert, Cairo, Egypt). Electrical parameters were examined at frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 105 Hz (dry, 21 °C). The electrical range of the measured data varies considerably depending on the frequency spectrum, specimens' concentration, constitution, and/or arrangement of the components (texture). There are two conduction areas relying on frequency-dependent conductivity (two slopes). Dielectric permittivity increases linearly with concentration. Dielectric permittivity is rapidly decreasing as the spectrum expands. Jonscher's law is applicable to all electrical characteristics. The hematite conductor concentration changes in the synthetic specimens and accordingly the texture of the specimens. The study of these electrical characteristics may assist in the modeling and simulation of rock electrical properties. The relationships between the ore's nature, mineral compositions, and electrical properties are valuable for exploration methods."
Closed-loop optimal and automatic tuning of pulse amplitude and width in EMG-guided controllable transcranial magnetic stimulation,"This paper proposes an efficient algorithm for automatic and optimal tuning of pulse amplitude and width for sequential parameter estimation (SPE) of the neural membrane time constant and input–output (IO) curve parameters in closed-loop electromyography-guided (EMG-guided) controllable transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTMS). The proposed SPE is performed by administering a train of optimally tuned TMS pulses and updating the estimations until a stopping rule is satisfied or the maximum number of pulses is reached. The pulse amplitude is computed by the Fisher information maximization. The pulse width is chosen by maximizing a normalized depolarization factor, which is defined to separate the optimization and tuning of the pulse amplitude and width. The normalized depolarization factor maximization identifies the critical pulse width, which is an important parameter in the identifiability analysis, without any prior neurophysiological or anatomical knowledge of the neural membrane. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through simulation. The results confirm satisfactory estimation of the membrane time constant and IO curve parameters for the simulation case. By defining the stopping rule based on the satisfaction of the convergence criterion with tolerance of 0.01 for 5 consecutive times for all parameters, the IO curve parameters are estimated with 52 TMS pulses, with absolute relative estimation errors (AREs) of less than 7%. The membrane time constant is estimated with 0.67% ARE, and the pulse width value tends to the critical pulse width with 0.16% ARE with 52 TMS pulses. The results confirm that the pulse width and amplitude can be tuned optimally and automatically to estimate the membrane time constant and IO curve parameters in real-time with closed-loop EMG-guided cTMS."
"Study on the Geological Environmental Disturbance and Reclamation Technology of Underground Coalmines: A Case Study, Xinjiang, China","In order to scientifically evaluate the disturbance level of geological environment caused by coal mining in northwest China, and to formulate the corresponding restoration plan of the broken ecological environment, an underground coalmine in the Xinjiang province, the most northwestern province in China, was selected as the researching object of this paper. Firstly, surface subsidence and aquifer destruction were selected as two typical indexes to evaluate the environmental disturbance level of the target underground coalmine, based on the result of a thorough field investigation. After that, a COMSOL numerical model and a theoretical calculating model were established respectively according to the geological condition of the target mine, to evaluate the surface subsidence and aquifer destruction in the early stage (5 years), medium stage (10 years) and long-term stage (20 years) of the full life cycle of the target coalmine. Finally, corresponding land reclamation technologies including collapse backfill, land levelling and vegetation recovery, and follow-up monitoring measures consist of periodic-offline manual observation and continuous-online sensor observation, were put forward in terms of the different disturbance level of the mine environment within different mining stages. The conclusions of this paper can provide a reference for mine environment control and land reclamation in the ecologically fragile areas of Northwest China."
The influences of the Arctic oscillation on the frequency of winter extreme cold days in Yunnan of China,"The investigation was concerning the spatiotemporal variation in the frequency of winter extreme cold days (WECDs) in Yunnan, and its results present the spatially consistent anomalies reflected by the first mode of empirical orthogonal function (EOF1), which explains ~ 55.4% of the total variances. The EOF1 is closely related to the Arctic oscillation (AO), the correlation coefficient between them is 0.45. When the AO is in the positive phase in winter, the favorable conditions of dynamic and water vapor lead to more precipitation in Yunnan, and the more total cloud cover reduces the shortwave radiation received by the ground. Both of them lead to lower winter temperatures in Yunnan, resulting in more WECDs. Through the diagnosis of temperature advection anomaly associated with AO, it was found that the effect of the advection process caused by AO is less than that of the non-adiabatic process caused by AO."
On partial information retrieval: the unconstrained 100 prisoner problem,"We consider a generalization of the classical 100 prisoner problem and its variant, involving empty boxes, whereby winning probabilities for a team depend on the number of attempts, as well as on the number of winners. We call this the unconstrained 100 prisoner problem. After introducing the 3 main classes of strategies, we define a variety of ‘hybrid’ strategies and quantify their winning-efficiency. Whenever analytic results are not available, we make use of Monte Carlo simulations to estimate with high accuracy the winning probabilities. Based on the results obtained, we conjecture that all strategies, except for the strategy maximizing the winning probability of the classical (constrained) problem, converge to the random strategy under weak conditions on the number of players or empty boxes. We conclude by commenting on the possible applications of our results in understanding processes of information retrieval, such as “memory” in living organisms."
The performance assessment framework (PPAFR) for RPA implementation in a loan application process using process mining,"When a company decides to automate its business processes by means of RPA (Robotic Process Automation), there are two fundamental questions that need to be answered. Firstly, what activities should the company automate and what characteristics make them suitable for RPA. The aim of the presented research is to design and demonstrate a data-driven performance framework assessing the impact of RPA implementation using process mining (PPAFR). Firstly, we comment on and summarise existing trends in process mining and RPA. Secondly, we describe research objectives and methods following the Design Science Research Methodology. Then, we identify critical factors for RPA implementation and design process stages of PPAFR. We demonstrate the design on real data from a loan application process. The demonstration consists of a process discovery using process mining methods, process analysis, and process simulation with assessment of RPA candidates. Based on the research results, a redesign of the process is proposed with emphasis on RPA implementation. Finally, we discuss the usefulness of PPAFR by helping companies to identify potentially suitable activities for RPA implementation and not overestimating potential gains. Obtained results show that within the loan application process, waiting times are the main causes of extended cases. If the waiting times are generated internally, it will be much easier for the company to address them. If the automation is focused mainly on processing times, the impact of automation on the overall performance of the process is insignificant or very low. Moreover, the research identified several characteristics which have to be considered when implementing RPA due to the impact on the overall performance of the process."
Efficient and interpretable SRU combined with TabNet for network intrusion detection in the big data environment,"While digital application infrastructure services are becoming increasingly abundant and the scale of the network continues to expand, many new network vulnerabilities and attacks (such as DoS, Botnet, and MITM) have emerged in an endless stream. The timely and accurate detection of network anomalies is of extraordinary importance for the stability of the network. Previous works designed based on deep learning have faced difficulties in their adoption in practice due to the lack of interpretability. Recently, Recurrent Neural Networks perform a superior ability to analyze high-dimensional complex network flow. However, these methods have the problems of limited parallelizability and time-consuming training, so they cannot meet the particular requirements of intrusion detection. To solve the above issues, we propose an efficient and interpretable intrusion detection scheme based on simple recurrent networks (Tab-AttSRU) to identify abnormal network traffic patterns accurately. Concretely, to obtain high-quality interpretation, we utilize model-specific feature importance and a learnable mask of TabNet for soft selection. The sequential attention mechanism is used to select the decision-making features for necessary interpretability. To realize efficient parallel computing, we combine SRU with attention mechanism to capture latent connections between traffic at different times and implement it on Spark. The performance of proposed method is assessed on the benchmark UNSW-NB15 and a real-world dataset UKM-IDS20. Experimental results have demonstrated the efficiency and interpretability of proposed method."
Effects of acute estradiol and progesterone on perimenstrual exacerbation of suicidal ideation and related symptoms: a crossover randomized controlled trial,"Female suicide attempts peak peri-menstrually—around the onset of menses—when the ovarian steroids estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) fall rapidly. Given preclinical evidence that withdrawal from either E2 or P4 can provoke behaviors consistent with elevated suicide risk, we hypothesized that withdrawal from one or both of these steroids contributes to perimenstrual exacerbation of suicidal ideation (SI) and related symptoms. In a randomized, controlled, double-blind crossover experiment (NCT03720847), a transdiagnostic sample of naturally cycling, medically healthy psychiatric outpatients reporting past-month SI completed two conditions during two different 14-day experimental intervals (days 7–20 where the luteinizing hormone surge = day 0), separated by a monthlong washout cycle. In the E2 and P4 (EP) condition, participants received transdermal E2 (0.1 mg/day) plus oral micronized P4 (200 mg/day as 100 mg twice daily) to buffer perimenstrual steroid withdrawal. A matched placebo (PBO) condition allowed natural perimenstrual steroid withdrawal. Participants reported daily SI and planning (primary outcomes) and indices of depression (low mood, hopelessness), threat sensitivity (anxiety, perceived stress), executive functioning (difficulty concentrating, impulsivity), and social cognitive bias (rejection sensitivity, perceived burdensomeness). In baseline cycles, no participant met prospective criteria for DSM-5 premenstrual dysphoric disorder, but 59% met all criteria except full follicular symptom remission, and 93% showed the highest SI in the perimenstrual phase. Of 29 randomized, 28 were analyzed (14 EP-PBO, 14 PBO-EP). Experimental administration of E2 and P4 (relative to PBO) reduced perimenstrual exacerbation of SI, suicide planning, depression, hopelessness, perceived stress, rejection sensitivity, and perceived burdensomeness, particularly in the perimenstrual (natural E2 and P4 withdrawal) days. Further, delayed withdrawal from experimental E2 and P4 (but not PBO) recapitulated SI, hopelessness, and rejection sensitivity. Acute perimenstrual withdrawal from ovarian steroids may play a causal role in perimenstrual worsening of depression and SI."

Ecological-economic coordination in the Yellow River basin: spatial and temporal evolution and driving mechanisms,"In recent years, environmental damage caused by economic development has been increasing in China’s Yellow River basin (YRB), one of the country’s most important economic zones. Finding an appropriate governance model is a prerequisite to ensuring the coordinated development of the YRB. Traditional analysis focus on city or province level, which is less accurate and ignores the interaction between spaces. This paper explores the distribution, spatial relationships and influencing factors of the level of coordinated development at county level in the YRB and its impact on the study area’s environment. This investigation aims to provide scientific support for the region's governance. We used the equivalent value method, the entropy method, a coupling coordinating degree model and the double-fixed spatial Durbin model to quantify, spatialize and assess the relationship between the value of ecosystem services and economic development and to analyze the drivers of ecological changes and the spatial interaction effects in the YRB from 2010 to 2020. The results show that (1) The degree of ecological-economic coupling coordination in the YRB steadily increased over the study period and is high in eastern areas but low in the western area. The growth rate is fast in the east and slow in the west and the gap has gradually enlarged. (2) Adjusting the industrial ratios alone cannot improve the level of local coordinated development. The intensity of government public expenditure support can significantly affect the coordinated development level of local, and the intensity of the impact on the neighboring areas depends on the difficulty of intercommunication between areas. (3) Increasing rural disposable income in mountainous areas can effectively increase the level of local coupling coordination but can also lead to a decrease in coupling coordination in the surrounding areas. (4) The influence of the normalized difference vegetation index on coupling coordination depends on local land values."
Protective consumption behavior under smog: using a data-driven dynamic Bayesian network,"In the midst of the deteriorating air pollution and collective stress, people pay close attention to risk mitigation measures such as keeping indoor and purchasing anti-smog products. Through impact evaluations, factors regarding health protective behavior can be identified. However, limited research is available regarding probabilistic interdependencies between the factors and protective behavior and largely relies on subjective diagnosis. These concerns have led us to adopt a data-driven static Bayesian network (BN) and Dynamic BN model to help explore multidimensional factors that may influence the public’s health protective behavior of buying anti-smog air purifiers and examine the dependencies among network nodes. Using the city-level aggregate data from an online shopping platform, the results shed new light on relationships existing among 11 factors and protective behavior of buying air purifiers. Furthermore, taking into account the dynamic nature of protective behavior, we add time-related factors on the basis of static BN to construct the dynamic BN model. Results indicate that PM2.5 concentration and product price are the two leading factors affecting the consumption behavior for air purifiers. Additionally, media-related factors play an important role in the consumption behavior. This study contributes to the fields of impact evaluation of protective consumption behavior analysis and links environment risk with public consumption by identifying key factors."
Dissecting the inheritance pattern of the anemone flower type and tubular floral traits of chrysanthemum in segregating F1 populations,"The anemone type, featuring prominent and colored in tubular florets, is an attractive flower shape in chrysanthemums and, thus, desired by breeders and consumers. Understanding the genetic basis of anemone type flowers in chrysanthemum is crucial for breeding success. The current study conducted nine cross combinations from seven parents to investigate segregation patterns, parental effect, and the relationships between the heterosis of six tubular floral traits and parental genetic distance. Significant (P < 0.05) differences among the parents and crosses in various tubular floral traits and transgressive segregation was observed in both directions for most traits. The broad-sense heritability of the tubular floral traits varied from h

PD-L1 Expression is not a Predictive Factor for Recurrence in Resected Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,"Although targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), is an established treatment modality for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the prognostic relevance of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC patients who undergo pulmonary resection is controversial."
Voluntary immobility despite hazard: a case of Jamuna floodplain in Bangladesh,"Frequent floods and river erosions, exacerbated by global climate change, are causing miseries to millions of people worldwide. Thousands of citizens in Bangladesh become homeless every year due to recurrent floods and river erosions. This study reveals an unusual fact that the inhabitants of the Jamuna river floodplain are choosing immobility over migration to safe locations in such situations. The victims of forced migration usually stay within the same zone of calamity. To understand the dynamics, this study focused on determining the factors influencing immobility of the victims in Dewanganj sub-district of Jamalpur district in north-central Bangladesh. Primary data were collected from three distinct locations through oral histories, Focus Group Discussions, Key Informant Interviews, and household questionnaire surveys. Migration has a negative correlation (− 0.29) with flood experiences and a positive correlation (0.63) with erosion experiences of the victims. Thus, the flood-victims tend to be immobile more than the erosion-victims. The tipping-depth for flood is the highest among women in the island char, and the tipping-distance for erosion is the lowest in the attached char. The low living cost, working opportunities for women, and non-government/ government supports are the most important facilitators of immobility, and poverty and uncertainty in adapting to a new place are the major obstructive indicators of mobility. Suggestions are provided as to how immobility can be encouraged in hazard-prone vulnerable settings."
Backflow phenomenon in converging and diverging channels,"To date, a backflow phenomenon that occurs in subsonic zero-pressure-gradient and adverse-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers has been well studied and its existence in such flow types is beyond doubt. In the present investigation, focusing on a turbulent air flow in a duct with adjustable cross section, for the first time we provide experimental evidence for the existence of backflow events in a converging channel and demonstrate the possibility of their occurrence in a favorable-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer. Taking into account that the backflow events are characterized by the low probability of their occurrence and spatio-temporal extent at the level of the Kolmogorov scale, we pay special attention to the use of high-speed particle image velocimetry with high spatio-temporal resolution. The measurement results revealed a general tendency in the backflow formation mechanism in the considered flow regimes and channel configurations. In conjunction with the findings of other studies, we suggest that the backflow events are induced by transversely oriented vortices located in the buffer region of the turbulent boundary layer and formed as a result of the interaction of large-scale high-momentum and low-momentum flow regions."
A randomized phase 2 study of neoadjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without atezolizumab in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) - NCI 10013,"Atezolizumab with chemotherapy has shown improved progression-free and overall survival in patients with metastatic PD-L1 positive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Atezolizumab with anthracycline- and taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy has also shown increased pathological complete response (pCR) rates in early TNBC. This trial evaluated neoadjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without atezolizumab in patients with clinical stages II-III TNBC. The co-primary objectives were to evaluate if chemotherapy and atezolizumab increase pCR rate and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) percentage compared to chemotherapy alone in the mITT population. Sixty-seven patients (ages 25–78 years; median, 52 years) were randomly assigned – 22 patients to Arm A, and 45 to Arm B. Median follow up was 6.6 months. In the modified intent to treat population (all patients evaluable for the primary endpoints who received at least one dose of combination therapy), the pCR rate was 18.8% (95% CI 4.0–45.6%) in Arm A, and 55.6% (95% CI 40.0–70.4%) in Arm B (estimated treatment difference: 36.8%, 95% CI 8.5–56.6%; p = 0.018). Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events occurred in 62.5% of patients in Arm A, and 57.8% of patients in Arm B. One patient in Arm B died from recurrent disease during the follow-up period. TIL percentage increased slightly from baseline to cycle 1 in both Arm A (mean ± SD: 0.6% ± 21.0%) and Arm B (5.7% ± 15.8%) (p = 0.36). Patients with pCR had higher median TIL percentages (24.8%) than those with non-pCR (14.2%) (p = 0.02). Although subgroup analyses were limited by the small sample size, PD-L1-positive patients treated with chemotherapy and atezolizumab had a pCR rate of 75% (12/16). The addition of atezolizumab to neoadjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel resulted in a statistically significant and clinically relevant increased pCR rate in patients with clinical stages II and III TNBC.

"Psychomotor slowing alters gait velocity, cadence, and stride length and indicates negative symptom severity in psychosis","Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder, in which 50% of the patients present with motor abnormalities such as psychomotor slowing. Slow spontaneous gait has been reported in schizophrenia. However, comprehensive objective instrumental assessments of multiple gait conditions are missing. Finally, the specific gait patterns of subjects with psychomotor slowing are still unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to objectively assess multiple gait parameters at different walking conditions in patients with schizophrenia with and without psychomotor slowing. Also, we hypothesised gait impairments to correlate with expert ratings of hypokinetic movement disorders and negative symptoms. We collected gait data (GAITRite®) in 70 patients with psychomotor slowing (SRRS (Salpetriere retardation rating scale) ≥15), 22 non-psychomotor slowed patients (SRRS < 15), and 42 healthy controls. Participants performed four walking conditions (self-selected speed, maximum speed, head reclined, and eyes closed) and six gait parameters were extracted (velocity, cadence, stride length, functional ambulation profile (FAP), and variance of stride length and time). Patients with psychomotor slowing presented slower velocity, lower cadence, and shorter stride length in all walking conditions compared to healthy controls, with the non-slowed patients in an intermediate position (all F > 16.18, all p < 0.001). Secondly, slower velocity was associated with more severe hypokinetic movement disorders and negative symptoms. In conclusion, gait impairments exist in a spectrum with healthy controls on one end and patients with psychomotor slowing on the other end. Patients with psychomotor slowing are specifically impaired when an adaptation of gait patterns is required, contributing to the deleterious effects of sedentary behaviours."
Peculiarities of nitrogen-vacancy centers’ superluminescence in diamond under optical pumping at 532 nm,"In the context of the NV− diamond laser creation (Savvin and Dormidonov in Nat. Commun. 12:7118, 2021), an urgent task is to determine the characteristics of diamonds that can affect laser generation. This work is aimed at investigating the mechanisms of the creation of superluminescence in diamond under the action of optical pumping by the second harmonic of the Nd:YAG laser (λ = 532 nm). It was found that when the HPHT diamond is irradiated by 532 nm radiation with an intensity above ~ 2.0 MW/cm2, a nonlinear intensity increasing in the spectral region 700–750 nm is manifested against the background of the spontaneous photoluminescence spectrum, which, with a further pumping intensity increase turns into a pronounced peak of superluminescence with a maximum of about 718 nm. An increase in the pumping intensity from 2.7 to 46 MW/cm2 widened this peak at half-maximum from 13 to 19 nm. At high levels of pumping intensity, nonlinear pumping radiation absorption and accumulation of NV centers in the excited state were detected. The position of the photoluminescence band was calculated depending on different values of the population inversion density of the color centers, taking into account the diamond's own absorption spectrum. The calculation results are close to the experimental data."
Intrinsic decoherence dynamics and dense coding in dipolar spin system,"The quantum decoherence is an ineluctable process when a quantum system interacts with its surrounding environment. Milburn’s dynamical master equation, as a modified shape of the Schrödinger equation, is typically used to study the effects decoherence even without intervention of environment. We studied the temporal evolution of non-local correlations in a dipolar-coupled spin system under the influence of intrinsic decoherence. Primarily, the generation in correlations of Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen steering, measurement-induced non-locality and entanglement in an uncorrelated initial system state were studied. Also, the effect of the intrinsic decoherence on the quality of the dense coding capacity dynamics for the dipolar-coupled spin system was examined. Our results highlight that the initial system’s role in defining the quantum correlations’ robustness, and we also brought out the impacts of system’s parameters on the non-local correlations and the efficiency of dense coding process."
Influence of BMI on virtual coronary artery calcium scoring,Virtual non-contrast (VNC) coronary artery calcium scoring (CAC) may obviate the need for traditional non-contrast (TNC) CAC. There is no data on the influence of body mass index (BMI) on VNC reliability. We aimed to evaluate the influence of BMI on VNC CAC agreement with TNC.
Parabrachial-to-parasubthalamic nucleus pathway mediates fear-induced suppression of feeding in male mice,"Feeding behavior is adaptively regulated by external and internal environment, such that feeding is suppressed when animals experience pain, sickness, or fear. While the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPB) plays key roles in nociception and stress, neuronal pathways involved in feeding suppression induced by fear are not fully explored. Here, we investigate the parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN), located in the lateral hypothalamus and critically involved in feeding behaviors, as a target of lPB projection neurons. Optogenetic activation of lPB-PSTN terminals in male mice promote avoidance behaviors, aversive learning, and suppressed feeding. Inactivation of the PSTN and lPB-PSTN pathway reduces fear-induced feeding suppression. Activation of PSTN neurons expressing pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a neuropeptide enriched in the PSTN, is sufficient for inducing avoidance behaviors and feeding suppression. Blockade of PACAP receptors impaires aversive learning induced by lPB-PSTN photomanipulation. These findings indicate that lPB-PSTN pathway plays a pivotal role in fear-induced feeding suppression."
Multimodel ensemble projection of precipitation over South Korea using the reliability ensemble averaging,"Multimodel assembling methods have been commonly used to improve the reliability of climate projections by extracting relevant information from a large future possible climate scenarios. In this aspect, this study adopted the Reliability Ensemble Averaging (REA) approach to combine the precipitation outputs of multiple climate models over South Korea. The quality of REA weights assigned to each climate model was investigated using the Taylor diagram; both of these approaches showed a similar weight assignation mechanism. Furthermore, the REA performance was evaluated with the bias and root mean square error in view of reproducing the historical climate characteristics over the study region; both performance indices revealed that the REA substantially improved the performances of individual climate models at all weather stations. The analysis also showed that the climate models performance was not consistent in reproducing the precipitation characteristics over different seasons in South Korea. Thus, this study used the seasonal REA weights of each climate model for the precipitation projection. There is a general consensus between the individual climate simulators on the increasing trend of the projected precipitation in 2070–2099, except for a slight decreasing trend observed with IPSL-CM5A-LR over some parts of the central region. In general, the projected precipitation obtained with the REA over South Korea will vary between 5.23 and 10.78% for 2070–2100 relative to 1976–2005. The maximum and minimum projected precipitation increases were observed over the western and eastern parts of South Korea, respectively."
Hyperfine effects and electron spin relaxation of 51V4+ doped into scandium orthosilicate Sc228SiO5: CW and pulsed X-band electron spin resonance studies,"The scandium orthosilicate monocrystal Sc228SiO5 (SSO) doped with 51V isotope in small concentrations (0.005% at.) was studied. We used continuous wave (CW) and pulsed electron spin resonance (ESR) methods with frequencies in the X-band range (9.3–9.8 GHz). From the orientational dependencies of the CW ESR spectra we found the following: the hyperfine interaction of the vanadium ions is very anisotropic and the Zeeman interaction is almost isotropic with principal values of the g – tensor near electron g – factor. In addition to that, we found that the charge state of vanadium ions is V4+. The directions of the principal axes of the A and g tensors were determined. The phase memory and spin–lattice relaxation were measured. It was found that the temperature dependence of the spin–lattice relaxation time can be approximated by the sum of direct and Aminov–Orbach processes with decent accuracy. The phase memory time stays in the microseconds range even at the temperature T = 30 K."

In the present study, we aimed to explore the transcriptomic m6A landscape of endothelial function-associated genes and identify potential regulators in AS progression."
Can we Restore Balance to Geometric Morphometrics? A Theoretical Evaluation of how Sample Imbalance Conditions Ordination and Classification,"The most common means of performing ordination and classification consist in principal component, canonical variate, and between-group principal component analysis (PCA, CVA & bgPCA) for ordination, and linear and partial least squares discriminant analysis (LDA & PLSDA) for classification. Over the years, research has shown how the number of variables used in Geometric Morphometrics can be problematic for studies using small sample sizes. In the case of ordination, this implies an inflation of differences between groups, even when no differences are present. In light of this, classification tasks should also theoretically present exaggerated accuracy scores. Using a theoretically constructed geometric experiment, the present study constructs a series of imbalanced theoretical datasets containing different degrees of variation in both shape and form. Each ordination and classification task is then carried out to observe how imbalance influences the quality of results. Even when using large enough sample sizes, if one sample is considerably smaller than another, then this imbalance will have an effect on both ordination and classification results. Imbalance is thus seen to force separation among samples, and a considerable loss in classification performance. Statistical tests such as Procrustes distance calculations are not affected. The conclusions suggest that prior dimensionality reduction such as PCA are necessary for CVA, bgPCA, LDA and PLSDA. Cross-validated versions of these algorithms should also be used. An extensive discussion is also provided into alternative ordination and classification techniques that could prove useful for Geometric Morphometrics, and that are less sensitive to sample imbalance."
Multilevel Reverse Stackelberg Differential Games: Existence and Solution Approach for Affine Strategies,"This article considers multilevel sequential differential games over fixed time interval. In this continuous time game structure, the leader controls the outcome by announcing a reverse Stackelberg strategy as a mapping from the decision spaces of the followers to his/her decision space. The leader constructs such a strategy based on the control of the followers, which can be determined up to the current time only, also called causal strategy. Existence of affine reverse Stackelberg strategy for multilevel differential games is proved, and a method to obtain such set of strategies is also presented. The structure of this game can be adopted to many application areas, in particular in decentralized continuous decision making situations such as marketing system, taxation and budget allocation. As compared to the existing literature, the result applies to more general game settings and hierarchical levels of decisions."
An Accelerated Smoothing Newton Method with Cubic Convergence for Weighted Complementarity Problems,"Smoothing Newton methods, which usually inherit local quadratic convergence rate, have been successfully applied to solve various mathematical programming problems. In this paper, we propose an accelerated smoothing Newton method (ASNM) for solving the weighted complementarity problem (wCP) by reformulating it as a system of nonlinear equations using a smoothing function. In spirit, when the iterates are close to the solution set of the nonlinear system, an additional approximate Newton step is computed by solving one of two possible linear systems formed by using previously calculated Jacobian information. When a Lipschitz continuous condition holds on the gradient of the smoothing function at two checking points, this additional approximate Newton step can be obtained with a much reduced computational cost. Hence, ASNM enjoys local cubic convergence rate but with computational cost only comparable to standard Newton’s method at most iterations. Furthermore, a second-order nonmonotone line search is designed in ASNM to ensure global convergence. Our numerical experiments verify the local cubic convergence rate of ASNM and show that the acceleration techniques employed in ASNM can significantly improve the computational efficiency compared with some well-known benchmark smoothing Newton method."
Approximation on Slices in Balanced Strictly Convex Domains with \(C^{2}\) boundary,We show that a maximum modulus set K in a bounded strictly convex balanced domain \(\Omega \) with \(C^{2}\) boundary can have a Lebesgue measure almost full on all slices. Additionally K has a so called slice continuity property.
A Simulation Modelling Study of Referral Distribution Policies in a Centralized Intake System for Surgical Consultation,"Delays beyond recommended wait times, especially for specialist services, are associated with adverse health outcomes. The Alberta Surgical Initiative aims to improve the referral wait time—the time between a referral is received at the central intake to the time a specialist sees the patient. Using the discrete event simulation modelling approach, we evaluated and compared the impact of four referral distribution policies in a central intake system on three system performance measures (number of consultations, referral wait time and surgeon utilization). The model was co-designed with clinicians and clinic staff to represent the flow of patients through the system. We used data from the Facilitated Access to Surgical Treatment (FAST) centralized intake referral program for General Surgery to parameterize the model. Four distribution policies were evaluated – next-available-surgeon, sequential, ""blackjack,"" and ""kanban."" A sequential distribution of referrals for surgical consultation among the surgeons resulted in the worst performance in terms of the number of consultations, referral wait time and surgeon utilization. The three other distribution policies are comparable in performance. The ""next available surgeon"" model provided the most efficient and robust model, with approximately 1,000 more consultations, 100 days shorter referral time and a 14% increase in surgeon utilization. Discrete event simulation (DES) modelling can be an effective tool to illustrate and communicate the impact of the referral distribution policy on system performance in terms of the number of consultations, referral wait time and surgeon utilization."
#BadTherapist: What TikTok is Saying About Therapy Discontinuation,"Therapy discontinuation, a term used to describe clients ending treatment prematurely, is a common problem faced by mental healthcare professionals. This study considers how negative experiences in therapy impact the client’s experience in therapy and how this contributes to premature discontinuation. Video posts that used the hashtag bad therapist (#badtherapist) were collected from the social media platform TikTok and analyzed using inductive qualitative content analysis procedures. Five themes emerged from our analysis including: invalidation, biases, boundary violations, including religious beliefs without client agreement, and denial of trauma. Oftentimes, clients who prematurely discontinue services or openly discuss negative therapy experiences in therapy are labeled as “resistant”; however, the data suggest that more careful consideration of therapist behavior and self-of-the-therapist issues is needed. Clinical implications and limitations to the study are discussed."
Unraveling the signs and symptoms of oral conditions that affect daily life activities and oral health-related quality of life,"Since oral conditions negatively affect oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), this study evaluated which oral clinical condition, signs, and symptoms are associated with the impact on OHRQoL, its domains, and specific daily life activities among adults."

Antenatal and delivery practices and neonatal mortality amongst women with institutional and non-institutional deliveries in rural Zimbabwe: observational data from a cluster randomized trial,"Despite achieving relatively high rates of antenatal care, institutional delivery, and HIV antiretroviral therapy for women during pregnancy, neonatal mortality has remained stubbornly high in Zimbabwe. Clearer understanding of causal pathways is required to inform effective interventions."
Partial cumulative correspondence analysis,"Partial correspondence analysis (Yanai, in: Diday, Escoufier, Lebart, Pagès, Schektman, Thomassone (eds) Data analysis and informatics IV, North-Holland, Amsterdam, pp 193–207, 1986, in: Hayashi, Jambu, Diday, Osumi (eds) Recent developments in clustering and data analysis, Academic Press, Boston, pp 259–266, 1988) has been introduced in statistical literature to eliminate the effects of an ancillary criterion variable on the relationship between two categorical characters. It is well known that partial and classical correspondence analyses do not perform well if one (or both) of the variables forming the contingency table presents an ordinal structure. Cumulative correspondence analysis is a method that considers the information included in the ordinal variable(s). Nevertheless, in this case, a third categorical variable (ancillary) could also influence the existing relation. In this paper, we extend Yanai’s partial approach to cumulative correspondence analysis and, by using suitable orthogonal projectors, we obtain some properties. Finally, we present two real case studies."
Effect of facemask oxygenation with and without positive pressure ventilation on gastric volume during anesthesia induction in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy or partial hepatectomy: a randomized controlled trial,Studies focusing on the relationship between gastric volume and facemask oxygenation without ventilation during apnea in anesthesia induction are scarce.

Influence of genetic polymorphisms in P2Y12 receptor signaling pathway on antiplatelet response to clopidogrel in coronary heart disease,"Remarkable interindividual variability in clopidogrel response is observed, genetic polymorphisms in P2RY12 and its signal pathway is supposed to affect clopidogrel response in CHD patients."
Poland-Möbius syndrome: a case report implicating a novel mutation of the PLXND1 gene and literature review,"Möbius (Moebius) and Poland’s syndromes are two rare congenital syndromes characterized by non-progressive bilateral (and often asymmetric) dysfunction of the 6th and 7th cranial nerves and hypoplasia of the pectoral muscles associated with chest wall and upper limb anomalies respectively. Manifest simultaneously as Poland-Möbius (Poland-Moebius) syndrome, debate continues as to whether this is a distinct nosological entity or represents phenotypic variation as part of a spectrum of disorders of rhomboencephalic development. Etiological hypotheses implicate both genetic and environmental factors. The PLXND1 gene codes for a protein expressed in the fetal central nervous system and vascular endothelium and is thus involved in embryonic neurogenesis and vasculogenesis. It is located at chromosome region 3q21-q22, a locus of interest for Möbius syndrome."
The protective effect of URP20 on ocular Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli infection in rats,"Infectious keratitis, a medical emergency with acute and rapid disease progression may lead to severe visual impairment and even blindness. Herein, an antimicrobial polypeptide from Crassostrea hongkongensis, named URP20, was evaluated for its therapeutic efficacy against keratitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection in rats, respectively."
PrEP risk perception and adherence among men who have sex with men: a prospective cohort study based on growth mixture model,It can be considered that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) risk perception is the negative experiences or concerns about taking PrEP.

Nationwide handgrip strength values and factors associated with muscle weakness in older adults: findings from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil),"Handgrip strength (HGS) is a simple, quick, inexpensive, and highly reliable method for the assessment of muscle strength in clinical practice and epidemiological studies. This study aimed at describing the HGS values by age group and sex in Brazilians aged 50 years and over, determining age group- and sex-specific cutoff points for muscle weakness, and investigating sociodemographic and anthropometric variables associated with muscle weakness for each sex."
Pricing new and remanufactured products under patent protection and government intervention,"This study proposes a three-period closed-loop supply chain model framework with remanufacturing, in which an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) sells the new products through the entire selling season, and a remanufacturer collects the used products and sells the remanufactured products in the third period to a group of strategic consumers with green preferences. In the basic model, firms determine their respective prices to pursue profit maximization, considering consumers’ strategic behaviour and green preference. Then, we extend the model by incorporating patent protection and government intervention and investigate their impacts on firms’ operational strategies, profitability, and consumer surplus. Our results show that all the optimal prices increase in the costs of the new and remanufactured products, while the optimal licensing fee strictly decreases in both marginal costs. We further uncover that consumers’ strategic behaviour can alleviate but consumers’ green preference will exacerbate the effects of marginal costs on product prices. Compared with the basic model, under patent protection and government intervention, one can see that government subsidies help more consumers find an ideal product rather than leave the market with nothing. In particular, it boosts sales of the remanufactured product and improves the performance of the remanufacturer’s profitability, although the OEM charges a higher patent-licensing fee. Interestingly, the profit of the OEM also increases in the per-unit government subsidy because the OEM could benefit indirectly from government subsidies through its patent-licensing revenue. Based on the combined effects of patent protection and government intervention, we therefore propose an efficient and easy-to-implement subsidy/tax scheme, which can assist the social planner in encouraging firms to set prices at the level of reaching social welfare maximization."
Diffusion limit of a modified Erlang-B system with sensing time of secondary users,"We analyze a queueing model for cognitive wireless networks using the asymptotic-diffusion method (Moiseev et al. (2020); Nazarov et al. (2020)). Cognitive wireless is a technology that resolves radio spectrum shortages by allowing secondary users (SUs, unlicensed users) to occupy channels initially assigned to primary users (PUs, licensed users). SUs need to sense the channel availability upon arrival. After sensing, an SU can transmit if there is an idle channel; otherwise, the SU must continue sensing. We consider the situation where SUs may be interrupted by the arrivals of PUs when all channels are occupied. We derive a diffusion limit for the queueing model when the SUs’ mean sensing time tends to infinity. The diffusion limit leads to an approximate probability distribution of the number of sensing SUs. Finally, we derive a necessary stability condition which turns out to be consistent with the sufficient condition obtained in previous research."
Characterization of Heavy Metals in Some Edible Dried Fruits and Nuts Using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy,"The heavy metal content of dried fruits, seed and nuts show some fluctuations depending on the source of fruit, seed and nut types. The amounts of Cd and Co in air-dried fruit samples ranged from 0.05721 µg/g (white mulberry) and 0.21724 (persimmon) to 0.05101 (white mulberry) and 0.40833 µg/g (persimmon), respectively. Also, the content of Cr and Mo in dried fruit samples was found to be between 5.05 (white mulberry) and 15.85 (persimmon) and 0.01374 µg/g (white mulberry) and 0.15071 (persimmon), respectively. The heavy metal content of the fruits was different. The content of Cr, Ni and Pb in fruits is higher than other heavy metals. The content of Pb and Se in nuts and seeds is determined to be between 0.04613 (sunflower) and 0.66848 µg/g (roasted pumpkin) and 0.237 (raw almond) and 1.85 µg/g (salted peanut), respectively. The concentration order of elements in different edible seed and nuts was: Cr > Ni > Pb > Se > Co > Cd > Mo."
Physiological Performance of Dill Plants Affected by Seed Pretreatments Under Salt Stress,"The impacts of seed polymer coating and priming with gibberellic acid (GA3: 1 mM) and salicylic acid (SA: 1 mM) on dill plants (Anethum graveolens L.) were examined under different levels of salinity (non-saline, 4, 8 and 12 dS/m NaCl). The sodium content, H2O2 generation, malondialdehyde (MDA), ascorbic acid and α‑tocopherol and endogenous SA were increased, while potassium, calcium, magnesium, K+/Na+ ratio, membrane stability (MSI) and endogenous GA3 were decreased with increasing salinity. Total phenol content and antioxidant activity were elevated up to 8 dS/m and thereafter considerably declined. A reduction in seed yield, essential oil percentage and yield was occurred under severe salinity. Seed priming with GA3 and SA reduced sodium and oxidative stress, but enhanced nutrient content, MSI and endogenous GA3 and SA. Antioxidants, seed and essential oil production were improved in response to GA3 and particularly SA. The highest sodium and oxidative stress and the lowest nutrients, MSI, antioxidants, endogenous GA3 and SA, and seed and essential oil yields under different levels of salinity were recorded for plants from polymer-coated seeds. Therefore, seed priming with GA3 and particularly SA could be used as a potential tool to improve antioxidative activity and essential oil production in dill plants under salt stress."
Endophytic Fungi Improve Growth and Yield of Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Under Limited Light Conditions,"Shading is a major challenge to the important agronomic traits of crops, which may be caused by climate change and light obstructions in terms of various intercultural practices. The objective of this study was to investigate the yield, growth traits, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmittance parameters in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and their interaction with endophytic fungi under various light intensities. The experiment was carried out as a split-plot with six replications in randomized complete block design. Experimental treatments consisted of four light intensities (normal light, 70, 50, and 30% of normal light) as the main factor and two fungul inoculation levels, as biofertilizer (inoculation and non-inoculation of Piriformospora indica and Trichoderma longibrachiatum) as a sub-factor. Results illustrated that low light intensity (30% of natural light) significantly reduced the growth and yield traits such as stem diameter (29%), extrusion (29%) and spike length (29%), stem (17%), flag-leaf (35%), shoot (36%), and spike dry weight (51%), spike number per m2 (7%), grain number per spike and grain yield (44% and 52%), while increased flag leaf area (21%), plant height (25%), and peduncle length (12%). These growth and yield losses were compensated by endophytic fungi application. Besides, although normal light enhanced the weight and number of weeds, endophytic fungi application decreased these traits at every level of light treatment. Furthermore, a reverse relationship was found between photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmittance and leaf dry weight. Overall, this study strengthens the idea that endophytic fungi can be used as a supplement to crop production, especially in limited light conditions, to promote agronomic performance and yield of wheat plants."
Energy distribution between liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen temperatures in a Stirling/pulse tube refrigerator,"A two-stage gas-coupled Stirling/pulse tube refrigerator (SPR), whose first and second stages respectively involve Stirling and pulse tube refrigeration cycles, is a very promising spaceborne refrigerator. The SPR has many advantages, such as a compact structure, high reliability, and high performance, and is expected to become an essential refrigerator for space applications. In research regarding gas-coupled regenerative refrigerator, the energy flow distribution between the two stages, and optimal phase difference between the pressure wave and volume flow, are two critical parameters that could widely influence refrigerator performance. The effects of displacer displacement on the pressure wave, phase difference, acoustic power distribution, and inter-stage cooling capacity shift of the SPR have been investigated experimentally. Notably, to obtain the maximum first-stage cooling capacity, an inflection point in displacement exists. When the displacer displacement is larger than the inflection point, the cooling capacity could be distributed between the first and second stages. In the present study, an SPR was designed and manufactured to work between the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen temperatures, which can be used to cool small-scale zero boil-off systems and space detectors. Under appropriate displacer displacement, the SPR can reach a no-load cooling temperature of 15.4 K and obtain 2.6 W cooling capacity at 70 K plus 0.1 W cooling capacity at 20 K with 160 W compressor input electric power."
An appraisal of the methodology and quality of evidence of systematic reviews on the efficacy of prone positional ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an umbrella review,"The objective of the study was to evaluate all available systematic reviews on the use of prone positional ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). An umbrella review on the efficacy of prone positional ventilation in adult patients ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome was conducted. We performed a systematic search in the database of Medline (Pubmed), Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Epistemonikos. The ROBIS tools and GRADE methodology were used to assess the risk of bias and certainty of evidence. We estimated the necessary number of patients to be treated to have benefit. For the synthesis of the result, we selected the review with the lowest risk of bias. Sixteen systematic reviews including 64 randomized clinical trials and evaluating the effect of prone positional ventilation, with or without other ventilation strategies were included. Aoyama 2019 observed prone positioning, without complementary ventilation strategies, leading to a reduction in the 28-day mortality only when compared to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.39–0.95) and lung-protective ventilation in the supine position (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.48–0.98), with an ARR of 9.32% and 14.94%, an NNTB of 5.89 and 8.04, and a low and moderate certainty of evidence, respectively. Most reviews had severe methodological flaws that led to results with very low certainty of evidence. The review with the lowest risk of bias presented results in favor of prone positional ventilation compared with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and lung-protective ventilation. There is a need to update the available reviews to obtain more accurate results."

Harnessing low dimensionality to visualize the antibody–virus landscape for influenza,"Antibodies constitute a key line of defense against the diverse pathogens we encounter in our lives. Although the interactions between a single antibody and a single virus are routinely characterized in exquisite detail, the inherent tradeoffs between attributes such as potency and breadth remain unclear. Moreover, there is a wide gap between the discrete interactions of single antibodies and the collective behavior of antibody mixtures. Here we develop a form of antigenic cartography called a ‘neutralization landscape’ that visualizes and quantifies antibody–virus interactions for antibodies targeting the influenza hemagglutinin stem. This landscape transforms the potency–breadth tradeoff into a readily solvable geometry problem. With it, we decompose the collective neutralization from multiple antibodies to characterize the composition and functional properties of the stem antibodies within. Looking forward, this framework can leverage the serological assays routinely performed for influenza surveillance to analyze how an individual’s antibody repertoire evolves after vaccination or infection."
A machine learning route between band mapping and band structure,"The electronic band structure and crystal structure are the two complementary identifiers of solid-state materials. Although convenient instruments and reconstruction algorithms have made large, empirical, crystal structure databases possible, extracting the quasiparticle dispersion (closely related to band structure) from photoemission band mapping data is currently limited by the available computational methods. To cope with the growing size and scale of photoemission data, here we develop a pipeline including probabilistic machine learning and the associated data processing, optimization and evaluation methods for band-structure reconstruction, leveraging theoretical calculations. The pipeline reconstructs all 14 valence bands of a semiconductor and shows excellent performance on benchmarks and other materials datasets. The reconstruction uncovers previously inaccessible momentum-space structural information on both global and local scales, while realizing a path towards integration with materials science databases. Our approach illustrates the potential of combining machine learning and domain knowledge for scalable feature extraction in multidimensional data."
Age-related liver endothelial zonation triggers steatohepatitis by inactivating pericentral endothelium-derived C-kit,"Aging leads to systemic metabolic disorders, including steatosis. Here we show that liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) senescence accelerates liver sinusoid capillarization and promotes steatosis by reprogramming liver endothelial zonation and inactivating pericentral endothelium-derived C-kit, which is a type III receptor tyrosine kinase. Specifically, inhibition of endothelial C-kit triggers cellular senescence, perturbing LSEC homeostasis in male mice. During diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) development, Kit deletion worsens hepatic steatosis and exacerbates NASH-associated fibrosis and inflammation. Mechanistically, C-kit transcriptionally inhibits chemokine (C–X–C motif) receptor (CXCR)4 via CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (CEBPA). Blocking CXCR4 signaling abolishes LSEC–macrophage–neutrophil cross-talk and leads to the recovery of C-kit-deficient mice with NASH. Of therapeutic relevance, infusing C-kit-expressing LSECs into aged mice or mice with diet-induced NASH counteracts age-associated senescence and steatosis and improves the symptoms of diet-induced NASH by restoring metabolic homeostasis of the pericentral liver endothelium. Our work provides an alternative approach that could be useful for treating aging- and diet-induced NASH."
Optimal Growth and Ligninolytic Enzyme Production by Geotrichum europaeum,"Geotrichum Link. is a filamentous fungus occurring worldwide in air, soil, sewage, water, plants and in dairy products. It is also commonly found in normal human flora. It is widely used in biotechnological processes like antimicrobial activity; auto aggregation capacity; antioxidant activity; cheese ripening and flavour formation. The in-vitro growth and ligninolytic enzymes of the fungus at different parameters like different pH, temperature, basal media, days of incubation, carbon and nitrogen sources have been investigated. After 16 days of incubation, maximum growth was reported with glucose-peptone medium at 24 °C, pH-5.0. The best carbon source was determined to be xylose, and the highest levels of lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP) production were observed in pectin and starch supplemented medium, whereas the highest level of laccase synthesis was found in maltose supplemented medium. Ammonium oxalate is the best inorganic nitrogen source for optimum growth. Ammonium chloride supported highest production of lignin peroxidase (LiP) whereas manganese peroxidase (MnP) in ammonium acetate and laccase in ammonium sulphate. L-ornithine HCl was the best organic nitrogen source for fungal growth. Lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP) production were found to be maximum in L-cystine HCl and L-arginine whereas laccase production recorded maximum in L-asparagine. The various phytochemicals were also reported in the extract of Geotrichum europaeum having application in agriculture and related fields."
Small Molecular Antimicrobial Ligands of YspD are Potential Therapeutic Agents Against Yersinia enterocolitica Infection,"YspD is a hydrophilic translocator forming the platform for assemblage of functional translocon. Exposure to the extra-cellular milieu makes YspD a potential therapeutic target. DoGSiteScorer predicted best druggable pocket (P0) within YspD, encompassing predominantly the C-terminal helical bundles and the long helices-9 & 5. COACH metaserver also identified ligand binding residues within the aforementioned druggable pocket mapping to helix-9. Amino acids of helix-9 are involved in oligomerization of YspD. Interaction of helix-9 and parts of C-terminal of YspD with hydrophobic translocator protein (YspB), is essential for translocation of bacterial effectors to initiate an infection. Helices-9 & 5 form an intramolecular coiled-coil structure, required for protein–protein interaction. Targeting intramolecular coiled-coil and parts of C-terminal would be important for functional inactivation of YspD. Solvent exposed surface in YspD, particularly in P0, enhances its accessibility to ligands. Nine small molecular inhibitors of TIIISS were identified and retrieved from ZINC15 database (drug-library) as putative drug candidates. Molecular docking of potential ligands with P0 was done using SwissDock server and Achilles Blind Docking server. Considering the “Significance” threshold of binding score and region of interaction, Salicylidene Acyl Hydrazide derivatives (INP0400) and Phenoxyacetamide derivative (MBX1641) were found to bind effectively with YspD. These potential ligands interact with functional domains of YspD including parts of C-terminal and the intramolecular coiled-coil, which may affect the oligomerization of YspD and disrupt the interaction of YspD with YspB, inhibiting formation of functional translocon. The identified small molecular antimicrobial ligands of YspD could be tested in vivo to attenuate Y. enterocolitica infection by deregulation of Ysa-Ysp TIIISS."
Antihyperlipidemic Activity of Ethanolic and Aqueous Extracts of Asparagus Racemosus and Chlorophytum Borivilianum Leaves in Albino Rats,"Hyperlipidemia is basically a risk factor for causing heart related diseases, strokes, high blood pressure, diabetes, renal disorders, etc. Herbal remedies are widely used by all sections of society, whether as traditional remedies or modern medicine. In this research work, the hyperlipidemic activity of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of Asparagus racemosus leaves and Chlorophytum borivilianum leaves was determined and the effect of these extracts on weight gain in hyperlipidemia-induced rats was determined. The aqueous and ethanolic extracts of A. racemosus (Leaves) and C. borivilianum (Leaves) were evaluated for serum lipid profile in hyperlipidemic-induced rats. It was concluded that the serum lipid profile in aqueous and ethanolic of C. borivilianum (Leaves) was found to be decreased than aqueous and ethanolic extract of A. racemosus (Leaves) when compared with standard (Rosuvastatin). The aqueous extract of C. borivilianum (Leaves) significantly lowered the body weight by the reduction in the serum lipid profile. Thus, in this study it was proved that aqueous extract of C. borivilianum (Leaves) decreased the level of hyperlipidemia in comparison to other extracts."
Optimization of Process Parameters in the Synthesis of TiO2 Nanoparticle Catalyst to Produce Hydrocarbon Oil Using the Catalytic Pyrolysis Process,"Plastic wastes such as HDPE, LDPE, PP and PS have a strong potential to produce hydrocarbon oil containing 75–85% carbon and approximately 42 MJ/kg of energy. This oil can be produced by a catalytic pyrolysis process with different catalysts with and without doping and can be utilized as an alternative energy or fuel source. In this paper, process parameters of synthesis of robust, easily available, naturally abundant and inexpensive catalyst titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2) are optimized and analyzed using Taguchi L16 orthogonal array and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a confidence level of 95%. The catalyst’s particle sizes were analyzed by a particle size analyzer, and their surface morphology characters were studied using scanning electron microscopy. Three different parameters considered here include calcination temperature, calcination time and speed of centrifugation. ANOVA predicts that calcination temperature plays a predominant role in the synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles. Minitab 17 software is used for optimization, while the signal-to-noise ratio, regression analysis and graphs are taken for analysis."
Study of MHD Mixed Convection of Different Nanofluids Due to the Inner Rotating Cylinder Saturated with Porous Media,"In the present study, the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) mixed convection of different nanofluids in two cylinders with an inner rotating cylinder is numerically investigated. Three nanoparticles, including Cu, Al2O3, and TiO2, were used as the working fluid. The geometry includes two cylinders, one fixed while another one rotates. Three configurations have been considered, including (1) eccentric cylinders with an eccentricity of + e, (2) concentric cylinders, and (3) eccentric cylinders with an eccentricity of −e. The governing equations were solved using the finite element method (FEM). The nanoparticles’ volume fraction (\(0 \le \varphi \le 0.2\)), Darcy number (\(10^{ - 3} \le {\text{Da}} \le 10^{ - 1}\)), Richardson number (\(10^{ - 1} \le {\text{Ri}} \le 10\)), Hartman number (\(0 \le {\text{Ha}} \le 60\)), the inclination angle of the magnetic field (\(0^\circ \le \gamma \le 135^\circ\)) and porosity coefficient (\(0.05 \le \varepsilon \le 1\)) on Nusselt number and heat transfer have been studied. Also, the influence of the inner cylinder rotation on the heat transfer and flow pattern was investigated. It was found that the average Nusselt number rises by rising porosity, the volume fraction of nanoparticles, and Richardson, while it decreases by increasing the Hartmann number; for example, the Nusselt number decreased by about 54% as the Hartmann number increased from 0 to 100. Besides, it was observed that a sinusoidal trend is observed in the average Nusselt number by increasing the inclination angle of the magnetic field from between 0° and 135°. The results revealed that for the magnetic field's angle of \(\gamma = 90^\circ\), the maximum heat transfer is obtained. The most optimal case, in terms of heat transfer rate, is achieved when the inner cylinder rotates, \(\gamma = 90^\circ\), and Cu-water nanofluid is used as a working fluid."
Deblurring transformer tracking with conditional cross-attention,"In object tracking, motion blur is a common challenge induced by rapid movement of target object or long time exposure of the camera, which leads to poor tracking performance. Traditional solutions usually perform image recovery operations before tracking object. However, most image recovery methods usually have higher computational cost, which decreases the tracking speed. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a deblurring Transformer-based tracking method embedding the conditional cross-attention. The proposed method integrates three important modules: (1) an image quality assessment (IQA) module to estimate image quality; (2) an image deblurring module based on lightweight adversarial network to improve image quality; and (3) a tracking module based on Transformer with conditional cross-attention to enhance the object localization ability. Experimental results on two UAV object tracking benchmarks show that the proposed trackers achieve competitive results compared to several state-of-the-art trackers."
Nonlinear physics opens a new paradigm for accurate transcription start site prediction,"There is evidence that DNA breathing (spontaneous opening of the DNA strands) plays a relevant role in the interactions of DNA with other molecules, and in particular in the transcription process. Therefore, having physical models that can predict these openings is of interest. However, this source of information has not been used before either in transcription start sites (TSSs) or promoter prediction. In this article, one such model is used as an additional information source that, when used by a machine learning (ML) model, improves the results of current methods for the prediction of TSSs. In addition, we provide evidence on the validity of the physical model, as it is able by itself to predict TSSs with high accuracy. This opens an exciting avenue of research at the intersection of statistical mechanics and ML, where ML models in bioinformatics can be improved using physical models of DNA as feature extractors."
Properties of concentrated skim rubber latex using membrane separation process and its comparison with other natural rubber latexes,"Concentrated skim (CSk) latex was prepared from raw skim (RSk) latex of Hevea brasilliensis via membrane separation process. Since the properties of CSk latex have not been reported previously, this work aims to study the properties of CSk latex and juxtapose it with raw skim (RSk), field (FNR) and high ammonia (HANR) latexes. The physicochemical properties of the latexes, such as total solid content (TSC), zeta potential, and pH, were analogous to FNR latex. CSK and RSk latexes were composed of small rubber particles as confirmed by SEM, with low molecular weight polymer as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The Fourier infra-red transform (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed that CSk film contained high fatty acid ester, nitrogen and gel contents. After the ultra-filtration (UF) membrane separation, TSC increased from 7.3 wt% to 39.6 wt%. The non-rubber components and metal ion content were markedly decreased by 50%, respectively. About 85% of fatty acid esters were removed by acetone extraction (AE) while nitrogen and gel content remained the same in CSk film. This could be attributed to proteins forming cross-links that lead to high gel content of skim latex. In addition, CSk film showed marked improvement in thermal stability as compared to that of RSk."
Viscoelastic-based finite element rutting predictive models for asphalt pavements,"Rutting is one of the most important distresses in asphalt concrete pavements. It is typically caused by consolidation or lateral movement of the materials (reorientation of aggregate particles) due to traffic loading in a hot climate. The ability to predict rutting depth in asphalt concrete pavements is an important aspect of pavement design. In this study, two different finite element models were created using ABAQUS software to predict the mechanical rutting behavior and performance of asphalt concrete pavements. In the first model, a linear elastic behavior was assumed for all layers in all pavement sections. In the second model, a viscoelastic behavior was assumed for the asphalt layer and a linear elastic behavior for all other layers. The finite element models (FEM) were calibrated and verified by comparing the proposed models’ predictions with the multilayered theory results, and the available field measurement of pavement response obtained from the Heavy Vehicle Simulator (HVS) at Richmond Field Station. A significant level of accuracy was found in the viscoelastic model compared to the available field measurement of pavement response obtained from the Heavy Vehicle Simulator (HVS) at Richmond Field Station while the linear elastic model represents an accurate simulation of the multilayer elastic theory."
One-step chemical activation for the production of engineered orange peel biochar,"In this study, engineered biochar was prepared in a top-lit updraft biomass reactor with retort heating, following a one-step chemical activation. The precursor (orange peel) and chemical activator (zinc chloride salt) were combined in the ratio of 1:1. The FTIR spectra produced for samples with or without zinc chloride activation were relatively similar, with only a few differences. From the FTIR spectra, it was observed that impregnation with zinc chloride increases the number of oxygenated functional groups and decreases the carbon-containing groups in the biochar. The EDS analysis performed on the biochars showed that impregnation with zinc chloride salt increased the oxygen content in the biochar but decreased its carbon content. SEM spectra revealed that the biochars are characterized by rough surfaces with heterogeneous surface morphology. From the textural properties, it was observed that the chemical activation process greatly improved the porosity and surface area of the biochar."
ZnO recovered from spent alkaline batteries as antimicrobial additive for waterborne paints,"Biocides are employed to prevent biodeterioration in waterborne paints. In the present study, we used zinc oxide nanoparticles (obtained from spent alkaline batteries) as biocide for indoor waterborne paint at 1.5% of the total solid content in paint."
Human outdoor thermal comfort analysis for the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup’s climate,"It is explored, in this work; some well-known classic methods to calculate thermal comfort, contrasting them with a method proposed here that is based on the Principal Components Analysis for the Doha Metropolitan Region (DohaMR) in Qatar. The Principal Components Analysis takes into account the natural outdoor space, which is influenced by the external atmosphere variables. The purpose of the comfort index is to measure the atmospheric variability and the result shows whether thermal comfort increases or decreases from one month to the next or seasonally. Considering the predominant climate characteristics of Qatar, it was possible to identify that among classical and canonical urban thermal comfort indices investigated, the Principal Components Index provides convenient evidence to be also appropriate. The overall vision of the final results of the study is related to the equivalence between the classical climate-dependent thermal comfort indices and the proposal of a self-explanatory index by the linear combination of the atmospheric variables, which captures the greatest joint variability, without a pre-defined equation, but rather by an empirical equation. The observed atmospheric variables determine, locally, the thermal comfort experienced by humans. The main conclusion of this research is the simplicity, and equiprobability, of calculating thermal comfort using the characteristic history of the atmospheric variables that can be used. Based on the principle of Principal Components construction, which captures the largest source of variability through an empirical linear combination."
Comparative efficacy of three pesticides against the tomato red spider mite Tetranychus evansi Baker & Pritchard under laboratory conditions,"Tetranychus evansi is an important pest of solanaceous crops in Africa, causing important economic damage. Control of T. evansi is mainly achieved chemically. In search for alternative measures, the efficiency of Neem Oil in suppressing eggs and adult females of T. evansi was tested in laboratory in comparison to Acarius and Sunpyrifos, two chemical acaricides commonly used in vegetable farms. The mean egg hatching rates varied significantly among treatments, ranging from 3.60 ± 0.54% to 60.3 ± 0.16% (P < 0.0001). The highest hatching rate was recorded with the Control whereas the lowest ones were recorded with Neem Oil. Mortality of adult female T. evansi also varied significantly among treatments, ranging from 48 ± 3% to 100% (P < 0.0001). The highest mortality rates were recorded with Neem Oil at D1 whereas the lowest rate was recorded with the Control treatment. Comparison between pesticide showed Neem Oil as the most efficient (100%) followed by Acarius (93%) and Sunpyrifos (78%). Fecundity of pesticide-treated females T. evansi and proportion of eggs that hatched revealed significant differences between Acarius and Sunpyrifos (P < 0.0001), while none of the female survived after being in contact with the Neem Oil. Consequently, Neem Oil could seldom induce pesticide resistance in T. evansi populations. It appears from the study that Neem Oil at D1 or D2 was very effective against T. evansi and could therefore be an alternative to synthetic acaricides for an effective control of T. evansi on nightshade or tomato."
"Conservative versus surgical treatment of foot drop in peroneal nerve entrapment: rationale and design of a prospective, multi-centre, randomized parallel-group controlled trial",High-quality evidence is lacking to support one treatment strategy over another in patients with foot drop due to peroneal nerve entrapment. This leads to strong variation in daily practice.
Numerical investigation of the settlement behavior of hybrid system of floating stone columns and granular mattress in soft clay soil,"The composite system of stone columns reinforced soil overlaid by granular mattress (GM) has been given more attention as a hybrid improvement technique. This work presents 3D finite element analyses using PLAXIS 3D software for a composite system of floating stone columns group constructed in a deep soft clay deposit in Port-Said in Egypt. The limited area of loading was investigated in conjunction with the system key parameters, i.e., length, diameter, and the GM main properties. Results validated the effectiveness of the GM in settlement reduction and system behavior enhancement. The GM thickness results in considerable settlement reduction up to value of 1.5d where d is the stone column diameter. The thickness increase can be an economical substitution instead of increasing stone column length where a new factor named “Mattress improvement factor: Ƞgm” is defined to represent the occurring improvement due to GM existence. Results also show notable reduction of settlement with increasing the length to a limiting value of L = 1.8B where B is the footing width."
Monitored anesthesia care and asleep-awake-asleep techniques combined with multiple monitoring for resection of gliomas in eloquent brain areas: a retrospective analysis of 225 patients,"Awake craniotomy (AC) has become gold standard in surgical resection of gliomas located in eloquent areas. The conscious sedation techniques in AC include both monitored anesthesia care (MAC) and asleep-awake-asleep (AAA). The choice of optimal anesthetic method depends on the preferences of the surgical team (mainly anesthesiologist and neurosurgeon). The aim of this study was to compare the difference in physiological and blood gas data, dosage of different drugs, the probability of switching to endotracheal intubation, and extent of tumor resection and dysfunction after operation between AAA and MAC anesthetic management for resection of gliomas in eloquent brain areas."
Stunting and thinness in school-attending adolescents in Addis Ababa,"Adolescent population Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) is uncommon in low-income settings. Though Global Diet Quality Score is a good measure of dietary diversity, it has not been used in assessing nutritional outcomes among adolescents. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess school-attending adolescents stunting and thinness status and associations with global diet quality scores in Addis Ababa."
Timing of tracheostomy and patient outcomes in critically ill patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a single-center retrospective observational study,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an integral method of life support in critically ill patients with severe cardiopulmonary failure; however, such patients generally require prolonged mechanical ventilation and exhibit high mortality rates. Tracheostomy is commonly performed in patients on mechanical ventilation, and its early implementation has potential advantages for favorable patient outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the association between tracheostomy timing and patient outcomes, including mortality, in patients requiring ECMO."
Assessment of S-net seafloor pressure data quality in view of seafloor geodesy,"Long-term continuous observation of seafloor pressure is effective for detecting seafloor vertical deformations that are associated with transient tectonic phenomena such as slow slip events. Since the aseismic slip event prior to the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, several discoveries have been made on spontaneous slow slip events and various other types of slow earthquake along the Japan and Kuril Trenches. Seafloor observation network for earthquakes and tsunamis along the Japan Trench (S-net) is expected to provide invaluable information on slow slip activities via geodetic signals that are detected by pressure observation. This study inspects the quality of the S-net pressure data in view of seafloor geodesy by comparison with records obtained by more than 100 autonomous ocean bottom pressure recorders (OBPRs) deployed along the Japan Trench. OBPRs have long been standard tools in seafloor geodesy, and the data collected are considered a benchmark in terms of quality. Most of the S-net stations showed noise levels that are considerably higher than those of the OBPRs over periods of more than 2 d. We speculate that a strong correlation between pressure and temperature accounts for much of the long-term noise. In this study, the temperature-dependent fluctuation component was estimated by prediction filtering and removed from the original data, leading to a significant reduction in the noise level at 51 stations, which reached levels almost equivalent to those of OBPRs. Although no significant pressure changes have been identified as associated with the 2018 Boso SSE or repeated tremor bursts in the northern Japan Trench thus far, our findings indicate that these stations are sufficiently sensitive to detect slow slip events occurring nearby."
Vibration of rotating porous nanocomposite eccentric semi-annular and annular plates in uniform thermal environment using TDQM,"In this paper, free vibration of rotating functionally graded (FG) porous eccentric semi-annular (ESA) and eccentric annular (EA) plates reinforced with graphene nanoplatelets (GPLs) in a thermal environment is solved with the help of transformed differential quadrature method (TDQM). Symmetrical and asymmetrical distributions are considered for both the porosity and the graphene nanoplatelets; the estimation of the Young’s modulus is conducted by the model of Halpin–Tsai. A higher-order shear deformation theory is considered as the basis for the employment of the Hamilton’s principle for the derivation of both the initial equations of the plates-up to the dynamic equilibrium point and the oscillation phenomena afterward. The method of TDQ utilizes a conformal mapping in order to obtain the DQ weighting coefficients and then discretizes the partial differential equations of the motion, as well as the boundary conditions; this discretization takes place in the physical domain directly. The results indicate that the employed numerical approach is advantageous in high solution accuracy in addition to fast convergence rate. Furthermore, the variation of the natural frequencies of the FG plates with different boundary conditions is investigated by taking into account the influences of several parameters: the geometry, such as eccentricity, thickness ratio, radius ratio; the material, such as the type of porosity and GPLs, the porosity parameter and the weight fraction of GPLs, and other parameters, such as temperature difference and rotating speed."
Deubiquitinating enzyme Josephin-2 stabilizes PHGDH to promote a cancer stem cell phenotype in hepatocellular carcinoma,Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) have been shown to be possible targets for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment.
The impacts of a global pandemic on the efficacy and stability of contemporary wildlife conservation: South Africa as a case study,"Conservationists speculated on potential benefits to wildlife of lockdown restrictions because of the COVID-19 pandemic but voiced concern that restrictions impeded nature conservation. We assessed the effects of lockdown restrictions on biodiversity conservation in South Africa, a biodiverse country with economic inequality and reliance on wildlife resources. We solicited expert opinion using the IUCN’s Threats Classification Scheme to structure a questionnaire and illustrated responses with individual case studies from government parastatal and non-governmental conservation organisations. The most highly reported threats were biological resource use, residential/commercial developments, invasive species, and human intrusions. The trends reported by 90 survey respondents were supported by case studies using environmental compliance data from parastatal conservation organisations. Lack of tourism revenue and funding were cited as hindrances to conservation. Mechanisms to prevent environmental degradation in the face of global emergencies must be implemented and ‘ring-fenced’ to ensure conservation is not a casualty during future global crises."
"It Matters: Early Childhood Mental Health, Educator Stress, and Burnout","Early childhood educators (ECEs) face several workplace challenges, including young children’s difficult behavior and mental health needs, workplace stress, low systemic support, and high levels of burnout. Both education and perceived confidence are often cited as important buffering factors, yet neither is well studied in the existing literature. The present study aimed to better understand and describe these factors. A survey, including both open and closed questions, was sent out to a large group of ECEs. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, T-tests, and the constant comparison method of qualitative coding. Findings suggest that the types of training ECEs have had is related to their comfort in recognizing and responding to young children’s mental health and challenging behaviors. Both systemic changes and didactic needs were cited as necessary to further support ECEs."
Revisiting the concept of bipolar depression: comparison of diagnostic validators between melancholic and non-melancholic episodes,"The current definition of bipolar disorder derives with minimal changes from one that emerged through expert consensus in the late 1970s, and the topic of its validity tended to be neglected in the literature. The aim of this exploratory study was to compare patients with bipolar disorder with a history of melancholic and non-melancholic depressive episodes in a series of external diagnostic validators. One hundred eight subjects were categorized as melancholic or non-melancholic in relation to their history of depressive episodes through the clinician-rated Sydney Melancholia Prototype Index (SMPI). The external validators used were clinical-demographic variables, family history of bipolar disorder, neurocognitive performance and functional outcome. There were 43.5% of the patients with a history of melancholia and 56.5% of non-melancholic depression. Non-melancholic depressions were overrepresented in females, while melancholic depressions had a female:male ratio closer to unity. Patients with melancholia had more history of BD in first-degree relatives and better functional outcome than those with non-melancholic depression. There were no differences between groups regarding neurocognitive performance. Results tended to be unchanged when controlled for confounders. Our preliminary results highlight the inherent heterogeneity in the current concept of bipolar depression, and suggest the need for further clinical research to elucidate its validity."
Predicting consumer intention toward eco-friendly smart home services: extending the theory of planned behavior,"Although smart home services have been acknowledged to promote environmental protection, few studies have explored the willingness of consumers to adopt eco-friendly smart home services. This study aims to investigate the influencing factors that affect Chinese consumers’ intention to adopt eco-friendly smart home services. The theory of planned behavior is used as the basic theoretical background and is further extended by adding the constructs of environmental knowledge, ambiguity tolerance, compatibility, and living habits. Data were collected from 629 respondents in China through a self-administered questionnaire survey and analyzed by structural equation modeling. Results indicate that attitude and perceived behavioral control have positive and significant effects on consumers’ intention toward adopting eco-friendly smart home services, whereas subjective norm does not have any effect. Moreover, environmental knowledge, ambiguity tolerance, compatibility significantly and positively affect consumer intention toward eco-friendly smart home services. Living habits have a negative effect on consumers’ intention under eco-friendly smart home services context. The implications for promoting the popularization of smart home services are discussed to motivate consumers to adopt eco-friendly smart home services on the basis of empirical results."
"Structural variations of amorphous magnesium carbonate during nucleation, crystallization, and decomposition of nesquehonite MgCO3·3H2O","Carbonate minerals are major contributors to carbon sequestration in geological deposits; however, their nature and behavior remain unclear. Amorphous magnesium carbonate (AMC) is formed as a precursor to crystalline magnesium carbonates and as a product of thermal decomposition of nesquehonite (NSQ). In this study, the AMCs formed during the crystallization and decomposition of NSQ were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic pair distribution function (PDF) methods. An AMC with a hydromagnesite-like structure (AMC-I) was formed immediately after mixing MgCl2 and Na2CO3 solutions. After 5 min of stirring, no change was observed in the XRD pattern; however, the PDF pattern changed. This suggests that the medium-range ordered structure of AMC-I transformed into an intermediate structure (AMC-II) between AMC-I and NSQ. After 10 min of stirring, the AMC-II crystallized into NSQ. In the case of Rb2CO3, the AMC-II structure was formed immediately after the mixing of solutions and was stable for three days. AMC-II in the Rb2CO3 solution appeared to be in equilibrium with energetic local minima, indicating the existence of polyamorphism in AMC. When Cs2CO3 solution was used, the first precipitate had an AMC-I structure. By stirring for 5 min, the AMC-I was transformed to AMC-II, and after 10 min of stirring, a few quantities crystallized into NSQ. After three days, NSQ dissolved and transformed back into AMC-I. Thus, it is inferred that the crystallization of NSQ is significantly influenced by alkali cations in aqueous solutions. The AMC formed during the thermal decomposition also possesses the AMC-I structure."
A joint network of non-linear graph attention and temporal attraction force for geo-sensory time series prediction,"Geo-sensory time series, such as the air quality and water distribution, are collected from numerous sensors at different geospatial locations in the same time interval. Each sensor monitors multiple parameters and generates multivariate time series. These time series change over time and vary geographically; hence, geo-sensory time series contain multi-scale spatial-temporal correlations, namely inter-sensor spatial-temporal correlations and intra-sensor spatial-temporal correlations. To capture spatial-temporal correlations, although various deep learning models have been developed, few of the models focus on capturing both correlations. To solve this problem, we propose simultaneously capture the inter- and intra-sensor spatial-temporal correlations by designing a joint network of non-linear graph attention and temporal attraction force(J-NGT) consisting two graph attention mechanisms. The non-linear graph attention mechanism can characterize node affinities for adaptively selecting the relevant exogenous series and relevant sensor series. The temporal attraction force mechanism can weigh the effect of past values on current values to represent the temporal correlation. To prove the superiority and effectiveness of our model, we evaluate our model in three real-world datasets from different fields. Experimental results show that our model can achieve better prediction performance than eight state-of-the-art models, including statistical models, machine learning models, and deep learning models. Furthermore, we conducted experiments to capture inter- and intra-sensor spatial-temporal correlations. Experimental results indicate that our model significantly improves performance by capturing both inter- and intra-sensor spatial-temporal correlations. This fully shows that our model has a greater advantage in geo-sensory time series prediction."
"Implementation of a Low-Cost, Multi-component, Web-Based Training for Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy","Effective, interactive trainings in evidence-based practices remain expensive and largely inaccessible to most practicing clinicians. To address this need, the current study evaluated the impact of a low-cost, multi-component, web-based training for Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) on clinicians’ TF-CBT knowledge, strategy use, adherence and skill. Clinician members of a practice-based research network were recruited via email and randomized to either an immediate training group (N = 89 assigned) or waitlist control group (N = 74 assigned) that was offered access to the same training after six months, with half of each group further randomized to receive or not receive incentives for participation. Clinicians completed assessments at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months covering TF-CBT knowledge, strategy use, and for a subset of clinicians (n = 28), TF-CBT adherence and skill. Although significant differences in overall TF-CBT skillfulness and readiness were found, there were no significant differences between the training and waitlist control group on TF-CBT knowledge and strategy use at six months. However, there was considerable variability in the extent of training completed by clinicians. Subsequent post-hoc analyses indicated a significant, positive association between the extent of training completed by clinicians and clinician TF-CBT knowledge, strategy use, demonstrated adherence and skill across the three TF-CBT components, and overall TF-CBT readiness. We also explored whether incentives predicted training participation and found no differences in training activity participation between clinicians who were offered an incentive and those who were not. Findings highlight the limitations of self-paced web-based trainings. Implications for web-based trainings are discussed."
Why We Derogate Victims and Demonize Perpetrators: the Influence of Just-World Beliefs and the Characteristics of Victims and Perpetrators,"Attempts to maintain a Belief in a Just World can sometimes lead to awry judgments about victims and perpetrators of violence. In a scenario-based study, we examined the associations of general belief in a just world with four BJW-maintenance strategies: victim blaming, victim derogation, perpetrator demonization, and compensation. We hypothesized that using a specific strategy depends on situational cues influencing the availability of that strategy and the level of a person’s BJW. More specifically, we tested whether BJW interacts with situational cues regarding the victim’s respectability and/or the perpetrator’s evilness, meaning that people with higher (vs. lower) BJW (a) tend to derogate the victim when the victim is presented as less (vs. more) respectable, (b) tend to demonize the perpetrator when the perpetrator is presented as more (vs. less) evil. Respectability (professor vs. car dealer) and evilness (with evilness cues vs. without evilness cues) were manipulated in a 2 × 2 between-subjects design. We also tested whether people use a single strategy versus multiple strategies to maintain their BJW. The results suggest that BJW-maintenance strategies are independent of one another, such that the availability or use of a particular strategy does not necessarily reduce or increase the use of other strategies. Taken together, our findings highlight the nuanced effects of just-world beliefs on how people react to and make sense of violent incidents."
Paired k-NN learners with dynamically adjusted number of neighbors for classification of drifting data streams,"Over the years, several classification algorithms have been proposed in the machine learning area to address challenges related to the continuous arrival of data over time, formally known as data stream. The implementations of these approaches are of vital importance for the different applications where they are used, and they have also received modifications, specifically to address the problem of concept drift, a phenomenon present in classification problems with data streams. The K-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classification algorithm is one of the methods of the family of lazy approaches used to address this problem in online learning, but it still presents some challenges that can be improved, such as the efficient choice of the number of neighbors k used in the learning process. This article proposes paired k-NN learners with dynamically adjusted number of neighbors (PL-kNN), an innovative method which adjusts dynamically and incrementally the number of neighbors used by its pair of k-NN learners in the process of online learning regarding data streams with concept drifts. To validate it, experiments were carried out with both artificial and real-world datasets and the results were evaluated using the accuracy metric, run-time, memory usage, and the Friedman statistical test with the Nemenyi post hoc test. The experimental results show that PL-kNN improves and optimizes the accuracy performances of k-NN with fixed neighboring k values in most tested scenarios."
Markov chain Monte Carlo-based DCPB estimation for ambiguity fixing of GLONASS-only FDMA single-epoch positioning,"The differential inter-frequency biases (DIFB) caused by the differential code phase biases (DCPB) between inhomogeneous stations are correlated with the ambiguity parameters and are difficult to estimate in GLONASS FDMA precise positioning. Without known DIFB, the double difference (DD) ambiguity cannot be fixed or only partial ambiguity resolution is achievable. The Monte Carlo-based method can estimate DIFB with sampled values where if only some samples are close enough to the true value, the unknown phase bias parameter can be estimated successfully and thus enable high precision positioning. This study implements the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to refine the sample distribution in DCPB estimation with GLONASS-only single-epoch observations. As a result, the procedure enables GLONASS-only FDMA ambiguity fixing and achieves single-epoch precise positioning even though the baseline and DIFB are unknown in advance. Also, the computation load of MCMC procedure is further reduced by merging the common computations of different samples in the ambiguity fixing step. The experiments with baselines OHI3_OHI2, WTZ2_WTZZ and TLSE_TLSG on 30 days show that the fix rates reach 93.6%, 89.1% and 85.0%, respectively, with baseline solution errors within [0.025, 0.025, 0.050]m. The positioning computation at each epoch takes only tens of milliseconds."
"Which modality is better to diagnose high-grade transformation in retroperitoneal liposarcoma? Comparison of computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging","Survival in patients with retroperitoneal liposarcoma (RPLS) depends on the surgical management of the dedifferentiated foci. The present study investigated the diagnostic yield of contrast-enhanced CT, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), and diffusion-weighted MRI in terms of dedifferentiated foci within the RPLS."
Do chimpanzees see a face on Mars? A search for face pareidolia in chimpanzees,"We sometimes perceive meaningful patterns or images in random arrangements of colors and shapes. This phenomenon is called pareidolia and has recently been studied intensively, especially face pareidolia. In contrast, there are few comparative-cognitive studies on face pareidolia with nonhuman primates. This study explored behavioral evidence for face pareidolia in chimpanzees using visual search and matching tasks. Faces are processed in a configural manner, and their perception and recognition are hampered by inversion and misalignment of top and bottom parts. We investigated whether the same effect occurs in a visual search for face-like objects. The results showed an effect of misalignment. On the other hand, consistent results were not obtained with the photographs of fruits. When only the top or bottom half of the face-like object was presented, chimpanzees showed better performance for the top-half condition, suggesting the importance of the eye area in face pareidolia. In the positive-control experiments, chimpanzees received the same experiment using human faces and human participants with face-like objects and fruits. As a result, chimpanzees showed an inefficient search for inverted and misaligned faces and humans for manipulated face-like objects. Finally, to examine the role of face awareness, we tested matching a human face to a face-like object in chimpanzees but obtained no substantial evidence that they saw the face-like object as a “face.” Based on these results, we discussed the extents and limits of face pareidolia in chimpanzees."
Drawdown risk measures for asset portfolios with high frequency data,"In this paper, we analyze Drawdown-based risk measures for an equity portfolio with high-frequency data. The returns of individual stocks are modeled through multivariate weighted-indexed semi-Markov chains with a copula dependence structure. Through this recently published model, we show that the estimate of Drawdown-based risk measures is more faithful than that obtained with the application of classic econometric models."
The Urban Biography of a Mauritanian City: Microstratigraphic Analysis of the Eastern Quarter of Tamuda (Morocco),"The lack of vertical stratigraphic sondages and open area excavations constitutes a challenge to understanding Mauritanian urbanism. This makes the characterization of the spatio-temporal evolution of Mauritanian towns a difficult task. Systematic excavations carried out in Tamuda by several research teams in the twentieth century provided vertical and horizontal views of Mauritanian urbanism. Our study offers, for the first time, a high-resolution geoarchaeological analysis of Tamuda’s urban sequence (third through first century BC). The microfacies analysis, by means of micromorphology and µ-XRF of Spaces E18 and E20 of the Eastern Quarter revealed a complex interaction of deposits and site formation processes that resulted from changes in everyday urban life. In this respect, the overlap of different construction phases and the alternation of episodes of active use and abandonment is highly significant. This study examines the functional characterization of urban spaces, including the identification of midden activities, a roasting pit, and a milling site (possibly) linked to fish flour production. These activities leave traces on beaten floors and occupation surfaces, and several features indicate abandonment periods between short-term occupations. The result is a complex urban biography of this Mauritanian town, in which human occupation was not constant over time."
Characteristics of the deep learning-based virtual monochromatic image with fast kilovolt-switching CT: a phantom study,We assessed the physical properties of virtual monochromatic images (VMIs) obtained with different energy levels in various contrast settings and radiation doses using deep learning-based spectral computed tomography (DL-Spectral CT) and compared the results with those from single-energy CT (SECT) imaging.
Jacobi’s Triple-Product Identity     and an Associated Family of Theta-Function Identities,The main object of this paper is to present a family of \(q\)-series identities which involve some of the theta functions of Jacobi and Ramanujan.  Each of these (presumably new) \(q\)-series identities reveals interesting relationships among three of the theta-type functions which stem from the celebrated Jacobi’s triple-product identity in a remarkably simple way.  The results presented in this paper are motivated essentially by a number of recent works dealing with the subject matter which is investigated herein.

Pivotal Weak Turaev \(\pi\)-Coalgebras,"In this paper, we first introduce the notion of \(\pi\)-pivotal elements in a weak Turaev \(\pi\)-coalgebra \(H\) and show that the representation category of \(H\) is a pivotal crossed category if and only if there is a \(\pi\)-pivotal element in \(H\).  Also we discuss the relation between \(\pi\)-pivotal elements and \(\pi\)-ribbon elements of a quasitriangular weak Turaev \(\pi\)-coalgebra.  Finally, we obtain a generalized Deligne Type theorem."
Dynamical and qKZ Equations Modulo \(p^s\): an Example,"We consider an example of the joint system of dynamical differential equations and qKZ difference equations with parameters corresponding to equations for elliptic integrals.  We solve this system of equations modulo any power \(p^n\) of a prime integer \(p\).  We show that the \(p\)-adic limit of these solutions as \(n\to\infty\) determines a sequence of line bundles, each of which is invariant with respect to the corresponding dynamical connection, and that the sequence of line bundles is invariant with respect to the corresponding qKZ difference connection."
Equivalence Classes of Parseval Frames,"On the set of frames in a finite-dimensional space, we introduce the widest possible equivalence preserving the main characteristics of frames, that is, tightness, equiangularity, and spark (the least number of linearly dependent vectors). This equivalence is known as projective–permutational unitary equivalence.  For example, we show that full spark equiangular tight frames in the spaces \(\mathbb{R}^3\), \(\mathbb{R}^5\), and \(\mathbb{R}^7\) are unique up to equivalence.  A similar uniqueness result is obtained for the general uniform Parseval frame of \(d+1\) vectors in the space \(\mathbb{R}^d\).  Related questions have been raised in the literature  several times.  Calculating the spark is computationally much harder than calculating the rank of a matrix.  Here we present an algorithm that can possibly simplify the spark calculation.  The use of Seidel matrices and the Naimark complement technique proves to be very useful in the classification of frames up to equivalence."
Boundary Value Problems for Quasi-Hyperbolic Equations     with Degeneration,"The paper deals with the solvability analysis of boundary value problems for degenerate higher-order quasi-hyperbolic equations.  The problems in question have the specific feature that the manifolds on which the equations characteristically degenerate are not freed from carrying boundary data.  The aim of this paper is to prove the existence and uniqueness of regular solutions of the problems under study, that is, solutions all of whose generalized derivatives occurring in the corresponding equations exist as generalized derivatives in the sense of Sobolev."
Recovery of Functions on \(p\)-Adic Groups,"A general definition of recovering set for the class of integrable functions is introduced.  For every Zygmund class \(\Lambda\) on the \(p\)-adic group, the existence of such sets is proved, and procedures for the complete recovery of a function \(f \in \Lambda\) and its Fourier coefficients in the Vilenkin–Chrestenson system from the values of \(f\) on one of these sets are given."
On the Delocalization of a Quantum Particle     under the Adiabatic Evolution Generated     by a One-Dimensional Schrödinger Operator,"The one-dimensional nonstationary Schrödinger equation is discussed in the adiabatic approximation.  The corresponding stationary operator \(H\) depending on time as a parameter has a continuous spectrum \(\sigma_c=[0,+\infty)\) and finitely many negative eigenvalues.  In time, the eigenvalues approach the edge of \(\sigma_c\) and disappear one by one.  The solution under consideration is close at some moment to an eigenfunction of \(H\).  As long as the corresponding eigenvalue \(\lambda\) exists, the solution is localized inside the potential well.  Its delocalization with the disappearance of \(\lambda\) is described."
The Dimension Conjecture: Solution and Future Prospects,"Counterexamples to the dimension conjecture in CR geometry are constructed.  This conjecture is organically related to the model surface method; it was refined as the method was developed.  On the one hand, these counterexamples give a final negative solution of the conjecture in its original setting.  On the other hand, they make it possible to distinguish a natural class of manifolds (nondegenerate manifolds) for which the conjecture makes sense and is of interest.  The main questions arising in this direction are formulated."
Pell and Pell–Lucas Numbers as Product of Two Repdigits,"In this study, we find all Pell and Pell–Lucas numbers that are product of two repdigits in the base \(b\) for \(b\in[2,10]\).  It is shown that the largest Pell and Pell–Lucas numbers that can be expressed as a product of two repdigits are \(P_{7}=169\) and \(Q_{6}=198\), respectively.  Also, we have the representations"

Spectral Expansion for Nonself-Adjoint Differential Operators     with Periodic Matrix Coefficients,"In this paper, we construct the spectral expansion for the nonself-adjoint differential operators generated in the space of vector functions by an ordinary differential expression of arbitrary order with periodic matrix coefficients, by using the essential spectral singularities, singular quasimomenta, and series with parenthesis."
Does vocabulary knowledge matter in the effectiveness of instructing reading strategies? Differential responses from adolescents with low academic achievement on growth in reading comprehension,"Prior studies suggest that teaching reading strategies promotes reading comprehension in adolescents who have difficulties with reading comprehension, yet the results of those studies are mixed. Individual differences in students’ vocabulary knowledge may explain these mixed results. This article examines to what extent vocabulary knowledge influences the effect of a two-year intervention program focused on teaching reading strategies to adolescents with low academic achievement in the Netherlands. We hypothesized that students (N = 310) with different levels of vocabulary knowledge would respond differently to the treatment, given that vocabulary knowledge is an important factor in reading comprehension. Results showed that vocabulary knowledge moderated the effect of the treatment, suggesting that low vocabulary knowledge negatively affected the impact of an intervention focused on reading strategies. Vocabulary knowledge, thus, emerges as a prerequisite for the successful leveraging of a reading strategy intervention. Students with low vocabulary knowledge may experience cognitive overload when attempting to apply newly learned reading strategies while simultaneously trying to find out the meaning of multiple unfamiliar words needed for successful application of reading strategies."
Removal of Cu(II) by biopolymer-clay nanocomposite adsorbent,"In this study, it was aimed to remove Cu(II) ions from the aqueous solutions by a biopolymer-clay nanocomposite (BCN) adsorbent. For this, the effects of some parameters, such as pH (pH 1–6), contact time (5–1440 min), the amount of adsorbent (0.5–3 g/L) and temperature (25–35 °C) were optimized. It was found that the adsorption became the most efficient by increasing the contact time and 99.74% removal efficiency for Cu(II) was achieved under the optimum conditions (pH 3; contact time 1440 min; adsorbent amount 1 g/L; 25 °C). Moreover, the adsorption data were modelled by Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin adsorption isotherms and Langmuir adsorption was found to be the most appropriate adsorption isotherm model for Cu(II). The maximum adsorption capacity (qm) of biopolymer-clay nanocomposite adsorbent was found to be 214.28 mg/g for Cu(II). Furthermore, the pseudo-second-order reaction kinetic model was found to be the most suitable kinetic model for Cu(II) adsorption. The desorption efficiency from BCN surface was found to be 99.36% using 2 mol/L HNO3. The results revealed that BCN can be considered as effective, economic, and alternative adsorbent for Cu(II) removal based on the both 99.74% of removal efficiency and 214.28 mg/g of adsorption capacity and all experiments were carried out at least three times with a RSD values of 4%. Based on reusability of the adsorbent, it was seen that there was a slight decrease in the adsorption efficiencies in the third cycle but then adsorption decreased and reached 67% in the fourth cycle."
Toward a ‘reverse density dividend’? Population growth and socioeconomic evolution of Greek districts before and after crisis,"Social dynamics and economic cycles have driven population growth in Europe toward heterogeneous and hardly predictable spatial patterns. To assess the role of economic expansion and recession, our study identifies contextual factors of population growth and decline at the prefectural scale in Greece, a peripheral economy in Europe, estimating the differential impact of economic scale, agglomeration, accessibility, and amenities since the early 2000s. With economic expansion (2002–2009), population growth was largely dependent on agglomeration forces in both high and medium-density prefectures. The spatial model observed during recession (2010–2017) has instead reflected the inherent decline of agglomeration economies—with population increasing in accessible, rural districts with (natural and cultural) amenities. In more recent years, population growth in low-density coastal areas definitely suggests how demographic trends have been decoupled from the geography of income and wealth, reducing the divide in central and peripheral locations. The dominance of Athens and Thessaloniki in the Greek urban hierarchy progressively lowered, leading to a settlement model based on population growth in ‘intermediate towns’ and attractive/accessible rural locations. Such dynamics delineate a development path grounded on the spatial distribution of amenities, suggesting the existence of a ‘reverse density dividend’ that requires a specific investigation in advanced economies."
A quantitative analysis on the effect of COVID-19 in a private health insurance plan expenditure,"This paper explores the effect of COVID-19 on health care expenditure using data from a private Health Insurance Plan (HIP). As well known, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments had to rely on Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions against the spread of the virus. However, the stringency of lockdowns differed across space and time as governments had to adjust their strategy dynamically to the country-specific development of the crisis. These strategies have strongly changed the policyholders’ behavior; however, after this period, a fundamental question is whether the policyholder behavior will return to a status quo (i.e. in traditional care delivery). We analyze these effects using a “pre-post” quantitative study using longitudinal data collected from 2017 to 2021. We consider as a consumption measure the health care expenditure amount within several types of health services, coming from a group of insured persons, followed overtime every quarter, and separating the effect per gender and age. Moving in this direction, the purpose of our contribution is to investigate if the traditional actuarial approach for assessing the loss cost, based on the Generalized Linear Models, could predict the effect on the health care expenditure due to COVID-19 and the capacity to which a HIP can anticipate these uncertainties. Our results provide a comprehensive picture of the different effects of COVID-19 on the health services offered by the HIP, as well as on the behavior ofpolicyholders during and after the pandemic period."
Inhibitory effect of nitrogen deposition on soil denitrifying activity in a subtropical forest,"Nitrogen (N) deposition, as a global environmental threat, has exhibited profound impacts on the nutrient cycling and ecosystem functioning of natural forests. However, little is known about how different N deposition levels influence the diversity, community composition, and structural complexity of the denitrifying bacteria."
Intercropped alfalfa and spring wheat reduces soil alkali-salinity in the arid area of northwestern China,"The intercropping has great advantages in production gain, resources use and soil quality improvement. However, the effects of perennial forage legumes intercropped with annual grain crop on soil alkali-salinity was not well revealed. This study aimed to propose a spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) intercropping and reveal whether this cropping system could ameliorate soil salinity."
"Semiclassical Asymptotics of Oscillating Tunneling     for a Quadratic Hamiltonian on the Algebra \(\operatorname{su}(1,1)\)","In this paper, we consider the problem of constructing semiclassical asymptotics for the tunnel splitting of the spectrum of an operator defined on an irreducible representation of the Lie algebra \(\operatorname{su}(1,1)\).  It is assumed that the operator is a quadratic function of the generators of the algebra.  We present coherent states and a unitary coherent transform that allow us to reduce the problem to the analysis of a second-order differential operator in the space of holomorphic functions.  Semiclassical asymptotic spectral series and the corresponding wave functions are constructed as decompositions in coherent states.  For some values of the system parameters, the minimal energy corresponds to a pair of nondegenerate equilibria, and the discrete spectrum of the operator has an exponentially small tunnel splitting of the levels.  We apply the complex WKB method to prove asymptotic formulas for the tunnel splitting of the energies.  We also show that, in contrast to the one-dimensional Schrödinger operator, the tunnel splitting in this problem not only decays exponentially but also contains an oscillating factor, which can be interpreted as tunneling interference between distinct instantons.  We also show that, for some parameter values, the tunneling is completely suppressed and some of the spectral levels are doubly degenerate, which is not typical of one-dimensional systems."

Correlation Between Estrogen Receptor α Gene Polymorphism (c454-397T>C) with Serum Estradiol Levels and Known Risk Factors in Patients with Myocardial Infarction,"Myocardial infarction (MI) remains the most common cause of cardiac failure and continuous increasing rate of morbidity and mortality. We aimed to investigate the association of estrogen receptor-α (ESR1) gene polymorphism c454-397T>C with serum estradiol levels and dyslipidemia in 220 patients with MI in the age range of 35–70 years of both the genders. Genotyping study was performed through PCR-RFLP method using PvuII restriction enzyme. Serum estradiol level was estimated using the Access Sensitive Estradiol assay kit. Men patients had 43.2% increased risk for TC heterozygote in co-dominant (OR 10.66) and over-dominant models (OR 8.30), while women patients had 50% increased risk in co-dominant (OR 16.57) and over-dominant (OR 14.04) models. Variant C allele showed 25% increased risk of MI for in men (OR 2.24; CI 1.49–3.36; p = 0.0001), and 24% increased risk in women (OR 3.35; CI 1.95–5.76; p = 0.0001). Men patients had significantly increased serum estradiol levels compared to controls (25.28 ± 5.80 vs 17.04 ± 2.01; p < 0.0001). Significant difference was observed in estradiol levels between men and women patients (25.28 ± 5.80 vs 17.56 ± 3.32; p < 0.0001). Furthermore, significantly increased estradiol level was found in men patients compared to women for TT (25.46 ± 5.91 vs 16.71 ± 4.46; p < 0.0001), and TC genotypes (25.47 ± 5.91 vs 17.70 ± 2.86; p < 0.0001). Significantly increased HDL levels were observed in men patients with TC (43.10 ± 8.18 vs 38.91 ± 7.84; p < 0.01) and CC (47.16 ± 8.09 vs 38.91 ± 7.84; p < 0.001) genotypes compared to TT genotype. These findings suggest that TC heterozygote plays an important role as a genetic risk factor during MI pathogenesis in the South Indian population."
