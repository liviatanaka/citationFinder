Performance analysis of a novel medium temperature compressed air energy storage system based on inverter-driven compressor pressure regulation,"In compressed air energy storage systems, throttle valves that are used to stabilize the air storage equipment pressure can cause significant exergy losses, which can be effectively improved by adopting inverter-driven technology. In this paper, a novel scheme for a compressed air energy storage system is proposed to realize pressure regulation by adopting an inverter-driven compressor. The system proposed and a reference system are evaluated through exergy analysis, dynamic characteristics analysis, and various other assessments. A comprehensive performance analysis is conducted based on key parameters such as thermal storage temperature, component isentropic efficiency, and designated discharge pressure. The results show that the novel system achieves a relative improvement of 3.64% in round-trip efficiency, demonstrating its capability to enhance efficiency without significantly increasing system complexity. Therefore, the system proposed offers a viable solution for optimizing compressed air energy storage systems."
"The role of information sources in farmers’ management of a worldwide alien agricultural pest, Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)","Managing invasive alien species (IAS) is a significant challenge for both ecological and socioeconomic systems. Our understanding of the role of information sources in stakeholders’ IAS management is elusive for the majority of insect invaders. We focused on the fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, one of the most damaging alien insects worldwide, to explore the role of information sources in farmers’ management of alien agricultural pests. We developed a theoretical framework containing three components and seven indicators, conducted extensive household questionnaires in the region bordering Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam in southwestern China, and used quantitative descriptions, ordinal logistic regressions, and Mann–Whitney U-tests in statistical analyses. Our results showed that farmers had a generally low level of recognition ability, medium level of control ability, and high level of engagement initiative in FAW management, and farmers’ FAW management was significantly associated with socio-demographic variables. Farmers obtained FAW-relevant information from four sources with a high preference for training workshops and agricultural retail stores; further, training workshops played a more effective role than agricultural retail stores in farmers’ FAW management. Here, we show for the first time that training workshops are the most effective sources of information in farmers’ FAW management, and agricultural retail stores serve as necessary support. Future research could extend these conclusions by including socioeconomic mechanisms such as informational feedback loops and public-private partnerships among stakeholders. Our findings contribute to theoretical insights into the role of information sources in IAS control, and to optimized management of alien agricultural pests."
Importance of genetic clarification in cytopenia syndromes (childhood myelodysplastic syndrome forms),"Childhood myelodysplastic syndrome (cMDS) is a rare clonal hematopoietic disorder characterized by peripheral cytopenia, with refractory cytopenia of childhood (RCC) being the most prevalent form. In children presenting with pancytopenia and significantly reduced bone marrow cellularity, RCC, severe aplastic anemia (SAA), and inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) are critical differential diagnoses, with accurate distinction being pivotal for effective treatment decisions. While histopathological analysis remains fundamental in differentiating these conditions, genetic and molecular testing are playing an increasingly important role. Reflecting this importance, two new classifications for cMDS were introduced in 2022: the WHO 5th edition and the International Consensus Classification (ICC). Both classifications have broadened the scope to include additional gene mutations, highlighting advances in understanding the genetic underpinnings of cMDS. However, significant differences in terminology persist: while the WHO 5th edition redefined RCC, replacing it with the term childhood MDS with low blasts (cMDS-LB), the ICC retained the RCC designation. This paper presents two cases that illustrate the current challenges in diagnosing and treating disorders in the spectrum of cMDS. One case describes a patient with germline GATA2 deficiency, highlighting the difficulties of distinguishing between SAA and cMDS in a timely manner. The other case underscores the importance of whole exome sequencing to differentiate between IBMFS and cMDS in the presence of a histomorphological RCC pattern."
Co-detection of respiratory pathogens among ILI patients: characterization of samples collected during the 2018/19 and 2019/20 pre-pandemic seasons,"Influenza-like illness (ILI) patients co-detected with respiratory pathogens exhibit poorer health outcomes than those with single infections. To address the paucity of knowledge concerning the incidence of concurrent respiratory pathogens, their relationships, and the clinical differences between patients detected with single and multiple pathogens, we performed an in-depth characterization of the oropharyngeal samples of primary care patients collected in Genoa (Northwest Italy), during winter seasons 2018/19–2019/20."
A novel suturing technique for natural tissue repair in cystocele treatment,"Recently, natural tissue repair has become popular in the treatment of pelvic organ prolapsed. In this study, we compared patients who underwent cystocele repair with the rug-weaving plication technique, a natural tissue repair method implemented since 2022 for anterior prolapse, with those treated using conventional colporrhaphy."
Gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate/glutamine levels in the dentate nucleus and periaqueductal gray in new daily persistent headache: a magnetic resonance spectroscopy study,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies have indicated that the imbalance between gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate/glutamine (Glx) levels was the potential cause of migraine development. However, the changes in the GABA and Glx levels in patients with New daily persistent headache (NDPH) remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the changes in GABA and Glx levels in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and dentate nucleus (DN) in patients with NDPH using the MEGA-PRESS sequence."
Structure and properties of spun-dyed lyocell fibers based on indigo dye,"Spun-dyed lyocell fibers were prepared by mixing cellulose pulp with an indigo dye dispersion and subsequent spinning. The indigo dye dispersion was obtained by adding leuco indigo to N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) solution. The particle size of the indigo dye was controlled by adjusting the dispersion conditions. Furthermore, the application of ball milling resulted in a reduced average dye particle size of 222.3 nm. The structure and properties of the fibers were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and strength testing. Indigo dye particles were distributed in the interior and surface of the fibers. Relative to the undyed fiber, the crystal structure of the colored fibers was unchanged, but the crystallinity and mechanical properties improved. The color strength and color fastness of the spun-dyed lyocell fibers were assessed according to industry standards. Increasing the dye content and reducing the dye particle size (via ball milling) increased the color strength of the fibers, and the color fastness to sun and soap washing was high (Gray card grade 5). Additionally, the dye did not diffuse into the spinning coagulation bath and thus did not affect the recovery of NMMO solvent. The present study demonstrates a viable strategy for preparing spun-dyed lyocell fibers."
The relationship between sleep quality and suicidal ideation in college students: the longitudinal mediating role of negative affect and the neural basis of this relationship,"Studies have shown that sleep quality is a critical predictor of suicidal ideation. However, the mechanisms by which sleep quality affects suicidal ideation remain largely unknown. We aimed to examine the longitudinal relationship between sleep quality and suicidal ideation among Chinese college students and the mediating role of negative affect (Study 1). We also aimed to identify the neural basis of the association between sleep quality and suicidal ideation (Study 2)."
GP-Marker facilitates the analysis of intact glycopeptide quantitative data at different levels,"Protein glycosylation is a highly heterogeneous post-translational modification that has been demonstrated to exhibit significant variations in various diseases. Due to the differential patterns observed in disease and healthy populations, the glycosylated proteins hold promise as early indicators for multiple diseases. With the continuous development of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC–MS) technology and spectrum analysis software, the sensitivity for the decipher of the tandem mass spectra of the glycopeptides carrying intact glycans, i.e., intact glycopeptides, enzymatic hydrolyzed from glycoproteins has been significantly improved. From quantified intact glycopeptides, the difference of protein glycosylation at multiple levels, e.g., glycoprotein, glycan, glycosite, and site-specific glycans, could be obtained for different samples. However, the manual analysis of the intact glycopeptide quantitative data at multiple levels is tedious and time consuming. In this study, we have developed a software tool named “GP-Marker” to facilitate large-scale data mining of spectra dataset of intact N-glycopeptide at multiple levels. This software provides a user-friendly and interactive interface, offering operational tools for machine learning to researchers without programming backgrounds. It includes a range of visualization plots displaying differential glycosylation and provides the ability to extract multi-level data analysis from intact glycopeptide data quantified by Glyco-Decipher."

Characteristics of molecular subtypes and cinical outcomes in the immunotherapy Queue of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer patients,"With a series of clinical trials confirming the sensitivity of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) to immunotherapy, research on personalized treatment for SCLC has gained increasing attention. Currently, the most widely accepted subtype of SCLC is based on the expression levels of Achaete-Scute Family BHLH Transcription Factor 1 (ASCL1), neurogenic differentiation factor 1 (NEUROD1), and POU class 2 homeobox 3 (POU2F3). However, real-world studies on this classification remain limited."
Why Student Ratings of Faculty Are Unethical,"For decades, student ratings of university faculty have been used by administrators in high stakes faculty employment decisions such as tenure, promotion, contract renewal and reappointment, and merit pay. However, virtually no attention has been paid to the ethical questions of using ratings in employment decisions. Instead, the ratings literature is generally limited to psychometric issues such as whether a given student ratings instrument exhibits the statistical properties of reliability and validity. There is no consensus understanding of teaching effectiveness, the very attribute that students are alleged to “evaluate.” What students are actually doing when they complete a ratings form—whether measuring, evaluating, reporting, judging, opining, etc.—remains unsettled in the ratings literature. If ratings are surveys of student satisfaction, they have no logical or ethical connection with teaching expertise. I argue that the administrative use of student ratings in faculty employment decisions violates basic moral principles including nonmaleficence, beneficence, professional autonomy and clinical independence, and multiple aspects of justice including due care, truthfulness, and equitable treatment. These ethical violations rule against any administrative use of student ratings in faculty employment decisions, including the “use with caution in conjunction with other evaluative methods” deployment of student ratings. My conclusion is that such use should be immediately and universally terminated. Formative use of student questionnaires as part of ordinary instructional communication and feedback between instructor and students is a separate issue and outside of the scope of this paper."
Modeling fisheries and carbon sequestration ecosystem services under deep uncertainty in the ocean twilight zone,"Mesopelagic fishes are a vital component of the biological carbon pump and are, to date, largely unexploited. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in harvesting the mesopelagic zone to produce fish feed for aquaculture. However, great uncertainties exist in how the mesopelagic zone interacts with the climate and food webs, presenting a dilemma for policy. Here, we investigate the consequences of potential policies relating to mesopelagic harvest quotas with a dynamic social-ecological modeling approach, combining system dynamics and global sensitivity analyses informed by participatory modeling. Our analyses reveal that, in simulations of mesopelagic fishing scenarios, uncertainties about mesopelagic fish population dynamics have the most pronounced influence on potential outcomes. The analysis also shows that prioritizing the development of the fishing industry over environmental protection would lead to a significantly higher social cost of climate change to society. Given the large uncertainties and the potential large impacts on oceanic carbon sequestration, a precautionary approach to developing mesopelagic fisheries is warranted."
Over Investigation: An Ethical Debate,"Over investigations contribute to escalating health costs driven by multiple factors including physician decisions, patient requests, information overload, technological advances, marketing, hospital management policies, insurance requirements and defensive practices. The reconciliation between knowledge and clinical wisdom while dealing with uncertainties in medicine is the primary way forward through this ethical maze. A case scenario illustrates what pediatricians need to reflect upon while facing decisions on rational investigations to maximize beneficence while being aware of economics of healthcare delivery."
Chernobyl fuel microparticles: uranium oxidation state and isotope ratio by HERFD-XANES and SIMS,"Fuel “hot” particles are the most unpredictable dose-forming components in the soils of uranium contaminated regions, such as Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Over time in the environment, “hot” particles undergo gradual dissolution with the release of uranium as well as fission and neutron-activation products trapped inside the uranium-oxide fuel matrix. The environmental fate of fuel particles depends not only on the environmental conditions but mainly on the conditions of their formation in the reactor and during the accident. In the present work micromorphology, fuel burnup and uranium oxidation state of several fuel “hot” particles, collected on the Western trace of Chernobyl fallout, were studied using a combination of non-destructive or semi-non-destructive techniques: gamma-spectrometry, secondary-ion mass-spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, the X-ray absorption near-edge structure and the high-energy resolution fluorescence-detected X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy. An attempt has been made to assess the contribution of the conditions of particle formation and the conditions of being in the environment to the current state of particles after more than a quarter of a century of history in the environment."
‘The mirror of the soul?’ Inferring sadness in the eyes,"The eyes are widely regarded as the mirror of the soul, providing reliable nonverbal information about drives, feelings, and intentions of others. However, it is unclear how accurate emotion recognition is when only the eyes are visible and whether inferring of emotions is altered across healthy adulthood. To fill this gap, the present piece of research was directed at comparing the ability to infer basic emotions in two groups of typically developing females that differed in age. We set a focus on females seeking group homogeneity. In a face-to-face study, in a two-alternative forced choice paradigm (2AFC), participants had to indicate emotions for faces covered by masks. The outcome reveals that although the recognition pattern is similar in both groups, inferring sadness in the eyes substantially improves with age. Inference of sadness is not only more accurate and less variable in older participants, but also positively correlates with age from early through mid-adulthood. Moreover, reading sadness (and anger) is more challenging in the eyes of male posers. A possible impact of poser gender and cultural background, both in expressing and inferring sadness in the eyes, is highlighted."
"Dynamics of Bifurcation, Chaos, Sensitivity and Diverse Soliton Solution to the Drinfeld-Sokolov-Wilson Equations Arise in Mathematical Physics","In this study, we present an amalgamation of solitary wave solutions for the fractional coupled Drinfeld-Sokolov-Wilson (FCDSW) equations, a versatile mathematical model with significant applications in fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and nonlinear dynamics. By leveraging the two recently developed computational approaches, namely the modified Sardar sub-equation (MSSE) method and the improved \(\mathbb {F}\)- expansion method, we manifested the novel soliton solutions in the form of dark, dark-bright, bright-dark, singular, periodic, exponential, and rational forms. Furthermore, we also extracted W-shape, V-shape, mixed trigonometric, and hyperbolic soliton wave solutions, which are not reported in previously. Also, the modulation instability (MI) of the proposed model is also examined. To further understand the dynamics of the FCDSW equations, we conducted a detailed bifurcation analysis to investigate the bifurcation events exhibited by these equations. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the model’s robustness against variations in initial conditions and parameters, offering valuable insights into the system’s susceptibility to perturbations. We proved the effectiveness of our suggested techniques in the analysis of the FCDSW equations using analytical tools and numerical simulations. Our results provide new insights into the behavior and solutions of the FCDSW equations and enhance the mathematical tools for investigating nonlinear partial differential equations (NLPDEs). These findings have potential applications in fields like fluid flow modeling, wave propagation in plasmas, and the study of nonlinear optical phenomena in physics and applied mathematics."
GMMDA: Gaussian mixture modeling of graph in latent space for graph data augmentation,"Graph data augmentation (GDA), which manipulates graph structure and/or attributes, has been demonstrated as an effective method for improving the generalization of graph neural networks on semi-supervised node classification. As a data augmentation technique, label preservation is critical, that is, node labels should not change after data manipulation. However, most existing methods overlook the label preservation requirements. Determining the label-preserving nature of a GDA method is highly challenging, owing to the non-Euclidean nature of the graph structure. In this study, for the first time, we formulate a label-preserving problem (LPP) in the context of GDA. The LPP is formulated as an optimization problem in which, given a fixed augmentation budget, the objective is to find an augmented graph with minimal difference in data distribution compared to the original graph. To solve the LPP problem, we propose GMMDA, a generative data augmentation (DA) method based on Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) of a graph in a latent space. We designed a novel learning objective that jointly learns a low-dimensional graph representation and estimates the GMM. The learning is followed by sampling from the GMM, and the samples are converted back to the graph as additional nodes. To uphold label preservation, we designed a minimum description length (MDL)-based method to select a set of samples that produces the minimum shift in the data distribution captured by the GMM. Through experiments, we demonstrate that GMMDA can improve the performance of graph convolutional network on Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed by as much as \(7.75\%\), \(8.75\%\) and \(5.87\%\), respectively, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art methods."
"Detection of tumour heterogeneity in patients with advanced, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer on [68Ga]Ga-/[18F]F-PSMA-11/-1007, [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 and 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT: a pilot study","In metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), some patients show low/absent PSMA expression in tumour lesions on positron emission tomography (PET) scans, indicating heterogeneity and heightened risk of non-response to PSMA-RLT (radioligand therapy). Imaging cancer-associated fibroblasts and glucose uptake may further characterise tumour heterogeneity in mCRPC patients. Here, we aimed to evaluate tumour heterogeneity and its potential implications for management in mCRPC patients assessed for PSMA-RLT using [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46, 2-[18F]FDG and [68Ga]Ga-/[18F]F-PSMA-11/-1007 PET."
Blockchain-based proxy re-encryption access control method for biological risk privacy protection of agricultural products,"In today’s globalized agricultural system, information leakage of agricultural biological risk factors can lead to business risks and public panic, jeopardizing corporate reputation. To solve the above problems, this study constructs a blockchain network for agricultural product biological risk traceability based on agricultural product biological risk factor data to achieve traceability of biological risk traceability data of agricultural product supply chain to meet the sustainability challenges. To guarantee the secure and flexible sharing of agricultural product biological risk privacy information and limit the scope of privacy information dissemination, the blockchain-based proxy re-encryption access control method (BBPR-AC) is designed. Aiming at the problems of proxy re-encryption technology, such as the third-party agent being prone to evil, the authorization judgment being cumbersome, and the authorization process not automated, we design the proxy re-encryption access control mechanism based on the traceability of agricultural products’ biological risk factors. Designing an attribute-based access control (ABAC) mechanism based on the traceability blockchain for agricultural products involves defining the attributes of each link in the agricultural supply chain, formulating policies, and evaluating and executing these policies, deployed in the blockchain system in the form of smart contracts. This approach achieves decentralization of authorization and automation of authority judgment. By analyzing the data characteristics within the agricultural product supply chain to avoid the malicious behavior of third-party agents, the decentralized blockchain system acts as a trusted third-party agent, and the proxy re-encryption is combined with symmetric encryption to improve the encryption efficiency. This ensures a efficient encryption process, making the system safe, transparent, and efficient. Finally, a prototype blockchain system for traceability of agricultural biological risk factors is built based on Hyperledger Fabric to verify this research method’s reliability, security, and efficiency. The experimental results show that this research scheme’s initial encryption, re-encryption, and decryption sessions exhibit lower computational overheads than traditional encryption methods. When the number of policies and the number of requests in the access control session is 100, the policy query latency is less than 400 ms, the request-response latency is slightly more than 360ms, and the data uploading throughput is 48.7 tx/s. The data query throughput is 81.8 tx/s, the system performance consumption is low and can meet the biological risk privacy protection needs of the agricultural supply chain. The BBPR-AC method proposed in this study provides ideas for achieving refined traceability management in the agricultural supply chain and promoting digital transformation in the agricultural industry."
Modeling static friction behavior of elastic–plastic spherical adhesive microcontact in full-stick condition,"The static friction behavior of an elastic–plastic spherical adhesive microcontact between a rigid flat and a deformable sphere under combined normal and tangential loading is studied by the finite element method (FEM). The contact between the sphere and the rigid flat is assumed to be full-stick, and the sliding inception is related to a loss of tangential stiffness. The intermolecular force between the rigid flat and the sphere is assessed by the Lennard–Jones (LJ) potential, which is applied to the sphere and the rigid flat by a user subroutine. The evolution of the adhesive force with tangential displacement in the full-stick condition is revealed. The results indicate that the increasing effect of adhesive energy on the static friction coefficient gradually diminishes with an increase in the adhesive energy and the external normal load. Finally, based on an extensive parametric study, an empirical dimensionless expression is obtained to predict the static friction coefficient of the spherical adhesive microcontact considering the intermolecular force."

"An enquiry into rehabilitation as a climate change adaptation policy: the case of the Western Ghats of Kerala, India","The Western Ghats have been declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Besides, it is classified as one of the world’s 36 biodiversity hotspots by Conservation International. The Western Ghats of Kerala have experienced devastating landslides and floods in recent years, which are triggered by climate change. This alarming situation calls for policymakers to develop a comprehensive climate adaptation policy at the local level. However, no study has yet thoroughly investigated this critical issue. Therefore, this study explores the prospects and trade-offs of climate rehabilitation policies for families living in the highly landslide- and flood-prone areas of the Western Ghats in Kerala, India. We have undertaken a mixed methodology comprising four focus group discussions followed by empirical analyses. Towards this, a semi-structured questionnaire is framed to gather relevant information based on the outcomes. The data are analyzed using robust logistic regression models. The findings indicate that most agricultural worker families support the rehabilitation policy, given their lower opportunity costs due to the absence of farmland ownership. On the other hand, agricultural families face considerable trade-offs regarding rehabilitation. Most agricultural families prefer to rehabilitate within a short distance from the current residence or construct a retaining wall as they fear rehabilitation to distant places will gravely affect their livelihood. This research highlights the potential for implementing a rehabilitation policy for marginalized communities heavily exposed to climate risks. Additionally, constructing retaining walls should also be a primary focus of the Government."

Effect of sulfate types on strength and swelling properties of sulfate-bearing soils stabilized with cement,"Sulfate-bearing soils is widely distributed around the world, and this type of soil is prone to rock and soil disasters such as dissolution, corrosion of foundations, and swell when exposed to water. Cement is a frequently used stabilizer to treat sulfate-bearing soils. However, sulfate-bearing soils usually include various types of sulfates, such as, calcium sulfate (CaSO4), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), potassium sulfate (K2SO4), and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4). So far, the effect of sulfate type on the strength and swelling properties of sulfate-bearing soil stabilized with cement has not been clarified. Therefore, in this study, the strength and swelling properties of four sulfate-bearing soils treated with cement were studied using unconfined compressive strength tests, and swelling tests. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy were employed to study mineralogical, micro-structural properties, and concentrations of calcium ion of stabilized soils, to explore stabilization mechanisms. The results showed that the formation of magnesium silicate hydrate and highest concentration of free Ca2+ in the stabilized Mg-sulfate-soil caused its lowest strength. The reduction in free Ca2+ concentration was greater in the stabilized Na-sulfate-soil and K-sulfate-soil compared to stabilized Mg-sulfate-soil and Ca-sulfate-soil, contributing to the formation of more calcium silicate hydrate and ettringite. Therefore, the stabilized Na-sulfate-soil and K-sulfate-soil had greater swelling and strength compared to other soils. As the cement content increases, there are abundant in the sulfated cement stabilized soil observed in XRD and SEM photos. Overall, sulfates with monovalent cations increased the strength of cement-stabilized soils more than those with divalent cations, while sulfates with divalent cations improved the resistance to swelling of cement-stabilized soils. Before treating sulfate-bearing soils with cement, it is necessary to first determine the cations type in the soil. If the soil contains Mg2+, seek cement alternatives. If the other three cations are present, choose an appropriate cement content for stabilization. This study provides some references for the stabilization of sulfate-bearing soils with cement."
Using multispectral images and field inclinometer data to analyze topographic changes related to and the reactivation mechanism of a large-scale landslide at Caoling in Taiwan,"This study employed a comprehensive methodology, which combines the use of multispectral images and field inclinometer data. The unique approach involves using multispectral images to monitor the topographic and hydrological changes caused by a large-scale landslide at Caoling in Taiwan. The field inclinometer data, collected at regular intervals, were then integrated into a geographic information system. This system was used to estimate the potential sliding volume of the landslide, which was then compared with changes in the digital terrain model data for Caoling. The multispectral images of Caoling were examined to determine the changes in its topographic and hydrological indices after the landslide. The convex slope at Caoling moved in the progressive backward mode with increased groundwater level and slope displacement under rainfall conditions. The potential sliding volume of the landslide was 6.4 × 106 m3. The results of this study indicate that the changes in topographic and hydrological indices after a landslide enable the identification of the local surficial changes caused by the landslide. Changes in the rate of slope movement show a high correlation to the fluctuation of groundwater level. Reactivation of the large-scale landslide is attributable to hillslope, geologic and topographic characteristics, including toe creek incision, surficial erosion, and torrential rainfall brought by typhoons. Moreover, post landslide topographic monitoring through drone images, which provide high-resolution and real-time data, plays a crucial role in identifying a landslide’s reactivation mechanism. This, in turn, enables effective disaster mitigation strategies to be implemented."
Synthesis of homogeneous styrenic pyridine resin (LSL-030-bd) and its application to the separation of uranium and molybdenum,"This paper synthesized a stytypyridine (LSL-030-bd) resin with small particle size and uniform distribution to recover molybdenum resources leached during neutral in-situ leaching of uranium. The batch experiment results show that the LSL-030-bd ion exchange resin produced had the highest U(VI) adsorption capacity at pH 7.0, reaching 187.20 mg·g−1. At pH 3.0, LSL-030-bd resin adsorbed 180.17 mg·g−1 of Mo(VI). At pH 7.0, the resin exhibited the highest separation coefficient for uranium and molybdenum, with a KD value of 9.08. The resin's adsorption of U(VI) is a spontaneous endothermic process involving monolayer adsorption that combines physical and chemical adsorption. The adsorption of Mo(VI) by the resin is an exothermic process that is not spontaneous. It involves monomolecular layer adsorption with hydrogen bonding as the primary chemical force. By desorbing molybdenum with NH4SCN, followed by utilizing a mixed solution of NH4HCO3 and (NH4)2CO3 to desorb uranium, a step-by-step desorption process may be achieved to separate and purify uranium and molybdenum."
Perspectives of older adults with chronic illness on person-centered practice at an inpatient hospital department: a descriptive study,The growing aging trend associated with a higher prevalence of chronic illnesses is increasing the demand for the development of person-centered practice in specific care settings. Knowing the person’s perception of the care and the care experience is essential to improving inpatient care toward person-centeredness. This study aims to characterize the perceptions of person-centered practice of hospitalized older adults with chronic illness at a Portuguese inpatient hospital department.
The impact of COVID-19 infections on pregnancy outcomes in women,"Given that viral infections can increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as spontaneous miscarriage, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and preterm birth, the effects of COVID-19, a novel emerging coronavirus disease rapidly spreading globally, on pregnancy outcomes have garnered significant attention."
Multi-attribute and predictive cascaded fuzzy system for the AGV dispatching in a flexible manufacturing system,"In recent years, manufacturers have increasingly applied automation techniques to enhance efficiency and remain competitive. Material handling is an essential activity in any production process. Its effectiveness has a significant impact on production costs. Automated guided vehicle (AGV) systems have become a strategic tool for factories and automated warehouses. They can reduce production costs and improve delivery times in a competitive business scenario. One of the main problems encountered in managing AGVs is the dispatching decision. The present paper proposes a vehicle dispatching system based on a multi-attribute cascaded fuzzy system with a state-space-based Petri net model to predict the future states of the factory. This work aims to reduce the production system’s makespan and/or tardiness values. Additionally, the paper presents one simulated factory scenario to evaluate the proposed fuzzy system against five other dispatching methods. The statistical validation results of the simulations show a 97% confidence level in the hypotheses of this work."

3D finite element analysis of carbon fiber reinforced aluminium alloy wheel,The present investigation aims to develop the aluminium composite to replace the conventional materials used in the vehicle wheels. The aluminium composite is developed with Aluminium 7079 alloy reinforced with 8% carbon fibers (Al 7079 + 8% CF). The structural performance of the developed aluminum composite was evaluated using a finite element analysis approach. The Finite element model of vehicle wheel made up of Al7079 + 8% CF and other commonly used conventional materials were developed. The developed models are then subjected to different load conditions and natural frequencies to analyse the displacements and Von Mises stress in the wheel. The analysis results show that the wheel made up of Al 7079 + 8% CF composites exhibits better strength than the wheel made up of conventional materials. Hence Al 7079 + 8% CF composites can be used in car wheels instead of traditional materials.

Evolutionary-variational method in mathematical plasticity,"The elastic–plastic infinitesimal deformation of a solid is considered within the framework of the incremental flow theory using the constitutive relation in the general rate form. The appropriate initial boundary value problem is formulated for the displacement in the form of the evolutionary-variational problem (EVP), i.e., as the abstract Cauchy problem in the Hilbert space which coincides with a weak form of the equilibrium equation, known as the principle of possible displacements in mechanics. The general existence and uniqueness theorem for the EVP is discussed. The main sufficient condition has a simple algebraic form and does not coincide with the classical Drucker and similar thermodynamical postulates; therefore, it must be independently verified. Its independence is illustrated for the non-associated plastic model of linear isotropic-kinematic hardening with dilatation and internal friction. The classical and endochronic models are analyzed too. The initial EVP is reduced by a spatial finite element approximation to the Cauchy problem for an implicit system of essentially nonlinear ordinary differential equations which can be stiff. Therefore, for the numerical solution the implicit Euler scheme is proposed. All theoretical results are illustrated by means of original numerical experiments."
Advancing convergence analysis: extending the scope of a sixth order method,"In this article, we aim to emphasize the critical role of extended convergence analysis in advancing research and understanding in the interdisciplinary fields of Applied and Computational Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, and Chemistry. By gaining a comprehensive understanding of the convergence behavior of numerical methods, one can make informed decisions regarding algorithm selection, optimization, and convergence domains, leading to more accurate and reliable scientific results in diverse applications. The conventional approach to assessing the convergence order of higher order methods for solving systems of non-linear equations relied on the Taylor series expansion, necessitating the computation of higher order derivatives that were typically absent in the method. This limitation not only constrained the method’s applicability but also increased the computational cost of solving the problem. In contrast, our study introduces a unique and innovative approach, where we demonstrate the improvised convergence of the method using only first order derivatives. Our new method offers several advantages over the traditional approach, providing valuable information regarding the radii of the convergence region and precise estimates of error boundaries. Furthermore, we establish the notion of semi-local convergence, which proves to be particularly significant as it allows for the identification of the specific domain in which the iterates converge. We have validated the convergence requirements through carefully selected numerical examples."
A coupled Legendre-Laguerre polynomial method with analytical integration for the Rayleigh waves in a quasicrystal layered half-space with an imperfect interface,"The Laguerre polynomial method has been successfully used to investigate the dynamic responses of a half-space. However, it fails to obtain the correct stress at the interfaces in a layered half-space, especially when there are significant differences in material properties. Therefore, a coupled Legendre-Laguerre polynomial method with analytical integration is proposed. The Rayleigh waves in a one-dimensional (1D) hexagonal quasicrystal (QC) layered half-space with an imperfect interface are investigated. The correctness is validated by comparison with available results. Its computation efficiency is analyzed. The dispersion curves of the phase velocity, displacement distributions, and stress distributions are illustrated. The effects of the phonon-phason coupling and imperfect interface coefficients on the wave characteristics are investigated. Some novel findings reveal that the proposed method is highly efficient for addressing the Rayleigh waves in a QC layered half-space. It can save over 99% of the computation time. This method can be expanded to investigate waves in various layered half-spaces, including earth-layered media and surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices."
Swimming velocity of spherical squirmers in a square tube at finite fluid inertia,"The three-dimensional lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is used to simulate the motion of a spherical squirmer in a square tube, and the steady motion velocity of a squirmer with different Reynolds numbers (Re, ranging from 0.1 to 2) and swimming types is investigated and analyzed to better understand the swimming characteristics of microorganisms in different environments. First, as the Reynolds number increases, the effect of the inertial forces becomes significant, disrupting the squirmer’s ability to maintain its theoretical velocity. Specifically, as the Reynolds number increases, the structure of the flow field around the squirmer changes, affecting its velocity of motion. Notably, the swimming velocity of the squirmer exhibits a quadratic relationship with the type of swimming and the Reynolds number. Second, the narrow tube exerts a significant inhibitory effect on the squirmer motion. In addition, although chirality does not directly affect the swimming velocity of the squirmer, it can indirectly affect the velocity by changing its motion mode."
Dynamic characteristics and sensitivity analysis of a nonlinear vehicle suspension system with stochastic uncertainties,"The suspension system is an important part of a vehicle and directly affects the vehicle's comfort and stability during driving. There are various nonlinearities and uncertainties in the vehicle suspension system, and even small changes can have a significant impact on the suspension performance. This paper provides an in-depth study of quarter- and half-vehicle suspensions modeled with nonlinear springs and dampers, considering the stochastic uncertainty of various parameters. A mathematical model of a nonlinear vehicle suspension was developed to more accurately simulate the increased stiffness of suspension springs with travel and the energy consumption of dampers. The sparse grid-based polynomial chaos expansion is employed to construct the metamodels of the system response in both the frequency and time domains. This approach effectively captures the stochastic characteristics of the system response, reducing computational cost while improving accuracy. Based on polynomial metamodels, various performance indicators of the nonlinear suspension were analyzed, including statistical moments, probability distributions, and parameter sensitivities. The results are then compared and discussed, revealing that uncertainties in the nonlinear spring, sprung mass, and tire stiffness significantly impact the frequency response, time response, ride comfort, and safety. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic characteristics and behaviors of nonlinear vehicle suspensions under complex parameter uncertainties and provide a reference for enhancing suspension performance."
Optimization for sound insulation of a sandwich plate with a corrugation and auxetic honeycomb hybrid core,"A sandwich plate with a corrugation and auxetic honeycomb hybrid core is constructed, and its sound insulation and optimization are investigated. First, the motion governing equation of the sandwich plate is established by the third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT), and then combined with the fluid-structure coupling conditions, and the sound insulation is solved. The theoretical results are validated by COMSOL simulation results, and the effects of the structural parameter on the sound insulation are analyzed. Finally, the standard genetic algorithm is adopted to optimize the sound insulation of the sandwich plate."
Two-step deep learning models for detection and identification of the manufacturers and types of dental implants on panoramic radiographs,"The purpose of this study is to develop two-step deep learning models that can automatically detect implant regions on panoramic radiographs and identify several types of implants. A total of 1,574 panoramic radiographs containing 3675 implants were included. The implant manufacturers were Kyocera, Dentsply Sirona, Straumann, and Nobel Biocare. Model A was created to detect oral implants and identify the manufacturers using You Only Look Once (YOLO) v7. After preparing the image patches that cropped the implant regions detected by model A, model B was created to identify the implant types per manufacturer using EfficientNet. Model A achieved very high performance, with recall of 1.000, precision of 0.979, and F1 score of 0.989. It also had accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score of 0.98 or higher for the classification of the manufacturers. Model B had high classification metrics above 0.92, exception for Nobel’s class 2 (Parallel). In this study, two-step deep learning models were built to detect implant regions, identify four manufacturers, and identify implant types per manufacturer."
Model based deep learning method for focused ultrasound pathway scanning,"The primary purpose of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), a non-invasive medical therapy, is to precisely target and ablate tumors by focusing high-frequency ultrasound from an external power source. A series of ablations must be performed in order to treat a big volume of tumors, as a single ablation can only remove a small amount of tissue. To maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing adverse side effects such as skin burns, preoperative treatment planning is essential in determining the focal site and sonication duration for each ablation. Here, we introduce a machine learning-based approach for designing HIFU treatment plans, which makes use of a map of the material characteristics unique to a patient alongside an accurate thermal simulation. A numerical model was employed to solve the governing equations of HIFU process and to simulate the HIFU absorption mechanism, including ensuing heat transfer process and the temperature rise during the sonication period. To validate the accuracy of this numerical model, a series of tests was conducted using ex vivo bovine liver. The findings indicate that the developed models properly represent the considerable variances observed in tumor geometrical shapes and proficiently generate well-defined closed treated regions based on imaging data. The proposed strategy facilitated the formulation of high-quality treatment plans, with an average tissue over- or under-treatment rate of less than 0.06%. The efficacy of the numerical model in accurately predicting the heating process of HIFU, when combined with machine learning techniques, was validated through quantitative comparison with experimental data. The proposed approach in cooperation with HIFU simulation holds the potential to enhance presurgical HIFU plan."

Neural mechanisms of cognitive load in Multimedia Learning: a Meta-analysis of EEG frequency Band Modulation,"The implicit nature and complexity of cognitive load in multimedia learning environments make it difficult for researchers to observe it objectively. Although many studies have used electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral power to measure cognitive load in multimedia learning, different EEG frequencies, such as θ, α, β, γ, and δ, or combinations of some of these frequencies, are not consistently sensitive to cognitive load. The present study collected 58 effect sizes from 26 studies about the use of EEG frequencies to measure cognitive load in multimedia learning environments. Subgroup analysis of EEG frequencies revealed θ (r = 0.40, CI [0.31,0.48]), α (r = -0.50, CI [-0.58,-0.41]), and β (r = 0.34, CI [0.22,0.44]). Although the effects of α and its sub-bands in terms of cognitive load were more significant (in absolute values), the analysis of heterogeneity in α and some important literature suggested a preference for θ. Furthermore, the highest effect size was calculated for frontal θ / parietal α (r = 0.78, CI [0.59,0.89]). The position and number of electrodes had a borderline significant moderating effect on cognitive load measures. A number of tasks, interactivity, and type of learning resource had significant moderating effects on cognitive load measures. Meta-regression analysis indicated that sample size and mean age of subjects were not significantly or not simply linearly related to cognitive load measurements. Finally, limitations of the current meta-analysis and future approaches to cognitive load measurement are discussed."
Accurate prediction of magnetocaloric effect in NiMn-based Heusler alloys by prioritizing phase transitions through explainable machine learning,"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, magnetocaloric materials as well as other materials are being developed with increased efficiency and enhanced performance. However, most studies do not take phase transitions into account, and as a result, the predictions are usually not accurate enough. In this context, we have established an explicable relationship between alloy compositions and phase transition by feature imputation. A facile machine learning is proposed to screen candidate NiMn-based Heusler alloys with desired magnetic entropy change and magnetic transition temperature with a high accuracy R2≈0.98. As expected, the measured properties of prepared NiMn-based alloys, including phase transition type, magnetic entropy changes and transition temperature, are all in good agreement with the ML predictions. As well as being the first to demonstrate an explicable relationship between alloy compositions, phase transitions and magnetocaloric properties, our proposed ML model is highly predictive and interpretable, which can provide a strong theoretical foundation for identifying high-performance magnetocaloric materials in the future."
Correlation of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/CT response and PSA decline in first-line enzalutamide for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients,to assess the utility of response monitoring to enzalutamide by using [68Ga]Ga-PSMA PET in mCRPC patients treated with enzalutamide as first-line therapy.
CCT3/ACTN4/TFRC axis protects hepatocellular carcinoma cells from ferroptosis by inhibiting iron endocytosis,"Sorafenib is widely used in treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its effectiveness in prolonging patient survival is limited by the development of drug resistance. To systematically investigate the resistance mechanisms of Sorafenib, an integrative analysis combining posttranslational modification (PTM) omics and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout library screening was conducted. This analysis identified ubiquitination at lysine 21 (K21) on chaperonin-containing TCP1 subunit 3 (CCT3) as being associated with Sorafenib resistance. Transcriptomic data from HCC patients treated with Sorafenib revealed that CCT3 expression was lower in responders compared to non-responders. Experimentally, inhibiting the expression of CCT3 sensitized HCC cells to Sorafenib and enhanced Sorafenib-induced ferroptosis. Additionally, CCT3 was found to interact with ACTN4, hindering the recycling of transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC) to the cell membrane, thus obstructing iron endocytosis. Mechanistically, the inhibition of ferroptosis by CCT3 depends on the deubiquitination of K6-linked non-degradative ubiquitination at its K21, which occurs upon Sorafenib treatment. Moreover, CCT3 knockdown enhanced the anti-tumor effects of Sorafenib in nude mice. In summary, we have identified a novel function of the chaperone protein. Targeting the CCT3/ACTN4/TFRC axis offers a promising strategy to enhance ferroptosis and overcome Sorafenib resistance in HCC."
"A review of wire and arc additive manufacturing using different property characterization, challenges and future trends","Because of the reasonability of economically generating large-scale metal equipment with a very large rate of deposition, important development has been conducted in the learning of the “wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM)” approach also the mechanical and microstructure features of the fabricated elements. The WAAM has emerged highly so the large range of the materials has accompanied the operation and its development fighting. It has enhanced as a very significant mechanism for the large metal equipment in various manufacturing organizations. Because of its arc-assisted deposition, high process cycle time, process stability, defect monitoring, and management are severe for the WAAM device to be employed in the organization. High improvements have been performed in the development of the process, control system, comprehensive operation monitoring, material evaluation, path slicing, and programming but still, it demands the improvement. Therefore, this article aims to give a detailed review of the WAAM systems to facilitate an easy and quick understanding of the current status and future prospects of WAAM. The stage-wise implementation of WAAM, usage of metals and alloys, process parameter effects, and methodologies used for improving the quality of WAAM components are discussed. The usage of hardware systems and technological parameters used for understanding the physical mechanism are also described in this research work. In addition, the monitoring systems such as acoustic sensing, optical inspection, thermal sensing, electrical sensing, and multi-sensor sensing are analyzed and the property characterization techniques also be evaluated in this study. On the other hand, the additive as well as the subtractive technologies and the artificial intelligence techniques utilized for improving the manufacturing level are discussed. Finally, the possible future research directions are provided for making further developments in WAAM by the researchers."
Prediction models for postoperative pulmonary complications in intensive care unit patients after noncardiac thoracic surgery,"Postoperative pulmonary complication (PPC) is a leading cause of mortality and poor outcomes in postoperative patients.

This study aimed to explore the incidence and risk factors and construct prediction models for PPC in these patients."
Approach of Genetic Diversity of Lippia alba (Mill) and Petiveria alliacea L.: Medicinal Plants of Colombia,"The medicinal Lippia alba and Petiveria alliacea, originating from Central and South America, exhibit a wide range of beneficial properties, including antimicrobial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, analgesic, and antibacterial effects. However, little is known about their population structure and genetic diversity, which may hinder the establishment of their cultivation in different regions of Colombia. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the genetic diversity and population structure of 17 samples of L. alba from the departments of Tolima, Valle del Cauca, and Putumayo, as well as 31 samples of P. alliacea from the departments of Cundinamarca, Boyacá, Tolima, and Valle del Cauca. We employed restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) with the enzyme PstI. We performed denovo_map and ref_map pipeline for L. alba and identified a total of 17,036 loci and 14,562 SNPs, respectively, revealing a genetic variation of 5.19% (FST of 0.05; p < 0.001) among its populations and two delimited genetic groups. For P. alliacea, in denovo_map our analysis discovered 6395 SNPs, indicating substantial genetic variation of 75% among the studied populations (FST = 0.75; p < 0.001), resulting in the delineation of four genetic groups. Our findings will contribute to providing valuable molecular data on the populations of these medicinal plants and provide evidence of the genetic flow existing among L. alba populations, while P. alliacea populations are more structured. We also performed a FDIST analysis; for L. alba using the results with reference, we identified 37 SNPs coding for proteins in biological, molecular, and cellular processes; and finally, we highlighted the gene SASPL_104284 involved in metabolic processes."
Strengthening mechanism of different morphologies of nano-sized MSH on tribological performance of phosphate/MoS2 bonded solid lubricating coatings,"Magnesium silicate hydroxides (MSHs) with granular, schistose, and tubular morphologies were separately incorporated to enhance the tribological properties of phosphate/MoS2 composite coatings. The nano-schistose MSH demonstrated superior tribological performance due to its effective interactions with the worn surface and frictional synergies with solid lubricants. Incorporation of nano-schistose MSH decreased the friction coefficient of composite coatings by about 34.7% and increased the anti-wear performance of composite coatings by about thirteen times. Nano-schistose MSH facilitated the formation of a friction-induced multi-layer heterogenous slipping structure with layered solid lubricants at the friction interface. Moreover, tribo-chemical reactions between nano-schistose MSH and worn surface promoted the in-situ formation of a cermet supporting film, and this also induced the gradual in-situ formation of a lubrication film on the top of worn surface. Consequently, the contact state between tribo-pairs was timely regulated and the invalidation of the nanocomposite slipping structure was effectively restrained during the friction process. As a result, the service life of the phosphate composite coatings was significantly extended and further abrasion on the worn surface was notably reduced."
Unveiling Use Cases for Human Resource Mining,"Human resources are considered a strategic asset for organizations and play a key role in the execution of business processes. Hence, organizations should provide an environment that enables them to operate in an effective and efficient manner. To shape such an environment, an improved understanding and monitoring of the real-life involvement of human resources in processes and the teams in which they operate would be beneficial. Using event data from information systems, process mining can play a role in this respect. Over the years, several human resource mining methods have been developed, i.e., process mining methods that convey insights related to the human resources in a process using an event log. However, there is a lack of a holistic understanding of the breadth of these methods. Against this backdrop, the paper uses a systematic literature review to develop a framework providing an overview of human resource mining use cases. These use cases are classified according to two dimensions: the level of analysis (individual versus multiple human resources) and the focus of analysis (organization-focused versus human-focused). The authors illustrate the versatility of process mining for providing insights into human resources and highlight opportunities for further enriching and extending this area of research to analyze, among other things, how teams of resources can perform better."
Principles of Molecular Evolution: Concepts from Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics for the Multilevel Theory of Learning,"We present a non-equilibrium thermodynamics approach to the multilevel theory of learning for the study of molecular evolution. This approach allows us to study the explicit time dependence of molecular evolutionary processes and their impact on entropy production. Interpreting the mathematical expressions, we can show that two main contributions affect entropy production of molecular evolution processes which can be identified as mutation and gene transfer effects. Accordingly, our results show that the optimal adaptation of organisms to external conditions in the context of evolutionary processes is driven by principles of minimum entropy production. Such results can also be interpreted as the basis of some previous postulates of the theory of learning. Although our macroscopic approach requires certain simplifications, it allows us to interpret molecular evolutionary processes using thermodynamic descriptions with reference to well-known biological processes."
Understanding the mental health and intention to leave of the public health workforce in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study,"There is limited evidence about the mental health and intention to leave of the public health workforce in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of burnout, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and intention to leave among the Canadian public health workforce, and associations with individual and workplace factors."
Minimizing Intersection Delays: A Novel Fuzzy Logic-Based Architecture for Traffic Signal Control,"This paper proposes a new fuzzy architecture for the management of an isolated intersection. The challenge of this study is to reduce the waiting time of vehicles in the lanes compared to what exists in the state of the art. The proposed approach is based on five fuzzy logic-based controllers, four for phase management and one for phase selection. The priority of a phase is managed dynamically and intelligently through a flexible cycle. A significant gain in terms of average and cumulative vehicle waiting time is proven in the simulation results compared to other architectures presented in the literature. The performance of the developed system is proven in three different scenarios, the first one containing a low vehicle arrival rate, the second one with a medium arrival rate, and the last one in a critical case with a high arrival rate. Our findings highlight the potential of fuzzy logic-based approaches for the development of intelligent transportation systems that can help alleviate traffic congestion and improve overall urban mobility."
Comparative Efficacy of Colchicine and Intensive Low-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Lowering in Patients with Atherosclerotic Diseases receiving Statins: A Network Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,Adding intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering agents or colchicine to statin has been shown to result in additional cardiovascular benefits for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD). We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of these supplementary agents in patients with ASCVD receiving statin.
A Novel Noise Variance and SNR Estimator for OFDM-IM Systems over Nakagami-m Fading Channel,"Noise power (Variance) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are the key performance evaluation parameters of wireless communication systems. In this article, a novel algorithm is proposed that effectively estimates the noise power and SNR for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (OFDM-IM) systems operating over a time-varying Nakagami-m fading channel. The inactive subcarriers in each group of the OFDM-IM system simplify the analysis and lead to noise power estimation under ideal as well as realistic conditions of the wireless channel. At the receiver side, by using the proposed algorithm the position of inactive subcarriers can be identified effectively, as these positions are dynamic in the OFDM-IM system. Another simplified algorithm is proposed at the transmitter side for effectively transmitting the inactive subcarriers. The noise power on the sub-channel, average noise power, and average SNR are calculated. Differential noise power can also be estimated to track the channel variations effectively. None of the noise power and SNR estimators are available in the literature for the OFDM-IM systems. Hence, the performance of the proposed estimator is compared with the noise power and SNR estimators available for the classical OFDM systems. Moreover, the performance is also tested in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) using extensive computer simulations. The proposed estimator achieves significant improvements in spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and also achieves much lower computational complexity in contrast to the estimators for the classical OFDM systems."
Human herpesvirus reactivation and its potential role in the pathogenesis of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has precipitated a global pandemic with substantial long-term health implications, including the condition known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly referred to as Long COVID. PASC is marked by persistent symptoms such as fatigue, neurological issues, and autonomic dysfunction that persist for months beyond the acute phase of COVID-19. This review examines the potential role of herpesvirus reactivation, specifically Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), in the pathogenesis of PASC. Elevated antibody titers and specific T cell responses suggest recent herpesvirus reactivation in some PASC patients, although viremia is not consistently detected. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits endothelial trophism, directly affecting the vascular endothelium and contributing to microvascular pathologies. These pathologies are significant in PASC, where microvascular dysfunction may underlie various chronic symptoms. Similarly, herpesviruses like CMV also exhibit endothelial trophism, which may exacerbate endothelial damage when reactivated. Evidence suggests that EBV and CMV reactivation could indirectly contribute to the immune dysregulation, immunosenescence, and autoimmune responses observed in PASC. Additionally, EBV may play a role in the genesis of neurological symptoms through creating mitochondrial dysfunction, though direct confirmation remains elusive. The reviewed evidence suggests that while herpesviruses may not play a direct role in the pathogenesis of PASC, their potential indirect effects, especially in the context of endothelial involvement, warrant further investigation."
Intraspecific variation in leaf (poly)phenolic content of a southern hemisphere beech (Nothofagus antarctica) growing under different environmental conditions,"Nothofagus antarctica (G.Forst.) Oerst. (Ñire) leaves are a valuable source of (poly)phenolic compounds and represent a high-value non-timber product from Patagonian forests. However, information on the variability of their chemical profile is limited or non-existent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the (poly)phenolic variability in Ñire leaf infusions. To this end, different tree populations growing under different temperature regimes and soil characteristics were considered. Interestingly, a cup of Ñire leaf infusion could be considered as a rich source of quercetin. Significant differences in the (poly)phenolic content, especially in flavonoid conjugates and cinnamic acids, were found among the populations studied. These results suggest metabolic variability among the forests studied, which could be related to the species response to its growing conditions, and also provide some clues about the performance of N. antarctica under future climate scenarios. The N. antarctica forests growing in environments with lower frequency of cold and heat stress and high soil fertility showed better infusion quality. This study showed how a South American beech interacts with its local environment at the level of secondary metabolism. In addition, the information obtained is useful for defining forest management strategies in the Patagonian region."
Can minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion achieve a better clinical and radiological outcome than traditional open technique in isthmic spondylolisthesis?,"Spondylolisthesis is a prevalent condition in the lumbar spine that can cause low back pain, leg pain, neurogenic claudication, and impact health-related quality of life in symptomatic individuals."
Driver fatigue detection method based on multi-feature empirical fusion model,"As the number of long-distance commuters continues to rise, driver fatigue has become a major contributor to traffic accidents, underscoring the critical need for real-time fatigue detection and prevention. Facial expressions serve as crucial indicators that directly reflect the driver's fatigue state, which may vary due to individual differences. This paper presents a comprehensive visual monitoring approach for real-time driver fatigue detection. The proposed method uses a vehicle-mounted camera to extract the driver's facial features through an empirical multi-feature fusion model. By determining appropriate thresholds based on individual driving habits and conditions, the algorithm maps multi-dimensional facial behaviors to corresponding Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) scores and fatigue levels, accurately identifying four states: awake, mild fatigue, moderate fatigue, and severe fatigue. Evaluated on a dataset of 2,555 validated samples obtained from real-world driving conditions, the method demonstrated an impressive average accuracy of 98.35% during both training and experimentation. Furthermore, a comparative analysis against state-of-the-art fatigue detection algorithms on a self- curated dataset revealed that the proposed approach achieved the highest average accuracy of 98.9%, with lower computational requirements and a lighter weight. The mean average precision (mAP) was 1.6% higher than the lightweight Efficient Det-D2, while also having fewer model parameters and reduced computational complexity."
Tyramine as a possible virulence factor in Melissococcus plutonius,"European foulbrood is one of the primary diseases in bee larvae (Apis mellifera). Its causal agent, Melissococcus plutonius, has been classified into three clonal complexes (CC12, CC3, and CC13), showing phenotypic variations among their virulence. The pathogenic mechanisms of the clonal complexes used to kill larvae are not fully understood. Tyramine, a monoamine used by some bacteria to adapt to stress conditions, could be a potential virulence factor of M. plutonius. Therefore, the ability of M. plutonius to produce tyramine was evaluated in this study using biochemical and genetic tools, in addition to the quantification of tyramine by HPLC in each clonal complex. CC12 showed high tyramine production and better adaptability to acidic environments than CC3 and CC13. Additionally, the toxicity of tyramine in bee larvae was evaluated by determining an LD50 of 0.172 mg/mL. These results show the influence that tyramine may have in the first steps of the pathogenicity process of M. plutonius, allowing it to better survive in acidic environments."
Leveraging local data sampling strategies to improve federated learning,"Federated learning (FL) facilitates shared training of machine learning models while maintaining data privacy. Unfortunately, it suffers from data imbalance among participating clients, causing the performance of the shared model to drop. To diminish the negative effects of unfavourable data-specific properties, both algorithm- and data-based approaches seek to make FL more resilient against them. In this regard, data-based approaches prove to be more versatile and require less domain knowledge to be applied efficiently. Hence, they seem particularly suitable for widespread application in various FL environments. Although data-based approaches such as local data sampling have been applied to FL in the past, previous research did not provide a systematic analysis of the potential and limitations of individual data sampling strategies to improve FL. To this end, we (1) identify relevant local data sampling strategies applicable to FL systems, (2) identify data-specific properties that negatively affect FL system performance, and (3) provide a benchmark of local data sampling strategies regarding their effect on model performance, convergence, and training time in synthetic, real-world, and large-scale FL environments. Moreover, we propose and rigorously test a novel method for data sampling in FL that locally optimizes the choice of sampling strategy prior to FL participation. Our results show that FL can greatly benefit from applying local data sampling in terms of performance and convergence rate, especially when data imbalance is high or the number of clients and samples is low. Furthermore, our proposed sampling strategy offers the best trade-off between model performance and training time."
Influence of inertia relief analysis on the topological optimisation of unconstrained structures,"The growth in build volumes of additive manufacturing (AM) printers has enabled the manufacture of larger and more complex products, such as drones, known as unconstrained structures. This necessitates advanced optimisation techniques to achieve optimal designs. Inertia relief (IR) is a solution for analysing these structures by leveraging their inertial properties while considering concentrated non-structural masses. Unfortunately, designers often overlook the benefits of IR due to a lack of understanding, a preference for static techniques involving boundary conditions (BCs), or the absence of a methodology for IR. Existing literature lacks sufficient comparison and documentation of the mechanical performance losses resulting from the application of BCs instead of IR. Therefore, this study provides a detailed comparison of BC and IR designs, highlighting the advantages in terms of compliance, stress fields, and eigenfrequency performance. Additionally, based on the findings, it proposes a comprehensive design and optimization methodology tailored for IR + TO, demonstrating its advantages through a case study. Applied to the redesign of a drone structure, results reveal that IR-optimized designs achieve a mass saving of 13%, with up to 53% lower compliance and 12%–32% lower stress values compared to BC-optimized designs. Those significant differences highlight the crucial role of IR in achieving optimal designs for unconstrained systems. Besides, these findings underscore the enhanced mechanical performance and potential for material savings in IR + TO, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application. This research provides valuable insights and practical guidelines for engineers and designers aiming to optimize complex structures for AM."
Digital-Triplet: a new three entities digital-twin paradigm for equipment fault diagnosis,"Current equipment fault diagnosis faces challenges due to the difficulties in arranging sensors to collect effective data and obtaining diverse fault data for studying fault mechanisms. The lack of data results in disconnection between data from different spaces, posing a challenge to forming a closed loop of data and hindering the development of digital twin (DT) driven fault diagnosis (FD). To address these issues, a new DT paradigm Digital-Triplet is proposed. This paradigm comprises three entities: a physical entity, a semi-physical entity, and a virtual entity. A semi-physical entity is created by implementing the ""six-D"" process on the physical entity. A new six dimensional structure is formed through the addition of the semi-physical entity. The new structure streamlines the construction of fault datasets, enhances sensor data acquisition, and tightly links different data spaces, thereby promoting the application of DT in equipment FD. Subsequently, the elevator is selected as a case study to illustrate the Digital-Triplet framework in detail. The results demonstrate that the Digital-Triplet framework can effectively expand the fault dataset and improve data collection efficiency through optimized sensor placement, thereby promoting fault diagnosis."
Evaluation of newly synthesized 2-(thiophen-2-yl)-1H-indole derivatives as anticancer agents against HCT-116 cell proliferation via cell cycle arrest and down regulation of miR-25,"In the present study, we prepared new sixteen different derivatives. The first series were prepared (methylene)bis(2-(thiophen-2-yl)-1H-indole) derivatives which have (indole and thiophene rings) by excellent yield from the reaction (2 mmol) 2-(thiophen-2-yl)-1H-indole and (1 mmol) from aldehyde. The second series were synthesized (2-(thiophen-2-yl)-1H-indol-3-yl) methyl) aniline derivatives at a relatively low yield from multicomponent reaction of three components 2-(thiophen-2-yl)-1H-indole, N-methylaniline and desired aldehydes. The anticancer effect of the newly synthesized derivatives was determined against different cancers, colon, lung, breast and skin. The counter screening was done against normal Epithelial cells (RPE-1). The effect on cell cycle and mechanisms underlying of the antitumor effect were also studied. All new compounds were initially tested at a single dose of 100 μg/ml against this panel of 5 human tumor cell lines indicated that the compounds under investigation exhibit selective cytotoxicity against HCT-116 cell line and compounds (4g, 4a, 4c) showed potent anticancer activity against HCT-116 cell line with the inhibitory concentration IC50 values were, 7.1±0.07, 10.5± 0.07 and 11.9± 0.05 μΜ/ml respectively. Also, the active derivatives caused cell cycle arrest at the S and G2/M phase with significant(p < 0.0001) increase in the expression levels of tumor suppressors miR-30C, and miR-107 and a tremendous decrease in oncogenic miR-25, IL-6 and C-Myc levels. It is to conclude that the anticancer activity could be through direct interaction with tumor cell DNA like S-phase-dependent chemotherapy drugs. Which can interact with DNA or block DNA synthesis such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, or 5-fluorouracil and which were highly effective in killing the cancer cells. This data ensures the efficiency of the 3 analogues on inducing cell cycle arrest and preventing cancer cell growth. The altered expressions explained the molecular mechanisms through which the newly synthesized analogues exert their anticancer action."
Synthesis and Analysis of Novel Polyamide COF-TH as a Potent Anticancer Delivery Vehicle Under Variable pH Conditions,"In this work, novel polyamide inked covalent organic frameworks—terepthalde hydrazine (COF-TH)—have been explored for selected anticancer drug delivery applications (DDA). Initially, trimesoyl chloride and terepthalic dihydrazine were used to synthesize novel covalent organic frameworks—terepthalde dihydrazine (COF-TH) in 1,4 dioxane under standard room temperature (RT) conditions. Different microscopic and spectroscopic analysis techniques confirmed the novel lab. synthesized and unique structural confirmations COF-TH. Before exploring the drug release analysis, the cytotoxicity of COF-TH and selected drug@COF-TH was investigated in mouse fibroblast (L929) and human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) cell lines. The resultant porous structure is ideally suited for efficiently encapsulating three vital anticancer drugs: DOX, 5-FU, and cisplatin. Furthermore, drug release kinetics (DRK) study has been investigated through varying pH solutions from neutral to acidic medium. These findings underline COF-TH’s significant potential in advancing drug delivery systems, offering the promise of improved therapeutic interventions. With its dual functionality encompassing both drug delivery and inherent anticancer properties, COF-TH emerges as a powerful tool for elevating the outcomes of cancer treatment, presenting a multifaceted approach to advancing the field of oncology."
Supporting treatment adherence for resilience and thriving (START): protocol for a mHealth randomized controlled trial,"Although behavioral interventions show some promise for reducing stimulant use and achieving durable viral suppression in sexual minority men (SMM) with HIV, scalable mHealth applications are needed to optimize their reach and cost-effectiveness."
Commutative Poisson algebras from deformations of noncommutative algebras,"It is well-known that a formal deformation of a commutative algebra \(\mathcal {A}\) leads to a Poisson bracket on \(\mathcal {A}\) and that the classical limit of a derivation on the deformation leads to a derivation on \(\mathcal {A}\), which is Hamiltonian with respect to the Poisson bracket. In this paper we present a generalization of it for formal deformations of an arbitrary noncommutative algebra \(\mathcal {A}\). The deformation leads in this case to a Poisson algebra structure on \(\Pi (\mathcal {A}){:}{=}Z(\mathcal {A})\times (\mathcal {A}/Z(\mathcal {A}))\) and to the structure of a \(\Pi (\mathcal {A})\)-Poisson module on \(\mathcal {A}\). The limiting derivations are then still derivations of \(\mathcal {A}\), but with the Hamiltonian belong to \(\Pi (\mathcal {A})\), rather than to \(\mathcal {A}\). We illustrate our construction with several cases of formal deformations, coming from known quantum algebras, such as the ones associated with the nonabelian Volterra chains, Kontsevich integrable map, the quantum plane and the quantized Grassmann algebra."
Analysis of oceanic suspended particulate matter in the western North Pacific using the complex amplitude sensor,"Oceanic suspended particulate matter (SPM) plays important roles in the coupling of climate and biogeochemical cycles via ocean–atmosphere interactions. However, methods for quantifying the properties of SPM in seawater have not yet been well established. Here we present the application of the recently developed complex amplitude sensor (CAS) for analyzing the complex forward-scattering amplitude of individual SPM (0.2–5.0 µm in diameter) obtained at depths of 0–100 m during a research cruise in the western North Pacific. The measured distribution of the complex amplitude indicated that the CAS-derived SPM data could be roughly classified into five major types. Comparison with reference sample’s complex amplitude data and scanning electron microscopy analysis suggested that these types could be attributed mainly to diatom fragments, carbonaceous materials (likely organic matter), mineral dusts, iron oxides, or black carbon. Depth profiles revealed that relatively high concentrations of SPM, presumably dominated by diatom fragments and carbonaceous materials with peak diameters of 0.7–1.0 µm, were typically associated with elevated turbidities and chlorophyll a concentrations. Based on this case study, we discuss the practical advantages and limitations of using the CAS to measure size-resolved concentrations of SPM in seawater and to characterize its composition."
"Bioefficacy and molecular characterization of Bacillus thuringiensis strain NBAIR BtGa against greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella L.","Galleria mellonella, the greater wax moth has always been an important pest against honeybees and has remained a nightmare for beekeeping farmers. Management of G. mellonella in live honeybee colonies is very difficult because most current management practices can destroy whole honeybee colonies. In the present study, experiments were conducted to isolate and characterize Bacillus thuringiensis from infected greater wax moth cadavers and to evaluate their biocontrol ability against G. mellonella. The bioefficacy of these isolates has been evaluated against greater wax moth along with the standard strain HD-1. Among all the strains tested, NBAIR BtGa demonstrated higher efficacy compared to other strains, with an LC50 value of 125.17 µg/ml, whereas HD-1 exhibited a significantly higher LC50 value of 946.61 µg/ml. Considering the economic importance of NBAIR BtGa we performed whole genome sequencing of this strain resulting in the identification of a genome size of 5.96 Mb consisting of 6888 protein-coding genes. Gene ontology analysis categorized these genes into three groups based on their roles, i.e., biological functions (2169 genes), cellular components (1900 genes), and molecular functions (2774 genes). Through insecticidal toxicity-related genes (ITRG) profiling of our strain across the genome by Bt toxin scanner and cry processor resulted in the identification of several Cry proteins namely Cry1Ab11, Cry1Ia44, Cry1Aa2, Cry2Af1, Cry1Da2, Cry1Eb1, Cry1Ab5, Cry1Cb2, Cry1Ac2. Besides Cry proteins, other ITRG genes, viz. Vip3Bb2, Zwittermicin A resistance proteins, Chitinase C, Mpp46Ab1, immune inhibitor A, Bmp1, Vpb4Ca1, and Spp1Aa1 were also reported, which show toxicity against lepidopteran pests. The studies were also conducted to test the biosafety of Bt toxins against honeybee larvae and adults, which showed strain NBAIR BtGa was more than 99% safer for honeybee larvae as well as adults. Thus, the data generated ascertains its effectiveness as a biocontrol agent and it can be used further for the development of bio formulation for the management of G. mellonella in honeybee colonies."
"Tribological behavior of TiN, AlTiN, and AlTiCrN coatings in atmospheric and vacuum environments","In this study, the tribological characteristics of TiN, AlTiN, and AlTiCrN coatings sliding against a SUS420J1 stainless steel pin were investigated in atmospheric and vacuum environments. The coatings were deposited on SUS440C substrates using the arc-physical vapor deposition technique. The friction and wear behavior of the coatings were evaluated based on the systematic analyses of the friction coefficient data as well as the physical and chemical state of the wear track. The results revealed that the friction coefficients of the SUS440C specimen and AlTiCrN coatings increased, whereas those of the TiN and AlTiN coatings decreased when the environment was changed from atmospheric to vacuum. It was confirmed that the formation of an oxide layer and adsorption of oxides on the surface were dominant factors that influenced the tribological behavior in the atmospheric environment. On the other hand, the compatibility, oxidation inhibition, and droplets of the surface mainly affected the frictional characteristics in the vacuum environment. The results of this work are expected to aid in the selection of proper coating materials for tribological systems operating in a vacuum."
p53 Orchestrates Cancer Metabolism: Unveiling Strategies to Reverse the Warburg Effect,"Cancer cells exhibit significant alterations in their metabolism, characterised by a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and an increased reliance on glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen. This metabolic shift, known as the Warburg effect, is pivotal in fuelling cancer’s uncontrolled growth, invasion, and therapeutic resistance. While dysregulation of many genes contributes to this metabolic shift, the tumour suppressor gene p53 emerges as a master player. Yet, the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. This study introduces a comprehensive mathematical model, integrating essential p53 targets, offering insights into how p53 orchestrates its targets to redirect cancer metabolism towards an OXPHOS-dominant state. Simulation outcomes align closely with experimental data comparing glucose metabolism in colon cancer cells with wild-type and mutated p53. Additionally, our findings reveal the dynamic capability of elevated p53 activation to fully reverse the Warburg effect, highlighting the significance of its activity levels not just in triggering apoptosis (programmed cell death) post-chemotherapy but also in modifying the metabolic pathways implicated in treatment resistance. In scenarios of p53 mutations, our analysis suggests targeting glycolysis-instigating signalling pathways as an alternative strategy, whereas targeting solely synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2) does support mitochondrial respiration but may not effectively suppress the glycolysis pathway, potentially boosting the energy production and cancer cell viability."
Unveiling the potential of machine learning approaches in predicting the emergence of stroke at its onset: a predicting framework,"A stroke is a dangerous, life-threatening disease that mostly affects people over 65, but an unhealthy diet is also contributing to the development of strokes at younger ages. Strokes can be treated successfully if they are identified early enough, and suitable therapies are available. The purpose of this study is to develop a stroke prediction model that will improve stroke prediction effectiveness as well as accuracy. Predicting whether someone is suffering from a stroke or not can be accomplished with this proposed machine learning algorithm. In this research, various machine learning techniques are evaluated for predicting stroke on the healthcare stroke dataset. The feature selection algorithms used here are gradient boosting and random forest, and classifiers include the decision tree classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, logistic regression classifier, gradient boosting classifier, random forest classifier, K neighbors classifier, and Xtreme gradient boosting classifier. In this process, different machine-learning approaches are employed to test predictive methods on different data samples. As a result obtained from the different methods applied, and the comparison of different classification models, the random forest model offers an accuracy rate of 98%."
Administration of anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies with increased affinity to Fcγ receptors during acute SHIVAD8-EO infection,"Anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have the dual potential of mediating virus neutralization and antiviral effector functions through their Fab and Fc domains, respectively. So far, bNAbs with enhanced Fc effector functions in vitro have only been tested in NHPs during chronic simian-HIV (SHIV) infection. Here, we investigate the effects of administering in acute SHIVAD8-EO infection either wild-type (WT) bNAbs or bNAbs carrying the S239D/I332E/A330L (DEL) mutation, which increases binding to FcγRs. Emergence of virus in plasma and lymph nodes (LNs) was delayed by bNAb treatment and occurred earlier in monkeys given DEL bNAbs than in those given WT bNAbs, consistent with faster clearance of DEL bNAbs from plasma. DEL bNAb-treated monkeys had higher levels of circulating virus-specific IFNγ single-producing CD8+ CD69+ T cells than the other groups. In LNs, WT bNAbs were evenly distributed between follicular and extrafollicular areas, but DEL bNAbs predominated in the latter. At week 8 post-challenge, LN monocytes and NK cells from DEL bNAb-treated monkeys upregulated proinflammatory signaling pathways and LN T cells downregulated TNF signaling via NF-κB. Overall, bNAbs with increased affinity to FcγRs shape innate and adaptive cellular immunity, which may be important to consider in future strategies of passive bNAb therapy."
Acquisition parameters influence AI recognition of race in chest x-rays and mitigating these factors reduces underdiagnosis bias,"A core motivation for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is to reduce existing healthcare disparities. Yet, recent studies have demonstrated two distinct findings: (1) AI models can show performance biases in underserved populations, and (2) these same models can be directly trained to recognize patient demographics, such as predicting self-reported race from medical images alone. Here, we investigate how these findings may be related, with an end goal of reducing a previously identified underdiagnosis bias. Using two popular chest x-ray datasets, we first demonstrate that technical parameters related to image acquisition and processing influence AI models trained to predict patient race, where these results partly reflect underlying biases in the original clinical datasets. We then find that mitigating the observed differences through a demographics-independent calibration strategy reduces the previously identified bias. While many factors likely contribute to AI bias and demographics prediction, these results highlight the importance of carefully considering data acquisition and processing parameters in AI development and healthcare equity more broadly."
RPA transforms RNase H1 to a bidirectional exoribonuclease for processive RNA–DNA hybrid cleavage,"RNase H1 has been acknowledged as an endoribonuclease specializing in the internal degradation of the RNA moiety within RNA–DNA hybrids, and its ribonuclease activity is indispensable in multifaceted aspects of nucleic acid metabolism. However, the molecular mechanism underlying RNase H1-mediated hybrid cleavage remains inadequately elucidated. Herein, using single-molecule approaches, we probe the dynamics of the hybrid cleavage by Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase H1. Remarkably, a single RNase H1 enzyme displays 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease activity. The directional RNA degradation proceeds processively and yet discretely, wherein unwinding approximately 6-bp hybrids as a prerequisite for two consecutive 3-nt RNA excisions limits the overall rate within each catalytic cycle. Moreover, Replication Protein A (RPA) reinforces RNase H1’s 3′-to-5′ nucleolytic rate and processivity and stimulates its 5′-to-3′ exoribonuclease activity. This stimulation is primarily realized through the pre-separation of the hybrids and consequently transfers RNase H1 to a bidirectional exoribonuclease, further potentiating its cleavage efficiency. These findings unveil unprecedented characteristics of an RNase and provide a dynamic view of RPA-enhanced processive hybrid cleavage by RNase H1."
Modelling spatiotemporal patterns of wildfire risk in the Garden Route District biodiversity hotspots using analytic hierarchy process in South Africa,"The increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires necessitate effective risk management in biodiversity hotspots to mitigate the potential impacts of wildfire hazards. The study utilised a multi-criteria decision analysis-analytic hierarchy process (MCDA-AHP) model to analyse wildfire risk patterns in the Garden Route District (GRD), focusing on biodiversity hotspots in the Western Cape, South Africa. The study used weight assignment and overlay analysis to evaluate wildfire risk factors, including human, topographic, and climatic factors, using data from Landsat and WorldClim from 1991 to 2021. The wildfire risk model was validated using MODIS historical fire data from the Global Forest Watch database and Confusion Matrix, with the burned area extent identified using differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). The results show that despite 53% of the most burned area, only 12% was burned, with the high-risk zone accounting for only 11%, indicating a higher likelihood of wildfires spreading and intensifying. The results reveal a weak positive correlation (r = 0.28) between historical fire occurrences and burned areas and a negative correlation (r = − 0.27) between historical fire occurrences and fire seasons. Human and climatic factors significantly impact wildfire propagation in high-risk zones, while topographic factors have less influence, indicating a lower risk of ignition. The findings show that 26% of high-risk zones in the southwestern region dominated GRD biodiversity hotspots, while 27% were in the low-moderate-risk zone in the northwestern parts. The results of this study can aid in assigning fire risk-based criterion weights to support decision-makers in regional and global wildfire prevention and management."
Identification of SDG gene family members and exploration of flowering related genes in different cultivars of chrysanthemums and their wild ancestors,"The SET domain genes (SDGs) are significant contributors to various aspects of plant growth and development, mainly includes flowering, pollen development, root growth, regulation of the biological clock and branching patterns. To clarify the biological functions of the chrysanthemum SDG family, the SDG family members of four chrysanthemum cultivars and three related wild species were identified; their physical and chemical properties, protein domains and conserved motifs were predicted and analyzed. The results showed that 59, 67, 67, 102, 106, 114, and 123 SDGs were identified from Chrysanthemum nankingense, Chrysanthemum lavandulifolium, Chrysanthemum seticuspe, Chrysanthemum × morifolium cv. ‘Hechengxinghuo’, ‘Zhongshanzigui’, ‘Quanxiangshuichang’ and ‘Jinbeidahong’, respectively. The SDGs were divided into 5–7 subfamilies by cluster analysis; different conserved motifs were observed in particular families. The SDGs of C. lavandulifolium and C. seticuspe were distributed unevenly on 9 chromosomes. SDG promoters of different species include growth and development, photo-response, stress response and hormone responsive elements, among them, the cis-acting elements related to MeJA response had the largest proportion. The expression of chrysanthemum SDG genes was observed for most variable selected genes which has close association with important Arabidopsis thaliana genes related to flowering regulation. The qPCR results showed that the expression trend of SDG genes varied in different tissues at different growth stages with high expression in the flowering period. The ClSDG29 showed higher expression in the flower and bud tissues, which indicate that ClSDG29 might be associated with flowering regulation in chrysanthemum. In summary, the results of this study can provide a basis for subsequent research on chrysanthemum flowering time regulation."
Blood glucose control among type 2 diabetic farmers in Chinese resettlement areas: a mixed methods study,"Due to China’s rapid urbanization, many farmers have relocated to urban resettlement regions. There is limited research on the glycemic control of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) farmers in these areas. This study examined their blood glucose control and its determinants."
Removal of antibiotics from aqueous solutions: insights of competitive adsorption onto Ni-impregnated biochar of spent coffee grounds,"Antibiotics are among the most widely used pharmaceutically active compounds. Possessing the capability to adversely impact the ecological system, existence of antibiotics in the environment is an escalating concern. With the purpose of removing two widely used antibiotics efficiently from aqueous solutions, the competency of two biochar (BC)-based sorbents derived from spent coffee (SC) grounds was investigated. Both pristine (SCBC) and nickel (II) oxide-impregnated (Ni-SCBC) biochars were utilized as sustainable and cost-effective sorbents to remove daunorubicin (DAYN) and tigecycline (TIGY) from single synthetic aqueous solutions and binary combinations. Batch adsorption experiments were controlled implementing Box–Behnken design. The removal efficiency of Ni-SCBC was superior compared to SCBC (TIGY: 67.06%, DAYN: 94.30%). Results of characterizations showed that impregnation with NiO changed the degree of crystallization with a remarkable increase in the surface area from 49.23 m2/g in SCBC to 86.06 m2/g in Ni-SCBC. Adsorption of DAYN and TIGY (single solutions) conformed well to Freundlich, and Langmuir isotherms, respectively. A maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) of 136.62 mg/g (DAYN) and 73.15 mg/g (TIGY) was reported in single solutions, compared to 23.50 mg/g (DAYN) and 58.42 mg/g (TIGY) in binary mixture. Adsorption kinetics onto Ni-SCBC fitted well with the pseudo-second-order (PSO) and Elovich models. Acquired results demonstrated that SCBC and Ni-SCBC are promising adsorbents for remedying antibiotics."
On an isotropic porous solid cylinder: the analytical solution and sensitivity analysis of the pressure,"Within this work, we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the influence of the material input parameters on the pressure in an isotropic porous solid cylinder. We provide a step-by-step guide to obtain the analytical solution for a porous isotropic elastic cylinder in terms of the pressure, stresses, and elastic displacement. We obtain the solution by performing a Laplace transform on the governing equations, which are those of Biot’s poroelasticity in cylindrical polar coordinates. We enforce radial boundary conditions and obtain the solution in the Laplace transformed domain before reverting back to the time domain. The sensitivity analysis is then carried out, considering only the derived pressure solution. This analysis finds that the time t, Biot’s modulus M, and Poisson’s ratio v have the highest influence on the pressure whereas the initial value of pressure P0 plays a very little role."
Energy efficient 5 Gb/s baseband transceiver for 3D memory interconnect,"Three-dimensional (3D) memory integration presents challenges in achieving high data rates while maintaining low power consumption and signal integrity. This article introduces an energy-efficient I/O Baseband (BB) transceiver architecture designed to address these challenges. The proposed architecture utilizes high-speed drivers and through-silicon vias (TSVs) to establish short, vertical interconnects between transmitter (TX, tier 1) and receiver (RX, tier 2). A low-dropout voltage regulator (LDO) is integrated to enhance signal integrity by minimizing supply noises. The design is simulated using a 3D EM solver tool, HFSS, to model and optimize TSV channels with S-parameters. Implemented in 130 nm CMOS technology, the compact TX and RX occupy a layout area of 0.18 mm2. Simulation results demonstrate a robust performance with a data rate of 5.8 Gb/s at a low 1.1-V supply voltage, consuming only 4.62 mW of power. This work contributes a novel approach to efficient 3D memory interconnects, emphasizing high performance and energy efficiency for next-generation mobile memory interfaces."
"The combined effect of physical exercise, pranayama, and diet on fatigue in adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy: a randomized controlled trial","Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy continue to experience significant fatigue, which affects their quality of life. The present study aims to evaluate the combined effect of comprehensive physical exercise, pranayama (regulated breathing practices of yoga), and dietary support intervention on fatigue in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy."
Cytokines profile in gingival crevicular fluid of subjects wearing fixed dental prostheses: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Fixed dental prostheses (FDP) can affect the production of inflammatory cytokines causing damage to periodontal tissues. A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out with the following two objectives: (1) to determine the prevalence and function of the different inflammatory cytokines present in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of teeth with metal–ceramic (M/C) and all-ceramic (A-Cs) prostheses, and (2) to analyze and compare the levels of inflammatory cytokines in GCF of teeth with M/C and A-Cs prostheses."
Advantages of customization of osseointegrated implants in transfemoral amputees: a comparative analysis of surgical planning,"Commercially available osseointegrated devices for transfemoral amputees are limited in size and thus fail to meet the significant anatomical variability in the femoral medullary canal. This study aimed to develop a customized osseointegrated stem to better accommodate a variety of femoral anatomies in transfemoral amputees than off-the-shelf stems. Customization is expected to enhance cortical bone preservation and increase the stem-bone contact area, which are critical for the long-term stability and success of implants."
The relationship between parental autonomy support and adolescents’ academic achievement in mathematics—the mediating role of the need for cognition and mathematics metacognition,"This study aimed to explore the relationship between parental autonomy support and adolescents’ academic performance in mathematics and to examine the mediating roles of the need for cognition and mathematical metacognition in this relationship. A total of 1,268 secondary school students from Grades 7 to 10 completed the survey questionnaires. The findings revealed two key points: (1) there was a small but significant positive correlation between parental autonomy support and mathematics academic achievement across the entire sample (r = 0.09, p < 0.01), with the correlation being highest in Grade 9 (r = 0.19, p < 0.01); and (2) parental autonomy support influenced academic achievement in mathematics through the mediation of the need for cognition and mathematical metacognition, with a total effect size of 0.13."
IAA is more effective than EDTA in enhancing phytoremediation potential for cadmium and copper contaminated soils,"Enhanced phytoremediation offers a rapid and eco-friendly approach for cleaning agricultural soil contaminated with copper and cadmium which pose a direct threat to food scarcity and security. The current study aimed to compare the effectiveness of the two commonly used additives, IAA and EDTA, for the remediation of copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) contaminated soils using sunflower and maize. The plants were cultivated in pots under controlled conditions with four sets of treatments: control (0), Cu50/Cd50, Cu50/Cd50 + EDTA, and Cu50/Cd50 + IAA. The results showed that Cu50/Cd50 mg/kg drastically compromised the phytoremediation potential of both plants, as evident by reduced shoot and root length, and lower biomass. However, the augmentation of Cu50/Cd50 with EDTA or IAA improved the tested parameters. In sunflower, EDTA enhanced the accumulation of Cu and Cd by 58% and 21%, respectively, and improved plant biomass by 41%, compared to control treatment. However, IAA exhibited higher accumulation of Cu and Cd by 64% and 25%, respectively, and enhanced plant biomass by 43%. In case of maize, IAA was superior to EDTA which enhanced the accumulation of Cu and Cd by 87% and 32% respectively, and increased the plant biomass by 57%, compared to control treatment. Our findings demonstrate that foliar IAA is more effective than EDTA in enhancing the phytoremediation potential of sunflower and maize for Cu and Cd."
Prevalence of muscle atrophy in pediatric patients during ICU hospitalization,"To evaluate the muscle thickness and prevalence of muscle atrophy of the biceps brachii/brachialis (BB) and quadriceps femoris (QF) in critically ill children using ultrasound (US). The prospective longitudinal study was conducted in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary hospital in southern Brazil with children and adolescents of both sexes, aged 1 month to 12 years, on invasive mechanical ventilation for 24 h. US measurements were taken up to 24 h after admission, 72 h after, and weekly until discharge from the PICU. One hundred one patients were selected, of whom 97 underwent two evaluations, 68 three evaluations, and 26 four ultrasound evaluations. The median age was 6 months, with 63 (62.4%) < 1 year old. The most prevalent clinical diagnosis was respiratory diseases (70.3%). There was a reduction in BB thickness from 1 to 2 weeks (− 0.10 cm, p = 0.009) and in QF from 24 h to 2 weeks (− 0.20 cm, p = 0.013) and 72 h to 2 weeks (− 0.18 cm, p = 0.045). The prevalence of muscle atrophy (decrease > 10% in thickness) was 41.2% in at least one muscle group between 24 and 72 h, 39.7% between 24 h and 1 week, and 59.3% between 24 h and 2 weeks. The US allows the evaluation of BB and QF muscle thickness in critically ill children, and monitoring muscles during PICU hospitalization is important. The prevalence of muscle atrophy was 30.8% in the biceps brachii and 46.2% in the quadriceps femoris at the end of 2 weeks of PICU hospitalization, regardless of age and diagnosis."
Effects of intraoperative different fluid therapy protocols on postoperative renal functions,"Planning intraoperative fluid therapy in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery is important.

A novel dual-level multi-source information fusion approach for multicriteria decision making applications,"The objective of this paper is to propose a novel dual-level multisource information fusion approach for handling open multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) issues related to accurately determining the weights of criteria while considering the relative importance of expert opinions, handling heterogeneous information, and selecting an appropriate MCDM ranking method. The proposed approach includes two levels. The first integrates the “analytic hierarchy process (AHP)—full consistency method (FUCOM)”, which comprises two phases. In the first phase, criteria weights are assigned using AHP, and FUCOM is employed to correct inconsistencies. In the second phase, the weights are computed for decision-makers. Triangular fuzzy numbers are employed due to their ability to encapsulate all the utilized heterogeneous data types. At the second level of the approach, three well-known distance-based methods, including “technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution”, “visekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno resenje”, and “multiattributive border approximation area comparison”, are fused to process a homogeneous decision matrix and provide comprehensive and robust rankings for alternatives. To develop our novel approach, a renewable energy source for Pakistan's electricity generation is adopted as a case study. The decision matrix contains four alternatives (i.e., hydropower, biomass energy, solar energy, and wind energy) and six main evaluation criteria (i.e., economic, quality of energy, social, political, environmental, and technical), with several subevaluation criteria under each criterion. The findings of the proposed approach were as follows: A2 was in the first rank with a score of 1.7889, and A4 was in the last rank with a score of 0.1199. The rest of the alternatives were distributed between them. The paper’s implications include the advancement of decision-making methods, enhancement of decision-making outcomes, and addressing heterogeneous information to highlight the relative importance of experts."
Comprehensive analysis of mathematical model of HIV/AIDS incorporating fisher-folk community,"The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a pathogen that specifically targets the human immune system, leading to a more advanced condition known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) when it significantly compromises the body’s immune defences. In this research, a comprehensive mathematical model for HIV/AIDS has been developed, encompassing the dynamics within both the general population and the fisher-folk population. Utilizing the next-generation matrix method, we calculate the basic reproduction number (\({R}_{0}\)), a crucial metric that quantifies the rate of HIV transmission. Through bifurcation analysis, we have explored the implications of varying \({\eta }^{*}\) and \({\eta }_{F}^{*}\), serving as bifurcation parameters, at the critical threshold where \({R}_{0}=1\). A sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number \({R}_{0}\) is conducted for both the general community and the fisherfolk community. For the general community, the sensitivity parameters are \(\eta\), \({\omega }_{F}\), \(\phi\), and \({\eta }_{F}\). For the fisher-folk community, the sensitivity parameters are \(\eta\), \(\omega\), \({\phi }_{F}\), and \({\eta }_{F}\). This analysis enhances our understanding of the factors influencing HIV transmission rates. Using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion and Castillo Chavez's approach, we have demonstrated the HIV-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable and globally asymptotically stable when \({R}_{0}<1\), respectively. Furthermore, the research explores the graphical behavior of both the general and fisher-folk communities, providing insights into their respective dynamics."
Daily PM2.5 concentration prediction based on variational modal decomposition and deep learning for multi-site temporal and spatial fusion of meteorological factors,"Air pollution, particularly PM2.5, has long been a critical concern for the atmospheric environment. Accurately predicting daily PM2.5 concentrations is crucial for both environmental protection and public health. This study introduces a new hybrid model within the “Decomposition-Prediction-Integration” (DPI) framework, which combines variational modal decomposition (VMD), causal convolutional neural network (CNN), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and attention mechanism (AM), named as VCBA, for spatio-temporal fusion of multi-site data to forecast daily PM2.5 concentrations in a city. The approach involves integrating air quality data from the target site with data from neighboring sites, applying mathematical techniques for dimensionality reduction, decomposing PM2.5 concentration data using VMD, and utilizing Causal CNN and BiLSTM models with an attention mechanism to enhance performance. The final prediction results are obtained through linear aggregation. Experimental results demonstrate that the VCBA model performs exceptionally well in predicting daily PM2.5 concentrations at various stations in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, China. Evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R2 are reported as 2.556, 1.998, and 0.973, respectively. Compared to traditional methods, this approach offers higher prediction accuracy and stronger spatio-temporal modeling capabilities, providing an effective solution for accurate PM2.5 daily concentration prediction."
LC–MS/MS phenolic profileand remedial role of Urtica dioica extract against Li2CO3-induced toxicity,"In this study, the protective role of Urtica dioica extract (Udex) against Li2CO3 toxicity in Allium cepa L. was investigated using various parameters such as germination rates, root growth, weight gain, mitotic index (MI), malondialdehyde (MDA), micronucleus (MN), antioxidant enzyme activity, chromosomal abnormalities (CAs) and anatomical changes. As the biological activity of Udex is related to its active content, the profile of phenolic compounds was determined by LC–MS/MS analysis. Li2CO3 caused abnormalities in the tested parameters and serious regressions in germination parameters. Application of 100 mg/L Li2CO3 reduced the chlorophyll a and b contents by 73.04% and 65.7%, respectively. Li2CO3 application exhibited a cytotoxic effect by inducing significant decreases in MI and increases in the frequency of MN, and also showed a genotoxic effect by causing CAs. After 100 mg/L Li2CO3 treatment, MDA, proline, superoxide dismutase, and catalase levels increased by 54.9%, 58.5%, 47.8%, and 52.3%, respectively. Li2CO3 and Udex co-administration resulted in a regression in increased biochemical parameters and genotoxicity parameters, and an improvement in germination parameters. Furthermore, Udex demonstrated efficacy in mitigating the detrimental effects of Li2CO3 on the root tip, particularly in the 200 µg/mL Udex-treated group. The thickening of the cortex cell wall and conduction tissue, which is commonly induced by Li₂CO₃, was not observed in the Udex-treated group. The protective effect of Udex can be explained by the phenolic compounds it contains. Rutin was detected as the major component in Udex and other phenolics were listed according to their presence rate as protecatechuic acid > caffeic acid > p-coumaric acid > syringic acid > rosemarinic acid > epicatechin. Li ions, which increase in the environment after industrialization, are an important environmental pollutant and exhibit toxicity that affects many pathways in organisms. Scientific research should not only detect these toxic effects but also develop solutions to such problems. In this study, it was determined that the Udex application had a toxicity-reducing role against Li2CO3 toxicity. Also, it has been demonstrated that A. cepa is an important indicator in determining this toxicity and toxicity-reducing applications."

Critical current degradation in an epoxy-impregnated rare-earth Ba2Cu3O7−x coated conductor caused by damage during a quench,"High-temperature superconducting (HTS) rare-earth Ba2Cu3O7−x (REBCO) coated conductors (CCs) have significant potential in high-current and high-field applications. However, owing to the weak interface strength of the laminated composite REBCO CCs, the damage induced by the thermal mismatch stress under a combination of epoxy impregnation, cooling, and quenching can cause premature degradation of the critical current. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical model based on the H-formulation and cohesive zone model (CZM) is developed to study the critical current degradation characteristics in an epoxy-impregnated REBCO CC caused by the damage during a quench. The temperature variation, critical current degradation of the REBCO CC, and its degradation onset temperature calculated by the numerical model are in agreement with the experimental data taken from the literature. The delamination of the REBCO CC predicted by the numerical model is consistent with the experimental result. The numerical results also indicate that the shear stress is the main contributor to the damage propagation inside the REBCO CC. The premature degradation of the critical current during a quench is closely related to the interface shear strength inside the REBCO CC. Finally, the effects of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the epoxy resin, thickness of the substrate, and substrate material on the critical current degradation characteristics of the epoxy-impregnated REBCO CC during a quench are also discussed. These results help us understand the relationship between the current-carrying degradation and damage in the HTS applications."

Experimental investigation of polymeric straight fin heat sink for low power LED,"Metal heat sinks are more effective in dissipating heat but its weight, cost, design complexity, production are limiting their use so polymers can be considered as supplement because of its higher electrical insulation, low cost fabrication, less weight and easy processing of complex design. In this study, conventional Aluminium straight fin heat sinks are compared with three different polymeric straight fin heat sinks fabricated using 3D printer out of Poly Lactic Acid (PLA), Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) and Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG). These 3D printed heat sinks are analyzed by Natural and Forced convection heat transfer for 3 W, 5 W and 20 W LEDs at two different orientations of heat sink 0° and 180°. From the experiments, polymers are less efficient in heat dissipation by 13 to 30% when compared with aluminium, it can be used as an alternative heat sink for low power electronic devices that requires less power dissipation."
Exploring Solitary Waves and Nonlinear Dynamics in the Fractional Chaffee–Infante Equation: A Study Beyond Conventional Diffusion Models,"The current study examines the (2 + 1)-dimensional fractional Chaffee–Infante (FCI) model, which is a nonlinear evolution equation that characterizes the processes of pattern generation, reaction-diffusion, and nonlinear wave propagation.

For many computer-aided diagnostic systems, precise retinal vessel segmentation is an essential job. However, it remains a difficult task due to the intricate vascular system of the eye. Although many different vascular segmentation techniques have already been presented, additional study is still required to address the problem of inadequate segmentation of thin and tiny vessels."
"Organ Markets, Options, and an Over-Inclusiveness Objection: On Rippon’s Argument","Human organs available for transplant are in short supply. One way to increase the supply of organs consists in legalizing a live donor market. Such a market is, however, controversial. This article is about an objection to live donor organ markets made by Simon Rippon. Rippon’s objection is that the presence of a market option creates new social and legal pressures that harm the poor. Legalizing the option of selling your organs transforms into a harmful, and morally indefensible, social, and legal pressure to sell on the financially desperate. This article defends the conclusion that Rippon’s argument fails as an objection to live donor organ markets. It fails because it has implausibly expansive implications about which markets are morally problematic. In short, Rippon’s argument proves too much. Sections one and two introduce Rippon’s argument. Sections three and four contain the argument against Rippon. The main argumentative move is that the features of an organ market that, according to Rippon, justify a ban on such a market are features that also characterize several other markets that are normally considered unproblematic, for example, markets where individuals sell their labour abroad in jobs that are dangerous. So, if an organ market should be legally impermissible, so should these labour markets. Section five considers several objections to the argument against Rippon. It is argued that these objections fail. Section six is a conclusion that sums up the findings of the article."
Testosterone therapy as a novel approach to the management of cytopenias in myelodysplastic neoplasms: a review of literature and case report,To explore the potential of testosterone therapy in managing cytopenias in myelodysplastic neoplasm and investigate the link between hypogonadism and hematologic malignancies.
The potential of smart factories in reducing environmental emissions: the evidence from Chinese listed manufacturing firms,"The nature of smart factories to help manufacturing firms reducing environmental emissions has attracted the widespread attention of governments and industries. However, some research also worried that if smart factories were not effectively constructed, they may increase firms’ environmental emissions. To address this concern, we use PSM-progressive DID model to analyze the relationships between the construction of smart factories and environmental emissions, based on 144 Chinese listed manufacturing firms. The main findings are as follow. First, the construction of smart factories can lead to the short-term increase of 7.55% GHG emissions (1.001 tCO2e) and 4.12% air pollutants cost (1.011 $) per $M operation cost for firms. Second, the negative impact of smart factory construction on GHG emissions can be partially explained by physical technologies. Third, mimetic institution (industrial maturity of environment management system) can reduce the negative impact of smart factory construction, but coercive institution (government regulation) and normative institution (social media attention) have no significant moderating effect. With these findings, this study provides a clear understanding of how the construction of smart factories influences firms’ environmental sustainability and accordingly offers insights for business considering environmental objectives in smart factory development."
Forecasting throughput at a transshipment hub under trade dynamism and uncertainty in major production centers,"The demand for port services is intricately tied to international trade between production centers and the global market. This paper introduces a unique econometric forecasting model tailored to predict container port throughput at a transshipment hub, leveraging the dynamic and uncertain nature of international trade flows, originating from three global production centers: China, the USA, and Germany. The paper examines how the trade flow dynamics of these centers impact a transshipment hub, especially in scenarios where the hub is strategically positioned along major shipping routes, serving as the sole container transshipment facility in a region. The validation of the model is conducted through empirical testing using time series analysis of trade flows from the above three major production centers to the South Asian port region. The Port of Colombo (PoC) is used as the regional hub port. The model incorporates external shocks to assess their influence on the demand for the services of the hub and its resilience to global disruptions. Findings indicate the substantial influence of China, with a notable impact on exports to the USA from South Asia and imports from Europe and Central Asia to China, establishing positive and long-term relationships with PoC. Furthermore, the paper offers insights into PoC’s resilience during crises such as the Red Sea incident, leveraging its strategic location. The findings not only contribute in developing PoC’s strategic position, but they also lay the groundwork for future studies on global trade patterns and the adaptability of transshipment hubs in the face of dynamic demand."

Altered Heat-Avoidance Behavior Following Damage to the Extended Architecture of Mexican Jumping Bean Moth Larvae (Cydia saltitans),"In response to physical damage, organisms must balance recovery with adaptive responses to other environmental stressors. Understanding how damage and repair influence adaptive responses to high environmental temperatures is of particular interest in light of global climate change. We investigate the impact of damage and subsequent repair on heat-avoidance behaviors in Cydia saltitans larvae using host seeds (Sebastiania pavoniana) as protective structures (together colloquially known as “Mexican jumping beans”). These larvae perform temperature-dependent “jumping” or “rolling” behaviors to escape extreme heat, which are crucial for larval survival in their native arid and hot subtropical dry forests. Due to possible costs of repair and limited energetic resources, we hypothesized that experiencing damage and investing in subsequent repair to a host seed would reduce larval displacement distance from extreme heat when compared to individuals that experienced damage without repairing the host seed, or the undamaged control group. Results suggest that larvae in control conditions exhibited greater displacement from heat compared to those in either damage treatment group. Contrary to predictions, damage and subsequent repair impaired heat avoidance behavior to same extent as damage without investing in repair.  This reduced displacement distance in both damage treatment groups may be linked to energy allocation or an adaptive antipredator response. These findings contribute to our understanding of how environmental stressors interact to shape behavioral responses in insects with “extended architecture.” As global temperatures rise, insights into the flexibility of adaptive behaviors are increasingly crucial."
Exploring the influence of coupled interfacial imperfections on SH wave propagation in layered structures with sliding interaction,"Present study delves into realm of coupled interfacial imperfections and their influence on propagation characteristics of shear horizontal (SH) waves in piezoelectric layered structures. The research scenario involves a piezoelectric layer sandwiched between exponentially graded piezoelectric superstrate and fiber-reinforced substratum, with specific boundary conditions at play. The upper boundary is treated as electrode, while the upper interface is considered both mechanically and electrically bonded. In contrast, the lower interface is configured with sliding contact conditions. Leveraging derived displacement components and applying pertinent boundary conditions, the dispersion equation is derived for both electrically open and short cases. To ascertain the validity and credibility of derived dispersion equation, results have been compared with established results from prior research and classical Love wave equation. Study further extends to numerical simulations and graphical demonstrations, which encompass a range of piezoelectric materials. Through comparative analysis, we uncover intriguing characteristics and analyse the significant influence of heterogeneity, electro-mechanical bonding parameters, and piezoelectric constants, along with dielectric properties, on the dispersion behaviour. This work not only advances the fundamental understanding of SH wave phenomena in composite structures but will also be useful in applications fields such as engineering geology, sensor technology, and geophysical exploration."

Administration of anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies with increased affinity to Fcγ receptors during acute SHIVAD8-EO infection,"Anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have the dual potential of mediating virus neutralization and antiviral effector functions through their Fab and Fc domains, respectively. So far, bNAbs with enhanced Fc effector functions in vitro have only been tested in NHPs during chronic simian-HIV (SHIV) infection. Here, we investigate the effects of administering in acute SHIVAD8-EO infection either wild-type (WT) bNAbs or bNAbs carrying the S239D/I332E/A330L (DEL) mutation, which increases binding to FcγRs. Emergence of virus in plasma and lymph nodes (LNs) was delayed by bNAb treatment and occurred earlier in monkeys given DEL bNAbs than in those given WT bNAbs, consistent with faster clearance of DEL bNAbs from plasma. DEL bNAb-treated monkeys had higher levels of circulating virus-specific IFNγ single-producing CD8+ CD69+ T cells than the other groups. In LNs, WT bNAbs were evenly distributed between follicular and extrafollicular areas, but DEL bNAbs predominated in the latter. At week 8 post-challenge, LN monocytes and NK cells from DEL bNAb-treated monkeys upregulated proinflammatory signaling pathways and LN T cells downregulated TNF signaling via NF-κB. Overall, bNAbs with increased affinity to FcγRs shape innate and adaptive cellular immunity, which may be important to consider in future strategies of passive bNAb therapy."
Acquisition parameters influence AI recognition of race in chest x-rays and mitigating these factors reduces underdiagnosis bias,"A core motivation for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is to reduce existing healthcare disparities. Yet, recent studies have demonstrated two distinct findings: (1) AI models can show performance biases in underserved populations, and (2) these same models can be directly trained to recognize patient demographics, such as predicting self-reported race from medical images alone. Here, we investigate how these findings may be related, with an end goal of reducing a previously identified underdiagnosis bias. Using two popular chest x-ray datasets, we first demonstrate that technical parameters related to image acquisition and processing influence AI models trained to predict patient race, where these results partly reflect underlying biases in the original clinical datasets. We then find that mitigating the observed differences through a demographics-independent calibration strategy reduces the previously identified bias. While many factors likely contribute to AI bias and demographics prediction, these results highlight the importance of carefully considering data acquisition and processing parameters in AI development and healthcare equity more broadly."
RPA transforms RNase H1 to a bidirectional exoribonuclease for processive RNA–DNA hybrid cleavage,"RNase H1 has been acknowledged as an endoribonuclease specializing in the internal degradation of the RNA moiety within RNA–DNA hybrids, and its ribonuclease activity is indispensable in multifaceted aspects of nucleic acid metabolism. However, the molecular mechanism underlying RNase H1-mediated hybrid cleavage remains inadequately elucidated. Herein, using single-molecule approaches, we probe the dynamics of the hybrid cleavage by Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase H1. Remarkably, a single RNase H1 enzyme displays 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease activity. The directional RNA degradation proceeds processively and yet discretely, wherein unwinding approximately 6-bp hybrids as a prerequisite for two consecutive 3-nt RNA excisions limits the overall rate within each catalytic cycle. Moreover, Replication Protein A (RPA) reinforces RNase H1’s 3′-to-5′ nucleolytic rate and processivity and stimulates its 5′-to-3′ exoribonuclease activity. This stimulation is primarily realized through the pre-separation of the hybrids and consequently transfers RNase H1 to a bidirectional exoribonuclease, further potentiating its cleavage efficiency. These findings unveil unprecedented characteristics of an RNase and provide a dynamic view of RPA-enhanced processive hybrid cleavage by RNase H1."
Modelling spatiotemporal patterns of wildfire risk in the Garden Route District biodiversity hotspots using analytic hierarchy process in South Africa,"The increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires necessitate effective risk management in biodiversity hotspots to mitigate the potential impacts of wildfire hazards. The study utilised a multi-criteria decision analysis-analytic hierarchy process (MCDA-AHP) model to analyse wildfire risk patterns in the Garden Route District (GRD), focusing on biodiversity hotspots in the Western Cape, South Africa. The study used weight assignment and overlay analysis to evaluate wildfire risk factors, including human, topographic, and climatic factors, using data from Landsat and WorldClim from 1991 to 2021. The wildfire risk model was validated using MODIS historical fire data from the Global Forest Watch database and Confusion Matrix, with the burned area extent identified using differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). The results show that despite 53% of the most burned area, only 12% was burned, with the high-risk zone accounting for only 11%, indicating a higher likelihood of wildfires spreading and intensifying. The results reveal a weak positive correlation (r = 0.28) between historical fire occurrences and burned areas and a negative correlation (r = − 0.27) between historical fire occurrences and fire seasons. Human and climatic factors significantly impact wildfire propagation in high-risk zones, while topographic factors have less influence, indicating a lower risk of ignition. The findings show that 26% of high-risk zones in the southwestern region dominated GRD biodiversity hotspots, while 27% were in the low-moderate-risk zone in the northwestern parts. The results of this study can aid in assigning fire risk-based criterion weights to support decision-makers in regional and global wildfire prevention and management."
Advancing convergence analysis: extending the scope of a sixth order method,"In this article, we aim to emphasize the critical role of extended convergence analysis in advancing research and understanding in the interdisciplinary fields of Applied and Computational Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, and Chemistry. By gaining a comprehensive understanding of the convergence behavior of numerical methods, one can make informed decisions regarding algorithm selection, optimization, and convergence domains, leading to more accurate and reliable scientific results in diverse applications. The conventional approach to assessing the convergence order of higher order methods for solving systems of non-linear equations relied on the Taylor series expansion, necessitating the computation of higher order derivatives that were typically absent in the method. This limitation not only constrained the method’s applicability but also increased the computational cost of solving the problem. In contrast, our study introduces a unique and innovative approach, where we demonstrate the improvised convergence of the method using only first order derivatives. Our new method offers several advantages over the traditional approach, providing valuable information regarding the radii of the convergence region and precise estimates of error boundaries. Furthermore, we establish the notion of semi-local convergence, which proves to be particularly significant as it allows for the identification of the specific domain in which the iterates converge. We have validated the convergence requirements through carefully selected numerical examples."
Evolutionary-variational method in mathematical plasticity,"The elastic–plastic infinitesimal deformation of a solid is considered within the framework of the incremental flow theory using the constitutive relation in the general rate form. The appropriate initial boundary value problem is formulated for the displacement in the form of the evolutionary-variational problem (EVP), i.e., as the abstract Cauchy problem in the Hilbert space which coincides with a weak form of the equilibrium equation, known as the principle of possible displacements in mechanics. The general existence and uniqueness theorem for the EVP is discussed. The main sufficient condition has a simple algebraic form and does not coincide with the classical Drucker and similar thermodynamical postulates; therefore, it must be independently verified. Its independence is illustrated for the non-associated plastic model of linear isotropic-kinematic hardening with dilatation and internal friction. The classical and endochronic models are analyzed too. The initial EVP is reduced by a spatial finite element approximation to the Cauchy problem for an implicit system of essentially nonlinear ordinary differential equations which can be stiff. Therefore, for the numerical solution the implicit Euler scheme is proposed. All theoretical results are illustrated by means of original numerical experiments."
Histological study of the development of the digestive system during larval feeding in the pike silverside Chirostoma estor,"Chirostoma estor (Jordan, 1879) is an endemic freshwater species with a high potential for aquaculture; however, as in many other fish, larviculture of this species is the most critical stage, in which the higher mortality rates. Therefore, it is necessary to fully describe the development of the digestive system to establish better feeding protocols in the larval culture of C. estor, both for aquaculture and restoration purposes. In the present study, larviculture was carried out from hatching to 20 days after hatching (DAH). The organisms were fed with the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis from 2 to 14 DAH, and nauplii of Artemia sp. from 15 to 20 DAH. A total of 12 organisms (0, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 DAH) were taken for size and weight growth and histological and histochemical analysis. The histological analysis indicated that after 3 DAH, the opening of the mouth and anus was observed, coinciding with the beginning of exogenous feeding. In addition, the digestive system developed, with differentiation of the oropharyngeal sections, esophagus, and intestine, folding of the intestinal mucosa, as well as associated organs (liver and pancreas) that reach their maximum development at 20 DAH. Thus, C. estor at this stage of development can digest and absorb nutrients despite being an agastric fish. The results obtained in this study will facilitate a better understanding of the ontogenetic morphophysiological development processes, associated with the transition of larvae to exogenous feeding, which ensures a higher percentage of survival during larval development and of course, adds to the diversity ontogenetics of teleostean."
Validity of temperament-based clinical personality types in a large sample of psychiatric inpatients,"The person-centered approach has provided numerous evidence for three clinically relevant personality types: a Resilient, an Undercontrolled, and an Overcontrolled type (RUO). The present study investigated whether (1) the RUO types could be identified within a large, diverse clinical population based upon transdiagnostical temperament factors, including Behavioral Approach and Inhibition Systems (BIS/BAS) and Effortful Control (EC), and (2) these types differed in terms of psychopathology. Self-report questionnaires, including the BIS/BAS scales, EC scale, Symptom-Checklist-90-Revised, and The Assessment of DSM-IV Personality Disorder, were administered to 2693 psychiatric inpatients. Based on a two-step cluster analysis we corroborated a Resilient (n = 959), an Undercontrolled/Dysregulated (n = 859), and an Overcontrolled/Inhibited (n = 875) type. The latter exhibited more internalizing psychopathology, whereas the undercontrolled/dysregulated type revealed more externalizing psychopathology. The resilient type showed the lowest levels of psychopathology. The present findings strengthen evidence that RUO typologies can be generalized across different psychopathologies and transdiagnostically shed light on the clinical importance of distinguishing subtypes to inform therapeutic interventions, which might possibly improve outcome and reduce relapse."
Wear and Friction Behavior on Extrusion-Based 3D Printed Short Carbon Fiber Reinforced PETG Composites with Annealing and Laser Treated Effects,"This study aims to improve wear and friction behavior in extrusion-based 3D printing by focusing on amorphous PETG and PETG reinforced with short carbon fibers. This work focuses on as-built and annealing as the primary post-processing techniques, comparing annealed PETG-CF and laser-treated PETG-CF with as-built pure PETG and as-built PETG-CF. Pin-on-disc tribometer tests were conducted under varying loads (5–20 N) and sliding velocities (1–3 m/s), recording the wear rate and coefficient of friction. Enhanced bonding achieved through post-processing, particularly when temperatures exceeded the polymer’s glass transition temperature, resulted in superior wear and friction performance, notably in laser-treated samples. Morphological analysis of worn surfaces supported these findings. Shore D hardness measurements indicated sustained hardness post-wear for annealed and laser-treated samples. PETG-CF annealed and laser-treated samples exhibited minimal degradation under compressive loads during wear tests, showing moderate improvement compared to other samples. This research underscores the efficacy of post-processing techniques in enhancing the mechanical properties of 3D printed composites, particularly in optimizing wear resistance and maintaining hardness in demanding operational conditions. These samples demonstrated increased wear resistance, making them suitable for automotive and aerospace applications requiring rotational or     reciprocating motion."
A survey on topological properties of P(K) spaces,"Given a compact space K, we denote by P(K) the space of all Radon probability measures on K, equipped with the weak* topology inherited from C(K)*. For nonmetrizable compacta K even basic properties of P(K) spaces depend of additional axioms of set theory. We discuss here older and quite recent results on the subject."
Migrant services and the reconfiguration of social reproduction as capital accumulation,"Much of past feminist theorization of social reproduction has concentrated on the domestic sphere. However, in multiple domains such as education, childcare, elder care, health care, the delivery of goods, and migrant settlement, first the state and non-profit organizations and increasingly corporate profit-making service industries emerged as significant providers. In this transformed world of social reproduction, the initial query of feminist theorists about the relationship between social reproduction and capital accumulation must again be addressed. This return to a theorization of social reproduction in what is often considered the humanitarian sector of capitalist economies must encompass the labor of precarious workers and unpaid volunteers. Building on but going beyond the feminist debate about social reproduction, this paper explores the relationship between the public–private domain of service delivery and capital accumulation in migrants’ services. In so many instances, humanitarian activities in sectors such as migrant services have become the local face of a multiscalar migration industry. Through an exploration of the delivery of migrant services in a disempowered city in eastern Germany, the paper explicates the dynamics through which social reproduction activities are commoditized and are increasingly linked to locations and mechanisms of capital accumulation through the extraction of surplus value."
The synergistic effect of triglyceride-glucose index and HbA1c on blood pressure control in patients with hypertension: a retrospective cohort study,"Triglyceride-Glucose Index (TyG index) and HbA1c are metabolic risk factors associated with insulin resistance (IR), which have been confirmed to be independently correlated with the incidence of hypertension. However, there is limited research specifically focusing on the interaction between these two metabolic risk factors in hypertensive populations. Currently, it remains unclear how the metabolic indicators TyG index and HbA1c affect BP control in individuals with hypertension. This study aims to investigate the value and interaction of TyG index and HbA1c in blood pressure (BP) control among hypertensive patients. The results are conducive to enhancing the effectiveness of clinical BP control for individuals with hypertension. This cohort study included 99,336 adults diagnosed with hypertension. Participants were grouped according to the median of TyG index and HbA1c. The main endpoint is inadequate BP control. Multivariable-adjusted risk ratios and multivariable Cox regression analysis were used to represent the relationship between BP control levels and metabolic risk factors. Finally, we evaluated the interaction between TyG index and HbA1c in the population with inadequate BP control. This study confirmed that TyG index and HbA1c, as metabolic risk factors, are independently associated with poor BP control (P < 0.05). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, it was found that TyG index and HbA1c were significantly associated with poor BP control. In the male elderly population, HbA1c was significantly associated with poor BP control (P = 0.029)."
Effect of sulfate types on strength and swelling properties of sulfate-bearing soils stabilized with cement,"Sulfate-bearing soils is widely distributed around the world, and this type of soil is prone to rock and soil disasters such as dissolution, corrosion of foundations, and swell when exposed to water. Cement is a frequently used stabilizer to treat sulfate-bearing soils. However, sulfate-bearing soils usually include various types of sulfates, such as, calcium sulfate (CaSO4), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), potassium sulfate (K2SO4), and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4). So far, the effect of sulfate type on the strength and swelling properties of sulfate-bearing soil stabilized with cement has not been clarified. Therefore, in this study, the strength and swelling properties of four sulfate-bearing soils treated with cement were studied using unconfined compressive strength tests, and swelling tests. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy were employed to study mineralogical, micro-structural properties, and concentrations of calcium ion of stabilized soils, to explore stabilization mechanisms. The results showed that the formation of magnesium silicate hydrate and highest concentration of free Ca2+ in the stabilized Mg-sulfate-soil caused its lowest strength. The reduction in free Ca2+ concentration was greater in the stabilized Na-sulfate-soil and K-sulfate-soil compared to stabilized Mg-sulfate-soil and Ca-sulfate-soil, contributing to the formation of more calcium silicate hydrate and ettringite. Therefore, the stabilized Na-sulfate-soil and K-sulfate-soil had greater swelling and strength compared to other soils. As the cement content increases, there are abundant in the sulfated cement stabilized soil observed in XRD and SEM photos. Overall, sulfates with monovalent cations increased the strength of cement-stabilized soils more than those with divalent cations, while sulfates with divalent cations improved the resistance to swelling of cement-stabilized soils. Before treating sulfate-bearing soils with cement, it is necessary to first determine the cations type in the soil. If the soil contains Mg2+, seek cement alternatives. If the other three cations are present, choose an appropriate cement content for stabilization. This study provides some references for the stabilization of sulfate-bearing soils with cement."
Using multispectral images and field inclinometer data to analyze topographic changes related to and the reactivation mechanism of a large-scale landslide at Caoling in Taiwan,"This study employed a comprehensive methodology, which combines the use of multispectral images and field inclinometer data. The unique approach involves using multispectral images to monitor the topographic and hydrological changes caused by a large-scale landslide at Caoling in Taiwan. The field inclinometer data, collected at regular intervals, were then integrated into a geographic information system. This system was used to estimate the potential sliding volume of the landslide, which was then compared with changes in the digital terrain model data for Caoling. The multispectral images of Caoling were examined to determine the changes in its topographic and hydrological indices after the landslide. The convex slope at Caoling moved in the progressive backward mode with increased groundwater level and slope displacement under rainfall conditions. The potential sliding volume of the landslide was 6.4 × 106 m3. The results of this study indicate that the changes in topographic and hydrological indices after a landslide enable the identification of the local surficial changes caused by the landslide. Changes in the rate of slope movement show a high correlation to the fluctuation of groundwater level. Reactivation of the large-scale landslide is attributable to hillslope, geologic and topographic characteristics, including toe creek incision, surficial erosion, and torrential rainfall brought by typhoons. Moreover, post landslide topographic monitoring through drone images, which provide high-resolution and real-time data, plays a crucial role in identifying a landslide’s reactivation mechanism. This, in turn, enables effective disaster mitigation strategies to be implemented."
Perspectives of older adults with chronic illness on person-centered practice at an inpatient hospital department: a descriptive study,The growing aging trend associated with a higher prevalence of chronic illnesses is increasing the demand for the development of person-centered practice in specific care settings. Knowing the person’s perception of the care and the care experience is essential to improving inpatient care toward person-centeredness. This study aims to characterize the perceptions of person-centered practice of hospitalized older adults with chronic illness at a Portuguese inpatient hospital department.
Multi-attribute and predictive cascaded fuzzy system for the AGV dispatching in a flexible manufacturing system,"In recent years, manufacturers have increasingly applied automation techniques to enhance efficiency and remain competitive. Material handling is an essential activity in any production process. Its effectiveness has a significant impact on production costs. Automated guided vehicle (AGV) systems have become a strategic tool for factories and automated warehouses. They can reduce production costs and improve delivery times in a competitive business scenario. One of the main problems encountered in managing AGVs is the dispatching decision. The present paper proposes a vehicle dispatching system based on a multi-attribute cascaded fuzzy system with a state-space-based Petri net model to predict the future states of the factory. This work aims to reduce the production system’s makespan and/or tardiness values. Additionally, the paper presents one simulated factory scenario to evaluate the proposed fuzzy system against five other dispatching methods. The statistical validation results of the simulations show a 97% confidence level in the hypotheses of this work."
Androgendeprivation als Initial- und Basistherapie beim Prostatakarzinom,"Ziel dieser Studie war die Bestimmung des Anteils der Patienten mit einem Prostatakarzinom (PCa), die nach Beginn einer Therapie für ein kastrationsresistentes Prostatakarzinom (KRPCa) die primäre Androgendeprivationstherapie (ADT) beibehielten sowie die Beschreibung ihrer Behandlungsmuster."
Clival chordomas and chondrosarcomas in Denmark—Outcomes in 33 patients following the national centralization of treatment in 2010,"This 13-year consecutive case series aims to provide a comprehensive overview of all patients operated for clival chordomas and clival chondrosarcomas in Denmark since the centralization of treatment in 2010, comparing outcomes to international series."
Large direct magnetoelectric coupling in lead-free (BaCa)(TiSn)O3 / Ni-Zn ferrite particulate composites,"In the present study, we report a significant magnetoelectric coupling in lead-free (1-x)Ba0.95Ca0.05Ti0.95Sn0.05O3 - (x)Ni0.7Zn0.3Fe2O4 (x = 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 and 0.30) particulate composites prepared by solid-state route. Phase purity and crystal structure of the composites were examined by the X-ray diffraction measurement. With the incorporation of the magnetic NZFO phase, a decrease in the tetragonality of the ferroelectric BTCS lattice was confirmed by the full pattern match of the XRD data using Rietveld analysis. FESEM micrographs revealed improved microstructures with the addition of ferrite concentrations in the composites. Simultaneous presence of ferroic orders in the composites was confirmed from the room-temperature P-E and M-H hysteresis loops. Direct magnetoelectric voltage measurement of the composites established the strain-mediated coupling between the BTCS and NZFO phases. Highest RT first-order magnetoelectric voltage coefficient (α/d = 6.24 mV/cm-Oe) of the x = 0.25 composite is attributed to better individual ferroic properties and improved microstructure of this sample."
A virtual reconstruction method for corridor gable buildings based on the knowledge of structural dynamics: taking Leiyin Cave as an example,"Virtual reconstruction of ancient buildings often has incomplete records of the original design and construction details, and can only be reconstructed based on limited data, drawings and photography, which is different from the actual conditions. The unique overhanging structure of the corridor gable building makes it vulnerable to damage in extreme weather conditions. In order to ensure that the virtual reconstruction results can not only reproduce the original appearance of history, but also ensure that the reconstructed model maintains structural stability in the long term. This paper proposes a reconstruction method of the original appearance of the corridor gable building remains based on structural dynamics analysis. This method comprehensively uses three-dimensional reconstruction, structural engineering, dynamic analysis, and computer simulation technology to ensure the structural accuracy and historical authenticity of the virtually reconstructed corridor gable building. First, through data collection and analysis, combined with ancient architectural construction techniques, a preliminary three-dimensional model was created, which included all structural elements and details. Several groups of reconstruction schemes are determined based on material properties. Then, using finite element analysis software, perform dynamic analysis on the three-dimensional model. Evaluate the stability of the reconstructed structure and optimize the material selection plan to ensure the feasibility and accuracy of the virtual reconstruction. Taking the virtual reconstruction of the eaves in front of Leiyin Cave as an example, it shows that this method is effective and feasible to achieve the virtual reconstruction of corridor gable buildings. It provides new ideas for virtual reconstruction of ancient buildings and has important practical application value."
Impact of Various Silicon Sources on the Synthesis of Mordenite and Differences in the Carbonylation Reaction of Dimethyl Ether,"This study introduces an innovative method for synthesizing mordenite (MOR) by employing a combination of water glass and fumed silica as the silica source. The zeolite produced through this method exhibits a smaller grain size, a larger specific surface area, and a greater number of Brønsted acid sites compared to the conventionally synthesized mordenite using silica sol. Furthermore, the chemical environment of framework Al in MOR zeolites is influenced by different silica sources, leading to varied acid properties between the two MOR zeolites, which results in an enhanced activity of dimethyl ether carbonylation from 50% to over 83%."
Genomic insights into organic acid production and plant growth promotion by different species of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria,"Bacteria can solubilize phosphorus (P) through the secretion of low-molecular-weight organic acids and acidification. However, the genes involved in the production of these organic acids are poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to verify the calcium phosphate solubilization and the production of low-molecular-weight organic acids by diverse genera of phosphate solubilizing bacterial strains (PSBS); to identify the genes related to the synthesis of the organic acids in the genomes of these strains and; to evaluate growth and nutrient accumulation of maize plants inoculated with PSBS and fertilized with Bayóvar rock phosphate. Genomic DNA was extracted for strain identification and annotation of genes related to the organic acids production. A greenhouse experiment was performed with five strains plus 150 mg dm− 3 P2O5 as Bayóvar rock phosphate (BRP) to assess phosphate solubilization contribution to maize growth and nutrition. Paraburkholderia fungorum UFLA 04–21 and Pseudomonas anuradhapurensis UFPI B5-8A solubilized over 60% of Ca phosphate and produced high amounts of citric/maleic and gluconic acids in vitro, respectively. Eleven organic acids were identified in total, although not all strains produced all acids. Besides, enzymes related to the organic acids production were found in all bacterial genomes. Plants inoculated with strains UFPI B5-6 (Enterobacter bugandensis), UFPI B5-8A, and UFLA 03–10 (Paenibacillus peoriae) accumulated more biomass than the plants fertilized with BRP only. Strains UFLA 03–10 and UFPI B5-8A increased the accumulation of most macronutrients, including P. Collectively, the results show that PSBS can increase maize growth and nutrient accumulation based on Bayóvar rock phosphate fertilization."
The epidemiology of lung cancer in Hungary based on the characteristics of patients diagnosed in 2018,"Among malignant diseases, lung cancer has one of the highest mortality and incidence. Most epidemiological studies conclude that Hungary faces the most severe burden in association with this disease. However, for various reasons estimates and population-based studies show discrepancies. In this study, an intense data cleansing was performed on lung cancer cases that were reported to the Hungarian National Cancer Registry in 2018, and the major clinico-pathological parameters as well as survival characteristics were described. Our population-based figures were compared to the European estimates. As a result of our thorough revision, the corrected incidence of lung cancer has fallen below the number of cases that were reported to the Registry from 11,746 to 9,519. We also demonstrate that Hungary did not show the highest incidence and mortality in Europe, but it is still among the ones with the worst raking countries, with 92.9 and 50.6 age standardized rate per 100 thousand capita among males and females, respectively. Analysis of the annually reported case numbers revealed a gender-specific difference in incidence trends: while from 2001 to 2019 it slightly decreased among males, it increased among females. The most dominant subtype was adenocarcinoma, which was more frequent among female patients. Unfortunately, most of the newly diagnosed cases were in advanced stage; thus, 5 year overall survival was 14.8%. We anticipate that in the longer term, a decrease in incidence and improvement in survival rates may be expected as a result of the development of primary and secondary prevention programs in the country."
It is challenging to reproduce both anatomical and functional aspects of anterolateral reconstruction: postoperative 3D-CT analysis of the femoral tunnel position,This study aimed to evaluate the femoral tunnel position and fiber length of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction compared with the natural anatomy of the ALL. We also evaluated whether the femoral tunnel position would affect residual pivot shift.
Upper brainstem pediatric low-grade gliomas: review and neuroendoscopic approach,"Pediatric brain tumors, particularly those affecting the brainstem, present a significant challenge due to their intricate anatomical location and diverse classification. This review explores the classification, anatomical considerations, and surgical approaches for pediatric brainstem tumors, focusing on recent updates from the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Brainstem tumors encompass a spectrum from diffuse gliomas to focal intrinsic and exophytic types, each presenting unique clinical and surgical challenges. Surgical strategies have evolved with advancements in neuroimaging and surgical techniques, emphasizing approaches such as neuroendoscopy and tailored incisions to minimize damage to critical structures. Despite the complexities involved, recent developments offer promising outcomes in tumor resection and patient management, highlighting ongoing advancements in neurosurgical care for pediatric brain tumors."
Beyond medical errors: exploring the interpersonal dynamics in physician-patient relationships linked to medico-legal complaints,"Previous research suggests that medico-legal complaints often arise from various factors influencing patient dissatisfaction, including medical errors, physician-patient relationships, communication, trust, informed consent, perceived quality of care, and continuity of care. However, these findings are not typically derived from actual patients’ cases. This study aims to identify factors impacting the interpersonal dynamics between physicians and patients using real patient cases to understand how patients perceive doctor-patient relational problems that can lead to dissatisfaction and subsequent medico-legal complaints."
Facile synthesis of Cu-doped manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve for the efficient degradation of sulfamethoxazole via peroxymonosulfate activation,"Advanced processes for peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-based oxidation are efficient in eliminating toxic and refractory organic pollutants
from sewage. The activation of electron-withdrawing HSO
−5
 releases reactive species, including sulfate radical (·SO
−4
), hydroxyl radical (·OH), superoxide radical (·O
−2
), and singlet oxygen (1O2), which can induce the degradation of organic contaminants. In this work, we synthesized a variety of M-OMS-2 nanorods (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Fe) by doping Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, or Fe3+ into manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve (OMS-2) to efficiently remove sulfamethoxazole (SMX) via PMS activation. The catalytic performance of M-OMS-2 in SMX elimination via PMS activation was assessed. The nanorods obtained in decreasing order of SMX removal rate were Cu-OMS-2 (96.40%), Co-OMS-2 (88.00%), Ni-OMS-2 (87.20%), Fe-OMS-2 (35.00%), and OMS-2 (33.50%). Then, the kinetics and structure–activity relationship of the M-OMS-2 nanorods during the elimination of SMX were investigated. The feasible mechanism underlying SMX degradation by the Cu-OMS-2/PMS system was further investigated with a quenching experiment, high-resolution mass spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance. Results showed that SMX degradation efficiency was enhanced in seawater and tap water, demonstrating the potential application of Cu-OMS-2/PMS system in sewage treatment."
"Denitration and nano-ZnO loading strategies to achieve high combustion progressivity, easy ignition and low ablation of the nitrocellulose-based propellant","Gradiently denitrated gun propellant (GDGP) prepared from nitrocellulose-based propellant by denitration strategy has the advantages of high combustion progressivity and storage stability, but still presents the problems of difficult ignition and lower oxygen balance than that of the raw propellant. In addition, the low utilization efficiency of uniformly added ablation inhibitors in conventional propellant formulations can also lead to harmful shooting phenomena. In this paper, nano-zinc oxide (ZnO) with high thermal conductivity as one of the ablation inhibitors was loaded on the surface of GDGP for the first time. FTIR, Raman, XRD, SEM, and XPS characterizations confirmed the preparation and structural integrity of the GDGP and gradiently denitrated gun propellant-ZnO composite (GDGP@ZnO) with ZnO in nano-size and adjustable loading concentration. The test results showed that GDGP@ZnO exhibited higher combustion progressivity than raw propellant, and the appropriate loading concentration of ZnO could enhance the heat conduction across the surface of the gun propellant and improve the ignition performance. The ablation inhibitor loaded on the surface of the gun propellant can provide an ablation inhibition effect while reducing the dosage. This work provides a new idea for the design and fabrication of a novel multifunctional integrated gun propellant with high combustion progressivity, easy ignition and low ablation."
Novel insights into vancomycin-loaded calcium sulfate and negative pressure wound therapy in preventing infections in open fractures,Open fractures are challenging due to susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus infections. This study examines the impact of Vancomycin-Loaded Calcium Sulfate (VLCS) and negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) on macrophage behavior in enhancing healing and infection resistance. Both VLCS and NPWT were evaluated individually and in combination to determine their effects on macrophage polarization and infection resistance in open fractures.
The skin microbiome stratifies patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma and determines event-free survival,"Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common entity of Cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCL) and is characterized by the presence of clonal malignant T cells in the skin. The role of the skin microbiome for MF development and progression are currently poorly understood. Using shotgun metagenomic profiling, real-time qPCR, and T cell receptor sequencing, we compared lesional and nonlesional skin of 20 MF patients with early and advanced MF. Additionally, we isolated Staphylococcus aureus and other bacteria from MF skin for functional profiling and to study the S. aureus virulence factor spa. We identified a subgroup of MF patients with substantial dysbiosis on MF lesions and concomitant outgrowth of S. aureus on plaque-staged lesions, while the other MF patients had a balanced microbiome on lesional skin. Dysbiosis and S. aureus outgrowth were accompanied by ectopic levels of cutaneous antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including adaptation of the plaque-derived S. aureus strain. Furthermore, the plaque-derived S. aureus strain showed a reduced susceptibility towards antibiotics and an upregulation of the virulence factor spa, which may activate the NF-κB pathway. Remarkably, patients with dysbiosis on MF lesions had a restricted T cell receptor repertoire and significantly lower event-free survival. Our study highlights the potential for microbiome-modulating treatments targeting S. aureus to prevent MF progression."
Fatigue Deflection Analysis for Prestressed Concrete Beams Based on Variable Stiffness Distribution Model,"In order to calculate the fatigue deflection of prestressed concrete (PC) beams, a fatigue variable stiffness distribution (VSD) model based on crack development pattern extracted from fatigue test is presented in this study. Firstly, a linear strain distribution model along the transfer length of concrete and steel bar was established. And the stress analysis of different cross-sections along the transfer length was performed in order to calculate the average moment of inertia in the fatigue crack zone of PC beam. Then, combined with the characterization model of concrete fatigue modulus, a fatigue VSD model for PC beams was established. The model validation shows that the calculated deflections are in good agreement with the measured deflections, and the deviation does not exceed ±10%. Furthermore, the quantitative reverse deduction of fatigue damage based on stiffness index was carried out. And the multi-stage development laws of stiffness degradation and damage evolution under fatigue loading were summarized. Finally, combined with the setting of fatigue failure threshold, the critical point of the PC beam entering the failure state can be reasonably determined. which provides a reference for the assessment of structural service status. The stiffness threshold of the fatigue failure criterion is about 70%, and the damage threshold is about 0.6 for this study. The research results can provide a theoretical basis for the structural performance analysis and failure assessment for PC beams."
A novel nomogram for predicting overall survival in patients with tongue squamous cell carcinoma using clinical features and MRI radiomics data: a pilot study,Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) accounts for 43.4% of oral cancers in China and has a poor prognosis. This study aimed to explore whether radiomics features extracted from preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could predict overall survival (OS) in patients with TSCC.
"Isotope constraints on seasonal dynamics of nitrogen in Zhanjiang Bay, a typical mariculture bay in South China","Eutrophication in coastal waters has been increasing remarkably, severely impacting the water quality in mariculture bays. In this study, we conducted multiple isotopic measurements on suspended particulate nitrogen (δ15N-PN) and dissolved nitrate (δ15N-NO
−3
 and δ18O-NO
−3
) in Zhanjiang Bay, a typical mariculture bay with a high level of eutrophication in South China, to investigate the changes in nitrogen sources and their cycling between the rainy and dry seasons. During the rainy season, the study found no significant relation between δ15N-PN and δ15N-NO
−3
 due to the impact of heavy rainfall and terrestrial erosion. In the upper bay, a slight nitrate loss and slightly higher δ15N-NO
−3
 and δ18O-NO
−3
 values were observed, attributed to intense physical sediment-water interactions. Despite some fluctuations, nitrate concentrations in the lower bay mainly aligned with the theoretical mixing line during the rainy season, suggesting that nitrate was primarily influenced by terrestrial erosion and that nitrate isotopes resembled the source. Consequently, the isotopic values of nitrate can be used for source apportionment in the rainy season. The results indicated that soil nitrogen (36%) and manure and sewage (33%) were the predominant nitrogen sources contributing to nitrogen loads during this period. In contrast, the dry season saw a deficient ammonium concentration (<0.2 µmol/L) in the bay, due to nearly complete consumption by phytoplankton during the red tide period. Additionally, the significant loss of nitrate and simultaneous increase in the stable isotopes of dissolved and particulate nitrogen suggest a strong coupling of assimilation and mineralization during the dry season. More active biogeochemical processes during the dry season may be related to decreased runoff and increased water retention time. Overall, our study illustrated the major seasonal nitrogen sources and their dynamics in Zhanjiang Bay, providing valuable insights for formulating effective policies to mitigate eutrophication in mariculture bays."
Developing a range-wide sampling framework for endangered species: a case study with light-footed Ridgway’s rail,"Monitoring provides the foundation for evaluating recovery of endangered species, yet many species lack monitoring programs designed to integrate a species’ unique attributes, specific monitoring objectives, and principles of statistical sampling theory. We developed a framework for monitoring and assessment of endangered light-footed Ridgway’s rails (Rallus obsoletus levipes) across their U.S. range, relative to multi-scale recovery goals. We created spatially explicit sample units and a sampling frame covering all potential habitat to facilitate range-wide probability sampling, and also built a model of the call-broadcast process commonly used to survey marsh birds that included heterogeneity in availability for detection and conditional detectability for each bird during each survey. We used the model to simulate 96 sampling strategies that included different levels of replication, multiple approaches for sample allocation amongst strata, and both simple random and weighted probability sampling (i.e., weights proportional to local rail abundance) of sample units within strata. Effective monitoring surveyed ≥ 20–30% of the sampling frame on ≥ 3 occasions, with weighted sample selection and more targeted sampling (50% of units) for strata that are key to species recovery. We also tested Bayesian N-mixture models for estimating abundance and show that multiple models provide reasonable estimates. This work lays the foundation for statistical sampling and multi-scale population estimation for an endangered bird, and for refinement of abundance estimation models. Moreover, this work provides a replicable process for building customized and statistically defensible sampling frameworks to assess recovery of endangered species that can be used for other sensitive species."
Fance deficiency impaired DNA damage repair of prospermatogonia and altered the repair dynamics of spermatocytes,"Non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) is the most severe form of male infertility and affects approximately 1% of men worldwide. Fanconi anemia (FA) genes were known for their essential role in DNA repair and growing evidence showed the crucial role of FA pathway in NOA. However, the underlying mechanisms for Fance deficiency lead to a serious deficit and delayed maturation of male germ cells remain unclear."
Performance of ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 as a tool for patient support before and after DBS surgery for Parkinson’s disease,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure that involves implanting electrodes into specific areas of the brain to treat a variety of medical conditions, including Parkinson’s disease. Doubts and questions from patients prior to or following surgery should be addressed in line with the most recent scientific and clinical practice. ChatGPT emerges as an example of how artificial intelligence can be used, with its ability to comprehend and answer medical questions in an understandable way, accessible to everyone. However, the risks of these resources still need to be fully understood."
Genetic deletion of ITIH5 leads to increased development of adipose tissue in mice,"Adipocytokines play a pivotal role in maintaining adipose tissue homeostasis by regulating cellular metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and secretory activity. These soluble factors are relevant components for healthy adipose tissue, while their deficiency is closely associated with the development of obesity and related metabolic diseases, e.g., chronic inflammation. In human adipose tissue, inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 5 (ITIH5) is expressed in proportion to the development of adipose tissue, i.e., the individual’s BMI. Thus, ITIH5 has been proposed to be an inert marker of human obesity. However, when applied to adipose stem cells in vitro, recombinant (r)ITIH5 protein inhibited proliferation and adipogenesis, suggesting that ITIH5 negatively affects the development of fat mass. We now tested the role of ITIH5 in vivo and compared ITIH5+/+ wildtype with ITIH5−/− knockout mice."
"Causal relationships between GLP1 receptor agonists, blood lipids, and heart failure: a drug-target mendelian randomization and mediation analysis","Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists have been shown to reduce major cardiovascular events in diabetic patients, but their role in heart failure (HF) remains controversial. Recent evidence implies their potential benefits on cardiometabolism such as lipid metabolism, which may contribute to lowering the risk of HF. Consequently, we designed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the causal relationships of circulating lipids mediating GLP1R agonists in HF."
Effect of Pb(II) on hydraulic behavior and microstructure evolution of activated charcoal-bentonite-reticulated red clay barrier,"The sanitary landfill method remains the primary disposal of municipal waste in developing countries. Effective landfill barriers in intercepting pollutants are warranted to avoid soil and groundwater contamination by leachate leakage from those landfills that threaten human health. This work focuses on enhancing the capability of reticulated red clay barriers to intercept Pb(II) by incorporating activated charcoal and bentonite. The impacts of additives on the hydraulic behavior and Pb(II) blocking efficacy of composite reticulated red clay were explored through hydraulic conductivity and leachate concentration tests, respectively. The microstructural evolution of barrier materials was revealed through scanning electron microscope (SEM) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) tests. Results suggest that the formulated activated charcoal-bentonite-reticulated red clay composite barrier exhibited significantly better performance than those with the additives individually. The permeability coefficient and Pb(II) leachate concentration of the activated charcoal-bentonite-reticulated red clay barrier with 5% activated charcoal, 16% bentonite, and 79% reticulated red clay were found to be 13.20% and 23.97% of pure reticulated red clay, respectively."
Over Investigation: An Ethical Debate,"Over investigations contribute to escalating health costs driven by multiple factors including physician decisions, patient requests, information overload, technological advances, marketing, hospital management policies, insurance requirements and defensive practices. The reconciliation between knowledge and clinical wisdom while dealing with uncertainties in medicine is the primary way forward through this ethical maze. A case scenario illustrates what pediatricians need to reflect upon while facing decisions on rational investigations to maximize beneficence while being aware of economics of healthcare delivery."
Causal associations between insulin and Lp(a) levels in Caucasian population: a Mendelian randomization study,"Numerous observational studies have demonstrated that circulating lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] might be inversely related to the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, recent Mendelian randomization (MR) studies do not consistently support this association. The results of in vitro research suggest that high insulin concentrations can suppress Lp(a) levels by affecting apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] synthesis. This study aimed to identify the relationship between genetically predicted insulin concentrations and Lp(a) levels, which may partly explain the associations between low Lp(a) levels and increased risk of T2D."
Liver and pancreas transplantation in adult donor and recipients with situs inversus totalis: a case series and review of the literature,"Situs inversus totalis is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by a mirror-image orientation of abdominal, and in some cases, thoracic organs. Here, we report our situs inversus totalis transplantation experience and further review liver transplantations in adult recipients and donors with situs inversus totalis."
Effect of synergistic flame retardancy on the flame retardant and smoke suppression properties of bamboo fiber composites,"Bamboo fiber composites (BFCs) possess significant potential for application in the automotive industry. However, the flammability of bamboo fibers and the substantial amount of smoke generated during combustion hinder their application to some extent. Considering the low flame retardancy of a single flame retardant, BFCs were prepared by incorporating ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and nanomagnesium hydroxide (NMH) in this work. The synergistic effect and flame retardant mechanisms were investigated through mechanical properties testing, thermogravimetric analysis, limiting oxygen index testing, cone calorimetry testing, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. When the optimal ratio of APP to NMH was 6:4, the pyrolysis reaction of BFCs was the most difficult to occur, and the oxygen index value reached the noncombustible level. Compared with those of the untreated materials, the peak heat release rate and total smoke production of BFC/6A4N decreased by 45.65% and 59.68%, respectively. APP and NMH exhibited significant synergistic effects during combustion, which enhanced both the flame retardant and smoke suppression properties in the condensed and gas phases, making it a promising synergistic system for BFCs. This work provides possibilities and safety assurances for the preparation of flame retardant and smoke suppression bamboo fiber/phenolic resin composites, promoting the development of materials towards multifunctional and high-performance applications while ensuring cost-effectiveness."
Retention time dataset for heterogeneous molecules in reversed–phase liquid chromatography,"Quantitative structure–property relationships have been extensively studied in the field of predicting retention times in liquid chromatography (LC). However, making transferable predictions is inherently complex because retention times are influenced by both the structure of the molecule and the chromatographic method used. Despite decades of development and numerous published machine learning models, the practical application of predicting small molecule retention time remains limited. The resulting models are typically limited to specific chromatographic conditions and the molecules used in their training and evaluation. Here, we have developed a comprehensive dataset comprising over 10,000 experimental retention times. These times were derived from 30 different reversed-phase liquid chromatography methods and pertain to a collection of 343 small molecules representing a wide range of chemical structures. These chromatographic methods encompass common LC setups for studying the retention behavior of small molecules. They offer a wide range of examples for modeling retention time with different LC setups."
A CCL2/MCP-1 antagonist attenuates fibrosis of the infrapatellar fat pad in a rat model of arthritis,"Fibrosis of the infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) is a feature of osteoarthritis and contributes substantially to the pain and dysfunction in patients’ joints. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. C-C motif chemokine ligand-2 (CCL2) plays a central role in tissue fibrosis. Thus, we aimed to investigate the role of CCL2 in the development of IFP fibrosis in a rat model of arthritis, hypothesizing that a CCL2 antagonist could mitigate fibrotic progression."
E-Cigarettes induce expression of procoagulant tissue factor in cultivated human endothelial cells,"Background: E-cigarettes (ECIG) are proposed as an alternative for regular tobacco users with less dangerous effects for health. Several studies demonstrated that ECIG exert deleterious cardiovascular effects and promote platelet dependent thrombosis. However, ECIG role on Tissue Factor-dependent thrombosis is still unknown. Dysfunctional endothelial cells (ECs) are known to express Tissue Factor (TF) on their surface. Aim of the present study was to investigate whether ECIG might promote TF expression in ECs, shifting them to a pro thrombotic phenotype. Methods: Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) were incubated with increasing doses of ECIG (commercially available and mix of propylene glycol/vegetable glycerine/nicotine 18 mg/mL) up to 1.8 mg/mL. TF gene expression and protein levels were assessed at different time points by Real Time PCR and Western Blot, respectively. TF surface expression and activity were also measured by FACS analysis and coagulation assay. Finally, NF-kB translocation was investigated as possible mechanism of action. Potential protective effects by Rosuvastatin were also investigated. Results: ECIG significantly increased TF expression at both gene and protein levels in a time and dose dependent manner. Surface expression and procoagulant activity were increased as well. These phenomena appeared modulated by the NF-κB pathway. Rosuvastatin reduced ECIG effects on TF-mRNA. Conclusions: Although in vitro, we indicate that ECIG promote a pro thrombotic phenotype in ECs via expression of functional TF. Data of the present study permit to shed a brighter light on the still partially unresolved issue about the role of ECIG in development of cardiovascular diseases suggesting that they might represent a potential risk factor for thrombotic cardiovascular events."
Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder mimicking cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy with symmetrical lesions in the temporal poles and external capsules on MRI,"Symmetrical lesions in the temporal poles and external capsules on brain MRI are known as radiological markers of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL); however, similar imaging findings have also been reported in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and this study investigated the frequency of such findings. The study included 55 NMOSD patients who met the 2015 international NMO diagnosis panel (IPND) criteria and were positive for aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4-Ab). Images were evaluated based on the consensus of two neuroradiologists, and brain lesions were detected in 33 patients, of whom 2 (6%) had symmetrical lesions in both the temporal poles and external capsules, and 1 (3%) had symmetrical lesions confined to the external capsules. Therefore, when symmetrical lesions in the temporal poles and external capsules are observed on MRI, NMOSD should be considered in the differential diagnosis."
Simulation study of the performance of the Very Large Area gamma-ray Space Telescope,"The Very Large Area gamma-ray Space Telescope (VLAST) is a mission concept proposed to detect gamma-ray photons through both Compton scattering and electron–positron pair production mechanisms, thus enabling the detection of photons with energies ranging from MeV to TeV. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive survey of the gamma-ray sky from a low-Earth orbit using an anti-coincidence detector, a tracker detector that also serves as a low-energy calorimeter, and a high-energy imaging calorimeter. We developed a Monte Carlo simulation application of the detector using the GEANT4 toolkit to evaluate the instrument performance, including the effective area, angular resolution, and energy resolution, and explored specific optimizations of the detector configuration. Our simulation-based analysis indicates that the current design of the VLAST is physically feasible, with an acceptance above 10 \(\mathrm m^2\, \text{sr}\) which is four times larger than that of the Fermi-LAT, an energy resolution better than 2% at 10 GeV, and an angular resolution better than 0.2\(^\circ\) at 10 GeV. The VLAST project promises to make significant contributions to the field of gamma-ray astronomy and enhance our understanding of the cosmos."
Stabilized Cuδ+-OH species on in situ reconstructed Cu nanoparticles for CO2-to-C2H4 conversion in neutral media,"Achieving large-scale electrochemical CO2 reduction to multicarbon products with high selectivity using membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzers in neutral electrolyte is promising for carbon neutrality. However, the unsatisfactory multicarbon products selectivity and unclear reaction mechanisms in an MEA have hindered its further development. Here, we report a strategy that manipulates the interfacial microenvironment of Cu nanoparticles in an MEA to suppress hydrogen evolution reaction and enhance C2H4 conversion. In situ multimodal characterizations consistently reveal well-stabilized Cuδ+-OH species as active sites during MEA testing. The OH radicals generated in situ from water create a locally oxidative microenvironment on the copper surface, stabilizing the Cuδ+ species and leading to an irreversible and asynchronous change in morphology and valence, yielding high-curvature nanowhiskers. Consequently, we deliver a selective C2H4 production with a Faradaic efficiency of 55.6% ± 2.8 at 316 mA cm−2 in neutral media."
Ensemble of physics-informed neural networks for solving plane elasticity problems with examples,"Two-dimensional (plane) elasticity equations in solid mechanics are solved numerically with the use of an ensemble of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The system of equations consists of the kinematic definitions, i.e. the strain–displacement relations, the equilibrium equations connecting a stress tensor with external loading forces and the isotropic constitutive relations for stress and strain tensors. Different boundary conditions for the strain tensor and displacements are considered. The proposed computational approach is based on principles of artificial intelligence and uses a developed open-source machine learning platform, scientific software Tensorflow, written in Python and Keras library, an application programming interface, intended for a deep learning. A deep learning is performed through training the physics-informed neural network model in order to fit the plain elasticity equations and given boundary conditions at collocation points. The numerical technique is tested on an example, where the exact solution is given. Two examples with plane stress problems are calculated with the proposed multi-PINN model. The numerical solution is compared with results obtained after using commercial finite element software. The numerical results have shown that an application of a multi-network approach is more beneficial in comparison with using a single PINN with many outputs. The derived results confirmed the efficiency of the introduced methodology. The proposed technique can be extended and applied to the structures with nonlinear material properties."
Gingerol nanoparticles attenuate complete Freund adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats via targeting the RANKL/OPG signaling pathway,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by inflammatory joint pathology leading to the degradation of articular bone and cartilage, primarily triggered by synovial inflammation, resulting in joint discomfort. The metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints are predominantly affected. Treatment typically involves a combination of biological and synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DAMARDs) alongside steroid therapy. The application of nanomedicine has been instrumental in enhancing treatment efficacy by facilitating controlled release of pharmacologically active compounds, thus augmenting bioavailability and enabling targeted drug delivery. Gingerol, a constituent of ginger, possesses multifaceted properties. including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, antidiabetic, and antipyretic effects. In this study, gingerol-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs), coated with chitosan, were administered orally to rats over a period of 21 days to address RA induced by complete Freund adjuvant (CFA). The rats were segregated into four experimental groups. Upon completion of the treatment regimen, blood samples were collected for the assessment of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), RA factor, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Subsequent gene expression analysis was conducted to evaluate the levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-17a (IL-17a), IL-6, interferon-gamma (INF-γ), TNF-α, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL). Statistical analyses utilizing one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey tests were applied to the data. The gene expression profiling revealed significant disparities in mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-4, IL-17a, RANKL, INF-γ, and TNF-α between the CFA-induced arthritis group and the control group. Consequently, it was inferred that gingerol-loaded PLGA NPs coated with chitosan exhibited heightened therapeutic efficacy in addressing CFA-induced arthritis in rats."
Prenatal diagnosis of recurrent Kagami–Ogata syndrome inherited from a mother affected by Temple syndrome: a case report and literature review,"Kagami–Ogata syndrome (KOS) and Temple syndrome (TS) are two imprinting disorders characterized by the absence or reduced expression of maternal or paternal genes in the chromosome 14q32 region, respectively. We present a rare prenatally diagnosed case of recurrent KOS inherited from a mother affected by TS."
Radiologic evaluation of the internal carotid artery and jugular bulb in lateral temporal bone resection using 3D computed tomography,This study investigated the internal carotid artery (ICA) and jugular bulb (JB) structures in terms of lateral temporal bone resection using 3D computed tomography (CT).
"Nursery provision of red-algal habitats in temperate Algoa Bay, South Africa","This study examines the importance of both macroalgal heterogeneity and specific macroalgal species or morphotypes to nursery provision for juvenile sparids (Diplodus capensis and Sarpa salpa) in a shallow (< 2 m), sheltered rocky cove in warm-temperate Algoa Bay, South Africa. The rocky cove is comprised of a mosaic of two main benthic habitats; canopy-forming Plocamium corallorhiza beds on rocky outcrops and flat reef dominated by low growing red algae morphotypes. We assessed macroalgal communities and the trophic ecology (stomach contents and isotopes), abundance and size structure of D. capensis and S. salpa in the two different benthic habitats and the resources/food associated with the dominant macroalgae species/morphotypes. We found high densities of S. salpa and D. capensis, in both high profile reef (rocky outcrops) and low profile (flat) reef. Within this habitat mosaic resources (epiphytes and macroinvertebrates) were more abundant in the non-canopy forming low growing macroalgae (Laurencia spp. and coralline turf algae) and these algae were also assimilated in the diets of both sparids. The high abundance of both juvenile S. salpa and D. capensis in high profile and low profile reef, suggests that within this mosaic of habitats these species may be using canopy-forming algae in the high profile reef for shelter and non-canopy forming algae in both the high and low profile reef for food. This shows that macroalgal habitats comprising several morphotypes have the potential to support higher juvenile diversity and abundance through both food provision and shelter."
Impact of food price inflation on stunting in under five aged children in Bangladesh,"Currently, food price inflation is a widespread issue in Bangladesh as well as the rest of the world. Malnutrition is a common issue among children that can have long-lasting effects on their development and overall health. There have been lots of studies conducted to identify the factors responsible for child malnutrition, but inflation is rarely considered a factor in child malnutrition. We aimed to determine the relationship between food price inflation and stunting (Height-for-Age Z-score (HAZ)) in children under five years of age in Bangladesh."
The level of partial pressure of carbon dioxide affects organ perfusion in respiratory failure patients undergoing pressure support ventilation with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a prospective study,We evaluated the influence of different partial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2) levels on organ perfusion in patients with respiratory failure receiving pressure-support ventilation with veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO).
Wellbeing in stroke and aphasia (WISA): protocol for a feasibility study setting up an accessible service offering psychological therapy to people with post-stroke aphasia,"Following a stroke, around a quarter of people will have aphasia, a language disability. Aphasia can have a devastating long-term impact on a person’s psychological wellbeing, yet their language difficulties make it challenging to access mental health care. The Wellbeing In Stroke and Aphasia (WISA) study aims to evaluate the feasibility of setting up an accessible psychological service for people with aphasia."
Temporal witnesses of non-classicality in a macroscopic biological system,"Exciton transfer along a bio-polymer is essential for many biological processes, for instance, light harvesting in photosynthetic biosystems. Here we apply a new witness of non-classicality to this phenomenon, to conclude that, if an exciton can mediate the coherent quantum evolution of a photon, then the exciton is non-classical. We then propose a general qubit model for the quantum transfer of an exciton along a bio-polymer chain, also discussing the effects of environmental decoherence. The generality of our results makes them ideal candidates to design new tests of quantum features in complex bio-molecules."
How the landscape pattern and landscape elements affect the source-based soundscape diversity,"In urban green space (UGS), diverse acoustic resources are essential for enhancing the public’s well-being, as different sound sources can bring distinct auditory experiences. However, there is a lack of research on the sources-based soundscapes diversity (SSD). In this study, we fill this gap by exploring the characteristics of SSD in different recreational areas of UGSs across three urban gradients in Fuzhou City, China. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between SSD, landscape elements (LEs), and landscape patterns (LPs) at various spatial scales. Our findings identified 53 types of sound sources, predominantly biological sound and anthrophony. The alpha and beta diversity indices effectively characterized SSD in UGSs and captured the differences in three levels of urbanization. Our results showed that urbanization gradients significantly impact soundscape diversity, especially in terms of animal sounds and mechanical sounds. For LEs, we found that trees play a crucial role in enhancing the diversity of animal and recreation sounds, whereas the proportion of buildings negatively correlates with animal sounds. Our analysis between LPs and SSDs revealed a strong correlation between the built environment (mainly roads) and lawn with traffic sound. In contrast, a higher percentage of forest land was associated with more animal sounds and fewer recreational and mechanical sounds. Characterizing urbanization gradients and the factors affecting SSD can be used to guide the development and enhancement of soundscapes in UGS."
Lifetime depression and mania/hypomania risk predicted by neural markers in three independent young adult samples during working memory and emotional regulation,"Objective markers of pathophysiological processes underlying lifetime depression and mania/hypomania risk can provide biologically informed targets for novel interventions to help prevent the onset of affective disorders in individuals with subsyndromal symptoms. Greater activity within and functional connectivity (FC) between the central executive network (CEN), supporting emotional regulation (ER) subcomponent processes such as working memory (WM), the default mode network (DMN), supporting self-related information processing, and the salience network (SN), is thought to interfere with cognitive functioning and predispose to depressive disorders. Using an emotional n-back paradigm designed to examine WM and ER capacity, we examined in young adults: (1) relationships among activity and FC in these networks and lifetime depression and mania/hypomania risk; (2) the extent to which these relationships were specific to lifetime depression risk versus lifetime mania/hypomania risk; (3) whether findings in a first, Discovery sample n = 101, 63 female, age = 23.85 (2.9) could be replicated in a two independent Test samples of young adults: Test sample 1: n = 90, 60 female, age = 21.7 (2.0); Test sample 2: n = 96, 65 female, age = 21.6 (2.1). The Mood Spectrum Self-Report (MOODS-SR-L) assessed lifetime mania/hypomania risk and depression risk. We showed significant clusters of activity to each contrast in similar locations in the anatomic mask in each Test sample as in the Discovery sample, and, using extracted mean BOLD signal from these clusters as IVs, we showed similar patterns of IV-DV relationships in each Test sample as in the Discovery sample. Specifically, in the Discovery sample, greater DMN activity during WM was associated with greater lifetime depression risk. This finding was specific to depression and replicated in both independent samples (all ps<0.05 qFDR). Greater CEN activity during ER was associated with increased lifetime depression risk and lifetime mania/hypomania risk in all three samples (all ps< 0.05 qFDR). These replicated findings provide promising objective, neural markers to better identify, and guide and monitor early interventions for, depression and mania/hypomania risk in young adults."
The effect of brace treatment history on bone density in preoperative patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) assessed by vertebral bone quality (VBQ) score: a retrospective propensity score-matched analysis,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), a prevalent condition among teenagers, is often accompanied by osteopenia. However, the impact of brace treatment on bone density in AIS patients remains a matter of debate. The Vertebral bone quality (VBQ) score, derived from MRI signal intensity, has been shown to correlate with bone mineral density (BMD). Yet, no studies to date have drawn comparisons between VBQ scores in preoperative AIS patients who had brace treatment history and those who have not received brace treatment."
Effect of the frequency of multi-specific synchronous spawning on genetic introgression among three Acropora species,"Hybridisation is an evolutionary process that generates genetic diversity in organisms. However, the relationship between reproductive features, such as spawning synchronisation and gamete compatibility, and the degree of introgression leading to hybridisation are poorly understood. The reef-building coral Acropora spp. have a complex evolutionary history, and the link between their ecology, life-history traits, and potential to hybridise is disputed. Here, we examined the relationship among the reproductive features involved in the intercrossing of three species, Acropora florida, Acropora gemmifera, and Acropora intermedia, at two sites: Akajima and the Sesoko islands in southern Japan. Although the examined species showed synchronous spawning and high rates of gamete compatibility, spawning synchronisation and gamete compatibility were less strongly associated with high rates of interbreeding among the three species. Model-based genetic clustering and site-pattern frequency-based tests with single nucleotide polymorphisms supported genetic admixture among the three species in each location. Demographic analyses using fastsimcoal implied that the admixture among the three species in each location might have occurred in the past (> 2,000 generations) and recently (< 50 generations). Furthermore, the recent admixture of these three species is potentially associated with heavy bleaching events and population declines. The principal component analysis, structure, and fastsimcoal showed that the extensive admixture of A. intermedia and A. gemmifera on Sesoko Island occurred recently. Therefore, gamete interactions that lead to hybridisation in the field must be clarified. Furthermore, the connectivity between the two locations needs to be identified; however, our results implied that population fluctuations could be associated with introgression."
Estimating the energy of dissipative neural systems,"There is, at present, a lack of consensus regarding precisely what is meant by the term 'energy' across the sub-disciplines of neuroscience. Definitions range from deficits in the rate of glucose metabolism in consciousness research to regional changes in neuronal activity in cognitive neuroscience. In computational neuroscience virtually all models define the energy of neuronal regions as a quantity that is in a continual process of dissipation to its surroundings. This, however, is at odds with the definition of energy used across all sub-disciplines of physics: a quantity that does not change as a dynamical system evolves in time. Here, we bridge this gap between the dissipative models used in computational neuroscience and the energy-conserving models of physics using a mathematical technique first proposed in the context of fluid dynamics. We go on to derive an expression for the energy of the linear time-invariant (LTI) state space equation. We then use resting-state fMRI data obtained from the human connectome project to show that LTI energy is associated with glucose uptake metabolism. Our hope is that this work paves the way for an increased understanding of energy in the brain, from both a theoretical as well as an experimental perspective."
Single-machine group scheduling with general linear deterioration and truncated learning effects,"In this paper we consider single-machine scheduling problems with group technology, where the group setup times are general linear functions of their starting times and the jobs in the same group have general truncated learning effects. The objective is to minimize the makespan and total completion time, respectively. We show that the makespan minimization remains polynomially solvable. For the total completion time minimization, optimal properties are presented and then we introduce some heuristic algorithms and a branch-and-bound algorithm."
Heraclitus-Maximal Worlds,"Within the context of general relativity, the Heraclitus asymmetry property requires that no distinct pair of spacetime events have the same local structure Manchak and Barrett 
(2023). Here, we explore Heraclitus-maximal worlds – those which are “as large as they can be” with respect to the Heraclitus property. Using Zorn’s lemma, we prove that such worlds exist and highlight a number of their properties. If attention is restricted to Heraclitus-maximal worlds, we show senses in which observers have the epistemic resources to know which world they inhabit."
A real-world study of active vitamin D as a prognostic marker in patients with sarcoma,"The assessment of sarcoma during clinical practice is primarily based on imaging examination, with no effective biomarkers available. Although it has been established that 1,25(OH)2D3 is abnormally expressed in patients with sarcoma, it remains unclear whether 1,25(OH)2D3 level could be used as an evaluation marker in these patient population."
Report of a case of renal collecting duct carcinoma with literature review,"Collecting duct carcinoma (CDC) is a rare pathologic subtype of renal cell carcinoma that accounts for approximately 0.4–1% of cases and originates in the collecting ducts (Bellini ducts) of the renal medulla. The majority of patients are metastatic at the time of presentation, extremely malignant and rapidly progressive, with most patients dying 1–3 years after initial diagnosis. Currently, surgery is considered the only effective treatment. There is no uniform standard for postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy.In this article, we report a case of an 85-year-old female patient with CDC who underwent radical nephrectomy. This is an extremely rare case. We describe the case and perform a literature review to report current research advances regarding the treatment and prognosis of patients with CDC. The aim of this study is to contribute to improving the diagnosis and treatment of CDC."
Effect of environmental factors on modal identification of a hydroelectric dam’s hollow-gravity concrete block,"Dams are a type of civil infrastructure that can directly impact people’s well-being, as their function is energy production, flood control, or water supply. Therefore, it is worth generating strategies to assess its current condition, since structural changes may occur during its useful life. One highly effective approach for evaluating the structural integrity of dams involves monitoring alterations in modal parameters. This method enables the identification of abnormal changes that may arise from structural degradation. Numerous studies have revealed the strong influence of environmental factors on modal parameters, resulting in variations unrelated to structural damage. This paper investigates the effects of environmental factors such as upstream water level and air temperature on the temporal evolution of the identified modal parameters of a hydroelectric dam’s hollow-gravity concrete block. Modal identification is performed through an automatic procedure of estimating modal parameters to 30-min acceleration time series over 3 years of operation. Correlation analysis reveals a distinct relationship between the identified modal parameters and environmental factors. Changes in air temperature exhibit a direct proportional impact on natural frequencies, while fluctuations of the upstream level have an inverse effect. Furthermore, a time lag was observed in the natural frequencies concerning air temperature. Multiple linear regressions were fitted to mitigate the induced effects, incorporating as predictors the upstream water level and the averages of air temperature segments measured prior to the predicted frequency. A reduction in variability of more than 50% was achieved in an out-of-sample 8-month period for the modes linked to the natural frequencies most influenced by environmental factors."
Comparison of the Waveguide and Phase–Energy Invariants in the Near-Field Zone of Acoustic Illumination,"In many problems of practical importance the interference structure of broadband-signal intensity field in shallow water is determined by the close-to-unity value of the waveguide invariant (WI) β (which is often referred to as the Chuprov invariant). This circumstance is used in ranging, when estimating the distance to the source or its relative velocity. However, the characteristics of the β invariant in deep sea have been studied insufficiently. The WI properties in the near-field acoustic-illumination zone (NFAIZ) of deep sea are investigated below. Its value is shown to be unstable: WI changes in a wide range and actually is not an invariant. Another value—phase–energy invariant (PEI) βef—proved to be more promising in deep sea. In the NFAIZ of deep sea, at real depths of sources and PEI detectors, it is equal to unity with a high accuracy (except for the interference minima zones). It is also found that coherent addition of Fourier components in the complex plane can be implemented in the NFAIZ, provided that a correction to phase variation is introduced when summing spectral densities along ridges. To this end, one must take into account that the Fourier-component phase on a ridge changes almost linearly with an increase or decrease in frequency. In principle, consideration of these characteristics of signals makes it possible to solve more efficiently various applied problems of acoustics. However, to implement this possibility, it is necessary to develop a fairly complex algorithm of signal power accumulation in the frequency–space domain."
Dynamic correlation between surface carbon response and underlying emissions from spontaneous combustion goaf: field study of an abandoned coal mine,"Abandoned coal mine goaf is affected by air leakages and prone to spontaneous combustion, resulting in environmental pollution and geological disasters. Haizhou Open-pit Mine adopts both underground and open-pit mining methods. During the long-term mining process, the original stable stratum structure is constantly destroyed, and the slope slides, increasing cracks and severe air leakage around the goaf and roadway. The spontaneous combustion of coal is particularly prominent after the mine shut down. At present, there is no suitable indirect monitoring method to effectively explore the spontaneous combustion area in goaf. The study developed an all-weather monitoring plan and conducted multi-point continuous long-term measurements of the spontaneous combustion state in one abandoned coal mine goaf located in the eastern part of the Haizhou Open-pit Mine. We evaluated the dynamic correlation between surface CO2 flux (SCF) and changes in the underground fire areas, determined the scope and evolution trend of the fire areas, and identified the distribution and change laws of SCF. The results show a significant positive correlation between SCF and soil temperature; moreover, the SCF value was found to reflect the CO2 emission intensity of the goaf. The high SCF in the test area showed month-wise expansion and increase, while the CO2 emission gradually increased monthly, and the calculated annual total emission was approximately 7017 t. Hence, the study can further provide guidance for the monitoring of spontaneous combustion in shallow coal seams, goaf and the assessment of CO2 emissions from underground coal fires through the on-site monitoring and analysis results."
Resolution of Hydroacoustic Noise Signals under Conditions of Spatial–Temporal Variability of Ocean Environment,"Holographic processing of hydroacoustic noise signals in randomly inhomogeneous ocean environment is presented. A method of hologram purification from a perturbed field is described. An algorithm of resolving signals using a single detector is presented. Focusing of signal spectral density on a hologram is considered. Criteria of signal resolution are proposed. Results of numerical simulation of the resolution of two hydroacoustic signals against the background of intense internal waves, conditioning coupling of sound field modes, are shown."
Features of Light Scattering in Turbid Media As Modeled for Two-Component Emulsions,"Specific features of the angular distribution of scattering intensity in a two-component turbid medium consisting of spherical particles have been investigated using numerical simulation. The algorithm for calculating multiple scattering in a turbid medium was based on the Monte Carlo method. Laws of change in the shape of light-scattering phase function in dependence of the size and number of particles per unit volume of the medium are revealed. It is shown that, in comparison with the case of single-component medium, addition of a fraction of particles with sizes larger than the main-fraction particles by an order of magnitude leads to deviation of intensity at forward scattering angles (from 0° to ~40°) to smaller values. Simulation was performed for intermediate-size particles of the main and impurity components of the turbid medium, which approximately correspond to the fat phase of milk and cellular impurities, respectively."
Improving the cooking quality of black glutinous rice by using the low-pressure cold plasma technology,"Black glutinous rice grains are hard cooking even though they have been soaked in water for a long period of time. This study aimed to improve the cooking quality of black glutinous rice by the low-pressure cold plasma. The low-pressure cold plasma significantly increased the lightness of the rice grains, especially the oxygen and air plasma. The water uptake of the rice grains was significantly increased after plasma treatment. No difference among the plasmas generated by Ar, Air or O2 gases. SEM examination showed that the surface structure of rice grains changed from smoothness to roughness throughout the break and reduced the contact angle. Air and O2plasma increased the softness and stickiness of cooked rice. Anthocyanin content was significantly increased in the range of 14.59 to 25.97 mg/100g in treated sample than those of untreated (10.72 mg/100 g). Air and O2plasma could modify the surface structure of rice grains due to increased softness and stickiness while reducing hardness. Therefore, low-pressure cold plasma could be a potential innovative technology for improving the cooking quality process while maintaining the nutritional value of black glutinous rice grains."
Effect of synthetic conditions on the structure and magnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles in diethylene glycol medium,"Ultra-small iron oxide nanoparticles (USNPs) have attracted particular attention in the past 15 years as perspective contrast agents for MRI. Unfortunately, the synthesis of such small nanoparticles with high contrast properties and water dispersibility is still challenging. This paper presents a study on the influence of synthetic conditions on the structure and the properties of hydrophilic iron oxide nanoparticles obtained by a simple single-step thermal decomposition in diethylene glycol at 230–235 °C. The samples were studied using X-ray diffraction, Mössbauer and infra-red spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, vibrating sample magnetometry, MRI, and dynamic light scattering. All the obtained samples are of spinel structure (Fd-3 m), specific to both magnetite and maghemite. With an increase in the synthesis time from 1 to 8 h, the crystallite size of the series with C(Fe(acac)3) = 30 mM changed from 1.8 ± 0.2 to 4.7 ± 0.5 nm, the average size according to TEM changed from 3.3 ± 0.8 to 3.8 ± 0.4 nm, and the saturation magnetization from 13.9 ± 0.3 to 83.3 ± 1.7 A•m2/kg, which is close to the values of bulk iron oxide. The same tendency was revealed with the increase in the concentration of C(Fe(acac)3) from 30 to 120 mM for 1 h of synthesis. An increase in the synthesis time for 60- and 120-mM solutions did not significantly change the crystallite size and the magnetic properties. It was shown that the samples obtained using this approach have unexpectedly high values of r2-relaxivity, up to 235 mM−1•s−1, which the highest published for USNPs. The studied method of water-soluble USNPs is promising for use in creating T2-contrast agents for MRI."
Simulation study of the performance of the Very Large Area gamma-ray Space Telescope,"The Very Large Area gamma-ray Space Telescope (VLAST) is a mission concept proposed to detect gamma-ray photons through both Compton scattering and electron–positron pair production mechanisms, thus enabling the detection of photons with energies ranging from MeV to TeV. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive survey of the gamma-ray sky from a low-Earth orbit using an anti-coincidence detector, a tracker detector that also serves as a low-energy calorimeter, and a high-energy imaging calorimeter. We developed a Monte Carlo simulation application of the detector using the GEANT4 toolkit to evaluate the instrument performance, including the effective area, angular resolution, and energy resolution, and explored specific optimizations of the detector configuration. Our simulation-based analysis indicates that the current design of the VLAST is physically feasible, with an acceptance above 10 \(\mathrm m^2\, \text{sr}\) which is four times larger than that of the Fermi-LAT, an energy resolution better than 2% at 10 GeV, and an angular resolution better than 0.2\(^\circ\) at 10 GeV. The VLAST project promises to make significant contributions to the field of gamma-ray astronomy and enhance our understanding of the cosmos."
Stabilized Cuδ+-OH species on in situ reconstructed Cu nanoparticles for CO2-to-C2H4 conversion in neutral media,"Achieving large-scale electrochemical CO2 reduction to multicarbon products with high selectivity using membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzers in neutral electrolyte is promising for carbon neutrality. However, the unsatisfactory multicarbon products selectivity and unclear reaction mechanisms in an MEA have hindered its further development. Here, we report a strategy that manipulates the interfacial microenvironment of Cu nanoparticles in an MEA to suppress hydrogen evolution reaction and enhance C2H4 conversion. In situ multimodal characterizations consistently reveal well-stabilized Cuδ+-OH species as active sites during MEA testing. The OH radicals generated in situ from water create a locally oxidative microenvironment on the copper surface, stabilizing the Cuδ+ species and leading to an irreversible and asynchronous change in morphology and valence, yielding high-curvature nanowhiskers. Consequently, we deliver a selective C2H4 production with a Faradaic efficiency of 55.6% ± 2.8 at 316 mA cm−2 in neutral media."
Ensemble of physics-informed neural networks for solving plane elasticity problems with examples,"Two-dimensional (plane) elasticity equations in solid mechanics are solved numerically with the use of an ensemble of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The system of equations consists of the kinematic definitions, i.e. the strain–displacement relations, the equilibrium equations connecting a stress tensor with external loading forces and the isotropic constitutive relations for stress and strain tensors. Different boundary conditions for the strain tensor and displacements are considered. The proposed computational approach is based on principles of artificial intelligence and uses a developed open-source machine learning platform, scientific software Tensorflow, written in Python and Keras library, an application programming interface, intended for a deep learning. A deep learning is performed through training the physics-informed neural network model in order to fit the plain elasticity equations and given boundary conditions at collocation points. The numerical technique is tested on an example, where the exact solution is given. Two examples with plane stress problems are calculated with the proposed multi-PINN model. The numerical solution is compared with results obtained after using commercial finite element software. The numerical results have shown that an application of a multi-network approach is more beneficial in comparison with using a single PINN with many outputs. The derived results confirmed the efficiency of the introduced methodology. The proposed technique can be extended and applied to the structures with nonlinear material properties."
B7-1 and PlGF-1 are two possible new biomarkers to identify fracture-associated trauma patients at higher risk of developing complications: a cohort study,"Around 10% of fractures lead to complications. With increasing fracture incidences in recent years, this poses a serious burden on the healthcare system, with increasing costs for treatment. In the present study, we aimed to identify potential ‘new’ blood markers to predict the development of post-surgical complications in trauma patients following a fracture."
Hardy–Littlewood fractional maximal operators on homogeneous trees,We study the mapping properties of the Hardy–Littlewood fractional maximal operator between Lorentz spaces of the homogeneous tree and discuss the optimality of all the results.
Insufficient compliance of the German Therapeutic Products Advertising Act in product catalogues of online pharmacies,"The importance of ordering drugs from online pharmacies in Germany is increasing constantly. At the same time, there are many online pharmacies that try to increase their own market share through advertising. In Germany, the advertising of drugs is regulated by the Therapeutic Products Advertising Act (Heilmittelwerbegesetz (HWG)) and must therefore also be complied with by online pharmacies in their product catalogues. One important purpose of the HWG is to protect consumers by ensuring that they are presented with all necessary medical-pharmacological information about the advertised product. This paper examines the implementation of as well as the compliance with Section 4 of the HWG in the product catalogues of two online pharmacies. For this purpose, the spring/summer catalogue of 2023 was considered in the allergy, cold and gastrointestinal tract categories, resulting in the inclusion of 143 drugs from online pharmacy 1 (OP1) and 102 drugs from online pharmacy 2 (OP2) for the analysis. The information on the drugs was taken from the respective catalogue and the pharmaceutical index ‘Gelbe Liste’, collected in tabular form and was encoded. Subsequently, the required mandatory information according to Section 4 was checked by comparing the collected information with the information from the package leaflet. The analysis revealed that both catalogues insufficiently complied with Section 4 of the HWG. OP1 complied with 75% of the mandatory information required under Section 4 of the HWG and OP2 with 64%. In the OP1 catalogue, there is no indication for 6% of the drugs and no specification for 29% of the traditionally registered drugs. In addition, the mandatory notice on risks and adverse effects in the OP1 catalogue is not presented in a consumer-friendly way. In the OP2 catalogue, further concerns about the compliance with the HWG were raised due to the missing indication for 17% of the drugs, no warning for 64% of the ethanol-containing drugs and no active ingredient for 31% of the monopreparations. The insufficient compliance with the HWG in the product catalogues of OP1 and OP2 means that consumer protection as a stated objective of the HWG cannot be guaranteed. Advertising for drugs should only be possible under the condition that the content of the advertisement complies with the HWG. Insufficient compliance, as in the product catalogue of OP1 and OP2, should be prohibited as it directly contradicts the law’s objective."
Stripe Error Correction for Landsat-7 Using Deep Learning,"Long-term time series satellite imagery became highly essential for analyzing earth cycles such as global warming, climate change, and urbanization. Landsat‑7 satellite imagery plays a key role in this domain since it provides open-access data with expansive coverage and consistent temporal resolution for more than two decades. This paper addresses the challenge of stripe errors induced by Scan Line Corrector sensor malfunction in Landsat‑7 ETM+ satellite imagery, resulting in data loss and degradation. To overcome this problem, we propose a Generative Adversarial Networks approach to fill the gaps in the Landsat‑7 ETM+ panchromatic images. First, we introduce the YTU_STRIPE dataset, comprising Landsat‑8 OLI panchromatic images with synthetically induced stripe errors, for model training and testing. Our results indicate sufficient performance of the Pix2Pix GAN for this purpose. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach through systematic experimentation and evaluation using various accuracy metrics, including Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, Structural Similarity Index Measurement, Universal Image Quality Index, Correlation Coefficient, and Root Mean Square Error which were calculated as 38.5570, 0.9206, 0.7670, 0.7753 and 3.8212, respectively. Our findings suggest promising prospects for utilizing synthetic imagery from Landsat‑8 OLI to mitigate stripe errors in Landsat‑7 ETM+ SLC-off imagery, thereby enhancing image reconstruction efforts. The datasets and model weights generated in this study are publicly available for further research and development: https://github.com/ynsemrevrl/eliminating-stripe-errors."
Cognitive load associated with speaking clearly in reverberant rooms,"Communication is a fundamental aspect of human interaction, yet many individuals must speak in less-than-ideal acoustic environments daily. Adapting their speech to ensure intelligibility in these varied settings can impose a significant cognitive burden. Understanding this burden on talkers has significant implications for the design of public spaces and workplace environments, as well as speaker training programs. The aim of this study was to examine how room acoustics and speaking style affect cognitive load through self-rating of mental demand and pupillometry. Nineteen adult native speakers of American English were instructed to read sentences in both casual and clear speech—a technique known to enhance intelligibility—across three levels of reverberation (0.05 s, 1.2 s, and 1.83 s at 500–1000 Hz). Our findings revealed that speaking style consistently affects the cognitive load on talkers more than room acoustics across the tested reverberation range. Specifically, pupillometry data suggested that speaking in clear speech elevates the cognitive load comparably to speaking in a room with long reverberation, challenging the conventional view of clear speech as an ‘easy’ strategy for improving intelligibility. These results underscore the importance of accounting for talkers' cognitive load when optimizing room acoustics and developing speech production training."
Identification of genetic variants associated with clinical features of sickle cell disease,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder marked by homozygosity of hemoglobin S, which is a defective hemoglobin caused by a missense mutation in the β-globin gene. However, clinical phenotypes of SCD vary among patients. To investigate genetic variants associated with various clinical phenotypes of SCD, we genotyped DNA samples from 520 SCD subjects and used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach to identify genetic variants associated with phenotypic features of SCD. For HbF levels, the previously reported 2p16.1 locus (BCL11A) reached genome significance (rs1427407, P = 8.58 × 10–10) in our GWAS as expected. In addition, we found a new genome-wide significance locus at 15q14 (rs8182015, P = 2.07 × 10–8) near gene EMC7. GWAS of acute chest syndrome (ACS) detected a locus (rs79915189, P = 3.70 × 10–8) near gene IDH2 at 15q26.1. The SNP, rs79915189, is also an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) of IDH2 in multiple tissues. For vasoocclusive episode (VOE), GWAS detected multiple significant signals at 2p25.1 (rs62118798, P = 4.27 × 10–8), 15q26.1 (rs62020555, P = 2.04 × 10–9) and 15q26.3 (rs117797325, P = 4.63 × 10–8). Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic mechanisms of SCD suggesting that common genetic variants play an important role in the presentation of the clinical phenotypes of patients with SCD."

Achieving productivity and operator well-being: a dynamic task allocation strategy for collaborative assembly systems in Industry 5.0,"Collaborative robots, or cobots, offer a unique combination of productivity and flexibility that has led to significant growth in adoption over the past decade. Moreover, recently, there has been a shift towards a human-centered design of the workspace, known as one of the drivers of Industry 5.0, which prioritizes the well-being of operators. To achieve this, various human factors such as ergonomics, mental workload, personal skills, and capabilities need to be considered in the workspace design, and their impact on system productivity must be evaluated. The integration of a human and a cobot in the same workplace can affect the performance of the human operator, as the perception of the cobot can impact their work. This highlights the importance of taking human factors into account, as a lack of consideration in these aspects has contributed to the failure of many implementations. To link the objectives of productivity, flexibility, and human factors consideration, a dynamic real-time multi-objective task allocation strategy for collaborative assembly systems is developed. This approach considers the different characteristics of the resources and optimizes for two objectives, makespan, and energy expenditure of the operator. By using this approach, it is possible to modify the behavior of the cobot by reallocating tasks between the two resources based on the operator’s current needs. In other words, if the operator appears too stressed due to time constraints or their energy rate level is too high, some of their assigned tasks can be transferred to the cobot. This helps to maintain a balanced system while reducing the operator’s stress."
Tannic Acid Suppresses Ferroptosis Induced by Iron Salophene Complex in Kidney Cells and Prevents Iron Overload-Induced Liver and Kidney Dysfunction in Rats,"Iron toxicity intricately links with ferroptosis, a unique form of cell death, and is significantly influenced by lipid peroxidation. Despite its critical role in various diseases and drug development, the association between iron toxicity and ferroptosis remains relatively unexplored. Accidental iron ingestion has emerged as a growing concern, resulting in a spectrum of symptoms ranging from gastrointestinal discomfort to severe outcomes, including mortality. This research introduces tannic acid (TA), which contains numerous phenol groups, as a powerful antiferroptotic agent. In male Wistar rats, even a modest dose of TA (7.5 mg/kg) significantly curtailed thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), a well-established indicator of lipid peroxidation, and mitigated iron accumulation induced by ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) in the liver and kidney. The evidence supporting TA's protective function against iron-triggered liver and kidney dysfunction was substantiated by assessing specifically the levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). In cell models using ferroptosis inducers such as iron-salophene (FeSP) and RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3), tannic acid (TA) exhibited superior protective capabilities compared to the traditional iron chelator, deferoxamine (DFO). Nrf2 and HO-1, regulators of antioxidant defense genes, are implicated in controlling ferroptosis. The expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 increased with TA treatment in the presence of FeSP, indicating their role in reducing lipid ROS levels. Additionally, TA significantly reduced the heightened levels of COX2, a marker associated with ferroptosis. In summary, the remarkable antiferroptosis activity of TA is likely due to its combined iron-chelating and antioxidant properties. With its safety profile for oral consumption, TA may offer benefits in cases of accidental iron ingestion and conditions like hemochromatosis."
Innovative digital marketing for promoting SDG 2030 knowledge in Jordanian universities in the Middle East,"This study investigate the efficacy of innovative digital marketing strategies in fostering awareness and understanding of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030 within Jordanian universities, situated in the evolving landscape of the Middle East's digital transformation. Through a mixed-methods approach encompassing quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews, we assess SDGs 2030 knowledge and digital marketing practices among students, faculty, and administrators. Our findings reveal a moderate level of familiarity with the SDGs among respondents, alongside a unanimous acknowledgment of the significance of achieving these goals and the pivotal role of universities in their promotion. Notably, significant associations are identified between engagement with digital content and active participation in SDGs-related initiatives, underscoring the effectiveness of digital marketing in stimulating sustainability efforts within university communities. Additionally, positive correlations between engagement frequency and the perceived effectiveness of digital marketing highlight the potential for tailored digital strategies to enhance SDGs promotion. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers disparities in SDGs awareness based on respondents' roles at the university, emphasizing the need for targeted approaches in digital marketing. By implementing recommendations to increase digital content engagement, leverage diverse platforms, and tailor campaigns to specific demographics, universities can effectively contribute to SDG 2030 attainment and cultivate a culture of sustainability among stakeholders."
The Tectonic Inversion Prediction in Fold-and-Thrust Belts by Using Numerical Modeling,"This research investigates tectonic inversion in rifted continental margins, specifically focusing on the interaction between foreland sediment deposits and fold-and-thrust belts during orogeny. Using numerical modeling with ANSYS-2023 R1 software and a Maxwell-type viscoelastic rheology, the study explores positive inversion in petroleum basins, revealing insights into the evolution of inverted basins. The research emphasizes the role of pre-existing extensional fault systems in controlling thrust faults, delving into the reactivation of faults and uplift of the hanging wall during tectonic compression. The study highlights diverse structural patterns associated with tectonic inversion in sub-thrust regions of fold-and-thrust belts, including anticlines, back-thrusts, fault propagation folds, pop-up, and an inversion-related fracture pattern. Results demonstrate the critical influence of rheological properties in fault reactivation and deformational styles during tectonic inversion. Comparisons with natural case studies, like the Helvetic nappes in Switzerland, validate the predictive capability of numerical models for tectonic inversion structures in different geological settings, including the Kohat-Potwar Fold and Thrust Belt in Pakistan. We find important of understanding interplay between geological structures and rheological properties for accuracy of predicting evolution of inverted basins. The deeply study of tectonic inversion are extending to optimizing exploration efforts and interpreting structural complexities in petroleum exploration, providing valuable insights for reservoir prediction and fold-and-thrust belt structural evolution."
Assessment of the efficacy and safety of anlotinib for the treatment of recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer,"The current research aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib, an orally administered small-molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), in the treatment of recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC)."
Differential Influence of Soil Organic Carbon and Calcium on the Community of Lumbricid Earthworms as Ecosystem Engineers in Cool Temperate Forests of Hokkaido,"Earthworms are important ecosystem engineers that stabilize soil aggregates and increase the size of aggregates. The major determinants for the biomass, density, and mean individual weight of lumbricid earthworms are considered to be the availability of soil organic carbon (SOC) and calcium (Ca). However, the importance of SOC and Ca availability for lumbricid earthworms has not been tested simultaneously in the field. In addition, the ripple effects of SOC and Ca on the soil aggregate stability and relative abundance of larger aggregates (mean weight diameter; MWD) via earthworm communities are poorly understood. To fill these knowledge gaps, we conducted field research across a spatially wide range of cool temperate forests, where soils were classified as Cambisols and Andosols and evaluated the relationships among the biomass, density, and mean individual weight of lumbricid earthworms, soil chemical properties, and MWD by conducting structural equation modelling (SEM). Our results showed that SOC affected not the density but the mean individual weight of earthworms. On the other hand, interestingly, exchangeable Ca affected not the mean individual weight but the density of earthworms. These results suggest that SOC stimulates earthworm growth and that exchangeable. Ca enhances the fertility rate and/or survival rate in earthworm communities in forest ecosystems. Furthermore, SOC had a positive ripple effect on the MWD via an increase in the mean individual weight of earthworms. These results suggest that larger earthworms produce larger casts, which bind a larger amount of soil particles thus making larger aggregates."
Fractional-order ILC-based adaptive integrated guidance and control of flight vehicles with system lag,"This paper proposes an adaptive integrated guidance and control (IGC) method termed fractional-order PID-type iterative learning control (FoPILC), which aims to solve the issue of system lag in large maneuvering target interception system. Firstly, to address the shortcomings of recursive models in traditional IGC design, taking into account the sensor dynamic lag and unknown uncertainties, the interception model is represented as a complete high-order nonlinear system with no small angle assume. Secondly, the uncertain information is estimated, which is subsequently utilized in a high-order adaptive controller and integrated with the deviation feedback control to constitute the basic control strategy, and completely avoids the ‘differential explosion’ phenomenon caused by the backstepping method. More importantly, we introduce the FoPILC to update the control commands, which eliminates the influence of the system lag, and improves the accuracy of the impact angle constraint. Finally, the convergence of the control system is analyzed, and the simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed IGC design."
Partial-wave analysis for photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons with truncation in total angular momentum,A partial-wave analysis (PWA) for the photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons on a nucleon using truncation in total angular momentum j is discussed. A formalism is described that can be used for investigating discrete ambiguities. Considerable attention is devoted to the connection of this type of PWA with that based on the truncation in orbital angular momentum l.
"Effects of adaptive scaffolding on performance, cognitive load and engagement in game-based learning: a randomized controlled trial","While game-based learning has demonstrated positive outcomes for some learners, its efficacy remains variable. Adaptive scaffolding may improve performance and self-regulation during training by optimizing cognitive load. Informed by cognitive load theory, this study investigates whether adaptive scaffolding based on interaction trace data influences learning performance, self-regulation, cognitive load, test performance, and engagement in a medical emergency game."

Hardy–Littlewood fractional maximal operators on homogeneous trees,We study the mapping properties of the Hardy–Littlewood fractional maximal operator between Lorentz spaces of the homogeneous tree and discuss the optimality of all the results.
Insufficient compliance of the German Therapeutic Products Advertising Act in product catalogues of online pharmacies,"The importance of ordering drugs from online pharmacies in Germany is increasing constantly. At the same time, there are many online pharmacies that try to increase their own market share through advertising. In Germany, the advertising of drugs is regulated by the Therapeutic Products Advertising Act (Heilmittelwerbegesetz (HWG)) and must therefore also be complied with by online pharmacies in their product catalogues. One important purpose of the HWG is to protect consumers by ensuring that they are presented with all necessary medical-pharmacological information about the advertised product. This paper examines the implementation of as well as the compliance with Section 4 of the HWG in the product catalogues of two online pharmacies. For this purpose, the spring/summer catalogue of 2023 was considered in the allergy, cold and gastrointestinal tract categories, resulting in the inclusion of 143 drugs from online pharmacy 1 (OP1) and 102 drugs from online pharmacy 2 (OP2) for the analysis. The information on the drugs was taken from the respective catalogue and the pharmaceutical index ‘Gelbe Liste’, collected in tabular form and was encoded. Subsequently, the required mandatory information according to Section 4 was checked by comparing the collected information with the information from the package leaflet. The analysis revealed that both catalogues insufficiently complied with Section 4 of the HWG. OP1 complied with 75% of the mandatory information required under Section 4 of the HWG and OP2 with 64%. In the OP1 catalogue, there is no indication for 6% of the drugs and no specification for 29% of the traditionally registered drugs. In addition, the mandatory notice on risks and adverse effects in the OP1 catalogue is not presented in a consumer-friendly way. In the OP2 catalogue, further concerns about the compliance with the HWG were raised due to the missing indication for 17% of the drugs, no warning for 64% of the ethanol-containing drugs and no active ingredient for 31% of the monopreparations. The insufficient compliance with the HWG in the product catalogues of OP1 and OP2 means that consumer protection as a stated objective of the HWG cannot be guaranteed. Advertising for drugs should only be possible under the condition that the content of the advertisement complies with the HWG. Insufficient compliance, as in the product catalogue of OP1 and OP2, should be prohibited as it directly contradicts the law’s objective."

Stripe Error Correction for Landsat-7 Using Deep Learning,"Long-term time series satellite imagery became highly essential for analyzing earth cycles such as global warming, climate change, and urbanization. Landsat‑7 satellite imagery plays a key role in this domain since it provides open-access data with expansive coverage and consistent temporal resolution for more than two decades. This paper addresses the challenge of stripe errors induced by Scan Line Corrector sensor malfunction in Landsat‑7 ETM+ satellite imagery, resulting in data loss and degradation. To overcome this problem, we propose a Generative Adversarial Networks approach to fill the gaps in the Landsat‑7 ETM+ panchromatic images. First, we introduce the YTU_STRIPE dataset, comprising Landsat‑8 OLI panchromatic images with synthetically induced stripe errors, for model training and testing. Our results indicate sufficient performance of the Pix2Pix GAN for this purpose. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach through systematic experimentation and evaluation using various accuracy metrics, including Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, Structural Similarity Index Measurement, Universal Image Quality Index, Correlation Coefficient, and Root Mean Square Error which were calculated as 38.5570, 0.9206, 0.7670, 0.7753 and 3.8212, respectively. Our findings suggest promising prospects for utilizing synthetic imagery from Landsat‑8 OLI to mitigate stripe errors in Landsat‑7 ETM+ SLC-off imagery, thereby enhancing image reconstruction efforts. The datasets and model weights generated in this study are publicly available for further research and development: https://github.com/ynsemrevrl/eliminating-stripe-errors."
Cognitive load associated with speaking clearly in reverberant rooms,"Communication is a fundamental aspect of human interaction, yet many individuals must speak in less-than-ideal acoustic environments daily. Adapting their speech to ensure intelligibility in these varied settings can impose a significant cognitive burden. Understanding this burden on talkers has significant implications for the design of public spaces and workplace environments, as well as speaker training programs. The aim of this study was to examine how room acoustics and speaking style affect cognitive load through self-rating of mental demand and pupillometry. Nineteen adult native speakers of American English were instructed to read sentences in both casual and clear speech—a technique known to enhance intelligibility—across three levels of reverberation (0.05 s, 1.2 s, and 1.83 s at 500–1000 Hz). Our findings revealed that speaking style consistently affects the cognitive load on talkers more than room acoustics across the tested reverberation range. Specifically, pupillometry data suggested that speaking in clear speech elevates the cognitive load comparably to speaking in a room with long reverberation, challenging the conventional view of clear speech as an ‘easy’ strategy for improving intelligibility. These results underscore the importance of accounting for talkers' cognitive load when optimizing room acoustics and developing speech production training."
Identification of genetic variants associated with clinical features of sickle cell disease,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder marked by homozygosity of hemoglobin S, which is a defective hemoglobin caused by a missense mutation in the β-globin gene. However, clinical phenotypes of SCD vary among patients. To investigate genetic variants associated with various clinical phenotypes of SCD, we genotyped DNA samples from 520 SCD subjects and used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach to identify genetic variants associated with phenotypic features of SCD. For HbF levels, the previously reported 2p16.1 locus (BCL11A) reached genome significance (rs1427407, P = 8.58 × 10–10) in our GWAS as expected. In addition, we found a new genome-wide significance locus at 15q14 (rs8182015, P = 2.07 × 10–8) near gene EMC7. GWAS of acute chest syndrome (ACS) detected a locus (rs79915189, P = 3.70 × 10–8) near gene IDH2 at 15q26.1. The SNP, rs79915189, is also an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) of IDH2 in multiple tissues. For vasoocclusive episode (VOE), GWAS detected multiple significant signals at 2p25.1 (rs62118798, P = 4.27 × 10–8), 15q26.1 (rs62020555, P = 2.04 × 10–9) and 15q26.3 (rs117797325, P = 4.63 × 10–8). Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic mechanisms of SCD suggesting that common genetic variants play an important role in the presentation of the clinical phenotypes of patients with SCD."

"Effects of dietary restriction and one-carbon metabolite supplementation during the first 63 days of gestation on the maternal gut, vaginal, and blood microbiota in cattle","Maternal diet quality and quantity have significant impacts on both maternal and fetal health and development. The composition and function of the maternal gut microbiome is also significantly influenced by diet; however, little is known about the impact of gestational nutrient restriction on the bovine maternal microbiome during early gestation, which is a critical stage for maternal microbiome-mediated fetal programming to take place. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the impacts of diet restriction and one-carbon metabolite (OCM) supplementation during early gestation on maternal ruminal, vaginal, and blood microbiota in cattle. Thirty-three beef heifers (approx. 14 months old) were used in a 2 × 2 factorial experiment with main factors of target gain (control [CON]; targeted 0.45 kg/d gain vs restricted [RES]; targeted − 0.23 kg/d gain), and OCM supplementation (+ OCM vs − OCM; n = 8/treatment; except n = 9 for RES–OCM). Heifers were individually fed, starting treatment at breeding (d 0) and concluding at d 63 of gestation. Ruminal fluid and vaginal swabs were collected on d − 2, d 35, and d 63 (at necropsy) and whole blood was collected on d 63 (necropsy). Bacterial microbiota was assessed using 16S rRNA gene (V3–V4) sequencing."
Asymptotic Results for Spacings of Largest Order Statistics,"We prove o- and O-type asymptotic results in probability for properly normalized spacings (differences) of the largest order statistics based on i.i.d. random sample, as the size of the sample tends to infinity. In particular, compactness properties of sequences of spacings are investigated. These results are applied to study the corresponding asymptotic properties of the ratios of upper order statistics and the number of observations near extremes. A common distribution function of the sample is assumed to satisfy mild conditions on regular variation at its right endpoint."
Age-related neural changes underlying long-term recognition of musical sequences,"Aging is often associated with decline in brain processing power and neural predictive capabilities. To challenge this notion, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to record the whole-brain activity of 39 older adults (over 60 years old) and 37 young adults (aged 18–25 years) during recognition of previously memorised and varied musical sequences. Results reveal that when recognising memorised sequences, the brain of older compared to young adults reshapes its functional organisation. In fact, it shows increased early activity in sensory regions such as the left auditory cortex (100 ms and 250 ms after each note), and only moderate decreased activity (350 ms) in medial temporal lobe and prefrontal regions. When processing the varied sequences, older adults show a marked reduction of the fast-scale functionality (250 ms after each note) of higher-order brain regions including hippocampus, ventromedial prefrontal and inferior temporal cortices, while no differences are observed in the auditory cortex. Accordingly, young outperform older adults in the recognition of novel sequences, while no behavioural differences are observed with regards to memorised ones. Our findings show age-related neural changes in predictive and memory processes, integrating existing theories on compensatory neural mechanisms in non-pathological aging."
Ribosomal S6 kinase 1 regulates inflammaging via the senescence secretome,"Inhibition of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) extends lifespan and improves healthspan in mice, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Cellular senescence is a stable growth arrest accompanied by an inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Cellular senescence and SASP-mediated chronic inflammation contribute to age-related pathology, but the specific role of S6K1 has not been determined. Here we show that S6K1 deletion does not reduce senescence but ameliorates inflammation in aged mouse livers. Using human and mouse models of senescence, we demonstrate that reduced inflammation is a liver-intrinsic effect associated with S6K deletion. Specifically, we show that S6K1 deletion results in reduced IRF3 activation; impaired production of cytokines, such as IL1β; and reduced immune infiltration. Using either liver-specific or myeloid-specific S6K knockout mice, we also demonstrate that reduced immune infiltration and clearance of senescent cells is a hepatocyte-intrinsic phenomenon. Overall, deletion of S6K reduces inflammation in the liver, suggesting that suppression of the inflammatory SASP by loss of S6K could underlie the beneficial effects of inhibiting this pathway on healthspan and lifespan."
A targetable type III immune response with increase of IL-17A expressing CD4+ T cells is associated with immunotherapy-induced toxicity in melanoma,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors are standard-of-care for the treatment of advanced melanoma, but their use is limited by immune-related adverse events. Proteomic analyses and multiplex cytokine and chemokine assays from serum at baseline and at the adverse event onset indicated aberrant T cell activity with differential expression of type I and III immune signatures. This was in line with the finding of an increase in the proportion of CD4+ T cells with IL-17A expression at the adverse event onset in the peripheral blood using flow cytometry. Multiplex immunohistochemistry and spatial transcriptomics on immunotherapy-induced skin rash and colitis showed an increase in the proportion of CD4+ T cells with IL-17A expression. Anti-IL-17A was administered in two patients with mild myocarditis, colitis and skin rash with resolution of the adverse events. This study highlights the potential role of type III CD4+ T cells in adverse event development and provides proof-of-principle evidence for a clinical trial using anti-IL-17A for treating adverse events."
The genetic landscape of neuro-related proteins in human plasma,"Understanding the genetic basis of neuro-related proteins is essential for dissecting the molecular basis of human behavioural traits and the disease aetiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Here the SCALLOP Consortium conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of over 12,000 individuals for 184 neuro-related proteins in human plasma. The analysis identified 125 cis-regulatory protein quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTL) and 164 trans-pQTL. The mapped pQTL capture on average 50% of each protein’s heritability. At the cis-pQTL, multiple proteins shared a genetic basis with human behavioural traits such as alcohol and food intake, smoking and educational attainment, as well as neurological conditions and psychiatric disorders such as pain, neuroticism and schizophrenia. Integrating with established drug information, the causal inference analysis validated 52 out of 66 matched combinations of protein targets and diseases or side effects with available drugs while suggesting hundreds of repurposing and new therapeutic targets."
On Stochastic Pure-Cubic Optical Soliton Solutions of Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation Having Power Law of Self-Phase Modulation,"In this study, we focus on the stochastic pure-cubic optical solitons of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, characterized by a parabolic law of nonlinearity. The nonlinear Schrödinger equation models are crucial for simulating pulse propagation in optical fibers especially ultrashort pulses. To obtain optical soliton solutions, we employ the effective and well-known the new Kudryashov and the generalized Kudryashov methods. Through these methods, we successfully derive dark, bright, and singular optical soliton solutions. Our findings are illustrated with 2D and 3D graphics for clarity. A significant aspect of our study is the inclusion of stochasticity in the model. We specifically examine the impact of white noise on the solutions. This effect is detailed in the results section, with corresponding graphs. Throughout our research, we did not encounter any restrictive factors that hindered access to the results. Ultimately, considering the growing number of studies on optical fibers, our work stands out by being the first to obtain optical solutions for this specific model and by investigating the influence of stochastic theories on wave behavior."
Construction of topological quantum magnets from atomic spins on surfaces,"Artificial quantum systems have emerged as platforms to realize topological matter in a well-controlled manner. So far, experiments have mostly explored non-interacting topological states, and the realization of many-body topological phases in solid-state platforms with atomic resolution has remained challenging. Here we construct topological quantum Heisenberg spin lattices by assembling spin chains and two-dimensional spin arrays from spin-1/2 Ti atoms on an insulating MgO film in a scanning tunnelling microscope. We engineer both topological and trivial phases of the quantum spin model and thereby realize first- and second-order topological quantum magnets. We probe the many-body excitations of the quantum magnets by single-atom electron spin resonance with an energy resolution better than 100 neV. Making use of the atomically localized magnetic field of the scanning tunnelling microscope tip, we visualize various many-body topological bound modes including topological edge states, topological defects and higher-order corner modes. Our results provide a bottom-up approach for the simulation of exotic quantum many-body phases of interacting spins."
The child dental care reform in Israel – service uptake from 2011 to 2022,"The 2010 Child Dental Care Reform of the National Health Insurance Law marked a turning point in the Israeli oral healthcare system by establishing Universal Health Coverage of dental care for children. Initially, the reform included children up to age 8 and gradually expanded to age 18 in 2019. The basket of services includes preventive and restorative treatments provided by the four Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO). The aim of this study was to examine the uptake of child dental services during the first decade of the reform."
Correlation between the chemical composition of fresh and dried Cymbopogon citratus essential oil fractions and their antifungal effects against the causal agents of brown spot and bakanae diseases of rice,"The fresh and dried whole plant (CF and CD respectively) of Cympopogon citratus essential oils (EOs) and its fractions, were tested, for their antifungal activities against Bipolaris oryzae and Fusarium moniliforme; respectively responsible of brown spot and bakanae disease of rice (Oryzae sativa L). Their chemical compositions were obtained by GC-GC/MS analysis and correlated with their biological activities. All six collected EO fractions of C. citratus contain myrcene, limonene, α-gurjunene, neral and geranial, but in different proportions. Neral (45.64 - 79.00%) predominant in CD1, CD2, CDm, CFm, and geranial (18.79 - 45.64%) in CF1, CF2; were found as major components. A positive correlation between the biological activity and the predominant constituent (citral) content was not always apparent. Carvacrol acetate and farnesol (2E, 6Z) were found only in EO fractions from fresh plants (CF1, CF2, CFm), and have high antifungal activity against B. oryzae and F. moniliforme compared to that of fractions from dried plants (CD1, CD2, CDm). The EO fractions collected within the first 60 min starting from the moment the first drop of EO was dropped (CF1, CD1), were more active than the fractions collected after 61 min (CF2, CD2). Cedrol, hexahydrofarnesyl acetone, γ-decalactone, β-bisabolol, α-muurolol, cavacrol and β-eudesmol, were present in low amount in CF2 and CD2 and absent in CF1 and CD1. The results serve as benchmark for researchers/industries, in fast and better targeting bioactive compounds and identify plausible interactions that may exist between constituents of an essential oil for a given biological activity."

Rare coding variant analysis for human diseases across biobanks and ancestries,"Large-scale sequencing has enabled unparalleled opportunities to investigate the role of rare coding variation in human phenotypic variability. Here, we present a pan-ancestry analysis of sequencing data from three large biobanks, including the All of Us research program. Using mixed-effects models, we performed gene-based rare variant testing for 601 diseases across 748,879 individuals, including 155,236 with ancestry dissimilar to European. We identified 363 significant associations, which highlighted core genes for the human disease phenome and identified potential novel associations, including UBR3 for cardiometabolic disease and YLPM1 for psychiatric disease. Pan-ancestry burden testing represented an inclusive and useful approach for discovery in diverse datasets, although we also highlight the importance of ancestry-specific sensitivity analyses in this setting. Finally, we found that effect sizes for rare protein-disrupting variants were concordant between samples similar to European ancestry and other genetic ancestries (βDeming = 0.7–1.0). Our results have implications for multi-ancestry and cross-biobank approaches in sequencing association studies for human disease."
Nuclear proteasomes buffer cytoplasmic proteins during autophagy compromise,"Autophagy is a conserved pathway where cytoplasmic contents are engulfed by autophagosomes, which then fuse with lysosomes enabling their degradation. Mutations in core autophagy genes cause neurological conditions, and autophagy defects are seen in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease. Thus, we have sought to understand the cellular pathway perturbations that autophagy-perturbed cells are vulnerable to by seeking negative genetic interactions such as synthetic lethality in autophagy-null human cells using available data from yeast screens. These revealed that loss of proteasome and nuclear pore complex components cause synergistic viability changes akin to synthetic fitness loss in autophagy-null cells. This can be attributed to the cytoplasm-to-nuclear transport of proteins during autophagy deficiency and subsequent degradation of these erstwhile cytoplasmic proteins by nuclear proteasomes. As both autophagy and cytoplasm-to-nuclear transport are defective in Huntington’s disease, such cells are more vulnerable to perturbations of proteostasis due to these synthetic interactions."
Learning integral operators via neural integral equations,"Nonlinear operators with long-distance spatiotemporal dependencies are fundamental in modelling complex systems across sciences; yet, learning these non-local operators remains challenging in machine learning. Integral equations, which model such non-local systems, have wide-ranging applications in physics, chemistry, biology and engineering. We introduce the neural integral equation, a method for learning unknown integral operators from data using an integral equation solver. To improve scalability and model capacity, we also present the attentional neural integral equation, which replaces the integral with self-attention. Both models are grounded in the theory of second-kind integral equations, where the indeterminate appears both inside and outside the integral operator. We provide a theoretical analysis showing how self-attention can approximate integral operators under mild regularity assumptions, further deepening previously reported connections between transformers and integration, as well as deriving corresponding approximation results for integral operators. Through numerical benchmarks on synthetic and real-world data, including Lotka–Volterra, Navier–Stokes and Burgers’ equations, as well as brain dynamics and integral equations, we showcase the models’ capabilities and their ability to derive interpretable dynamics embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that attentional neural integral equations outperform existing methods, especially for longer time intervals and higher-dimensional problems. Our work addresses a critical gap in machine learning for non-local operators and offers a powerful tool for studying unknown complex systems with long-range dependencies."
Asset redeployability and corporate social responsibility,"We examine the impact of holding more redeployable assets on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Using a large panel sample of U.S. public companies, we posit and find a significant negative relation between asset redeployability and CSR performance, suggesting that firms with more redeployable assets demonstrate lower overall CSR performance. Our findings are robust to different time periods, alternative measures of redeployability, a changes analysis, and a two-stage regression analysis."
Expectations of and perceived need for civil war in the USA: findings from a 2023 nationally representative survey,"Surveys have found concerningly high levels of agreement that the United States will experience civil war soon. This study assesses variation in expectation of and perceived need for civil war with respondent sociopolitical characteristics, beliefs, firearm ownership, and willingness to engage in political violence."
Integration of mass cytometry and mass spectrometry imaging for spatially resolved single-cell metabolic profiling,The integration of spatial omics technologies can provide important insights into the biology of tissues. Here we combined mass spectrometry imaging-based metabolomics and imaging mass cytometry-based immunophenotyping on a single tissue section to reveal metabolic heterogeneity at single-cell resolution within tissues and its association with specific cell populations such as cancer cells or immune cells. This approach has the potential to greatly increase our understanding of tissue-level interplay between metabolic processes and their cellular components.
Point and interval estimation of \(R=P(X>Y)\) for the proportional reversed hazard family based on ranked set sampling,"In this article, we examine the point and interval estimation of \(R=P(X>Y)\) under the simple random sampling (SRS), ranked set sampling (RSS), and median ranked set sampling (MRSS) plans when the X and Y random variables follow the distributions from the proportional reversed hazard (PRH) family. In the framework of point estimation, we obtain the estimate of R by using the maximum likelihood method. Also, in the cases of RSS and MRSS plans, we use a modified maximum likelihood method to determine the closed form of R. In the framework of interval estimation, we create the asymptotic confidence interval of R based on all three sampling methods. In addition, the exact confidence interval is constructed by employing the pivotal quantity technique based on the SRS plan. A study is performed using a simulation technique to compare the suggested methods. The results are obtained under the Topp–Leone distribution as an example of the PRH family. Finally, frosted flakes data is used to explain the application of the studied methods."
Investigating the role of senescence biomarkers in colorectal cancer heterogeneity by bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of most common tumors worldwide, causing a prominent global health burden. Cell senescence is a complex physiological state, characterized by proliferation arrest. Here, we investigated the role of cellular senescence in the heterogeneity of CRC. Based on senescence-associated genes, CRC samples were classified into different senescence patterns with different survival, cancer-related biological processes and immune cell infiltrations. A senescence-related model was then developed to calculate the senescence-related score to comprehensively explore the heterogeneity of each CRC sample such as stromal activities, immunoreactivities and drug sensitivity. Single-cell analysis revealed there were different immune cell infiltrations between low and high senescence-related model genes enrichment groups, which was confirmed by multiplex immunofluorescence staining. Pseudotime analysis indicated model genes play a pivotal role in the evolution of B cells. Besides, intercellular communication modeled by NicheNet showed tumor cells with higher enrichment of senescence-related model genes highly expressed CXCL2/3 and CCL3/4, which attracted immunosuppressive cell infiltration and promoted tumor metastasis. Finally, top 6 hub genes were identified from senescence-related model genes by PPI analysis. And RT-qPCR revealed the expression differences of hub genes between normal and CRC cell lines, indicating to some extent the clinical practicability of senescence-related model. To sum up, our study explores the impact of cellular senescence on the prognosis, TME and treatment of CRC based on senescence patterns. This provides a new perspective for CRC treatment."
Conceptual Burstiness in Sociolinguistic Profiling of Radical-Criminal Communications: Corpus Method-Assisted Meaning Extraction for Investigative Leads,"Positioned within linguistic profiling research as in Shuy’s work (The language of murder cases: intentionality, predisposition, and voluntariness. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2014), this study introduces the concept of ‘conceptual burstiness’ to computer-assisted sociolinguistic profiling, demonstrating how to uncover investigative leads within terrorist threatening communications. Leveraging corpus analysis methods and semiotic clues, the study chiefly utilises AntConc (a software tool developed by Anthony, AntConc (Version 3.5.8) [Computer software]. Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, 2019) to scrutinise word frequency and concordance lines, revealing distinct lexical preferences and their semantic proximity as recurrent thematic elements colouring the semantics of criminal texts. As a case study, the article examines 20 public statements attributed to notorious figures: the far-rightist Brenton Tarrant and jihadists Osama bin Laden, Abubakar Shekau, and Abubaker al-Baghdadi. Analysis conducted revealed repeated lemmas making up around 21.65% of the entire texts and encoding the semantic nature of the terrorist texts, giving rise to propelled conceptual burstiness categories as: (i) a function of the discursive purpose to which different lemmas converging within the same semantic fields are used in the forensic texts (e.g. introducing a radical concept and persuading the audience); and (ii) a reflection of the regularities in symbolic capital and repertoire of concepts to which the authors adhere. These discernible patterns reflect each author’s adherence to religious or ethnonationalist ideologies, patterns of violent-pathway language, agendas of control and dominance, and attribution practices that signal ideological stances and characteristic rhetorical devices. Integrating insights into the threat assessment framework TRAP-18 (Meloy & Gill, J Threat Assess Manag 3(1):37, 2016), the study offers a ‘post-diction’ (i.e. retrospective) lens on traditional risk assessment methods. The analysis of conceptual choices reveals patterns aligning with TRAP-18 categories of proximal warning behaviour and distal characteristics of terrorist communications, enhancing security and law enforcement professionals’ predictive ability and identifying pathways to radicalisation, fixation, identification with violent individuals and groups, desperation, or ‘last resort behaviour.’ The conceptual burstiness method promises insights for counter-terrorism efforts, informing accelerated investigatory and intervention protocols and objectionable content moderation online."
Laminaria japonica Polysaccharide Regulates Fatty Hepatosis Through Bile Acids and Gut Microbiota in Diabetes Rat,"In this study, we examined the effect of Laminaria japonica polysaccharide (fucoidan) on the regulation of lipid metabolism. A rat model of diabetes mellitus (DM) was established by a high-sugar and high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin. Changes in the rats’ body weight and blood glucose level during the experiment were recorded. Before the end of the experiment, an automatic biochemical analyzer was used to detect the fasting blood glucose (FBG), lipid content in serum, and insulin content, and calculate the insulin resistance index. Oil red O staining was used to detect lipid deposition in the liver. H&E staining, Masson staining, and PASM staining were used to observe the pathological structural changes in the liver. 16 s RNA sequencing and targeted metabolomics were used to detect intestinal microbiota and bile acid content. The results showed that fucoidan was able to inhibit weight loss in the DM rats and reduce the content of triglycerides (TG), cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) in serum. Oil red O staining showed a decrease in liver fat accumulation after fucoidan treatment. 16 s RNA sequencing demonstrated that fucoidan increased the abundance of Bacteroidia, Campylobacteria, Clostridia, Gammaproteobacteria, Negativicutes, and Verrucomicrobi. Fucoidan also increased the secretion of secondary bile acids (Nor-DCA, TLCA, β-UDCA) and alleviated lipid metabolism disorders. The expression of α-SMA was inhibited by fucoidan, whereas the expression of FXR and TGR5 was promoted. Fucoidan shows good activity in regulating lipid metabolism by regulating the expression of FXR and TGR5 and acting on the intestinal flora–bile acid axis."
Iterative Mathematical Models Based on Curves and Applications to Coastal Profiles,"The objective of this study is iterative systems based on general types of curves, not only on circumference arcs. We begin by presenting some implementations and generalizations of constructions based on arcs of circumference. Then we consider constructions based on general curves and give a “universal property” relating to the primary construction that exploits arcs of circumference. With the prospect of applying these theoretical models also to coastal geomorphology in the future, and inspired by one of the best-known models on the subject, the logarithmic spiral one for the so-called headland-bay beaches (HBBs), we study geometrically some cases in which the constructions are based on arcs of the golden spiral. Simultaneously we concretely illustrate and explain the universal property above. Finally we dedicate a section to discuss the possibility of how to numerically evaluate and compare the (infinite) lengths originating from our theoretical geometric constructions. Some explicit examples, calculations and comparisons will be provided by the use of infinity computing which is one of the various possible assets that contemporary non-standard mathematics makes available."
Clinical outcomes of fenestration discectomy and iLESSYS-Delta interlaminar endoscopic system for treatment of LDH: a single-center retrospective cohort study,"To compare the clinical efficacy of interlaminar endoscopic surgical system delta (iLESSYS-Delta) discectomy with that of classical fenestration discectomy for treating lumbar disc herniation. Patients who underwent iLESSYS-Delta or fenestration discectomy were enrolled in this study. Baseline information and clinical indicators were collected. The baseline data were matched using propensity score matching. Fifty-two patients were in each group. In the iLESSYS-Delta cohort, the volume of intraoperative bleeding was 18.17 ± 4.20 ml, the length of postoperative hospital stay was 4.16 ± 2.29 days, and the length of postoperative off-bed activity was 1.58 ± 0.88 days. In contrast, in the fenestration group, the volume of intraoperative bleeding was 32.50 ± 17.13 ml, the length of postoperative hospital stay was 6.66 ± 2.44 days, and the length of postoperative off-bed activity was 3.18 ± 1.28 days. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The operation time was 88.90 ± 19.14 min in the iLESSYS-Delta group and 67.63 ± 19.32 min in the fenestration group, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Regarding the pain visual analogue scale scores at 24, 48, and 72 h after surgery, patients in the iLESSYS-Delta group had less pain than did those in the fenestration group (P < 0.05). The Oswestry disability indices of postoperative patients in both groups significantly improved at 3 months after surgery and at the last follow-up (P < 0.05); however, there was no statistically significant difference in the postoperative ODI scores between the two surgery groups (P > 0.05). The two groups showed no significant differences in clinical effects, postoperative recurrence rates, or perioperative complications. iLESSYS-Delta can cause less intraoperative bleeding and faster recovery than fenestration discectomy."
Reliability of DC-link capacitor in pulsed power supply for accelerator magnet,"Capacitors are widely used in pulsed magnet power supplies to reduce ripple voltage, store energy, and decrease power variation. In this study, DC-link capacitors in pulsed power supplies were investigated. By deriving an analytical method for the capacitor current on the H-bridge topology side, the root-mean-square value of the capacitor current was calculated, which helps in selecting the DC-link capacitors. The proposed method solves this problem quickly and with high accuracy. The current reconstruction of the DC-link capacitor is proposed to avoid structural damage in the capacitor’s current measurement, and the capacitor’s hotspot temperature and temperature rise are calculated using the FFT transform. The test results showed that the error between the calculated and measured temperature increases was within 1.5 \(^\circ \hbox {C}\). Finally, the lifetime of DC-link capacitors was predicted based on Monte Carlo analysis. The proposed method can evaluate the reliability of DC-link capacitors in a non-isolated switching pulsed power supply for accelerators and is also applicable to film capacitors."
Hybrid nanocellulose material as an adsorbent to remove reactive yellow 2 dye,"Textile dyes are frequently disposable in aqueous effluents, making it difficult to remove them from industrial effluents before their release to natural waters. This paper deals with the fabrication of cellulose-based adsorbents by reacting nanocelulose crystalline (nanocel) with N-[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ethylenediamine (TMSPEDA), forming the hybrid (silylpropyl)ethylenediamine@nanocellulose (SPEDA@nanocel), which was employed as adsorbent for the uptake of reactive yellow 2 dye (RY-2) from aqueous effluents. Characterisation of SPEDA@nanocel was carried out using FTIR, SEM–EDS, XRD, TGA, surface area, pHpzc, and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity ratio (HI). Also, adsorption studies were thoroughly investigated. The effect of initial pH indicated that the maximum uptake of RY-2 takes place at pH 2, which is an indication of the electrostatic mechanism. The kinetic data carried out with 250 and 500 mg L−1 RY-2 with SPEDA@nanocel followed better the nonlinear fractional-like pseudo-first-order model. The t0.5 and t0.95 for the dye uptake were about 30 and 141 min, respectively. The equilibrium data from 10 to 45 °C indicated that the Liu isotherm model was the best-fitted isothermal model. The maximum sorption capacity attained was 112.3 mg g−1 at 45 °C. The thermodynamic data have shown that the equilibrium was favorable and endothermic, and the ΔH° was compatible with an electrostatic attraction between RY-2 and SPEDA@nanocel. Experiments of desorption of loaded adsorbent showed promising results for real applications since at least 5 adsorption/desorption cycles could be employed without significant changes in the recovery and with high precision."
Adipocyte deletion of the oxygen-sensor PHD2 sustains elevated energy expenditure at thermoneutrality,"Enhancing thermogenic brown adipose tissue (BAT) function is a promising therapeutic strategy for metabolic disease. However, predominantly thermoneutral modern human living conditions deactivate BAT. We demonstrate that selective adipocyte deficiency of the oxygen-sensor HIF-prolyl hydroxylase (PHD2) gene overcomes BAT dormancy at thermoneutrality. Adipocyte-PHD2-deficient mice maintain higher energy expenditure having greater BAT thermogenic capacity. In human and murine adipocytes, a PHD inhibitor increases Ucp1 levels. In murine brown adipocytes, antagonising the major PHD2 target, hypoxia-inducible factor-(HIF)−2a abolishes Ucp1 that cannot be rescued by PHD inhibition. Mechanistically, PHD2 deficiency leads to HIF2 stabilisation and binding of HIF2 to the Ucp1 promoter, thus enhancing its expression in brown adipocytes. Serum proteomics analysis of 5457 participants in the deeply phenotyped Age, Gene and Environment Study reveal that serum PHD2 associates with increased risk of metabolic disease. Here we show that adipose-PHD2-inhibition is a therapeutic strategy for metabolic disease and identify serum PHD2 as a disease biomarker."
Estimating the energy of dissipative neural systems,"There is, at present, a lack of consensus regarding precisely what is meant by the term 'energy' across the sub-disciplines of neuroscience. Definitions range from deficits in the rate of glucose metabolism in consciousness research to regional changes in neuronal activity in cognitive neuroscience. In computational neuroscience virtually all models define the energy of neuronal regions as a quantity that is in a continual process of dissipation to its surroundings. This, however, is at odds with the definition of energy used across all sub-disciplines of physics: a quantity that does not change as a dynamical system evolves in time. Here, we bridge this gap between the dissipative models used in computational neuroscience and the energy-conserving models of physics using a mathematical technique first proposed in the context of fluid dynamics. We go on to derive an expression for the energy of the linear time-invariant (LTI) state space equation. We then use resting-state fMRI data obtained from the human connectome project to show that LTI energy is associated with glucose uptake metabolism. Our hope is that this work paves the way for an increased understanding of energy in the brain, from both a theoretical as well as an experimental perspective."
Single-machine group scheduling with general linear deterioration and truncated learning effects,"In this paper we consider single-machine scheduling problems with group technology, where the group setup times are general linear functions of their starting times and the jobs in the same group have general truncated learning effects. The objective is to minimize the makespan and total completion time, respectively. We show that the makespan minimization remains polynomially solvable. For the total completion time minimization, optimal properties are presented and then we introduce some heuristic algorithms and a branch-and-bound algorithm."
Radiologic evaluation of the internal carotid artery and jugular bulb in lateral temporal bone resection using 3D computed tomography,This study investigated the internal carotid artery (ICA) and jugular bulb (JB) structures in terms of lateral temporal bone resection using 3D computed tomography (CT).
"Nursery provision of red-algal habitats in temperate Algoa Bay, South Africa","This study examines the importance of both macroalgal heterogeneity and specific macroalgal species or morphotypes to nursery provision for juvenile sparids (Diplodus capensis and Sarpa salpa) in a shallow (< 2 m), sheltered rocky cove in warm-temperate Algoa Bay, South Africa. The rocky cove is comprised of a mosaic of two main benthic habitats; canopy-forming Plocamium corallorhiza beds on rocky outcrops and flat reef dominated by low growing red algae morphotypes. We assessed macroalgal communities and the trophic ecology (stomach contents and isotopes), abundance and size structure of D. capensis and S. salpa in the two different benthic habitats and the resources/food associated with the dominant macroalgae species/morphotypes. We found high densities of S. salpa and D. capensis, in both high profile reef (rocky outcrops) and low profile (flat) reef. Within this habitat mosaic resources (epiphytes and macroinvertebrates) were more abundant in the non-canopy forming low growing macroalgae (Laurencia spp. and coralline turf algae) and these algae were also assimilated in the diets of both sparids. The high abundance of both juvenile S. salpa and D. capensis in high profile and low profile reef, suggests that within this mosaic of habitats these species may be using canopy-forming algae in the high profile reef for shelter and non-canopy forming algae in both the high and low profile reef for food. This shows that macroalgal habitats comprising several morphotypes have the potential to support higher juvenile diversity and abundance through both food provision and shelter."

Expectations of and perceived need for civil war in the USA: findings from a 2023 nationally representative survey,"Surveys have found concerningly high levels of agreement that the United States will experience civil war soon. This study assesses variation in expectation of and perceived need for civil war with respondent sociopolitical characteristics, beliefs, firearm ownership, and willingness to engage in political violence."
Damage Detection of Span Bridge Structures Under Moving Loads Using the Hybrid Enhanced SOS-SA Algorithm,"To detect structural damage, the static deflections due to a moving load, measured at three different points of the structure, are used with the model updating method. In this method, by minimizing the difference between the responses of the damaged and analytical structures, the location and severity of damage are obtained. A new criterion called ‘deflection influence line indicator’ (DILI) is presented and used as an objective function. Moreover, by integrating the enhanced symbiotic organisms search (ESOS) algorithm and the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, a new algorithm called the ‘hybrid enhanced symbiotic organisms search-simulated annealing algorithm’ (HESOS-SA) is presented which improves on the original ESOS algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, the global search (exploration) is performed by the ESOS algorithm, whereas the local search (exploitation) is done by the SA algorithm. The original SOS and the proposed HESOS-SA algorithms are used to minimize the DILI criterion. In order to assess the performance of the proposed method for structural damage detection, three benchmark structures, including a simply-supported beam and 25-member and 31-member planar truss problems, with a number of damage scenarios are considered. The numerical results demonstrate that, for noise-free data, both the SOS and HESOS-SA algorithms can correctly detect both the location and severity of damage using the DILI criterion. On the other hand, for noisy data, the HESOS-SA algorithm has a more robust performance in damage detection than the SOS algorithm."
Integration of mass cytometry and mass spectrometry imaging for spatially resolved single-cell metabolic profiling,The integration of spatial omics technologies can provide important insights into the biology of tissues. Here we combined mass spectrometry imaging-based metabolomics and imaging mass cytometry-based immunophenotyping on a single tissue section to reveal metabolic heterogeneity at single-cell resolution within tissues and its association with specific cell populations such as cancer cells or immune cells. This approach has the potential to greatly increase our understanding of tissue-level interplay between metabolic processes and their cellular components.
The role of dimensions in gravitating relativistic shear-free fluids,We study the dynamics of relativistic shear-free gravitating fluids in higher dimensions for both neutral and charged matter. We reduce the Einstein–Maxwell equations to a single second order nonlinear partial differential equation which contains two arbitrary functions. This generalizes the condition of pressure isotropy to higher dimensions; the new condition is functionally different from four dimensions. Our result in higher dimensions reduces to known results in four dimensions. The presence of higher dimensions affects the dynamics of relativistic fluids in general relativity. The dynamical behaviour of the gravitating fluid in higher dimensions is qualitatively different to the four dimensional case. Higher dimensions affect astrophysical and cosmological processes in gravitating shear-free fluids.
The classified peri-urban forest of Kua from Burkina Faso must not be declassified for ecological reasons,"Densification of urban areas and rapid urbanization result in land scarcity in the Sahelian cities of West Africa. Therefore, urban greenspaces are increasingly coveted for socio-economic development. This is the case of the peri-urban forest of Kua in Burkina Faso which has been subject of controversies between ecologists and decision makers who intended to declassify this forest for hospital project. The lack of ecological evidence on this forest fueled the dichotomous conflicts between environment protection and urban planning. Hence, this study aimed to assess the ecological characteristics of the peri-urban forest of Kua. Dendrometric measurements of 2993 individuals were performed in 106 plots across the peri-urban forests of Kua and Dindéresso. We computed and compared tree diversity metrics, structural parameters and carbon stocks between the two forests. The findings revealed a γ–diversity of 40 woody species from 38 genera and 16 families in Kua forest. Through the diversity metrics, we found that the peri-urban forest of Kua exhibited lower tree diversity than the peri-urban forest of Dindéresso (p-value < 0.05). Similarly, tree density was significantly lower (p-value < 0.05) in Kua (212.446 ± 291.65 ind. ha−1) than in Dindéresso (378.461 ± 298.89 ind. ha−1). However, carbon stock was two times significantly higher (p-value < 0.05) in Kua (26.21 ± 31.27 Mg.ha−1) than in Dindéresso (13.389 ± 15.95 Mg.ha−1), highlighting the high potential of this forest in carbon sequestration. This study demonstrated that the peri-urban forest of Kua – despite its lower tree diversity and density – constitutes important carbon pools and sinks. Therefore, this forest must not be declassified, but should rather be reinforced through management plans and conservation actions. To sustain urban development, land management policies promoting the conservation of greenspaces are required to reduce biodiversity loss and carbon emissions in urban centers."
The level of dental fear and anxiety is higher in children with both severe Molar-Incisor Hypomineralisation and active dental caries lesions compared to children without these conditions,To assess levels of dental fear and anxiety (DFA) in children with and without Molar-Incisor Hypomineralisation (MIH) and dental caries lesions.

Improving the cooking quality of black glutinous rice by using the low-pressure cold plasma technology,"Black glutinous rice grains are hard cooking even though they have been soaked in water for a long period of time. This study aimed to improve the cooking quality of black glutinous rice by the low-pressure cold plasma. The low-pressure cold plasma significantly increased the lightness of the rice grains, especially the oxygen and air plasma. The water uptake of the rice grains was significantly increased after plasma treatment. No difference among the plasmas generated by Ar, Air or O2 gases. SEM examination showed that the surface structure of rice grains changed from smoothness to roughness throughout the break and reduced the contact angle. Air and O2plasma increased the softness and stickiness of cooked rice. Anthocyanin content was significantly increased in the range of 14.59 to 25.97 mg/100g in treated sample than those of untreated (10.72 mg/100 g). Air and O2plasma could modify the surface structure of rice grains due to increased softness and stickiness while reducing hardness. Therefore, low-pressure cold plasma could be a potential innovative technology for improving the cooking quality process while maintaining the nutritional value of black glutinous rice grains."
Effect of synthetic conditions on the structure and magnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles in diethylene glycol medium,"Ultra-small iron oxide nanoparticles (USNPs) have attracted particular attention in the past 15 years as perspective contrast agents for MRI. Unfortunately, the synthesis of such small nanoparticles with high contrast properties and water dispersibility is still challenging. This paper presents a study on the influence of synthetic conditions on the structure and the properties of hydrophilic iron oxide nanoparticles obtained by a simple single-step thermal decomposition in diethylene glycol at 230–235 °C. The samples were studied using X-ray diffraction, Mössbauer and infra-red spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, vibrating sample magnetometry, MRI, and dynamic light scattering. All the obtained samples are of spinel structure (Fd-3 m), specific to both magnetite and maghemite. With an increase in the synthesis time from 1 to 8 h, the crystallite size of the series with C(Fe(acac)3) = 30 mM changed from 1.8 ± 0.2 to 4.7 ± 0.5 nm, the average size according to TEM changed from 3.3 ± 0.8 to 3.8 ± 0.4 nm, and the saturation magnetization from 13.9 ± 0.3 to 83.3 ± 1.7 A•m2/kg, which is close to the values of bulk iron oxide. The same tendency was revealed with the increase in the concentration of C(Fe(acac)3) from 30 to 120 mM for 1 h of synthesis. An increase in the synthesis time for 60- and 120-mM solutions did not significantly change the crystallite size and the magnetic properties. It was shown that the samples obtained using this approach have unexpectedly high values of r2-relaxivity, up to 235 mM−1•s−1, which the highest published for USNPs. The studied method of water-soluble USNPs is promising for use in creating T2-contrast agents for MRI."
Physics-Informed Masked Autoencoder for active sparse imaging,"Imaging technology based on detecting individual photons has seen tremendous progress in recent years, with broad applications in autonomous driving, biomedical imaging, astronomical observation, and more. Comparing with conventional methods, however, it takes much longer time and relies on sparse and noisy photon-counting data to form an image. Here we introduce Physics-Informed Masked Autoencoder (PI-MAE) as a fast and efficient approach for data acquisition and image reconstruction through hardware implementation of the MAE (Masked Autoencoder). We examine its performance on a single-photon LiDAR system when trained on digitally masked MNIST data. Our results show that, with \(1.8\times 10^{-6}\) or less detected photons per pulse and down to 9 detected photons per pixel, it achieves high-quality image reconstruction on unseen object classes with 90% physical masking. Our results highlight PI-MAE as a viable hardware accelerator for significantly improving the performance of single-photon imaging systems in photon-starving applications."
B7-1 and PlGF-1 are two possible new biomarkers to identify fracture-associated trauma patients at higher risk of developing complications: a cohort study,"Around 10% of fractures lead to complications. With increasing fracture incidences in recent years, this poses a serious burden on the healthcare system, with increasing costs for treatment. In the present study, we aimed to identify potential ‘new’ blood markers to predict the development of post-surgical complications in trauma patients following a fracture."
The Effects of Triiodothyronine on the Free Thyroxine Set Point Position in the Hypothalamus Pituitary Thyroid Axis,"In clinical endocrinology, it is often assumed that the results of thyroid hormone function tests (TFTs) before total thyroidectomy are considered euthyroid when the circulating concentrations of thyrotropin [TSH] and free thyroxine [FT4] are within the normal reference ranges. Postoperative thyroid replacement therapy with levothyroxine. The aim of L-T4 is to reproduce the preoperative euthyroid condition. Currently, intra-individual changes in the euthyroid set point before and after total thyroidectomy are only partly understood. After total thyroidectomy, a greater postoperative [FT4] than preoperative [FT4] for equivalent euthyroid [TSH] was found, with differences ranging from 3 to 8 pmol/L. This unexplained difference can be explained by the use of a mathematical model of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis set point theory. In this article, the postoperative HPT euthyroid set point was calculated using a dataset of total thyroidectomized patients with at least three distinguishable postoperative TFTs. The postoperative [TSH] set point was used as a homeostatic reference for the comparison of preoperative TFTs. The preoperative [FT4] value was equal to the postoperative [FT4] value in 50% of the patients, divided by a factor of ~ 1.25 (within +/- 10%). The factor of 1.25 stems from the lack of postoperative use of thyroidal triiodothyronine (T3). Furthermore, approximately 25% of the patients presented a greater preoperative [FT4] difference than postoperative [FT4]/1.25 combined with a normal [TSH] difference. Based on these observations, the effect of T3 on the value of the [FT4] set point was analyzed and explained from a control theory perspective."
Microbial core communities in activated sludge plants are strongly affected by immigration and geography,"The microbiota in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and incoming wastewater is critical for the treatment process, the preservation of natural ecosystems and human health, and for the recovery of resources and achievement of sustainability goals. Both core species and conditionally rare and abundant taxa (CRAT) are considered process-critical but little is known about identity as well as true functional and ecological importance. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of the microbiota of 84 municipal activated sludge (AS) plants with nutrient removal treating ~ 70% of all wastewater within a confined geographical area, Denmark (43,000 km2). With the use of an ecosystem-specific database (MiDAS 5.2), species-level classification allowed us to investigate the core and CRAT species, whether they were active, and important factors determining their presence."
Biological and clinical relevance of correlated expression levels of coding and long noncoding RNAs in HPV16 positive cervical cancers,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) drives cervical cancer (CaCx) pathogenesis and viral oncoproteins jeopardize global gene expression in such cancers. In this study, our aim was to identify differentially expressed coding (DEcGs) and long noncoding RNA genes (DElncGs) specifically sense intronic and Natural Antisense Transcripts as they are located in the genic regions and may have a direct influence on the expression pattern of their neighbouring coding genes. We compared HPV16-positive CaCx patients (N = 44) with HPV-negative normal individuals (N = 34) by employing strand-specific RNA-seq and determined the relationships between DEcGs and DElncGs and their clinical implications. By performing Gene set enrichment and protein–protein interaction (PPI) analyses of DEcGs, we identified enrichment of processes crucial for abortive virus life cycle and cancer progression. The DEcGs formed 16 gene clusters which we identified through Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) plugin of Cytoscape. All the gene clusters portrayed cancer-related functions. We recorded significantly correlated expression levels of 79 DElncGs with DEcGs at proximal genomic loci based on Pearson’s Correlation coefficients. Of these gene pairs, 24 pairs portrayed significantly altered correlation coefficients among patients, compared to normal individuals. Of these, 6 DEcGs of 6 such gene pairs, belonged to 5 of the identified gene clusters, one of which was survival-associated. Out of the 24 correlated DEcG: DElncG pairs, we identified 3 pairs, where expression of both members was significantly associated with patient overall survival. The findings justify the cooperative roles of these gene pairs, in patient prognostication, thereby bearing immense potential for translation. Thus, elucidation of correlative strengths between paired DElncGs and DEcGs in patient and normal samples, could serve as a foundation for identification of therapeutic and prognostic targets of HPV16-positive CaCx."
Iterative Mathematical Models Based on Curves and Applications to Coastal Profiles,"The objective of this study is iterative systems based on general types of curves, not only on circumference arcs. We begin by presenting some implementations and generalizations of constructions based on arcs of circumference. Then we consider constructions based on general curves and give a “universal property” relating to the primary construction that exploits arcs of circumference. With the prospect of applying these theoretical models also to coastal geomorphology in the future, and inspired by one of the best-known models on the subject, the logarithmic spiral one for the so-called headland-bay beaches (HBBs), we study geometrically some cases in which the constructions are based on arcs of the golden spiral. Simultaneously we concretely illustrate and explain the universal property above. Finally we dedicate a section to discuss the possibility of how to numerically evaluate and compare the (infinite) lengths originating from our theoretical geometric constructions. Some explicit examples, calculations and comparisons will be provided by the use of infinity computing which is one of the various possible assets that contemporary non-standard mathematics makes available."
Investigating the role of senescence biomarkers in colorectal cancer heterogeneity by bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of most common tumors worldwide, causing a prominent global health burden. Cell senescence is a complex physiological state, characterized by proliferation arrest. Here, we investigated the role of cellular senescence in the heterogeneity of CRC. Based on senescence-associated genes, CRC samples were classified into different senescence patterns with different survival, cancer-related biological processes and immune cell infiltrations. A senescence-related model was then developed to calculate the senescence-related score to comprehensively explore the heterogeneity of each CRC sample such as stromal activities, immunoreactivities and drug sensitivity. Single-cell analysis revealed there were different immune cell infiltrations between low and high senescence-related model genes enrichment groups, which was confirmed by multiplex immunofluorescence staining. Pseudotime analysis indicated model genes play a pivotal role in the evolution of B cells. Besides, intercellular communication modeled by NicheNet showed tumor cells with higher enrichment of senescence-related model genes highly expressed CXCL2/3 and CCL3/4, which attracted immunosuppressive cell infiltration and promoted tumor metastasis. Finally, top 6 hub genes were identified from senescence-related model genes by PPI analysis. And RT-qPCR revealed the expression differences of hub genes between normal and CRC cell lines, indicating to some extent the clinical practicability of senescence-related model. To sum up, our study explores the impact of cellular senescence on the prognosis, TME and treatment of CRC based on senescence patterns. This provides a new perspective for CRC treatment."
Clinical outcomes of fenestration discectomy and iLESSYS-Delta interlaminar endoscopic system for treatment of LDH: a single-center retrospective cohort study,"To compare the clinical efficacy of interlaminar endoscopic surgical system delta (iLESSYS-Delta) discectomy with that of classical fenestration discectomy for treating lumbar disc herniation. Patients who underwent iLESSYS-Delta or fenestration discectomy were enrolled in this study. Baseline information and clinical indicators were collected. The baseline data were matched using propensity score matching. Fifty-two patients were in each group. In the iLESSYS-Delta cohort, the volume of intraoperative bleeding was 18.17 ± 4.20 ml, the length of postoperative hospital stay was 4.16 ± 2.29 days, and the length of postoperative off-bed activity was 1.58 ± 0.88 days. In contrast, in the fenestration group, the volume of intraoperative bleeding was 32.50 ± 17.13 ml, the length of postoperative hospital stay was 6.66 ± 2.44 days, and the length of postoperative off-bed activity was 3.18 ± 1.28 days. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The operation time was 88.90 ± 19.14 min in the iLESSYS-Delta group and 67.63 ± 19.32 min in the fenestration group, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Regarding the pain visual analogue scale scores at 24, 48, and 72 h after surgery, patients in the iLESSYS-Delta group had less pain than did those in the fenestration group (P < 0.05). The Oswestry disability indices of postoperative patients in both groups significantly improved at 3 months after surgery and at the last follow-up (P < 0.05); however, there was no statistically significant difference in the postoperative ODI scores between the two surgery groups (P > 0.05). The two groups showed no significant differences in clinical effects, postoperative recurrence rates, or perioperative complications. iLESSYS-Delta can cause less intraoperative bleeding and faster recovery than fenestration discectomy."
Conceptual Burstiness in Sociolinguistic Profiling of Radical-Criminal Communications: Corpus Method-Assisted Meaning Extraction for Investigative Leads,"Positioned within linguistic profiling research as in Shuy’s work (The language of murder cases: intentionality, predisposition, and voluntariness. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2014), this study introduces the concept of ‘conceptual burstiness’ to computer-assisted sociolinguistic profiling, demonstrating how to uncover investigative leads within terrorist threatening communications. Leveraging corpus analysis methods and semiotic clues, the study chiefly utilises AntConc (a software tool developed by Anthony, AntConc (Version 3.5.8) [Computer software]. Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, 2019) to scrutinise word frequency and concordance lines, revealing distinct lexical preferences and their semantic proximity as recurrent thematic elements colouring the semantics of criminal texts. As a case study, the article examines 20 public statements attributed to notorious figures: the far-rightist Brenton Tarrant and jihadists Osama bin Laden, Abubakar Shekau, and Abubaker al-Baghdadi. Analysis conducted revealed repeated lemmas making up around 21.65% of the entire texts and encoding the semantic nature of the terrorist texts, giving rise to propelled conceptual burstiness categories as: (i) a function of the discursive purpose to which different lemmas converging within the same semantic fields are used in the forensic texts (e.g. introducing a radical concept and persuading the audience); and (ii) a reflection of the regularities in symbolic capital and repertoire of concepts to which the authors adhere. These discernible patterns reflect each author’s adherence to religious or ethnonationalist ideologies, patterns of violent-pathway language, agendas of control and dominance, and attribution practices that signal ideological stances and characteristic rhetorical devices. Integrating insights into the threat assessment framework TRAP-18 (Meloy & Gill, J Threat Assess Manag 3(1):37, 2016), the study offers a ‘post-diction’ (i.e. retrospective) lens on traditional risk assessment methods. The analysis of conceptual choices reveals patterns aligning with TRAP-18 categories of proximal warning behaviour and distal characteristics of terrorist communications, enhancing security and law enforcement professionals’ predictive ability and identifying pathways to radicalisation, fixation, identification with violent individuals and groups, desperation, or ‘last resort behaviour.’ The conceptual burstiness method promises insights for counter-terrorism efforts, informing accelerated investigatory and intervention protocols and objectionable content moderation online."
Reliability of DC-link capacitor in pulsed power supply for accelerator magnet,"Capacitors are widely used in pulsed magnet power supplies to reduce ripple voltage, store energy, and decrease power variation. In this study, DC-link capacitors in pulsed power supplies were investigated. By deriving an analytical method for the capacitor current on the H-bridge topology side, the root-mean-square value of the capacitor current was calculated, which helps in selecting the DC-link capacitors. The proposed method solves this problem quickly and with high accuracy. The current reconstruction of the DC-link capacitor is proposed to avoid structural damage in the capacitor’s current measurement, and the capacitor’s hotspot temperature and temperature rise are calculated using the FFT transform. The test results showed that the error between the calculated and measured temperature increases was within 1.5 \(^\circ \hbox {C}\). Finally, the lifetime of DC-link capacitors was predicted based on Monte Carlo analysis. The proposed method can evaluate the reliability of DC-link capacitors in a non-isolated switching pulsed power supply for accelerators and is also applicable to film capacitors."
The Relationship of Chronic Disease Burden and Racial-Ethnic Disparities in Depression Treatment,"Chronic disease and depression are closely related, and depression, if left untreated, can worsen physical disease symptoms. Furthermore, treating depression can improve patient outcomes. Generally, treatment for depression is lower in minority groups."
Variations of organic functional chemistry in carbonaceous matter from the asteroid 162173 Ryugu,"Primordial carbon delivered to the early earth by asteroids and meteorites provided a diverse source of extraterrestrial organics from pre-existing simple organic compounds, complex solar-irradiated macromolecules, and macromolecules from extended hydrothermal processing. Surface regolith collected by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft from the carbon-rich asteroid 162173 Ryugu present a unique opportunity to untangle the sources and processing history of carbonaceous matter. Here we show carbonaceous grains in Ryugu can be classified into three main populations defined by spectral shape: Highly aromatic (HA), Alkyl-Aromatic (AA), and IOM-like (IL). These carbon populations may be related to primordial chemistry, since C and N isotopic compositions vary between the three groups. Diffuse carbon is occasionally dominated by molecular carbonate preferentially associated with coarse-grained phyllosilicate minerals. Compared to related carbonaceous meteorites, the greater diversity of organic functional chemistry in Ryugu indicate the pristine condition of these asteroid samples."
Enhancement of rider comfort by magnetorheological elastomer based damping treatment at strategic locations of an electric two wheeler,"The vibrations generated in the two-wheeled vehicles like motorcycles due to road irregularities such as cracks, potholes, and bumps on the road cause discomfort for the rider as well as the pillion. These vibrations are reported to cause lower back pains, musculoskeletal effects, fatigue, and long-term health issues. Particularly, electric two-wheelers are more susceptible to these vibrations caused by the road and need attention. This paper presents an innovative technique for the reduction of vibrations at prominent locations in the electric two-wheeler to improve the rider’s comfort. All measured accelerations are about vertical direction (along z-axis as per ISO 2631-1 standard). Passive and Semi-active damping treatments namely, Room temperature vulcanizing Silicone rubber and Magnetorheological elastomer (MRE) were applied on the test vehicle at strategic locations of vibration. Both were compared for their effectiveness in reducing the vibrations. Results showed that MRE based damping technique proved better vibration isolation at the strategic locations. The weighted root mean square acceleration as well as vibration dose values were found to decrease with the help of damping treatments thus improving the rider’s overall comfort level."
Optimizing ZnO as an electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells: Study on aluminum doping and thickness variation,"This study utilizes the Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS), a simulation program, to comprehensively investigate the influence of aluminum (Al) doping concentration and thickness variation in the ZnO layer on the performance of perovskite solar cells. The simulated perovskite solar cell (PSC) featured a perovskite layer of CH3NH3PbI3, with an Al-doped ZnO layer acting as the electron transport layer (ETL) and Spiro-OMETAD as the hole transport layer (HTL). Employing the basic n-i-p planar structure of the PSC, the simulations were conducted to discern the impact of varying Al doping and ZnO layer thickness. In the context of Al doping, the J-V curves exhibit a systematic improvement in open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and overall conversion efficiency (η) as the doping concentration varies from 0 to 4%, with optimal performance achieved at 3%, yielding an efficiency of 15.37%. However, higher doping concentrations lead to diminished efficiency. Regarding thickness variation with a fixed 3% doping concentration, the J-V curves show a stable Voc but a subtle reduction in Jsc with increasing layer thickness. Notably, the investigation reveals that a maximum efficiency of 15.44% is achieved at a thickness of 20 nm. These findings provide crucial design considerations for enhancing PSC performance."
First insight into the whole genome sequence variations in clarithromycin resistant Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates in Russia,"Clarithromycin (CLR) is currently a key antibiotic for Helicobacter pylori infection treatment, however, the data on CLR resistance patterns in Russia are missing. Here, we applied WGS-based approach to H. pylori clinical isolates from Russia to comprehensively investigate sequence variation, identify putative markers of CLR resistance and correlate them with phenotypic susceptibility testing. The phenotypic susceptibility of 44 H. pylori isolates (2014–2022) to CLR was determined by disc diffusion method: 23 isolates were CLR-resistant and 21-CLR-susceptible. All isolates were subjected to WGS and submitted to GenBank. Based on complete sequence analysis, we showed that among all sequence variants, the combination of mutations A2146G/A2147G in the 23S rRNA gene is the most reliable for prediction of phenotypic susceptibility. For the first time, the average number of mutations in 106 virulence-associated genes between resistant and susceptible groups were compared. Moreover, this study presents the first WGS insight into genetic diversity of H. pylori in Russia with a particular focus on the molecular basis of drug resistance: the novel mutations were described as potential markers for the resistance development. Of these, the most prominent was a frameshift deletion (252:CGGGT) in HP0820 coding region, which is a good candidate for further investigation."
A non-parametric approach to predict the recruitment for randomized clinical trials: an example in elderly inpatient settings,"Accurate prediction of subject recruitment, which is critical to the success of a study, remains an ongoing challenge. Previous prediction models often rely on parametric assumptions which are not always met or may be difficult to implement. We aim to develop a novel method that is less sensitive to model assumptions and relatively easy to implement."
Loading Path Design for Grain Refinement in Hot Forming Process of Ti-6Al-2Zr-1Mo-1V Alloy,"Grain refinement is crucial for enhancing the microstructure and mechanical properties of materials. This study employed a new loading method for grain refinement in Ti-6Al-2Zr-1Mo-1V alloy. A particle swarm optimization–backpropagation neural network model was developed to precisely capture the complex rheological behavior of the alloy. The model exhibited outstanding correlation (from 0.99633 to 0.99998). A detailed hot processing map was constructed using experimental and model data. By combining microstructure characteristics, a microstructure deformation mechanism map was developed to identify and isolate the stable dynamic recrystallization fine-grain regions. However, these regions remain chaotic and require further discretization design. By employing finite element simulation, the optimal strain rates of discretized elements were determined, and then, the 3D response surface was fitted. The loading path was ultimately verified through isothermal compression experiments and microstructure analysis. Results indicate that grain sizes under the optimal loading paths are smaller than before, strongly confirming the effectiveness of loading path. Specifically, at 1173 K, grain size under the optimized loading path was 10.45 μm, and at 1223 K, it was 12.15 μm."
From free fields to interacting SCFTs via representation theory,"We ask when it is possible to construct arbitrary unitary multiplets of the superconformal algebra with eight Poincaré supercharges that are compatible with locality from (continuous deformations of) representations in free field theories. We answer this question in two, three, and five dimensions. In four dimensions, we resort to an intricate but self-consistent web of conjectures. If correct, these conjectures imply various new non-perturbative constraints on short multiplets in any local unitary 4d \( \mathcal{N} \) = 2 superconformal field theory and on an unusual set of related vertex algebras. Throughout, we connect our results with properties of deformations in the space of theories."
Microstructure and Property Evolution of an Al-Mg-Si Alloy Cable during the Production Process,"An Al-Mg-Si alloy cable was manufactured by a production process including hot rolling (HR), drawing (DR) and aging (AA) treatment after Properzi continuous casting. The microstructures, electrical conductivity (EC) and tensile properties of the alloy samples at different production stages were investigated. The present work focused on the microstructural evolutions and their effects on electron conduction and strengthening mechanism. It was found that the dispersed clusters were firstly formed in the DR sample, and then, they were produced in large quantities in the AA sample. The EC decreased after drawing and increased after aging, while the strength progressively increased. The results demonstrated that the recrystallization won the competition with other phase reactions during hot rolling. The drawing process refined the grains and increased dislocation density, leading to the reduction of EC and the improvement of strength. After aging treatment, the dislocation density decreased and the precipitation occurred, resulting in the desired EC (54.2 IACS%) and strength (320 MPa)."
Effectiveness of a 5-week virtual reality versus traditional training on balance and flexibility in healthy adult females,This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a 5-week virtual reality training protocol on static and dynamic balance and flexibility compared to a traditional training protocol in healthy adult females.
Estimated time dispersion and delay through free space optics transceiver communications performance signature in the presence of adverse atmospheric conditions,"This paper indicated the estimated time dispersion and delay through free space optics transceiver communications performance signature in the presence of adverse atmospheric conditions. The estimated time dispersion/time delay is deeply studied through free space optics transceiver. The modulation techniques are clarified through this study are differential phase shift keying (DPSK), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The used optimum operating wavelength is 1550 nm for the free space link transmission. The study is employed with dense and light fog atmospheric weather through the free space transceiver communication system. The study emphasized that QPSK modulation scheme demonstrated the lowest signal scattering, attenuation losses and the highest received power with the data rates transmission performance signature. Scattering loss and atmospheric signal loss are demonstrated versus free space channel link at both the dense fog and light fog weather distribution through the use of different proposed modulation techniques. The percentage signal transmission is clarified versus free space channel link at the dense/light fog weather distribution through the use of proposed modulation techniques. Received power is studied versus free space channel link and operating system wavelength variations at the dense fog weather distribution through the employment of QAM, QPSK and DPSK modulation schemes.Query Optimum bit rate transmission, optimum link margin and optimum signal quality are demonstrated against operating system wavelength and free space channel link at the dense/light fog weather distribution through the employment of QPSK modulation scheme. As well as the signal propagation delay time is clarified against free space channel link at the light/dense fog weather distribution through the use of proposed modulation techniques."
The relationship between space and time perception: A registered replication of Casasanto and Boroditsky (2008),"Everything in our environment moves through both space and time, and to effectively act we must be aware of both spatial and temporal elements in relation to our own bodies. Thus, perceptions of space and time have an intimate relationship. Walsh’s a theory of magnitude (ATOM) suggests that space and time perception rely on a general magnitude system and their relationship should be roughly symmetrical. Alternatively, metaphor theory, which is based on the philosophical work of Lakoff and Johnson, argues that we represent time using a spatial metaphor and thus the relationship should be asymmetrical (with space influencing time more than time influences space). A compelling line of evidence for metaphor theory comes from the work of Casasanto & Boroditsky. Cognition, 106(2), 579–593. (2008) who experimentally demonstrated this asymmetric effect. However, in our previous unpublished online replication attempt of this work, we found a roughly symmetrical relationship between space and time, more in line with the theoretical predictions of ATOM. Given this, we performed a registered replication of Casasanto & Boroditsky. Cognition, 106(2), 579–593. (2008) in both an online and laboratory environment."
The effect of cognitive reserve on the cognitive connectome in healthy ageing,"During ageing, different cognitive functions decline at different rates. Additionally, cognitive reserve may influence inter-individual variability in age-related cognitive decline. These complex relationships can be studied by constructing a so-called cognitive connectome and characterising it with advanced graph-theoretical network analyses. This study examined the effect of cognitive reserve on the cognitive connectome across age. A total of 334 cognitively healthy participants were stratified into early middle age (37–50 years; n = 110), late middle age (51–64 years; n = 106), and elderly (65–78 years; n = 118) groups. Within each age group, individuals were subdivided into high and low cognitive reserve. For each subgroup, a cognitive connectome was constructed based on correlations between 47 cognitive variables. Applying graph theory, different global network measures were compared between the groups. Graph-theoretical network analyses revealed that individuals with high cognitive reserve were characterized by a stable cognitive connectome across age groups. High cognitive reserve groups only differed in modularity. In contrast, individuals with low cognitive reserve showed a marked reconfiguration of cognitive connectomes across age groups with differences extending over a variety of network measures including network strength, global efficiency, modularity, and small-worldness. Our results suggest a stabilizing effect of cognitive reserve on the cognitive connectome. Gaining further insights into these findings and underlying mechanisms will contribute to our understanding of age-related cognitive decline and guide the development of strategies to preserve cognitive function in ageing."
Stabilization of silver nanoparticles in a transparent polymethacrylate matrix while maintaining the capabilities of a colorimetric hydrogen peroxide sensor,"We suggest sensor systems based on silver nanoparticles embedded within the polymethacrylate matrix for colorimetric determination of hydrogen peroxide. Polymethacrylate matrix stabilizes silver nanoparticles and its application enhances the selectivity of H2O2 determination through the transfer of the redox reaction from the solution volume into the solid phase, which reduces the access of interfering substances to the reaction medium. Dual-signal spectrophotometric and colorimetric approaches can be used for the determination of hydrogen peroxide in the range 0.2–4.4 mM with a detection limit 0.05 mM. We studied the conditions of interaction between the matrix components and some other substances by evaluating the influence of such factors as solution pH, the amount of nanoparticles within the polymer matrix, the contact time, and the analyte concentration upon the analytical signal."
Lifetime depression and mania/hypomania risk predicted by neural markers in three independent young adult samples during working memory and emotional regulation,"Objective markers of pathophysiological processes underlying lifetime depression and mania/hypomania risk can provide biologically informed targets for novel interventions to help prevent the onset of affective disorders in individuals with subsyndromal symptoms. Greater activity within and functional connectivity (FC) between the central executive network (CEN), supporting emotional regulation (ER) subcomponent processes such as working memory (WM), the default mode network (DMN), supporting self-related information processing, and the salience network (SN), is thought to interfere with cognitive functioning and predispose to depressive disorders. Using an emotional n-back paradigm designed to examine WM and ER capacity, we examined in young adults: (1) relationships among activity and FC in these networks and lifetime depression and mania/hypomania risk; (2) the extent to which these relationships were specific to lifetime depression risk versus lifetime mania/hypomania risk; (3) whether findings in a first, Discovery sample n = 101, 63 female, age = 23.85 (2.9) could be replicated in a two independent Test samples of young adults: Test sample 1: n = 90, 60 female, age = 21.7 (2.0); Test sample 2: n = 96, 65 female, age = 21.6 (2.1). The Mood Spectrum Self-Report (MOODS-SR-L) assessed lifetime mania/hypomania risk and depression risk. We showed significant clusters of activity to each contrast in similar locations in the anatomic mask in each Test sample as in the Discovery sample, and, using extracted mean BOLD signal from these clusters as IVs, we showed similar patterns of IV-DV relationships in each Test sample as in the Discovery sample. Specifically, in the Discovery sample, greater DMN activity during WM was associated with greater lifetime depression risk. This finding was specific to depression and replicated in both independent samples (all ps<0.05 qFDR). Greater CEN activity during ER was associated with increased lifetime depression risk and lifetime mania/hypomania risk in all three samples (all ps< 0.05 qFDR). These replicated findings provide promising objective, neural markers to better identify, and guide and monitor early interventions for, depression and mania/hypomania risk in young adults."
The effect of brace treatment history on bone density in preoperative patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) assessed by vertebral bone quality (VBQ) score: a retrospective propensity score-matched analysis,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), a prevalent condition among teenagers, is often accompanied by osteopenia. However, the impact of brace treatment on bone density in AIS patients remains a matter of debate. The Vertebral bone quality (VBQ) score, derived from MRI signal intensity, has been shown to correlate with bone mineral density (BMD). Yet, no studies to date have drawn comparisons between VBQ scores in preoperative AIS patients who had brace treatment history and those who have not received brace treatment."
Effect of the frequency of multi-specific synchronous spawning on genetic introgression among three Acropora species,"Hybridisation is an evolutionary process that generates genetic diversity in organisms. However, the relationship between reproductive features, such as spawning synchronisation and gamete compatibility, and the degree of introgression leading to hybridisation are poorly understood. The reef-building coral Acropora spp. have a complex evolutionary history, and the link between their ecology, life-history traits, and potential to hybridise is disputed. Here, we examined the relationship among the reproductive features involved in the intercrossing of three species, Acropora florida, Acropora gemmifera, and Acropora intermedia, at two sites: Akajima and the Sesoko islands in southern Japan. Although the examined species showed synchronous spawning and high rates of gamete compatibility, spawning synchronisation and gamete compatibility were less strongly associated with high rates of interbreeding among the three species. Model-based genetic clustering and site-pattern frequency-based tests with single nucleotide polymorphisms supported genetic admixture among the three species in each location. Demographic analyses using fastsimcoal implied that the admixture among the three species in each location might have occurred in the past (> 2,000 generations) and recently (< 50 generations). Furthermore, the recent admixture of these three species is potentially associated with heavy bleaching events and population declines. The principal component analysis, structure, and fastsimcoal showed that the extensive admixture of A. intermedia and A. gemmifera on Sesoko Island occurred recently. Therefore, gamete interactions that lead to hybridisation in the field must be clarified. Furthermore, the connectivity between the two locations needs to be identified; however, our results implied that population fluctuations could be associated with introgression."
A real-world study of active vitamin D as a prognostic marker in patients with sarcoma,"The assessment of sarcoma during clinical practice is primarily based on imaging examination, with no effective biomarkers available. Although it has been established that 1,25(OH)2D3 is abnormally expressed in patients with sarcoma, it remains unclear whether 1,25(OH)2D3 level could be used as an evaluation marker in these patient population."
Report of a case of renal collecting duct carcinoma with literature review,"Collecting duct carcinoma (CDC) is a rare pathologic subtype of renal cell carcinoma that accounts for approximately 0.4–1% of cases and originates in the collecting ducts (Bellini ducts) of the renal medulla. The majority of patients are metastatic at the time of presentation, extremely malignant and rapidly progressive, with most patients dying 1–3 years after initial diagnosis. Currently, surgery is considered the only effective treatment. There is no uniform standard for postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy.In this article, we report a case of an 85-year-old female patient with CDC who underwent radical nephrectomy. This is an extremely rare case. We describe the case and perform a literature review to report current research advances regarding the treatment and prognosis of patients with CDC. The aim of this study is to contribute to improving the diagnosis and treatment of CDC."
"Trade openness, economic growth and economic development nexus in South Africa: a pre- and post-BRICS analysis","This research analyses the interplay between trade liberalisation, economic growth, and economic development in South Africa. The research focuses on two distinct periods, pre-BRICS (1991 to 2010) and post-BRICS (2011 to 2021) and aims to assess economic growth and development trajectories which are intertwined with liberalisation. A Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) is used to account for potential cointegration among the variables. The study reports a long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables. The study finds that trade openness substantially influences GDP growth in the post-BRICS period and highlights a unidirectional causal relationship between trade liberalisation and economic growth. The research also reveals a positive association between trade openness and economic development, implying that openness fosters growth and facilitates broader development outcomes in South Africa. The research underscores the importance of trade openness as a driving force for economic growth and economic development in emerging economies like South Africa."
Hyperhomocysteinemia and its effect on ageing and language functions – HEAL study,"Hyperhomocysteinemia or high levels (> 15 µmol/L) of homocysteine (Hcy)in the blood has been suggested to affect the brain through vascular and neurodegenerative pathways and potentially impact cognition. The current study aims to explore the association of high homocysteine with cognition and brain volume changes in a cohort of middle and old agedr adults. The study recruited 1296 participants aged ≥ 45 years from Tata Longitudinal Study of Ageing (TLSA), an ongoing cohort study. The participants underwent detailed cognitive assessments using Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III) and Computerized Assessment of Adult Information Processing (COGNITO) neuropsychological battery and MR imaging using a 3T scanner. The participants were classified based on the median homocysteine level (16.89 µmol/L) into low Hcy (≤ median) and high Hcy (> median) groups. When adjusted for age, gender, years of education, vitamin B12, folate and dyslipidaemia, Generalised Linear Model (GLM) found a significant association of high Hcy with vocabulary task [β (95% CI) − 1.354 (− 2.655, − 0.052); p = 0.041]. Significant associations was also obtained between cerebral white matter volume and high Hcy [β (95% CI) − 5617.182 (− 11062.762, − 173.602); p = 0.043]. The results suggest that people with high Hcy levels performed poorer in cognitive tasks related to language domain and had lesser cerebral white matter volume. This indicates that homocysteine might have a profound impact on brain structure as well as function."
"A comparative assessment of Lead (Pb) concentration and physicochemical parameters in groundwater from the Kabwe mine and Lusaka non-mine sites, Zambia","This study addresses the comparative influence of physicochemical parameters on the dissolution of Pb and its levels in the groundwater of former Pb mining areas in Kabwe and non-mining areas in Lusaka, Zambia. This cross-sectional study analyzed 61 groundwater samples from hand pump boreholes using atomic absorption spectrometry. Physicochemical parameters were measured, including electrical conductivity (EC), temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), and pH. Statistical analysis involved the Wilcoxon test, Spearman’s correlation, robust linear regression, Principal component analysis (PCA), and generalized additive models. Pb concentrations were particularly higher (p = 0.029; median = 0.131 mg/L) in mining areas compared to non-mining areas (median = 0.071 mg/L). The EC in the mining areas (median = 585 µS/cm) was significantly (p = 0.001) lower than those in the non-mining area (median = 1100 µS/cm). Likewise, TDS levels revealed a significant (p = 0.001) difference between the mining area (median = 303 ppm) and the non-mining area (median = 601 ppm). The median pH values for groundwater samples in the mining and non-mining areas were 6.96 and 7.27, respectively. Spearman’s rank correlation revealed a significant (rho = − 0.405; p = 0.036) inverse relationship between Pb concentrations and pH in non-mining areas. Robust linear regression and generalized additive models underscored a significant (p = 0.016) non-linear relationship between temperature and Pb across all areas, with the non-mining area demonstrating a significant (p = 0.003) non-linear relationship between temperature and pH concerning Pb. The study associates mining activities with increased Pb concentrations, underscoring it as a principal contamination source. In contrast, elemental dissolutions from the basement limestone with dolomite might increase Pb concentration in the non-mining areas. The observed positive relationship between temperature and pH in non-mining areas highlights its positive interactions with Pb mobility while temperature greatly influences Pb dissolutions in mining areas."
Neurovirulence of Usutu virus in human fetal organotypic brain slice cultures partially resembles Zika and West Nile virus,"Usutu (USUV), West Nile (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) are neurotropic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) that cause severe neurological disease in humans. However, USUV-associated neurological disease is rare, suggesting a block in entry to or infection of the brain. We determined the replication, cell tropism and neurovirulence of these arboviruses in human brain tissue using a well-characterized human fetal organotypic brain slice culture model. Furthermore, we assessed the efficacy of interferon-β and 2′C-methyl-cytidine, a synthetic nucleoside analogue, in restricting viral replication. All three arboviruses replicated within the brain slices, with WNV reaching the highest titers, and all primarily infected neuronal cells. USUV- and WNV-infected cells exhibited a shrunken morphology, not associated with detectable cell death. Pre-treatment with interferon-β inhibited replication of all arboviruses, while 2′C-methyl-cytidine reduced only USUV and ZIKV titers. Collectively, USUV can infect human brain tissue, showing similarities in tropism and neurovirulence as WNV and ZIKV. These data suggest that a blockade to infection of the human brain may not be the explanation for the low clinical incidence of USUV-associated neurological disease. However, USUV replicated more slowly and to lower titers than WNV, which could help to explain the reduced severity of neurological disease resulting from USUV infection."
Intolerance of uncertainty and internet addiction among college students in China post-pandemic era: the mediating role of future anxiety,"Due to the repeated changes in the COVID-19 pandemic, we live in an era of various uncertainties that raise future anxiety and behavioral addiction problems. According to the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), the present study attempted to explore the impact of COVID-19 intolerance of uncertainty (COVID-19 IU) on internet addiction (IA) among college students and the mediating role of future anxiety (FA) by constructing a mediating model. A questionnaire survey was conducted on 679 Chinese college students and PROCESS 3.5 was utilized to test the hypotheses. The results indicated that the COVID-19 IU was significantly positively correlated with IA and FA, and FA was significantly positively correlated with IA. COVID-19 IU had a significant positive predictive effect on IA; FA played a complementary partial mediating role between COVID-19 IU and IA. The results supported the PMT, which not only enriched our understanding of FA under uncertain life circumstances, but also deepened our understanding of the potential mechanisms of the effects of IA. Finally, discussions and suggestions were presented based on the results."
First insight into the whole genome sequence variations in clarithromycin resistant Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates in Russia,"Clarithromycin (CLR) is currently a key antibiotic for Helicobacter pylori infection treatment, however, the data on CLR resistance patterns in Russia are missing. Here, we applied WGS-based approach to H. pylori clinical isolates from Russia to comprehensively investigate sequence variation, identify putative markers of CLR resistance and correlate them with phenotypic susceptibility testing. The phenotypic susceptibility of 44 H. pylori isolates (2014–2022) to CLR was determined by disc diffusion method: 23 isolates were CLR-resistant and 21-CLR-susceptible. All isolates were subjected to WGS and submitted to GenBank. Based on complete sequence analysis, we showed that among all sequence variants, the combination of mutations A2146G/A2147G in the 23S rRNA gene is the most reliable for prediction of phenotypic susceptibility. For the first time, the average number of mutations in 106 virulence-associated genes between resistant and susceptible groups were compared. Moreover, this study presents the first WGS insight into genetic diversity of H. pylori in Russia with a particular focus on the molecular basis of drug resistance: the novel mutations were described as potential markers for the resistance development. Of these, the most prominent was a frameshift deletion (252:CGGGT) in HP0820 coding region, which is a good candidate for further investigation."
Wissen über humane Papillomaviren unter Studierenden in Deutschland: eine Querschnittstudie belegt dringenden Handlungsbedarf,"Humane Papillomaviren (HPV) zählen zu den häufigsten durch Intimkontakte übertragenen Erregern und verursachen viele gut- und bösartige Erkrankungen. Eine Impfung gegen diese Viren schützt sehr sicher vor diesen Erkrankungen. Trotz einer durch die Ständige Impfkommission (STIKO) empfohlenen HPV-Impfung sind das Wissen und die Impfrate in Deutschland sehr niedrig. Ziel der Studie war es daher, das HPV-Wissen unter deutschen Studierenden zu erheben."
A non-parametric approach to predict the recruitment for randomized clinical trials: an example in elderly inpatient settings,"Accurate prediction of subject recruitment, which is critical to the success of a study, remains an ongoing challenge. Previous prediction models often rely on parametric assumptions which are not always met or may be difficult to implement. We aim to develop a novel method that is less sensitive to model assumptions and relatively easy to implement."
Loading Path Design for Grain Refinement in Hot Forming Process of Ti-6Al-2Zr-1Mo-1V Alloy,"Grain refinement is crucial for enhancing the microstructure and mechanical properties of materials. This study employed a new loading method for grain refinement in Ti-6Al-2Zr-1Mo-1V alloy. A particle swarm optimization–backpropagation neural network model was developed to precisely capture the complex rheological behavior of the alloy. The model exhibited outstanding correlation (from 0.99633 to 0.99998). A detailed hot processing map was constructed using experimental and model data. By combining microstructure characteristics, a microstructure deformation mechanism map was developed to identify and isolate the stable dynamic recrystallization fine-grain regions. However, these regions remain chaotic and require further discretization design. By employing finite element simulation, the optimal strain rates of discretized elements were determined, and then, the 3D response surface was fitted. The loading path was ultimately verified through isothermal compression experiments and microstructure analysis. Results indicate that grain sizes under the optimal loading paths are smaller than before, strongly confirming the effectiveness of loading path. Specifically, at 1173 K, grain size under the optimized loading path was 10.45 μm, and at 1223 K, it was 12.15 μm."
From free fields to interacting SCFTs via representation theory,"We ask when it is possible to construct arbitrary unitary multiplets of the superconformal algebra with eight Poincaré supercharges that are compatible with locality from (continuous deformations of) representations in free field theories. We answer this question in two, three, and five dimensions. In four dimensions, we resort to an intricate but self-consistent web of conjectures. If correct, these conjectures imply various new non-perturbative constraints on short multiplets in any local unitary 4d \( \mathcal{N} \) = 2 superconformal field theory and on an unusual set of related vertex algebras. Throughout, we connect our results with properties of deformations in the space of theories."
Microstructure and Property Evolution of an Al-Mg-Si Alloy Cable during the Production Process,"An Al-Mg-Si alloy cable was manufactured by a production process including hot rolling (HR), drawing (DR) and aging (AA) treatment after Properzi continuous casting. The microstructures, electrical conductivity (EC) and tensile properties of the alloy samples at different production stages were investigated. The present work focused on the microstructural evolutions and their effects on electron conduction and strengthening mechanism. It was found that the dispersed clusters were firstly formed in the DR sample, and then, they were produced in large quantities in the AA sample. The EC decreased after drawing and increased after aging, while the strength progressively increased. The results demonstrated that the recrystallization won the competition with other phase reactions during hot rolling. The drawing process refined the grains and increased dislocation density, leading to the reduction of EC and the improvement of strength. After aging treatment, the dislocation density decreased and the precipitation occurred, resulting in the desired EC (54.2 IACS%) and strength (320 MPa)."
Effectiveness of a 5-week virtual reality versus traditional training on balance and flexibility in healthy adult females,This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a 5-week virtual reality training protocol on static and dynamic balance and flexibility compared to a traditional training protocol in healthy adult females.
"Typicality, entropy and the generalization of statistical mechanics","When at equilibrium, large-scale systems obey conventional thermodynamics because they belong to microscopic configurations (or states) that are typical. Crucially, the typical states usually represent only a small fraction of the total number of possible states, and yet the characterization of the set of typical states—the typical set—alone is sufficient to describe the macroscopic behavior of a given system. Consequently, the concept of typicality, and the associated Asymptotic Equipartition Property allow for a drastic reduction of the degrees of freedom needed for system’s statistical description. The mathematical rationale for such a simplification in the description is due to the phenomenon of concentration of measure. The later emerges for equilibrium configurations thanks to very strict constraints on the underlying dynamics, such as weekly interacting and (almost) independent system constituents. The question naturally arises as to whether the concentration of measure and related typicality considerations can be extended and applied to more general complex systems, and if so, what mathematical structure can be expected in the ensuing generalized thermodynamics. In this paper, we illustrate the relevance of the concept of typicality in the toy model context of the “thermalized” coin and show how this leads naturally to Shannon entropy. We also show an intriguing connection: The characterization of typical sets in terms of Rényi and Tsallis entropies naturally leads to the free energy and partition function, respectively, and makes their relationship explicit. Finally, we propose potential ways to generalize the concept of typicality to systems where the standard microscopic assumptions do not hold."

"Trade openness, economic growth and economic development nexus in South Africa: a pre- and post-BRICS analysis","This research analyses the interplay between trade liberalisation, economic growth, and economic development in South Africa. The research focuses on two distinct periods, pre-BRICS (1991 to 2010) and post-BRICS (2011 to 2021) and aims to assess economic growth and development trajectories which are intertwined with liberalisation. A Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) is used to account for potential cointegration among the variables. The study reports a long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables. The study finds that trade openness substantially influences GDP growth in the post-BRICS period and highlights a unidirectional causal relationship between trade liberalisation and economic growth. The research also reveals a positive association between trade openness and economic development, implying that openness fosters growth and facilitates broader development outcomes in South Africa. The research underscores the importance of trade openness as a driving force for economic growth and economic development in emerging economies like South Africa."
State-Level LGBTQ + Policies and Experiences of Interpersonal Discrimination among Sexual and Gender Minority People,"To quantify the role of state-level lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+)-related policies on experiences of discrimination in a population-representative sample of partnered individuals."
First impressions and the built environment: exploring zero acquaintance judgments in socio-spatial contexts,"The well-researched sociological concept known as Zero Acquaintance Judgment frames first impression scenarios and highlights their prevalence and importance to our everyday lives, yet sociology so far overlooks how these might be affected by the built environment where first impressions are typically situated. Broadly, spatial discriminatory discourse investigates how spaces can affect social judgments, yet no research has investigated how this dynamic might unfold within a first impression scenario. Using the Zero Acquaintance Judgment concept as a lens of inquiry, a comprehensive review of feminist, queer, racial, and disability frameworks (which comprise spatial discriminatory discourse) was undertaken. From this investigation, three broad theoretical themes were articulated and rationalized as to how the built environment can potentially affect first impressions between strangers. The discussion bears relevance for researchers and designers of spaces where first impressions are paramount to function as well as highlights how the settings of research into first impressions may affect outcomes."
Do opaque algorithms have functions?,"The functions of technical artifacts are closely associated with design. Increasingly, however, we depend on technologies that are not designed: algorithms produced using machine learning (ML). Machine learning uses automated optimization processes to produce algorithms that are often opaque even to developers. I argue that these opaque ML models cannot be ascribed functions on the leading design-based account, the ICE theory of Houkes and Vermaas (Technical functions: On the use and design of artefacts, Springer, 2010). Specifically, I argue that the form of rational justification that the ICE theory provides for the uses of artifacts in typical cases cannot be provided for opaque algorithms, since developers lack the necessary “support beliefs” about how the algorithm works. This does not mean that opaque ML models have no proper functions at all; rather, it lends support to non-intentional theories of technical functions, modeled after function theories in the sciences. However, these theories are meant to perform different work than the ICE theory. As a result, the kind of justification they provide for artifact use is weaker than that provided by the ICE theory and fails to justify many ongoing uses of algorithms."
Machine-learning-aided method for optimizing beam selection and update period in 5G networks and beyond,"Finding the optimal beam pair and update time in 5G systems operating at mmWave frequencies is time-intensive and resource-demanding. This intricate procedure calls for the proposal of more intelligent approaches. Therefore, this work proposes a machine learning-based method for optimizing beam pair selection and its update time. The method is structured around three main modules: spatial characterization of beam pair service areas, training of a machine learning model using collected beam pair data, and an algorithm that uses the decision function of the trained model to compute the optimal update time for beam pairs based on the spatial position and velocity of user equipment. When the machine learning model is deployed in a network with a single gNB equipped with a \(8\times 8\) UPA and one UE equipped with a \(1\times 2\) UPA in an mmWave scenario simulated in NS3, improvements in SINR and throughput up to \(407\%\), were observed. Improvements are gathered because of a reduction of \(85.7\%\) in beam pair selections because of an increase of approximately \(1543\%\) in the effective time between successive beam pair searches. This method could offer real-time optimization of the beam pair procedures in 5G networks and beyond."
The Health and Safety of Retail and Service Workers during COVID-19: The Role of Safety Leadership,"We examined how safety leadership behaviours (“speaking about safety” and “role modeling safety”) predicted retail workers’ symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and safety behavior during a health and safety crisis and the mediating role of workers’ health and safety-related fears. During the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., March and April 2020), we surveyed retail workers in the U.S. and Canada, measuring fear of COVID-19 infection, symptoms of PTSD, self-protective safety behaviors (e.g., handwashing), and perceptions of their leaders’ safety behaviors at three time points (n1 = 505, n2 = 326, n3 = 218). In an observed variable path analysis, leader modeling of safety related directly to greater self-protection behaviors in time two only. Leader “speaking about safety” was associated with increases in employees’ fear of infection. Fear, in turn, promoted greater self-protective safety behaviors. Speaking about safety was directly and positively related to symptoms of PTSD among employees, suggesting that, during times of crisis, the benefits associated with leaders’ safety behaviors may need to be balanced with the potential for mental-health related costs. Implications for future research and practice are discussed."
Neutrophil-specific interactome of ARHGAP25 reveals novel partners and regulatory insights,"ARHGAP25, a crucial molecule in immunological processes, serves as a Rac-specific GTPase-activating protein. Its role in cell migration and phagocyte functions, affecting the outcome of complex immunological diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, renders it a promising target for drug research. Despite its importance, our knowledge of its intracellular interactions is still limited. This study employed proteomic analysis of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tag pulldowns and co-immunoprecipitation from neutrophilic granulocyte cell lysate, revealing 76 candidates for potential physical interactions that complement ARHGAP25’s known profile. Notably, four small GTPases (RAC2, RHOG, ARF4, and RAB27A) exhibited high affinity for ARHGAP25. The ARHGAP25–RAC2 and ARHGAP25–RHOG interactions appeared to be affected by the activation state of the small GTPases, suggesting a GTP–GDP cycle-dependent interaction. In silico dimer prediction pinpointed ARHGAP25’s GAP domain as a credible binding interface, suggesting its suitability for GTP hydrolysis. Additionally, a list of Fc receptor-related kinases, phosphatases, and three of the 14-3-3 members were identified as potential partners, with in silico predictions highlighting eight binding sites, presenting novel insight on a potential regulatory mechanism for ARHGAP25."
An AI-Based Method for Estimating the Potential Runout Distance of Post-Seismic Debris Flows,"The widely distributed sediments following an earthquake presents a continuous threat to local residential areas and infrastructure. These materials become more easily mobilized due to reduced rainfall thresholds. Before establishing an effective management plan for debris flow hazards, it is crucial to determine the potential reach of these sediments. In this study, a deep learning-based method—Dual Attention Network (DAN)—was developed to predict the runout distance of potential debris flows after the 2022 Luding Earthquake, taking into account the topography and precipitation conditions. Given that the availability of reliable precipitation data remains a challenge, attributable to the scarcity of rain gauge stations and the relatively coarse resolution of satellite-based observations, our approach involved three key steps. First, we employed the DAN model to refine the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) data, enhancing its spatial and temporal resolution. This refinement was achieved by leveraging the correlation between precipitation and regional environment factors (REVs) at a seasonal scale. Second, the downscaled GPM underwent calibration using observations from rain gauge stations. Third, mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) were employed to evaluate the performance of both the downscaling and calibration processes. Then the calibrated precipitation, catchment area, channel length, average channel gradient, and sediment volume were selected to develop a prediction model based on debris flows following the Wenchuan Earthquake. This model was applied to estimate the runout distance of potential debris flows after the Luding Earthquake. The results show that: (1) The calibrated GPM achieves an average MAE of 1.56 mm, surpassing the MAEs of original GPM (4.25 mm) and downscaled GPM (3.83 mm); (2) The developed prediction model reduces the prediction error by 40 m in comparison to an empirical equation; (3) The potential runout distance of debris flows after the Luding Earthquake reaches 0.77 km when intraday rainfall is 100 mm, while the minimum distance value is only 0.06 km. Overall, the developed model offers a scientific support for decision makers in taking reasonable measurements for loss reduction caused by post-seismic debris flows."
The Relationship of Chronic Disease Burden and Racial-Ethnic Disparities in Depression Treatment,"Chronic disease and depression are closely related, and depression, if left untreated, can worsen physical disease symptoms. Furthermore, treating depression can improve patient outcomes. Generally, treatment for depression is lower in minority groups."
Effects of Graphene Nanoplates (GNPs) on Microstructure and Corrosion Behavior of ADC12-GNPs Composite,"GNP-reinforced aluminum matrix composites have garnered significant attention as high-performance lightweight materials. The research of corrosion resistance is also an important research aspect. In this study, the impact of GNPs and ultrasound assistance on the microstructure and corrosion behavior of ADC12-0.9GNPs composite was investigated using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electrochemical testing. The microstructural analysis revealed that ultrasonically dispersed GNPs significantly enhance the dissolution of the Si phase. However, the ultrasonically dispersed composites exhibited higher corrosion rates than those without ultrasonic dispersion. The corrosion current densities of ADC12-0.9GNPs non-dispersed composite and ADC12-0.9GNPs dispersed composite were 5.34 μA cm−2 and 7.02 μA cm− 2, respectively. The polarization resistances were 1002.74 Ω cm2 and 869.72 Ω cm2, respectively. Composites with dispersed GNPs exhibited higher corrosion rates. The in-situ corrosion monitoring using OM and SEM indicated that the presence of GNPs phase and Fe-rich phase led to a decrease in corrosion resistance. The negative impact of dispersed GNPs on corrosion is due to the increased contact area with more cathodic phases, resulting in accelerated galvanic corrosion of the α-Al matrix."
Giant retroperitoneal liposarcoma with multiple organ involvement: a case report and literature review,"Retroperitoneal liposarcoma (RPLPS) is a relatively rare disease. Liposarcomas vary in size, but sizeable RPLPS larger than 30 cm in diameter are very rare, and their diagnosis and treatment present significant challenges."
Temporal evolution and inter-patient heterogeneity in primary and recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are heterogeneous in terms of origin and aetiology. In addition, there is uncertainty about the genetic evolution from initial diagnosis to recurrence after primary treatments and further disease progression following systemic treatment. Changes in the genetic profile have implications on the selection of appropriate treatments for patients, especially in the era of targeted therapies and immunotherapies."
Microsurgical treatment for superior petrosal sinus dural arteriovenous fistulas,"Superior petrosal sinus (SPS) dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are a commonly encountered type of tentorial DAVF that occasionally requires microsurgical intervention. This study aims to analyze the tributaries of the superior petrosal vein (SPV) observed intraoperatively, their association with clinical symptoms, and venous drainage patterns. This retrospective study reviewed 34 consecutive patients with SPS DAVFs who underwent microsurgical treatment at a single institution between 2014 and 2022. The cohort had a mean age of 52.8 ± 11.8 years, with 85.3% (29/34) being male. Predominant symptoms included venous hypertensive myelopathy (VHM) (55.9%) and intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage (23.5%). Standard retrosigmoid approach was used to ligate 94.1% (32/34) of the lesions, resulting in immediate complete fistula occlusion for all patients. Supratentorial venous drainage patterns were associated with a higher incidence of intracranial hemorrhage and venous varix (P = 0.047). Infratentorial drainage patterns were more frequently linked with VHM-related symptoms (P<0.001). Patients presenting VHM-related symptoms showed a higher prevalence of drainage through the vein of the cerebellopontine fissure (VCPF) (P = 0.01), while those with intracranial hemorrhage symptoms exhibited a higher prevalence of pontotrigeminal vein (PTV) drainage (P = 0.033) in their DAVFs. Endovascular management of SPS DAVFs carries inherent risks. Surgical treatment via standard retrosigmoid craniotomy offers favorable clinical outcomes with high rates of cure. In cases featuring infratentorial venous drainage, the predominant arterialized tributary of the SPV was the VCPF, commonly associated with VHM-related symptoms. Conversely, in cases with supratentorial venous drainage, the predominant arterialized SPV tributary was the PTV, often associated with intracranial hemorrhage symptoms."
Variations of organic functional chemistry in carbonaceous matter from the asteroid 162173 Ryugu,"Primordial carbon delivered to the early earth by asteroids and meteorites provided a diverse source of extraterrestrial organics from pre-existing simple organic compounds, complex solar-irradiated macromolecules, and macromolecules from extended hydrothermal processing. Surface regolith collected by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft from the carbon-rich asteroid 162173 Ryugu present a unique opportunity to untangle the sources and processing history of carbonaceous matter. Here we show carbonaceous grains in Ryugu can be classified into three main populations defined by spectral shape: Highly aromatic (HA), Alkyl-Aromatic (AA), and IOM-like (IL). These carbon populations may be related to primordial chemistry, since C and N isotopic compositions vary between the three groups. Diffuse carbon is occasionally dominated by molecular carbonate preferentially associated with coarse-grained phyllosilicate minerals. Compared to related carbonaceous meteorites, the greater diversity of organic functional chemistry in Ryugu indicate the pristine condition of these asteroid samples."
Enhancement of rider comfort by magnetorheological elastomer based damping treatment at strategic locations of an electric two wheeler,"The vibrations generated in the two-wheeled vehicles like motorcycles due to road irregularities such as cracks, potholes, and bumps on the road cause discomfort for the rider as well as the pillion. These vibrations are reported to cause lower back pains, musculoskeletal effects, fatigue, and long-term health issues. Particularly, electric two-wheelers are more susceptible to these vibrations caused by the road and need attention. This paper presents an innovative technique for the reduction of vibrations at prominent locations in the electric two-wheeler to improve the rider’s comfort. All measured accelerations are about vertical direction (along z-axis as per ISO 2631-1 standard). Passive and Semi-active damping treatments namely, Room temperature vulcanizing Silicone rubber and Magnetorheological elastomer (MRE) were applied on the test vehicle at strategic locations of vibration. Both were compared for their effectiveness in reducing the vibrations. Results showed that MRE based damping technique proved better vibration isolation at the strategic locations. The weighted root mean square acceleration as well as vibration dose values were found to decrease with the help of damping treatments thus improving the rider’s overall comfort level."
Systemic ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma with NPM1::TYK2 rearrangement,"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with most cases harboring ALK gene rearrangement (ALK + ALCL); however, 20–50% of ALCLs do not have the rearrangement (ALK- ALCL) but exhibit distinct genetic alterations. In this report, we present an unusual case of systemic ALK- ALCL with NPM1::TYK2 fusion. Diagnosis of this case was challenging prior to the NGS findings. A comprehensive panel of immunohistochemical and in-situ hybridization studies was conducted. FISH assays were utilized to target the rearrangements of DUSP22 and TP63 genes. Moreover, next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays were performed to detect clonal rearrangements of IGH and TRG genes, somatic mutations, and potential fusions. The lymphoma cells in this case are negative for all hematolymphoid markers stained, except for CD30 expression and focal and weak CD43 expression. However, NGS studies detected clonal TRG rearrangement and NPM1::TYK2 rearrangement, which aid in the diagnosis of ALK- ALCL. NPM1::TYK2 rearrangement is a rare genetic alteration that has been reported in rare cases of primary cutaneous ALCL, mycosis fungoides, and lymphomatoid papulosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported instance of such rearrangement in systemic ALK- ALCL."
Optimizing ZnO as an electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells: Study on aluminum doping and thickness variation,"This study utilizes the Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS), a simulation program, to comprehensively investigate the influence of aluminum (Al) doping concentration and thickness variation in the ZnO layer on the performance of perovskite solar cells. The simulated perovskite solar cell (PSC) featured a perovskite layer of CH3NH3PbI3, with an Al-doped ZnO layer acting as the electron transport layer (ETL) and Spiro-OMETAD as the hole transport layer (HTL). Employing the basic n-i-p planar structure of the PSC, the simulations were conducted to discern the impact of varying Al doping and ZnO layer thickness. In the context of Al doping, the J-V curves exhibit a systematic improvement in open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and overall conversion efficiency (η) as the doping concentration varies from 0 to 4%, with optimal performance achieved at 3%, yielding an efficiency of 15.37%. However, higher doping concentrations lead to diminished efficiency. Regarding thickness variation with a fixed 3% doping concentration, the J-V curves show a stable Voc but a subtle reduction in Jsc with increasing layer thickness. Notably, the investigation reveals that a maximum efficiency of 15.44% is achieved at a thickness of 20 nm. These findings provide crucial design considerations for enhancing PSC performance."
Estimated time dispersion and delay through free space optics transceiver communications performance signature in the presence of adverse atmospheric conditions,"This paper indicated the estimated time dispersion and delay through free space optics transceiver communications performance signature in the presence of adverse atmospheric conditions. The estimated time dispersion/time delay is deeply studied through free space optics transceiver. The modulation techniques are clarified through this study are differential phase shift keying (DPSK), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The used optimum operating wavelength is 1550 nm for the free space link transmission. The study is employed with dense and light fog atmospheric weather through the free space transceiver communication system. The study emphasized that QPSK modulation scheme demonstrated the lowest signal scattering, attenuation losses and the highest received power with the data rates transmission performance signature. Scattering loss and atmospheric signal loss are demonstrated versus free space channel link at both the dense fog and light fog weather distribution through the use of different proposed modulation techniques. The percentage signal transmission is clarified versus free space channel link at the dense/light fog weather distribution through the use of proposed modulation techniques. Received power is studied versus free space channel link and operating system wavelength variations at the dense fog weather distribution through the employment of QAM, QPSK and DPSK modulation schemes.Query Optimum bit rate transmission, optimum link margin and optimum signal quality are demonstrated against operating system wavelength and free space channel link at the dense/light fog weather distribution through the employment of QPSK modulation scheme. As well as the signal propagation delay time is clarified against free space channel link at the light/dense fog weather distribution through the use of proposed modulation techniques."
Synthesis of magnetic 4A zeolite and its performance on ammonia nitrogen adsorption in water,"Fe3O4@SiO2/4A magnetic nanocomposites (magnetic 4A zeolite) have been synthesized by hydrothermal method which endowed 4A zeolite with magnetic separation characteristics. XRD results showed that the magnetic 4A zeolite had the characteristic diffraction peaks of both 4A zeolite and Fe3O4. The SEM images displayed the combination of 4A zeolite and Fe3O4. N2 physical adsorption showed that magnetic 4A zeolite had a large specific surface area and can provide a large number of adsorption sites for ammonia nitrogen. The magnetic separation results showed that magnetic 4A zeolite exhibited fast response to external magnetic field, and the saturation strength measured by VSM was 5.85 emu g−1, indicating the superparamagnetic properties of magnetic 4A zeolite. The removal rate of ammonia nitrogen by FSA-M-1 sample reached to 43.18%. After 6 rounds of repeated adsorption experiments, each sample’s magnetic recovery rate was above 95%, and the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen was higher than 36%."
Accuracy of ultra-high resolution and virtual non-calcium reconstruction algorithm for stenosis evaluation with photon-counting CT: results from a dynamic phantom study,"We compared ultra-high resolution (UHR), standard resolution (SR), and virtual non-calcium (VNCa) reconstruction for coronary artery stenosis evaluation using photon-counting computed tomography (PC-CT)."
Two-indexed formulation of the traveling salesman problem with multiple drones performing sidekicks and loops,"Aerial drone delivery has great potential to improve package delivery time, as drones can fly autonomously over obstacles at a possibly higher speed than trucks. The benefits of drones in delivery can even be increased in a truck-and-drone tandem where a truck carries multiple drones and releases them at advantageous places, i.e., the traveling salesman problem with multiple drones (TSPmD). We focus on a general version of this problem with makespan minimization, where the drones have two options after serving the customer: they can return to any node the truck visits at a later stage (sidekick) or return to the same node they were launched from (loop) — even at the depot. We introduce an efficient two-indexed mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for this TSPmD and show how to adapt the MILP to cover two problem variants, namely the multiple flying sidekick traveling salesman problem and the traveling salesman problem with drone. Our MILP formulation is an efficient formulation, as it outperforms eight state-of-the-art MILP formulations for these problem variants in nearly all larger instances. In a numerical study, we provide new optimal solutions with up to 28 nodes for benchmark purposes. Moreover, we analyze the impact of allowing drone loops on makespan minimization in general and at the depot. We find that loops mainly become relevant when drones travel faster than trucks, resulting in average makespan savings of up to 2.7%."
Dry blood spots as a sampling strategy to identify insulin resistance markers during a dietary challenge,"This study aimed to identify markers of postprandial dysglycemia in the blood of self-described healthy individuals using dry blood spots (DBS) as a sampling strategy. A total of 54 volunteers, including 31 women, participated in a dietary challenge. They consumed a high-fat, high-sugar mixed meal and underwent multiple blood sampling over the course of 150 min to track their postprandial responses. Blood glucose levels were monitored with a portable glucometer and individuals were classified into two groups based on the glucose area under the curve (AUC): High-AUC (H-AUC) and Low-AUC (L-AUC). DBS sampling was performed at the same time points as the assessment of glycemia using Whatman 903 Protein Saver filter paper. A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling was conducted in the DBS samples to assess postprandial changes in blood metabolome. Higher concentrations of metabolites associated with insulin resistance were observed in individuals from the H-AUC group, including sugars and sugar-derived products such as fructose and threonic acid, as well as organic acids and fatty acids such as succinate and stearic acid. Several metabolites detected in the GC-MS analysis remained unidentified, indicating that other markers of hyperglycemia remain to be discovered in DBS. Based on these observations, we demonstrated that the use of DBS as a non-invasive and inexpensive sampling tool allows the identification of metabolites markers of dysglycemia in the postprandial period."
Effect of bacterial diversity on the quality of fermented apple juice during natural fermentation of Hanfu apples,"The fermented cloudy apple juice (FCAJ) bacterial phase was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing. During fermentation, the bacterial phase transition promoted quality changes, such as carbohydrate, organic acid, total phenol, taste and volatiles of FCAJ. Citrobacter and Lactobacillus were the dominant bacterial genera of Hanfu apple juice by natural fermentation, and lactic acid was the most abundant organic acid in FCAJ. Citrobacter showed a continuous increase trend along with fermentation time, while Lactobacillus showed a slight decrease during the later period of fermentation. The contents of total phenolic and flavonoid both showed a trend of rising first and then decreasing in FCAJ during fermentation. Alcohols and esters, the main aromatic volatiles in FCAJ, showed significant increases, especially for ethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol and ethyl acetate. Citrobacter presented a higher correlation than Lactobacillus with some volatile flavor."
Riot Like a Girl? Gender-Stereotypical Associations Boost Support for Feminist Online Campaigns,"The current study examined whether congruence with gender stereotypes is associated with support for online feminist campaigns. In Study 1 (Ntweets = 510,000), we investigated how two real-world movements (i.e., #metoo and #sexstrike) were viewed in terms of adhering to the traditional feminine stereotype of high warmth/communion and low competence/agency, as per language used in the tweets posted within each campaign. We found that the #metoo movement was characterised by more communal and less agentic content than #sexstrike. In Study 2 (N = 195), when presented with descriptions of the movements modelled after #metoo and #sexstrike, participants associated the #metoo-like campaign with more feminine (e.g., community orientation) and less masculine concepts (e.g., rebelliousness), which, in turn, translated to greater declared support for the campaign. In Study 3 (N = 446), conducted in a more controlled and context-independent setting, we once again observed the link between the gender stereotypes attached to feminist movements and the support they received. We also found that this effect was independent of the effect of perceiving movements as violating social norms. Controlling for feminist identification, political conservatism, and gender system justification did not affect the pattern of results. Uncovering these stereotype-related effects on support for feminist movements furthers understanding of the strategies that might be used in the fight for gender equality."
Research on runoff interval prediction method based on deep learning ensemble modeling with hydrological factors,"Precise prediction of runoff is not only conducive to the prevention of floods and droughts but also to the rational use of water resources. Due to the frequency of weather extremes and the complexity of runoff variability, achieving accurate runoff predictions is challenging. This research develops a deep-learning ensemble model for interval prediction based on meteorological and hydrological factors. The model can be divided into four stages: feature extraction, decomposition, point prediction, and interval prediction. First, Pearson's correlation coefficient filters out key driving variables affecting runoff. Next, the original data are decomposed by variational modal decomposition (VMD) to intrinsic modal function (IMF); Then, each IMF is decomposed by complementary ensemble empirical modal decomposition (CEEMD) to capture more data details. Following, the runoff point prediction portion is realized by the attention mechanism fusion gated recurrent unit (AM-GRU). In this study, data from Dunhuang and Panjiazhuang stations, located in the upper and lower reaches of the Shule River in China, were used to validate and analyze the VMD-CEEMD-ISSA-AM-GRU (VCIAG) model. The results show that (1) the VCIAG model has the best fitting effect which the NSE values of Dunhuang and Panjiazhuang stations are 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. (2) In the multi-period prediction in advance, the highest prediction accuracy is achieved when the prediction period is 1 day and the accuracy of the prediction decreases gradually as the prediction period becomes longer. (3) In flood early warning, the VCIAG performs well at both stations, which suggests that the proposed model can take precautionary measures in advance before the floods come. (4) In terms of interval prediction, the VCIAG model has the narrowest prediction interval width and the highest prediction accuracy, which enhances the application value of the model."
Effect of Ferromagnetic Materials on Vibration of In-wheel Brushless Direct Current Motor for Light Electric Vehicle,"Light electric vehicles (LEV) have become an integral part of our daily lives. In-wheel Brushless Direct Current Motor (BLDCM) is mostly preferred in the propulsion systems of LEVs. Ferromagnetic materials used in electric motors affect motor output performance as much as geometric design parameters. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effects of vibration on the driving performance of LEVs and its disruptive effects on BLDCM. Vibration effect reduces the operating life of electric motors and leads to their malfunction. In this study, the vibration effects of different stator and rotor ferromagnetic materials in-wheel BLDCM of LEVs were analyzed. It has been revealed that permanent magnets and mild steel ferromagnetic materials are factors affecting the operating performance of BLDCM. Total deformation harmonic response analyses were performed under ANSYS Workbench software to reveal the vibration effects on the specified in-wheel BLDCM. The lowest vibration effect is achieved when SmCo5(R18) magnet is used in the rotor and M22-26G mild steel ferromagnetic material is used in the stator, where the maximum vibration of 0.086023 μm in rotor and 18.386 μm in stator are achieved. It was concluded that the most compatible materials result in the lowest vibration values in BLDCM."
Community participatory mapping of malaria mosquito breeding sites in Mozambique,"The community involvement and the people’s knowledge allow detailed information about the distribution, location, and identification of mosquito breeding-sites. Information which is fundamental for their efficient management and elimination. Since participatory mapping has proven to be an effective tool to identify health determinants, the study aimed to apply the methodology to identify and map potential mosquito breeding-sites in Tambai, Nhamatanda, Mozambique."
Multi-Label Classification of Fundus Images with Optimized Vision Transformer Based Wasserstein Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network,"Early retinal disease diagnosis and treatment are essential for preventing the irreversible vision impairment. The patients in the clinical settings have various kinds of retinal disorders. Fundus image categorization is a multiple label categorization task since a fundus image contains one or more disorders. However, most previous research has focused on the diagnosis of a single fundus problem and there remain substantial obstacles to the simultaneous diagnosis of several fundus conditions. In this research work, Multi-Label Classification of Fundus Images with Optimized vision transformer based Wasserstein Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (MLC-FI-VF-WDCGAN) is proposed to accurately classify the Fundus disease images. Initially, the input image data is collected from Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset. The input images are preprocessed with Multivariate Fast Iterative Filtering (MFIF) for eliminating the noise and increasing the quality of input imageries. The pre-processing images are given to Multi-scale Neighborhood Feature Extraction (MS-NFE) method for extracting features such as, Geometric Features, Blood Vessel and Vascular Tortuosity for enhancing the classification accuracy. Then, the extracted features are provided to vision transformer based Wasserstein Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (VF-WDCGAN) for classifying the Fundus disease as Normal, Diabetic retinopathy, Glaucoma, Cataract, Hypertensive retinopathy and Myopia. The Vision-transformer acts as Discriminator in the WDCGAN and doesn’t reveal any adoption of optimization methods for calculating the ideal parameters in improved categorization accuracy. Hence, Giza Pyramids Construction Algorithm (GPCA) is proposed to improve the weight parameters of VF-WDCGAN. The MLC-FI-VF-WDCGAN technique is implemented in python and evaluated using several performances metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall. The performance of proposed MLC-FI-VF-WDCGAN method is compared with existing techniques like, deep variational auto-encoders for denoising retinal fundus image (DVAE-DR-FI), Cycle GAN-depend deep learning method for artifact reduction in fundus photography (CGAN-DLAR-FP) and Rformer: Transformer-depend generative adversarial network for real fundus image restoration on new clinical benchmark (TGAN-FI-NCB) respectively."
Modeling and analyzing network dynamics of COVID-19 vaccine information propagation in the Chinese Sina Microblog,"Information about the vaccine is usually spread through heterogeneous networks in reality, where public opinion bursts out faster than in homogeneous networks. Considering the complexity of heterogeneous networks, we develop a network susceptible-forwarding-immune (NET-SFI) model to describe the patterns of information propagation in the actual social network. Classifying the states of nodes according to the number of users can contact in the social network, the NET-SFI model focuses on the network structure and user heterogeneity. We adopt a data-model drive method to conduct the model validation including two types of COVID-19 vaccine information from the Chinese Sina Microblog. Our parameter sensitivity analyses show the important significance of node degree in causing the outbreak of public opinion. Moreover, corresponding conclusions based on our analytic study are conducive to designing valid strategies for vaccine information dissemination."
The effect of hydrogen peroxide and subsequent resveratrol application to CAD–CAM blocks on the cell viability of fibroblasts,"The aim is to assess viability of fibroblasts exposed to 2 CAD–CAM blocks and a nanohybrid resin after application of hydrogen peroxide (HP) and resveratrol with 2 extraction media at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Eighteen specimens were obtained from Lava Ultimate (LU), Vita Enamic (VE), and Grandio (GR). Specimens of each material were divided into 3 groups (material only, bleached, resveratrol applied) for 2 extraction media as artificial saliva (AS) and phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (n = 3). For bleached group, 40% HP was applied to specimens for 20 min twice. For resveratrol group, 0.5 µM resveratrol was applied after bleaching for 10 min. Mouse fibroblast cells were exposed to extracts of each group. The viability of cells was determined with MTT assay at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Cell viability data (%) were analyzed statistically using one-way ANOVA, and post hoc Tukey test. Bleached materials showed the lowest cell viability (PBS; p < 0.01/ AS; p < 0.001). There is no statistically significant difference between resveratrol applied and bleached groups (PBS; p = 0.14/ AS; p = 0.072). Regardless of period of time and procedure, GR showed lower viable cell numbers than LU and VE (p < 0.001). Viable cell numbers were higher at 24 h than at 72 h (p < 0.001). There was no statistically difference between AS and PBS (p > 0.05). For all materials, the application of resveratrol did not affect the cell viability which decreased after bleaching over time. The decrease in nanohybrid resin was more critical than hybrid CAD–CAM blocks. The type of extraction media had no effect on cell viability results."
Accuracy of ultra-high resolution and virtual non-calcium reconstruction algorithm for stenosis evaluation with photon-counting CT: results from a dynamic phantom study,"We compared ultra-high resolution (UHR), standard resolution (SR), and virtual non-calcium (VNCa) reconstruction for coronary artery stenosis evaluation using photon-counting computed tomography (PC-CT)."
Two-indexed formulation of the traveling salesman problem with multiple drones performing sidekicks and loops,"Aerial drone delivery has great potential to improve package delivery time, as drones can fly autonomously over obstacles at a possibly higher speed than trucks. The benefits of drones in delivery can even be increased in a truck-and-drone tandem where a truck carries multiple drones and releases them at advantageous places, i.e., the traveling salesman problem with multiple drones (TSPmD). We focus on a general version of this problem with makespan minimization, where the drones have two options after serving the customer: they can return to any node the truck visits at a later stage (sidekick) or return to the same node they were launched from (loop) — even at the depot. We introduce an efficient two-indexed mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for this TSPmD and show how to adapt the MILP to cover two problem variants, namely the multiple flying sidekick traveling salesman problem and the traveling salesman problem with drone. Our MILP formulation is an efficient formulation, as it outperforms eight state-of-the-art MILP formulations for these problem variants in nearly all larger instances. In a numerical study, we provide new optimal solutions with up to 28 nodes for benchmark purposes. Moreover, we analyze the impact of allowing drone loops on makespan minimization in general and at the depot. We find that loops mainly become relevant when drones travel faster than trucks, resulting in average makespan savings of up to 2.7%."

Enhancing Ci3T Professional Learning: Initial Lessons Learned from Ci3T Implementers,"In this article, we present findings from our first iterative design study for Project ENHANCE to share our findings as well as provide an exemplar for others engaged in design inquiry. In particular, we explain how we used a data-informed design process with district partners to determine content and features of three foundational professional learning modules to support implementation of integrated tiered systems of support. We report findings from three groups of individuals: advisory board and expert panel members (Phase 0), Ci3T Leadership Team members (Phase 1), and role-specific user groups from school faculty and staff (Phase 2). Results indicated acceptability and overall usability of content from multiple perspectives, with priority placed on smaller units of professional learning and flexible resources (e.g., videos infographics). Results also raised questions about how to use resources without overwhelming teachers as they manage multiple responsibilities within a finite amount of time. We discuss limitations and future directions."
Resting-state neural dynamics changes in older adults with post-COVID syndrome and the modulatory effect of cognitive training and sex,"Post-COVID syndrome manifests with numerous neurological and cognitive symptoms, the precise origins of which are still not fully understood. As females and older adults are more susceptible to developing this condition, our study aimed to investigate how post-COVID syndrome alters intrinsic brain dynamics in older adults and whether biological sex and cognitive training might modulate these effects, with a specific focus on older females. The participants, aged between 60 and 75 years, were divided into three experimental groups: healthy old female, post-COVID old female and post-COVID old male. They underwent an adaptive task-switching training protocol. We analysed multiscale entropy and spectral power density of resting-state EEG data collected before and after the training to assess neural signal complexity and oscillatory power, respectively. We found no difference between post-COVID females and males before training, indicating that post-COVID similarly affected both sexes. However, cognitive training was effective only in post-COVID females and not in males, by modulating local neural processing capacity. This improvement was further evidenced by comparing healthy and post-COVID females, wherein the latter group showed increased finer timescale entropy (1–30 ms) and higher frequency band power (11–40 Hz) before training, but these differences disappeared following cognitive training. Our results suggest that in older adults with post-COVID syndrome, there is a pronounced shift from more global to local neural processing, potentially contributing to accelerated neural aging in this condition. However, cognitive training seems to offer a promising intervention method for modulating these changes in brain dynamics, especially among females."
"Structural, mechanical, and luminescent characteristics of Gd1−xEuxNb1−yTayO4 ceramic solid solutions","The paper studies ceramic samples prepared using traditional ceramic technology also knows as conventional sintering. Samples were prepared from Eu3+ activated fine powders of gadolinium niobate-tantalates GdNb1−yTayO4 (y = 0, 0.7, 1); Eu3+ concentration was x = 0.01, 0.2 and 0.4. Powders were synthesized using nitrate solutions Gd and Eu and niobium and tantalum hydroxides. The hydroxides were coprecipitated from hydrofluoric acid solutions. Full-profile analysis (Rietveld refinement) of XRD (X-ray diffraction) patterns of polycrystals determined the phase composition and refined the parameters of the structure of solid solution phases depending on the Eu concentration. Morphological features of the microstructure have been studied for gadolinium niobate-tantalate ceramics Gd1−xEuxNb1−yTayO4 where y = 0, 0.7, 1 and x = 0.01, 0.2, 0.4. Their mechanical properties have been studied; strength characteristics (Young’s modulus, microhardness) and critical stress intensity factor for mode I KIC have been estimated. The compositions and modes for producing ceramics with optimal mechanical properties have been determined. The photoluminescence (PL) has been studied in ceramic solid solutions in the visible range upon excitation by near UV (376 nm). The features of energy transfer between the host of ceramic GdNb1−yTayO4:Eu solid solution (y = 0; 0.7; 1) and 4fn-4fn levels of Eu in concentrations x = 0.01, 0.2 and 0.4 have been established. We have established that concentration quenching of PL in single-phase ceramics Gd1−xEuxNbO4 occurs above Eu concentration x > 0.01 and in ceramics Gd1−xEuxTaO4—at Eu concentration x > 0.2. The sample with the composition Gd0.99Eu0.01NbO4 demonstrated the maximal PL intensity among all other studied samples. The least PL intensity is observed in Gd0.99Eu0.01Nb0.3Ta0.7O4 relative to individual compounds of gadolinium niobates and tantalates, activated with Eu in the same concentration x = 0.01. The significant difference in Stark splitting of levels has been shown for solid solutions based on niobium (Gd1−xEuxNbO4) and tantalum (Gd1−xEuxTaO4). The compositions of ceramic GdNb1−yTayO4:Eu solid solution have been established which have maximum luminance. We have determined that the luminance of some of the studied samples exceeded the luminance of an industrial phosphor based on Y2O3:Eu3+."
Combination of ligand‑based and structure‑based virtual screening for the discovery of novel Janus kinase 2 inhibitors against philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms,"The activating V617F mutation in Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) has been shown to be the major cause for classic Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Thus, the development of pharmacologic JAK2 inhibitors is an essential move in combating MPNs. In this study, screening methods examining both ligands and their structures were developed to discover novel JAK2 inhibitors from the ChemDiv database with virtual screening identifying 886 candidate inhibitors. Next, these compounds were further filtered using ADMET, drug likeliness, and PAINS filtering, which reduced the compound number even further. This consolidated list of candidate compounds (n = 49) was then evaluated biologically at molecular level and the highest performing inhibitor with a novel scaffold was selected for further examination. This candidate inhibitor, CD4, was then subjected to molecular dynamics studies, with complex stability, root-mean-square deviation, radius of gyration, binding free energy, and binding properties all examined. The result suggested that CD4 interacts with JAK2 and that the CD4-JAK2 complex is stable. This study was able to identify a candidate inhibitor that warrants further examination and optimization and may potentially serve as a future MPN treatment."
Genetic Polymorphisms of COL1A1 Promoter Region (rs1800012) and TGFB1 Signal Peptide (rs1800471): Role in Cervical Insufficiency Susceptibility?,"A structural or functional cervix problem prevents a woman from carrying a full-term pregnancy, which leads to the disease known as cervical insufficiency. Cervical insufficiency is partially inherited, and in certain situations, variations in genes related to connective tissue metabolism may be involved. The main objective of this investigation was to describe the collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1) gene rs1800012 polymorphism and the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) gene rs1800471 polymorphism in a cohort of patients suffering from cervical insufficiency. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assays have been used to analyze the DNAs of 93 patients with cervical insufficiency and 103 healthy controls. The chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. There were significant differences in the genotype frequencies of the COL1A1 gene rs1800012 (G > T) and TGFB1 gene rs1800471 (G > C) polymorphisms between the patient and the control groups (p = 0.049 and p = 0.049, respectively). Also, the C allele of the TGFB1 rs1800471 polymorphism was significantly higher in the patient group than the control group (p = 0.016). Following clinical assessment, the COL1A1 rs1800012 polymorphism was found to be connected to the history of cerclage (p = 0.010). Additionally, the frequency of the TT/GG composite genotype of COL1A1 rs1800012/TGFB1 rs1800471 polymorphisms was significantly lower in the patient group than the control group (p = 0.049). The TT genotype of COL1A1 rs1800012 polymorphism was found to be protective against cervical insufficiency, while the C allele of TGFB1 rs1800471 polymorphism was found to predispose to the disease. It appears that the TT/GG composite genotype of COL1A1 rs1800012/TGFB1 rs1800471 polymorphisms protects against cervical insufficiency."
Combining PCT with CRP is better than separate testing for patients with bacteriuria in the intensive care unit: a retrospective study,"Previous studies on PCT for urinary tract infections (UTI) have focused primarily on minors.

Team Factors in Ethical Decision Making: A Content Analysis of Interviews with Scientists and Engineers,"The ethical decision making of researchers has historically been studied from an individualistic perspective. However, researchers rarely work alone, and they typically experience ethical dilemmas in a team context. In this mixed-methods study, 67 scientists and engineers working at a public R1 (very high research activity) university in the United States responded to a survey that asked whether they had experienced or observed an ethical dilemma while working in a research team. Among these, 30 respondents agreed to be interviewed about their experiences using a think-aloud protocol. A total of 40 unique ethical incidents were collected across these interviews. Qualitative data from interview transcripts were then systematically content-analyzed by multiple independent judges to quantify the overall ethicality of team decisions as well as several team characteristics, decision processes, and situational factors. The results demonstrated that team formalistic orientation, ethical championing, and the use of ethical decision strategies were all positively related to the overall ethicality of team decisions. Additionally, the relationship between ethical championing and overall team decision ethicality was moderated by psychological safety and moral intensity. Implications for future research and practice are discussed."
Examining the Measurement Invariance of the Revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory Among Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White College Women in the U.S.,"The Revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI-R) is a widely used measure in research, yet the invariance of this measure has not been established in English speaking Non-Hispanic White (NHW) and Hispanic/Latine populations. This study examined whether the SOI-R, a measure developed in Germany, was invariant between US Hispanic/Latina (N = 208) and NHW (N = 190) undergraduate women. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to assess model fit in the Hispanic/Latina and NHW samples and fit of increasingly restrictive models was used to test configural, metric, scalar, and residual invariance of the models in both samples. CFA results revealed that data from both the Hispanic/Latina and NHW groups fit the model adequately in this sample, which consisted of highly acculturated Hispanic/Latina college women. Tests of measurement invariance found that the SOI-R was invariant across Hispanic/Latina and NHW college women. However, questions about the development of the SOI-R and the underlying assumptions made during the course of its development might be considered prior to the use of the measure in research, and further invariance testing should be conducted in future work with less acculturated Hispanic/Latine populations."
Ultralow radiant exposure of a short-pulsed laser to disrupt melanosomes with localized thermal damage through a turbid medium,"Short-pulsed lasers can treat dermal pigmented lesions through selective photothermolysis. The irradiated light experiences multiple scattering by the skin and is absorbed by abnormal melanosomes as well as by normal blood vessels above the target. Because the fluence is extremely high, the absorbed light can cause thermal damage to the adjacent tissue components, leading to complications. To minimize radiant exposure and reduce the risk of burns, a model of the melanosome-disruption threshold fluence (MDTF) has been developed that accounts for the light-propagation efficiency in the skin. However, the light-propagation efficiency is attenuated because of multiple scattering, which limits the extent to which the radiant exposure required for treatment can be reduced. Here, this study demonstrates the principle of melanosome disruption with localized thermal damage through a turbid medium by ultralow radiant exposure of a short-pulsed laser. The MDTF model was combined with a wavefront-shaping technique to design an irradiation condition that can increase the light-propagation efficiency to the target. Under this irradiation condition, melanosomes were disrupted at a radiant exposure 25 times lower than the minimal value used in conventional laser treatments. Furthermore, almost no thermal damage to the skin was confirmed through a numerical simulation. These experimental and numerical results show the potential for noninvasive melanosome disruption and may lead to the improvement of the safety of short-pulsed laser treatment."
Role of Pyrophosphate Source for Improving Proton Conductivity and Stability of Sodium Dihydrogen Phosphate,"Solid acid composites of (1 – x)NaH2PO4/xCeP2O7 (x = 0.1–0.4) with different molar weight ratio of NaH2PO4 (SDP) and CeP2O7 were synthesized and characterized. The characterization of solid acid composites was carried out to determine the structures, thermal stability, and conductivity, utilizing X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA), and conductivity measurements. The electrolyte pellets of composite powder were prepared for the determination of ionic conductivity. The presence of CeP2O7 in the composite had a large impact on the conductivity measurements and increased the ionic conductivity of NaH2PO4. The thermal stability of the solid acid composites for dehydration, melting, and decomposition was investigated in the temperature range of 50 to 500°C under open atmospheric environments."
Elective splenectomy for hematological diseases: a vanishing indication,"Splenectomy has been used as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool in the management of hematological diseases for many years. However, the emergence of new medical therapies has modified guidelines for many hematological diseases for which splenectomy was previously considered. We aimed to evaluate the evidence of a decrease in the hematological indications for splenectomy and the reasons and justifications for this change."
Fluoride-ion enhanced the electrochemical surface texturing of Ti6Al4V alloy via in situ EDM and ECM with patterned tool,"This research paper presents an innovative approach to fabricating enhanced-quality hierarchical surface micro-textures on Ti6Al4V alloy by synergistically employing in situ electrical discharge machining (EDM) and electrochemical machining (ECM) processes. The hierarchical structure encompasses three levels: a primary level at a few hundred micrometers, a secondary level at a few tens of micrometers, and a ternary level at sub-micrometer scales. Despite the precision achieved in generating the primary-level texture through EDM using a chemically patterned tool, inherent thermal damages and surface defects, such as micro-craters and irregularities, pose challenges. Unlike usual ex situ chemical or electrochemical post-processing methods, this study introduces in situ ECM post-processing (ECM) with the same patterned tool. This approach enhances the quality of EDMed surfaces without compromising geometrical accuracy, offering anisotropic dissolution along the feature depth. To ensure geometrical accuracy, an experimentally validated finite element method-based transient numerical simulation model is developed. This model accurately predicts the evolution of the feature profile during the ECM operation. Furthermore, ECM with a fluoride ion–containing electrolyte introduces additional secondary and ternary levels of hierarchical textures. Fluoride ions play a pivotal role in augmenting material removal during ECM, particularly in areas around micro-crevices and pores, shaping the secondary-level texture."

Drive-by damage detection methodology for high-speed railway bridges using sparse autoencoders,"High-speed railway bridges are essential components of any railway transportation system that should keep adequate levels of serviceability and safety. In this context, drive-by methodologies have emerged as a feasible and cost-effective monitoring solution for detecting damage on railway bridges while minimizing train operation interruptions. Moreover, integrating advanced sensor technologies and machine learning algorithms has significantly enhanced structural health monitoring (SHM) for bridges. Despite being increasingly used in traditional SHM applications, studies using autoencoders within drive-by methodologies are rare, especially in the railway field. This study presents a novel approach for drive-by damage detection in HSR bridges. The methodology relies on acceleration records collected from multiple bridge crossings by an operational train equipped with onboard sensors. Log-Mel spectrogram features derived from the acceleration records are used together with sparse autoencoders for computing statistical distribution-based damage indexes. Numerical simulations were performed on a 3D vehicle–track–bridge interaction system model implemented in Matlab to evaluate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach, considering several damage scenarios, vehicle speeds, and environmental and operational variations, such as multiple track irregularities and varying measurement noise. The results show that the proposed approach can successfully detect damages, as well as characterize their severity, especially for very early-stage damages. This demonstrates the high potential of applying Mel-frequency damage-sensitive features associated with machine learning algorithms in the drive-by condition assessment of high-speed railway bridges."
An innovative model for coupled fermion-antifermion pairs,"Understanding the behavior of fermion-antifermion (\(f\overline{f}\)) pairs is crucial in modern physics. These systems, governed by fundamental forces, exhibit complex interactions essential for particle physics, high-energy physics, nuclear physics, and solid-state physics. This study introduces a novel theoretical model using the many-body Dirac equation for \(f\overline{f}\) pairs with an effective position-dependent mass (i.e., \(m \rightarrow m + \mathcal {S}(r)\)) under the influence of an external magnetic field. To validate our model, we show that by modifying the mass with a Coulomb-like potential, \(m(r) = m - \alpha /r\), where \(-\alpha /r\) is the Lorentz scalar potential \(\mathcal {S}(r)\), our results match the well-established energy eigenvalues for \(f\overline{f}\) pairs interacting through the Coulomb potential, without approximation. By applying adjustments based on the Cornell potential (i.e., \(\mathcal {S}(r) = kr - \alpha /r\)), we derive a closed-form energy expression. We believe this unique model offers significant insights into the dynamics of \(f\overline{f}\) pairs under various interaction potentials, with potential applications in particle physics. Additionally, it could be extended to various \(f\overline{f}\) systems, such as positronium, relativistic Landau levels for neutral mesons, excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, and Weyl pairs in monolayer graphene sheets."
The Camino de Santiago as a ‘Spiritual Journey’: A Contemporary Challenge to Religion?,"According to many surveys, the pilgrimage along the Way of St James (Camino de. Santiago) can lead to spiritual benefits, but there is some disagreement about this because these benefits can be associated with the pilgrim's motivation. This article presents a conceptual framework for understanding the phenomenon of pilgrimages to Compostela and their impact on human spiritual well-being. Many diaries mention various positive psychological effects from these trips, but they are presented in religious/spiritual dialectical tension. The article presents the classical concept of spirituality as related to the ability to transcend, and then classifies what is spiritual in the writings of some Polish pilgrims. In this way, conceptual precision will be offered, which is important for understanding the positive impact of pilgrimages on well-being and empowerment."
Polymyxin resistance in Enterobacter cloacae complex in Brazil: phenotypic and molecular characterization,"Enterobacter cloacae complex isolates have been reported as an important nosocomial multidrug resistance pathogen. In the present study, we investigated antimicrobial susceptibility and the colistin-resistance rates, their genetic determinants and clonality among clinical E. cloacae complex isolates from different Brazilian states. For this, an initial screening was carried out on 94 clinical isolates of E. clocacae complex received between 2016 and 2018 by LAPIH—FIOCRUZ, using EMB plates containing 4 μg/mL of colistin, followed MIC determination, resulting in the selection of 26 colistin-resistant isolates from the complex. The presence of carbapenemases encoding genes (blaKPC, blaNDM and blaOXA-48), plasmidial genes for resistance to polymyxins (mcr1-9) and mutations in chromosomal genes (pmrA, pmrB, phoP and phoQ) described as associated with resistance to polymyxin were screened by PCR and DNA sequencing. Finally, the hsp60 gene was sequenced to identify species of the E. cloacae complex and genetic diversity was evaluated by PFGE and MLST. The results have shown that among 94 E. cloacae complex isolates, 19 (20.2%) were colistin-resistant. The resistant strains exhibited MIC ranging from 4 to 128 µg / mL and E. hormaechei subsp. steigerwaltii was the prevalent species in the complex (31,6%), followed by E. cloacae subsp. cloacae (26,3%). The antimicrobials with the highest susceptibility rate were gentamicin (21%) and tigecycline (26%). Carbapenemases encoding genes (blaKPC n = 5, blaNDM n = 1) were detected in 6 isolates and mcr-9 in one. Among the modifications found in PmrA, PmrB, PhoP e PhoQ (two-component regulatory system), only the S175I substitution in PmrB found in E. cloacae subsp cloacae isolates were considered deleterious (according to the prediction of PROVEAN). By PFGE, 13 profiles were found among E. cloacae complex isolates, with EcD the most frequent. Furthermore, by MLST 10 ST’s, and 1 new ST, were identified in E. cloacae. In conclusion, no prevalence of clones or association among carbapenemase production and polymyxin resistance was found between the E. cloacae. Thereby, the results suggest that the increased polymyxin-resistance is related to the selective pressure exerted by the indiscriminate use in hospitals. Lastly, this study highlights the urgent need to elucidate the mechanism involved in the resistance to polymyxin in the E. cloacae complex and the development of measures to control and prevent infections caused by these multiresistant bacteria."
Numerical simulation of cable sheath damage detection based on torsional mode guided wave,"In view of the cracking, sag, and damage of sheath caused by the load effect and external force impact of power cable, the echo parameters of cable sheath damage detection based on the characteristics of torsional guided wave propagation are studied in this work. According to the Navier displacement equilibrium equation, the dispersion curve of a magnetostrictive guided wave of the cable sheath was solved, and the T(0,1) mode with a group velocity of 1198.8 m/s and no dispersion was selected. Furthermore, while considering the excitation frequency, loss rate, and direction of the damaged section, the displacement field and the echo characteristic parameters of guided wave in the cable sheath were solved. Moreover, by analyzing the time-domain signals of damaged section echo, the cubic fitting function for the loss rate of the damaged section and the damaged section echo coefficient were obtained, which can effectively characterize the quantitative relationship between the damaged location, size, and guided wave echo of the cable sheath."

Grain yield performance of spring maize under different agroecological zones,"Maize is an important cereal crop which ranks second in production after rice in Nepal with an increasing demand for livestock and poultry ration but declining in production. This experiment was conducted to screen top- and stable yielding maize hybrids in various agroecological zones of Nepal during the spring season. In this study, nine maize genotypes were evaluated across six environments in randomized complete block design with three replications. The additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) ANOVA revealed that environment, genotype, and their interaction had a substantial effect on the grain yield and all five principal components (PCs) were significantly different (P < 0.0001). AMMI stability value revealed that genotypes Rampur composite and Kanchan 101 were the most stable genotypes in all environments. The specific adaptation of genotype as explained by Which-won-where model suggest that Godavari in environment E2, Rajkumar in E4 and E5, and Bisco gold 941 in E1, E3 and E6 were the winning genotypes. Furthermore, the mean-versus-stability model revealed that genotype Kanchan 101 had above average yield with greater stability. In addition, biplot analysis revealed that 78.32% of variation is explained by PC1 and 11.41% by PC2 of the interaction effect. The genotype ranking based on revealed that genotype Kanchan 101 was close to the ideal line and Sano ghogha was at the greatest distance. Conclusively, AMMI and genotype and genotype by environment interaction (GGE) model explicates that genotype Kanchan 101 has both the high yield and stability across all agroecological zones. In future research on multi-year trial with emphasis other agronomic traits to assess the stability and priorities for the development of package of practices for maximizing the grain yield is recommended."
DNA concentrations in amniotic fluid according to gestational age and fetal sex: data from 2573 samples,"In some cases of prenatal genetic testing, an ample amount of fetal DNA is needed, to allow for parallel testing (conducting several genetic tests simultaneously). This study investigated the association between amniotic fluid DNA concentration and various factors. We aimed to define the required amount of amniotic fluid to be extracted in amniocentesis, to allow parallel testing throughout gestational weeks."
Batch-transformer for scene text image super-resolution,"Recognizing low-resolution text images is challenging as they often lose their detailed information, leading to poor recognition accuracy. Moreover, the traditional methods, based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are not effective enough for some low-resolution text images with dense characters. In this paper, a novel CNN-based batch-transformer network for scene text image super-resolution (BT-STISR) method is proposed to address this problem. In order to obtain the text information for text reconstruction, a pre-trained text prior module is employed to extract text information. Then a novel two pipeline batch-transformer-based module is proposed, leveraging self-attention and global attention mechanisms to exert the guidance of text prior to the text reconstruction process. Experimental study on a benchmark dataset TextZoom shows that the proposed method BT-STISR achieves the best state-of-the-art performance in terms of structural similarity (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metrics compared to some latest methods."
Fluoride-ion enhanced the electrochemical surface texturing of Ti6Al4V alloy via in situ EDM and ECM with patterned tool,"This research paper presents an innovative approach to fabricating enhanced-quality hierarchical surface micro-textures on Ti6Al4V alloy by synergistically employing in situ electrical discharge machining (EDM) and electrochemical machining (ECM) processes. The hierarchical structure encompasses three levels: a primary level at a few hundred micrometers, a secondary level at a few tens of micrometers, and a ternary level at sub-micrometer scales. Despite the precision achieved in generating the primary-level texture through EDM using a chemically patterned tool, inherent thermal damages and surface defects, such as micro-craters and irregularities, pose challenges. Unlike usual ex situ chemical or electrochemical post-processing methods, this study introduces in situ ECM post-processing (ECM) with the same patterned tool. This approach enhances the quality of EDMed surfaces without compromising geometrical accuracy, offering anisotropic dissolution along the feature depth. To ensure geometrical accuracy, an experimentally validated finite element method-based transient numerical simulation model is developed. This model accurately predicts the evolution of the feature profile during the ECM operation. Furthermore, ECM with a fluoride ion–containing electrolyte introduces additional secondary and ternary levels of hierarchical textures. Fluoride ions play a pivotal role in augmenting material removal during ECM, particularly in areas around micro-crevices and pores, shaping the secondary-level texture."
Combination of bacteriophages and vancomycin in a co-delivery hydrogel for localized treatment of fracture-related infections,"Fracture-related infections (FRIs), particularly those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are challenging to treat. This study designed and evaluated a hydrogel loaded with a cocktail of bacteriophages and vancomycin (1.2 mg/mL). The co-delivery hydrogel showed 99.72% reduction in MRSA biofilm in vitro. The hydrogel released 54% of phages and 82% of vancomycin within 72 h and maintained activity for eight days, in vivo the co-delivery hydrogel with systemic antibiotic significantly reduced bacterial load by 0.99 log10 CFU compared to controls, with active phages detected in tissues at euthanasia (2 × 103 PFU/mL). No phage resistance was detected in the phage treatment groups, and serum neutralization resulted in only a 20% reduction in phage count. In this work, we show that a phage-antibiotic co-delivery system via CMC hydrogel is a promising adjunct to systemic antibiotic therapy for MRSA-induced FRI, highlighting its potential for localized, sustained delivery and improved treatment outcomes."
Systematic Study of Liquid-State Interfacial Reactions Between Co and In-Sn Solders with Varying Sn Contents,"This study investigated the interfacial reactions between Co and In-Sn solders, with various compositions, up to 90 at% Sn, at 350°C, with the aim of evaluating their potential for use in the solid–liquid interdiffusion (SLID) process. The results demonstrated that the reaction phases formed at the interfaces exhibited significant variations depending on the Sn content present in the In-Sn solders. For Sn content below 2 at%, the reaction phase was CoIn3. Notably, the CoIn3 in the In-2 at% Sn/Co reaction exhibited a linear growth at a rate of ~ 15 μm/h, which was significantly higher compared to the In/Co reaction. The accelerated growth rate could be attributed to the minor addition of Sn, which facilitated both the nucleation and growth of CoIn3. With an increase in Sn content to 2.5–3.5 at%, the dominant reaction phase shifted to Co(In,Sn)2, but its growth was significantly hindered. With a further increase in Sn content within the range of 4–35 at%, the irregular Co(Sn,In) phase became dominant. However, as the Sn content exceeded 36 at% and extended up to 90 at%, the Co(Sn,In)2 phase remained stable at the interface, and its growth decreased significantly with increasing Sn content. The observed shift in the reaction phases is closely related to the local phase equilibrium. The suggested phase diagram of Co-In-Sn system was proposed to further understand the relationship between interfacial reaction and phase equilibrium. The Sn content of In-Sn solders not only influenced the formed reaction phase but also the growth rates and microstructures. Careful control of Sn content is crucial for the SLID process of In-Sn/Co system."
Clinical characteristics and mortality of mucormycosis in hematological malignancies: a retrospective study in Eastern China,"Mucormycosis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological malignancies, but its characteristics are not fully understood. This study aimed to gain a better understanding of the clinical features of mucormycosis in patients with hematological malignancies in eastern China."
Modified Harris Hawks optimization for the 3E feasibility assessment of a hybrid renewable energy system,"The off-grid Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRES) demonstrate great potential to be sustainable and economically feasible options to meet the growing energy needs and counter the depletion of conventional energy sources. Therefore, it is crucial to optimize the size of HRES components to assess system cost and dependability. This paper presents the optimal sizing of HRES to provide a very cost-effective and efficient solution for supplying power to a rural region. This study develops a PV-Wind-Battery-DG system with an objective of 3E analysis which includes Energy, Economic, and Environmental CO2 emissions. Indispensable parameters like technical parameters (Loss of Power Supply Probability, Renewable factor, PV fraction, and Wind fraction) and social factor (Human Developing Index) are evaluated to show the proposed modified Harris Hawks Optimization (mHHO) algorithm’s merits over the existing algorithms. To achieve the objectives, the proposed mHHO algorithm uses nine distinct operators to obtain simultaneous optimization. Furthermore, the performance of mHHO is evaluated by using the CEC 2019 test suite and the most optimal mHHO is chosen for sizing and 3E analysis of HRES. The findings demonstrate that the mHHO has achieved optimized values for Cost of Energy (COE), Net Present Cost (NPC), and Annualized System Cost (ASC) with the lowest values being 0.14130 $/kWh, 1,649,900$, and 1,16,090$/year respectively. The reduction in COE value using the proposed mHHO approach is 0.49% in comparison with most of the other MH-algorithms. Additionally, the system primarily relies on renewable sources, with diesel usage accounting for only 0.03% of power generation. Overall, this study effectively addresses the challenge of performing a 3E analysis with mHHO algorithm which exhibits excellent convergence and is capable of producing high-quality outcomes in the design of HRES. The mHHO algorithm attains optimal economic efficiency while simultaneously minimizing the impact on the environment and maintaining a high human development index."
Authenticity in algorithm-aided decision-making,"I identify an undertheorized problem with decisions we make with the aid of algorithms: the problem of inauthenticity. When we make decisions with the aid of algorithms, we can make ones that go against our commitments and values in a normatively important way. In this paper, I present a framework for algorithm-aided decision-making that can lead to inauthenticity. I then construct a taxonomy of the features of the decision environment that make such outcomes likely, and I discuss three possible solutions to the problem."
Health hazards implication for household solid waste collectors of north city corporation in Dhaka: a post-COVID study,"Solid waste management has been one of the challenging tasks for the waste collectors at Dhaka North City corporations, especially during the post-COVID-19 period, since this task exposes several acute and chronic illnesses. The perilous implications of waste collection on the health condition of the waste collectors at the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) have often been ignored, and they have to work without adequate protective measures. Though different research has already been done regarding the occupational health hazards of waste collectors, the novelty of this study is that it considers the post-COVID period and focuses on the solid waste picker of DNCC. This study aimed to evaluate the current health hazards faced by DNCC household waste collectors and suggest remedial actions. A questionnaire-based survey (n = 415) assessed work environment, socio-economic status, and post-COVID-19 health hazard awareness through convenience sampling. Descriptive statistics, Pearson’s chi-square tests, and binary logistic regression were adopted to analyze the data. Descriptive statistics portray that 81.8% of waste pickers are not satisfied with their work environment. Additionally, 66% of solid waste collectors face health issues, and 58% of waste collectors are unaware of the risk of COVID-19. Pearson’s chi-square tests reveal that the health hazards of waste pickers are significantly associated with job type, working hours, Awareness of solid waste effect on health and severe suffering history. Additionally, the binary logistic regression model exposed job type, Awareness of solid waste effect on health, frequently suffered diseases, and severe suffering history has significant (p-value < 0.05) impact on the health hazard of a waste picker of DNCC. Regarding the policy implication, Dhaka North City Corporation must take immediate action that will significantly reduce the hazardous impacts of solid waste collection on the health of the waste collectors by supplying them with adequate protective measures."
Elective splenectomy for hematological diseases: a vanishing indication,"Splenectomy has been used as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool in the management of hematological diseases for many years. However, the emergence of new medical therapies has modified guidelines for many hematological diseases for which splenectomy was previously considered. We aimed to evaluate the evidence of a decrease in the hematological indications for splenectomy and the reasons and justifications for this change."
Chlorophyll fluorescence and sap flow in eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) in both the growing and nongrowing season in Kentucky,"Red cedar chlorophyll fluorescence remains high during the nongrowing season, while transpiration is reduced."
Synthesis and PASS-assisted evaluation of new heterocyclic compounds containing hydroquinoline scaffolds,"Currently, there is a growing interest in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds containing hydroquinoline fragments. This surge can be attributed to the broad range of pharmaceutical and industrial applications that these compounds possess. In this study, the synthesis of both linear and fused heterocyclic systems that incorporate hydroquinoline fragments was described. Furthermore, the pharmacological activity spectra of the synthesized compounds were predicted using the in silico method, employing the Prediction of Activity Spectra of Substances (PASS) program. Hydroquinolines containing the nitrile functionality 7 and 8 were synthesized through the reaction of the corresponding hydroquinolinecarbaldehyde 5a, 6b with hydroxylamine hydrochloride and iodine in aqueous ammonia under ambient conditions, respectively. 2-Phenyl-1,3-oxazol-5(4 H)-ones 9a, b and 10a, b were synthesized via the condensation of compounds 5a, b and 6a, b with hippuric acid in acetic acid in 30–60% yield. When the methyl activated 7-methylazolopyrimidines 11a, b were reacted with N-alkyl-2,2,4-trimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline-6-carbaldehydes 6a, b, 60–70% yield of triazolo/pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-6-yl carboxylic acids 12a, b were obtained. The condensation of 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline 3 h with dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) and ethyl acetoacetate afforded cyclic products 16 and 17, respectively. The condensation reaction of 6-formyl-7-hydroxy-1,2,2,4-tetramethyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline 5e with methylene-active compounds such as ethyl cyanoacetate/dimethyl-3-oxopentanedioate/ethyl acetoacetate/diethylmalonate/Meldrum’s acid afforded 3-substituted coumarins 19 and 21 containing dihydroquinoline moiety. The pentacyclic coumarin 22 was obtained via the tandom condensation reaction of malononitrile with 5e in the presence of a catalytic amount of piperidine in ethanol. The biological activities of the synthesized compounds were predicted using the PASS program. Based on the prognosis, compounds 13a, b, and 14 exhibited a high likelihood of being active as inhibitors of gluconate 2-dehydrogenase, as well as possessing antiallergic, antiasthmatic, and antiarthritic properties, with a probability value (Pa) ranging from 0.849 to 0.870. Furthermore, it was discovered that compounds 7 and 8 tended to act as effective progesterone antagonists and displayed antiallergic, antiasthmatic, and antiarthritic effects (Pa = 0.276–0.827). Among the hydroquinolines containing coumarin moieties, compounds 17, 19a, and 19c were predicted to be potent progesterone antagonists, with Pa values of 0.710, 0.630, and 0.615, respectively."
Trends and outcomes in colorectal cancer surgery: a multicenter cross-sectional study of minimally invasive versus open techniques in Germany,"The objective of this study was to assess the trend from open to modern minimally invasive (laparoscopic and robot-assisted) surgical techniques for colorectal cancer (CRC) in Germany, with a particular focus on hospital mortality, postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay."
CTDSPL2 promotes the progression of non-small lung cancer through PI3K/AKT signaling via JAK1,"Carboxy-terminal domain small phosphatase like 2 (CTDSPL2), one of the haloacid dehalogenase phosphatases, is associated with several diseases including cancer. However, the role of CTDSPL2 and its regulatory mechanism in lung cancer remain unclear. Here, we aimed to explore the clinical implications, biological functions, and molecular mechanisms of CTDSPL2 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CTDSPL2 was identified as a novel target of the tumor suppressor miR-193a-3p. CTDSPL2 expression was significantly elevated in NSCLC tissues. Database analysis showed that CTDSPL2 expression was negatively correlated with patient survival. Depletion of CTDSPL2 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells, as well as tumor growth and metastasis in mouse models. Additionally, silencing of CTDSPL2 enhanced CD4+ T cell infiltration into tumors. Moreover, CTDSPL2 interacted with JAK1 and positively regulated JAK1 expression. Subsequent experiments indicated that CTDSPL2 activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway through the upregulation of JAK1, thereby promoting the progression of NSCLC. In conclusion, CTDSPL2 may play an oncogenic role in NSCLC progression by activating PI3K/AKT signaling via JAK1. These findings may provide a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC."
A randomized controlled clinical trial on multimodal prehabilitation in colorectal cancer patients to improve functional capacity: preliminary results,Major colorectal surgery is associated with 20 to 40% reduction in physiological and functional capacity and higher level of fatigue 6 to 8 weeks after surgery. The primary aim of this study was to analyse the effects of a multimodal prehabilitation program in colorectal cancer patients to improve functional capacity. The secondary outcome was to evaluate postoperative complications and length of postoperative hospital stay as well as to determine the costs of implementation and indirect costs.
The effect of hydrogen peroxide and subsequent resveratrol application to CAD–CAM blocks on the cell viability of fibroblasts,"The aim is to assess viability of fibroblasts exposed to 2 CAD–CAM blocks and a nanohybrid resin after application of hydrogen peroxide (HP) and resveratrol with 2 extraction media at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Eighteen specimens were obtained from Lava Ultimate (LU), Vita Enamic (VE), and Grandio (GR). Specimens of each material were divided into 3 groups (material only, bleached, resveratrol applied) for 2 extraction media as artificial saliva (AS) and phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (n = 3). For bleached group, 40% HP was applied to specimens for 20 min twice. For resveratrol group, 0.5 µM resveratrol was applied after bleaching for 10 min. Mouse fibroblast cells were exposed to extracts of each group. The viability of cells was determined with MTT assay at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Cell viability data (%) were analyzed statistically using one-way ANOVA, and post hoc Tukey test. Bleached materials showed the lowest cell viability (PBS; p < 0.01/ AS; p < 0.001). There is no statistically significant difference between resveratrol applied and bleached groups (PBS; p = 0.14/ AS; p = 0.072). Regardless of period of time and procedure, GR showed lower viable cell numbers than LU and VE (p < 0.001). Viable cell numbers were higher at 24 h than at 72 h (p < 0.001). There was no statistically difference between AS and PBS (p > 0.05). For all materials, the application of resveratrol did not affect the cell viability which decreased after bleaching over time. The decrease in nanohybrid resin was more critical than hybrid CAD–CAM blocks. The type of extraction media had no effect on cell viability results."

Construction of an Artificial Neural Network for Solving the Incompressible Navier–Stokes Equations,"The tasks of analyzing and visualizing the dynamics of viscous incompressible flows of complex geometry based on traditional grid and projection methods are associated with significant requirements for computer performance necessary to achieve the set goals. To reduce the computational load in solving this class of problems, it is possible to apply algorithms for constructing artificial neural networks (ANNs) using exact solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations on a given set of spatial regions as training sets. An ANN is implemented to construct flows in regions that are complexes made up of training sets of standard axisymmetric domains (cylinders, balls, etc.). To reduce the amount of calculations in the case of 3D problems, invariant flow manifolds of lower dimensions are used. This makes it possible to identify the structure of solutions in detail. It is established that typical invariant regions of such flows are figures of rotation, in particular, ones homeomorphic to the torus, which form the structure of a topological bundle, for example, in a ball, cylinder, and general complexes composed of such figures. The structures of flows obtained by approximation based on the simplest 3D unsteady vortex flows are investigated. Classes of exact solutions of the incompressible Navier–Stokes system in bounded regions of \({{\mathbb{R}}_{3}}\) are distinguished based on the superposition of the above-mentioned topological bundles. Comparative numerical experiments suggest that the application of the proposed class of ANNs can significantly speed up the computations, which allows the use of low-performance computers."
A hybrid approach for efficient feature selection in anomaly intrusion detection for IoT networks,"The exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices underscores the need for robust security measures against cyber-attacks. Extensive research in the IoT security community has centered on effective traffic detection models, with a particular focus on anomaly intrusion detection systems (AIDS). This paper specifically addresses the preprocessing stage for IoT datasets and feature selection approaches to reduce the complexity of the data. The goal is to develop an efficient AIDS that strikes a balance between high accuracy and low detection time. To achieve this goal, we propose a hybrid feature selection approach that combines filter and wrapper methods. This approach is integrated into a two-level anomaly intrusion detection system. At level 1, our approach classifies network packets into normal or attack, with level 2 further classifying the attack to determine its specific category. One critical aspect we consider is the imbalance in these datasets, which is addressed using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). To evaluate how the selected features affect the performance of the machine learning model across different algorithms, namely Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbor, we employ benchmark datasets: BoT-IoT, TON-IoT, and CIC-DDoS2019. Evaluation metrics encompass detection accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results indicate that the decision tree achieves high detection accuracy, ranging between 99.82 and 100%, with short detection times ranging between 0.02 and 0.15 s, outperforming existing AIDS architectures for IoT networks and establishing its superiority in achieving both accuracy and efficient detection times."
Quenched disorder and instability control dynamic fracture in three dimensions,"Materials failure in 3D still poses basic challenges. We study 3D brittle crack dynamics using a phase-field approach, where Gaussian quenched disorder in the fracture energy is incorporated. Disorder is characterized by a correlation length R and strength σ. We find that the mean crack velocity v is bounded by a limiting velocity, which is smaller than the homogeneous material’s prediction and decreases with σ. It emerges from a dynamic renormalization of the fracture energy with increasing crack driving force G, resembling a critical point, due to an interplay between a 2D branching instability and disorder. At small G, the probability of localized branching on a scale R is super-exponentially small. With increasing G, this probability quickly increases, leading to misty fracture surfaces, yet the associated extra dissipation remains small. As G is further increased, branching-related lengthscales become dynamic and persistently increase, leading to hackle-like structures and a macroscopic contribution to the fracture surface. The latter dynamically renormalizes the actual fracture energy until, eventually, any increase in G is balanced by extra fracture surface, with no accompanying increase in v. Finally, branching width reaches the system’s thickness such that 2D symmetry is statistically restored. Our findings are consistent with a broad range of experimental observations."
Secure multi-party computation with legally-enforceable fairness,"Fairness is a security notion of secure computation and cannot always be achieved if an adversary corrupts a majority of parties in standard settings. Lindell (CT-RSA 2008) showed that imposing a monetary penalty on an adversary can circumvent the impossibility. He formalized such a security notion as “legally enforceable fairness"" for the two-party setting based on the ideal trusted bank functionality and showed a protocol achieving the requirements. Based on the same framework, we introduce secure multi-party computation with legally enforceable fairness that is applicable for an arbitrary number of parties. Further, we propose two protocols that realize our introduced functionality. The first one achieves O(n) rounds and \(O(n \alpha )\) fees, where n is the number of parties, and \(\alpha \) is a parameter for the penalty amount. The fee refers to the balance amount in the bank required at the beginning of the protocol, which evaluates the difficulty of participating in the protocol in a financial sense. The second one achieves O(1) rounds and \(O(n^2 \alpha )\) fees."
Structural and enhanced dielectric properties of Li-doped BT elaborated by the sol-gel method,"In this paper, we studied the effect of lithium doping on the structural, microstructural, dielectric, and electrical properties of Ba1-xLixTiO3-δ (BTLx) ceramics prepared via the sol-gel method, with x = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.09. The results obtained from Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy show that all the samples crystallize in the tetragonal phase. Dielectric measurements show that increasing the lithium doping rate results in lower dielectric losses (from 0.04 for x = 0 to 0.008 for x = 0.09 at room temperature) and lower transition temperature Tm for compositions with x ≤ 0.07. The phase transition diffusivity parameter γ varies between 1 and 1.39, showing that our samples exhibit a diffuse phase transition but far from relaxor behavior. Complex impedance spectroscopy indicates that the grain boundary resistance of the materials is predominant in the electrical behavior of the materials. The activation energy Ea was calculated at 10 kHz by linear fitting of the temperature dependence of conductivity using the Arrhenius formula. The obtained values indicate that conduction for compositions with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.05 occurs through free electrons originating from the ionization of oxygen vacancies, while for the compositions with x = 0.07 and 0.09, the predominant conduction mechanism is ionic conduction."
Fatigue life of laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) AlSi10Mg alloy: effects of surface roughness and porosity,"The fatigue life of components manufactured by the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) process is dominated by the presence of defects, such as surface roughness and internal porosity. The present study focuses on the relative effect of surface roughness and porosity in determining the fatigue properties of AlSi10Mg alloy produced by L-PBF process built in the Z-direction for the as-built (AB), machined (M) and machined & polished (M&P) conditions. As-built L-PBF samples possess higher average surface roughness, Ra (1.5–2 µm) compared to that of the machined (0.8–1.0 µm) or polished ones (0.3–0.75 µm). For similar loading conditions, the machined or machined & polished samples have a longer fatigue life than those of the as-built samples. For the as-built samples, surface roughness was found to be the dominant factor affecting fatigue life. However, for a small variation of roughness, particularly for machined or machined & polished samples, the subsurface porosity becomes the dominant factor affecting fatigue failure. Besides, the pore size and location effects are analysed using linear elastic fracture mechanics, and these are found to have a higher effect on fatigue failure than overall porosity. Based on the results of X-ray computer tomography (XCT) and fracture surface characterisation, the critical stress intensity factors (KIC) for L-PBF AlSi10Mg alloy samples are estimated. In addition to this, the calculated critical stress intensity factors are used to predict the fatigue life by developing an empirical formula. The result from this empirical relationship is found to match closely with the experimentally determined fatigue life. This suggests that fatigue life can be predicted based on XCT images of machined samples. The findings can help minimize detrimental effects of defects by optimising mechanical or structural designs in attaining the desired structural integrity and durability."
Investigating the tensile properties and crystallinity of 3D-printed poly (ether ether ketone)/poly (ether imide) [PEEK/PEI] blend in the Z-direction by fused filament fabrication,"The present study focuses on the evaluation of the effect of nozzle temperature, print speed and layer thickness printing parameters of additively manufactured poly (ether ether ketone)/poly (ether imide) [PEEK/PEI] blend using the fused filament fabrication (FFF) process. Various characterization techniques were employed to investigate printed samples' crystallinity and morphological and mechanical characteristics. These methods included scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mechanical tests. Additionally, the thermal characteristics of the specimens were evaluated through the use of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Optimum printing settings were attained at 400 °C nozzle temperature, 40 mm·s−1 print speed, and a 0.10 mm layer height. The PEEK/PEI samples underwent annealing at 200 °C for a duration of 2 h to eliminate any residual thermal stress that may have arisen during the printing process. The annealing treatment resulted in enhanced elastic modulus and tensile strength of the samples. Moreover, the degree of crystallinity (\({X}_{c})\) exhibited a notable increase of 26%, associated with an increase of 13.4 °C in the glass transition temperature (Tg)."
Advanced 3D-DXA insights into bone density changes in hyperparathyroidism,"Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a disorder marked by chronic parathyroid hormone hypersecretion, which affects bone turnover and remodelling processes. With a loss of bone density and an increase in bone porosity, the cortical compartment is most severely impacted. The study's goal is to assess PHPT's effects on the volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) of the femur's trabecular compartment as well as the vBMD and thickness of the cortical bone."
Graph neural network-based attention mechanism to classify spam review over heterogeneous social networks,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) models, a current machine learning hotspot, have increasingly started to be applied in fraud detection in conjunction with user reviews in recent years. The accessible material is complicated and varied, the aggregated user evaluations cover a diverse range of topics, and erroneous information among vast amounts of user-generated content is typically rare. The review system is modeled as a heterogeneous network to address the issue of feature heterogeneity and uneven data distribution, and a new social theory-based graphical neural network model (SGNN) is suggested. The rich user behavior information in the heterogeneous network may be fully leveraged to acquire richer semantic representations for comments by integrating the hierarchical attention structure. Under the ensemble learning bagging framework, various distinct SGNN sub-models are combined. The sampling technique realizes the diversity aggregation of the base learners, which reduces the loss of useful information and improves the ability to identify bogus comments. According to testing results on real datasets from Amazon and YelpChi, the SGNN approach provides strong anomaly detection performance. It is demonstrated that the SGNN process has good robustness against fraudulent entities in the use of skewed distribution of data categories when compared to the existing approach."
Serum and urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 as markers of inflammation and renal damage in dogs with naturally occurring leishmaniosis,"Renal disease in canine leishmaniosis is of great importance owing to increased risk of mortality. In human visceral leishmaniosis, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) has been used as a marker of renal damage and inflammation. The purpose of this study was first to determine the serum MCP-1 and urinary MCP-1-to-creatinine ratio (uMCP-1/Cr) in healthy dogs and dogs with leishmaniosis at diagnosis, and second to determine whether these markers can differentiate disease severity at diagnosis."
Sequencing-based study of neural induction of human dental pulp stem cells,"Techniques for triggering neural differentiation of embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells into neural stem cells and neurons have been established. However, neural induction of mesenchymal stem cells, including dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), has been assessed primarily based on neural-related gene regulation, and detailed studies into the characteristics and differentiation status of cells are lacking. Therefore, this study was aimed at evaluating the cellular components and differentiation pathways of neural lineage cells obtained via neural induction of human DPSCs. Human DPSCs were induced to neural cells in monolayer culture and examined for gene expression and mechanisms underlying differentiation using microarray-based ingenuity pathway analysis. In addition, the neural lineage cells were subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to classify cell populations based on gene expression profiles and to elucidate their differentiation pathways. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that genes exhibiting marked overexpression, post-neuronal induction, such as FABP7 and ZIC1, were associated with neurogenesis. Furthermore, in canonical pathway analysis, axon guidance signals demonstrated maximum activation. The scRNA-seq and cell type annotations revealed the presence of neural progenitor cells, astrocytes, neurons, and a small number of non-neural lineage cells. Moreover, trajectory and pseudotime analyses demonstrated that the neural progenitor cells initially engendered neurons, which subsequently differentiated into astrocytes. This result indicates that the aforementioned neural induction strategy generated neural stem/progenitor cells from DPSCs, which might differentiate and proliferate to constitute neural lineage cells. Therefore, neural induction of DPSCs may present an alternative approach to pluripotent stem cell-based therapeutic interventions for nervous system disorders."
HASCH - A high-throughput amplicon-based SNP-platform for medicinal cannabis and industrial hemp genotyping applications,"Cannabis sativa is seeing a global resurgence as a food, fiber and medicinal crop for industrial hemp and medicinal Cannabis industries respectively. However, a widespread moratorium on the use and research of C. sativa throughout most of the 20th century has seen the development of improved cultivars for specific end uses lag behind that of conventional crops. While C. sativa research and development has seen significant investments in the recent past, resulting in a suite of publicly available genomic resources and tools, a versatile and cost-effective mid-density genotyping platform for applied purposes in breeding and pre-breeding is lacking. Here we report on a first mid-density fixed-target SNP platform for C. sativa."
Numerical and optimization modeling of dual-fuel natural gas–diesel engine at the idle load,"In this article, the modeling and optimization of a dual-fuel diesel engine with the combination of South Pars Refinery gas have been discussed at the idle load. First, using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, the modeling has been validated with experimental data, and the results of the present numerical solution are in acceptable agreement with the experimental data. In order to optimization, the considered objective functions include minimum NOx emission, maximum power generation, and minimum fuel consumption. Optimization variables include start of injection (SOI) time, the mass fraction of mean natural gas (YNG), and inlet air pressure (Pi). The number of tests required by the response surface method for the intervals 5 < SOI < 25 before top dead center (BTDC) crank angle (CA), mass fraction 0.02 < YNG < 0.04, and 0.75 < Pi < 1.75 (bar) are considered with 20 numerical solutions using the CFD method. The objective functions are set with confidence 95% that has been calculated. In the following, using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm method, the objective functions are optimized and the Pareto front is displayed. In addition, by using TOPSIS, the optimal point has been obtained at SOI = 10 BTDC (CA), YNG = 0.02, and Pi = 1.6 (bar). Also, in optimal conditions for three revolutions of 850, 1000, and 1250 rpm, the thermal, fluid, and performance parameters of the engine have been compared."
Molecular Characterisation and Dynamics of the Fusion Protein of an Emerging Genotype VIIi of Newcastle Disease Virus,"The viral strains of the Newcastle disease virus have exhibited genetic and pathogenic diversity since their discovery, which is mainly influenced by mutations in the Fusion gene. This study focussed on describing the circulating Newcastle disease virus strain based on the Fusion gene sequencing of three isolates: JKND01, JKND02, and JKND03, which were isolated from commercial poultry in Kashmir. Phylogenetic analysis identified the isolates as Genotype VIIi with the virulent fusion cleavage site motif (113RQKRF117). Homology analysis of amino acid sequences identified amino acid substitutions in the Fusion protein of the isolates compared to the reference strains. In silico mutational analysis revealed that the amino acid changes impact the structure of the protein, potentially affecting the functional behaviour of the virus. Moreover, predictive analysis of potential post-translational modification motifs showed a loss of an N-glycosylation site and the acquisition of a phosphorylation site in JKND02 compared to the reference Fusion glycoprotein. This study reports the first presence of the fifth panzootic vNDV genotype VIIi in Kashmir, highlighting the need for further epidemiological and surveillance studies to better understand the distribution and spread of the virus and to develop effective control measures."
Peaks and Distortions: Evaluation of Irregularities in Capillary Serum Protein Electrophoresis-An Institutional Experience of 980 Cases From Bihar,"Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) is an easy to perform technique encompassing a wide range of clinical applications ranging from inflammatory, renal, hepatic, neurological disorders as well as hematological malignancies like Plasma cell neoplasms. The objectives of the study are to explore various patterns of serum protein abnormalities in different medical diseases ranging from systemic disorders to hematological malignancies coming to our institute and to correlate these electrophoretic abnormalities with clinic-hematological and biochemical parameters. The present study was conducted in the Department of Hematology of a tertiary care institute over a period of 20 months. Altogether 980 samples were received for serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) in clinically indicated cases. Detailed clinical history, hematological and biochemical reports were compiled and analyzed with SPE reports. SPE was performed by Minicap Flex piercing fully automated capillary electrophoresis system from Sebia France and results were interpreted. In the present study, out of 980 cases 630 (64.3%) were males and 350 (35.7%) were females with a M: F ratio of 1.9:1. Most of the cases were in the age group of 51–60 years (n-285, 47.4%) followed by 41–50 years (n = 188, 27%). The most common indication for SPE was Chronic kidney disease (CKD) that accounted for 50% of all cases, followed by Plasma cell neoplasms (40%). Acute kidney injury (AKI), nephrotic syndrome (NS), peripheral neuropathy, and unexplained anemia were the other indications. Most common SPE pattern obtained on CZE was that of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia accounting to 316 of all cases (32.2%), closely followed by 292 cases of chronic inflammatory pattern (29.7%). Distortion in gamma region was seen in 14.7% cases (145/980). A distinct M spike was seen in 57 cases (5.8%) suggesting a diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy. A comprehensive look at all the protein fractions, their distortions and peaks along with clinico-biochemical and hematological correlation can help in reaching out to a correct diagnosis."
Palynological characterization of selected herbaceous plants in the lesser Himalaya of Azad Jammu and Kashmir,"This study provides taxonomic significance of palyno-morphology in context of identifying floral diversity and their pollen types in herbaceous plants of Lesser Himalayan region of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (Pakistan). The consideration of taxonomic correlations enhances the accuracy of plant identification and classification was crucial for biodiversity conservation and ecological research in this mountainous region. The current work was aims to explored the microscopic pollen grains morphological features using light and scanning electron microscopic tools. Microscopic research included 17 selected species belonging to different plant families that were collected, submitted to ISL Herbarium and then their pollen grains were acetolyzed. The most abundant pollen shape observed was oblate-spheroidal (six species) followed by sub-oblate (four species) and sub-prolate in three species. The maximum exine thickness was noted in Gerbera gossypoina (4.75 µm) and minimum in Allium jacequemongtii (2.00 µm). Mesocolpium distance was measured highest for Gerbera gossypina (18 µm) and lowest for Ageratum houstonianum (10.40 µm). Pollen exine wall stratification was examined of striate, reticulate, echinate regulate and perforate types. The highest pollen fertility was estimated for Plantago lenceolata (92%). The maximum P/E ratio index was calculated for Arabis alpina (1.30). This microscopic pollen bioimaging variations were analyzed using statistical clustering PAST 3 software that provided in-depth data variance. This study of herbaceous flora contributes to the pollination biology for the further systematic observation to fill the knowledge gaps for accurate identification by visualizing classical microscopic taxonomic characters."
Massive expansion of the pig gut virome based on global metagenomic mining,"The pig gut virome plays a vital role in the gut microbial ecosystem of pigs. However, a comprehensive understanding of their diversity and a reference database for the virome are currently lacking. To address this gap, we established a Pig Virome Database (PVD) that comprised of 5,566,804 viral contig sequences from 4650 publicly available gut metagenomic samples using a pipeline designated “metav”. By clustering sequences, we identified 48,299 viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) genomes of at least medium quality, of which 92.83% of which were not found in existing major databases. The majority of vOTUs were identified as Caudoviricetes (72.21%). The PVD database contained a total of 2,362,631 protein-coding genes across the above medium-quality vOTUs genomes that can be used to explore the functional potential of the pig gut virome. These findings highlight the extensive diversity of viruses in the pig gut and provide a pivotal reference dataset for forthcoming research concerning the pig gut virome."
"History, historiography, and stories of logical empiricism","Histories of philosophy usually incorporate logical empiricism into the story of either analytic philosophy or empiricism. Alan Richardson’s Logical Empiricism as Scientific Philosophy (2023) tells a different story, in which the diverse group of thinkers associated with logical empiricism is united by an attitude rather than a single philosophical methodology or epistemological project. I examine some historiographical consequences of adopting Richardson’s new story, paying particular attention to its significance for our current moment."
Identifying the physiological traits associated with DNA marker using genome wide association in wheat under heat stress,"Heat stress poses a significant environmental challenge that profoundly impacts wheat productivity. It disrupts vital physiological processes such as photosynthesis, by impeding the functionality of the photosynthetic apparatus and compromising plasma membrane stability, thereby detrimentally affecting grain development in wheat. The scarcity of identified marker trait associations pertinent to thermotolerance presents a formidable obstacle in the development of marker-assisted selection strategies against heat stress. To address this, wheat accessions were systematically exposed to both normal and heat stress conditions and phenotypic data were collected on physiological traits including proline content, canopy temperature depression, cell membrane injury, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate (at vegetative and reproductive stage and ‘stay-green’. Principal component analysis elucidated the most significant contributors being proline content, transpiration rate, and canopy temperature depression, which exhibited a synergistic relationship with grain yield. Remarkably, cluster analysis delineated the wheat accessions into four discrete groups based on physiological attributes. Moreover, to explore the relationship between physiological traits and DNA markers, 158 wheat accessions were genotyped with 186 SSRs. Allelic frequency and polymorphic information content value were found to be highest on genome A (4.94 and 0.688), chromosome 1A (5.00 and 0.712), and marker Xgwm44 (13.0 and 0.916). Population structure, principal coordinate analysis and cluster analysis also partitioned the wheat accessions into four subpopulations based on genotypic data, highlighting their genetic homogeneity. Population diversity and presence of linkage disequilibrium established the suitability of population for association mapping. Additionally, linkage disequilibrium decay was most pronounced within a 15–20 cM region on chromosome 1A. Association mapping revealed highly significant marker trait associations at Bonferroni correction P < 0.00027. Markers Xwmc418 (located on chromosome 3D) and Xgwm233 (chromosome 7A) demonstrated associations with transpiration rate, while marker Xgwm494 (chromosome 3A) exhibited an association with photosynthetic rates at both vegetative and reproductive stages under heat stress conditions. Additionally, markers Xwmc201 (chromosome 6A) and Xcfa2129 (chromosome 1A) displayed robust associations with canopy temperature depression, while markers Xbarc163 (chromosome 4B) and Xbarc49 (chromosome 5A) were strongly associated with cell membrane injury at both stages. Notably, marker Xbarc49 (chromosome 5A) exhibited a significant association with the 'stay-green' trait under heat stress conditions. These results offers the potential utility in marker-assisted selection, gene pyramiding and genomic selection models to predict performance of wheat accession under heat stress conditions."
Assessing the seismic sensitivity of bridge structures by developing fragility curves with ANN and LSTM integration,"In today’s transportation networks, bridges play an essential role as conduits that allow efficient access to a variety of locations. These structures are still vulnerable to outside pressures, though, and doing so can result in serious harm, especially during seismic occurrences. In this research, we model and analyze reinforced concrete (RC) T-beam bridges with elastomeric bridge bearings in order to thoroughly assess the seismic behavior of bridge components. We build and examine several span bridge models with CSI Bridge Software, altering pier heights and bearing stiffnesses in a methodical manner. In this work, we evaluate an RC bridge’s seismic susceptibility by taking regionally variable ground motions into account. Fragility curves, which are crucial instruments for evaluating risk, are at the center of our research. The probability of failure is represented by these curves over the whole load spectrum. Typically, fragility curves plot estimated probabilities (such as deflection) against ground motion parameters, providing insights into the likelihood of exceeding specific deformation limits during seismic events. Our research aims to create accurate fragility curves, facilitating precise loss calculations for bridge structures. By employing artificial neural networks (ANNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM), this research addresses uncertainties associated with influencing factors. It has been discovered that the inputs and outputs of the ANN and LSTM models are, respectively, the influencing traits and fragility parameters of significant components."
MiR-322-5p is involved in regulating chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation in offspring’s growth plate of maternal gestational diabetes,"Pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM) has an impact on fetal bone formation, but the underlying mechanism is still obscure. Although miRNAs have been extensively investigated throughout bone formation, their effects on fetal bone development caused by PGDM still need clarification. This study intends to examine the mechanism by which hyperglycemia impairs the bone formation of offspring via miR-322-5p (miR-322). In this study, miR-322 was selected by systemically screening utilizing bioinformatics and subsequent validation experiments. Using streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice and ATDC5 cell lines, we found that miR-322 was abundantly expressed in the proliferative and hypertrophic zones of the growth plate, and its expression pattern was disturbed in the presence of hyperglycemia, suggesting that miR-322 is involved in the chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation in absence/presence of hyperglycemia. This observation was proved by manipulating miR-322 expression in ATDC5 cells by transfecting mimic and inhibitor of miR-322. Furthermore, Adamts5, Col12a1, and Cbx6 were identified as the potential target genes of miR-322, verified by the co-transfection of miR-322 inhibitor and the siRNAs, respectively. The evaluation criteria are the chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation and their relevant key gene expressions (proliferation: Sox9 and PthIh; differentiation: Runx2 and Col10a1) after manipulating the gene expressions in ATDC5 cells. This study revealed the regulative role miR-322 on chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation of growth plate by targeting Adamts5, Col12a1, and Cbx6 in hyperglycemia during pregnancy. This translational potential represents a promising avenue for advancing our understanding of bone-related complications in diabetic pregnancy and mitigating bone deficiencies in diabetic pregnant individuals, improving maternal and fetal outcomes."
Tough double-bouligand architected concrete enabled by robotic additive manufacturing,"Nature has developed numerous design motifs by arranging modest materials into complex architectures. The damage-tolerant, double-bouligand architecture found in the coelacanth fish scale is comprised of collagen fibrils helically arranged in a bilayer manner. Here, we exploit the toughening mechanisms of double-bouligand designs by engineering architected concrete using a large-scale two-component robotic additive manufacturing process. The process enables intricate fabrication of the architected concrete components at large-scale. The double-bouligand designs are benchmarked against bouligand and conventional rectilinear counterparts and monolithic casts. In contrast to cast concrete, double-bouligand design demonstrates a non-brittle response and a rising R-curve, due to a hypothesized bilayer crack shielding mechanism. In addition, interlocking behind and crack deflection ahead of the crack tip in bilayer double-bouligand architected concrete elicits a 63% increase in fracture toughness compared to cast counterparts."
Trends in the integration of medical corporation hospitals in Japan: a national wide longitudinal study between 2017 and 2021,"Medical corporations, which are non-profit organizations that aim to operate hospitals, clinics, or long-term care facilities, account for more than half of all hospital beds and play a central role in the health care system in Japan. However, limited analysis of hospital integration has been performed. Examining the hospital integration trends of medical corporations can provide valuable insights for optimizing health care delivery and resource allocation in Japan. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of trends in the hospital integration of medical corporations and market concentration in Japan using nationwide longitudinal data."
Montane evergreen forest deforestation for banana plantations decreased soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stores to alarming levels,"Forest conversion to agricultural land has been shown to deplete soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) stocks. However, research on how soil properties respond to forest conversion to shifting cultivation has produced conflicting results. The conflicting findings suggest that the agricultural system may influence the response of SOC and STN to forest conversion to agriculture, depending on the presence of vegetative cover throughout the year. Due to the unique characteristics of montane evergreen forests (MEF) and banana plantations (BP), SOC and STN response to MEF conversion to BP may differ from existing models. Nevertheless, research on how soil properties are affected by MEF conversion to BP is scarce globally. In order to fill this research gap, the goal of this study was to evaluate how much deforestation for BP affects SOC, STN, and soil quality by analysing these soil parameters in MEF and BP fields down to 1-m depth, using standard profile-based procedures. Contrary to the specified hypothesis that SOC and STN losses would be restricted to the upper 20-cm soil layer, SOC losses were extended to the 40-cm depth layer and STN losses to the 60-cm depth layer. The soils lost 18.56 Mg ha – 1 (37%) of SOC from the upper 20 cm and 33.15 Mg ha – 1 (37%) from the upper 40 cm, following MEF conversion to BP. In terms of STN, the upper 20, 40, and 60 cm lost 2.98 (43%), 6.62 (47%), and 8.30 Mg ha – 1 (44%), respectively. Following MEF conversion to BP, the SOC stratification ratio decreased by 49%, implying a decline in soil quality. Massive exportation of nutrients, reduced C inputs due to complete removal of the arboreal component and crop residues, the erodibility of the soils on the study area’s steep hillslopes, and the potential for banana plantations to increase throughfall kinetic energy, and splash erosion through canopy dripping are thought to be the leading causes of SOC and STN losses. More research is needed to identify the extent to which each cause influences SOC and STN losses."
Exploring drivers of self-treatment with antibiotics in three agricultural communities of northern Tanzania,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant global health threat, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Self-treatment with antibiotics, the practice of using antibiotics without professional guidance, is often considered an important contributor to the emergence and spread of AMR."
The novel ribosome biogenesis inhibitor usnic acid blocks nucleolar pre-60S maturation,"The formation of new ribosomes is tightly coordinated with cell growth and proliferation. In eukaryotes, the correct assembly of all ribosomal proteins and RNAs follows an intricate scheme of maturation and rearrangement steps across three cellular compartments: the nucleolus, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm. We demonstrate that usnic acid, a lichen secondary metabolite, inhibits the maturation of the large ribosomal subunit in yeast. We combine biochemical characterization of pre-ribosomal particles with a quantitative single-particle cryo-EM approach to monitor changes in nucleolar particle populations upon drug treatment. Usnic acid rapidly blocks the transition from nucleolar state B to C of Nsa1-associated pre-ribosomes, depleting key maturation factors such as Dbp10 and hindering pre-rRNA processing. This primary nucleolar block rapidly rebounds on earlier stages of the pathway which highlights the regulatory linkages between different steps. In summary, we provide an in-depth characterization of the effect of usnic acid on ribosome biogenesis, which may have implications for its reported anti-cancer activities."
A high-density multi-electrode platform examining the effects of radiation on in vitro cortical networks,"Radiation therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery are common treatments for brain malignancies. However, the impact of radiation on underlying neuronal circuits is poorly understood. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), neurons communicate via action potentials that control cognitive processes, thus it is important to understand the impact of radiation on these circuits. Here we present a novel protocol to investigate the effect of radiation on the activity and survival of PFC networks in vitro. Escalating doses of radiation were applied to PFC slices using a robotic radiosurgery platform at a standard dose rate of 10 Gy/min. High-density multielectrode array recordings of radiated slices were collected to capture extracellular activity across 4,096 channels. Radiated slices showed an increase in firing rate, functional connectivity, and complexity. Graph-theoretic measures of functional connectivity were altered following radiation. These results were compared to pharmacologically induced epileptic slices where neural complexity was markedly elevated, and functional connections were strong but remained spatially focused. Finally, propidium iodide staining revealed a dose-dependent effect of radiation on apoptosis. These findings provide a novel assay to investigate the impacts of clinically relevant doses of radiation on brain circuits and highlight the acute effects of escalating radiation doses on PFC neurons."
Integrable Variants of the Toda Lattice,"By introducing bilinear operators of trigonometric type, we propose several novel integrable variants of the famous Toda lattice, two of which can be regarded as integrable discretizations of the Kadomtsev–Petviashvili equation—a universal model describing weakly nonlinear waves in media with dispersion of velocity. We also demonstrate that two one-dimensional reductions of these variants can approximate the nonlinear Schrödinger equation and a generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation well. It turns out that these equations admit meaningful solutions including solitons, breathers, lumps and rogue waves, which are expressed in terms of explicit and closed forms. In particular, it seems to be the first time that rogue wave solutions have been obtained for Toda-type equations. Furthermore, g-periodic wave solutions are also produced in terms of Riemann theta function. An approximation solution of the three-periodic wave is successfully carried out by using a deep neural network. The introduction of trigonometric-type bilinear operators is also efficient in generating new variants together with rich properties for some other integrable equations."
Helical ultrastructure of the L-ENA spore aggregation factor of a Bacillus paranthracis foodborne outbreak strain,"In pathogenic Bacillota, spores can form an infectious particle and can take up a central role in the environmental persistence and dissemination of disease. A poorly understood aspect of spore-mediated infection is the fibrous structures or ‘endospore appendages’ (ENAs) that have been seen to decorate the spores of pathogenic Bacilli and Clostridia. Current methodological approaches are opening a window on these long enigmatic structures. Using cryoID, Alphafold modelling and genetic approaches we identify a sub-class of robust ENAs in a Bacillus paranthracis foodborne outbreak strain. We demonstrate that L-ENA are encoded by a rare three-gene cluster (ena3) that contains all components for the self-assembly of ladder-like protein nanofibers of stacked heptameric rings, their anchoring to the exosporium, and their termination in a trimeric ‘ruffle’ made of a complement C1Q-like BclA paralogue. The role of ENA fibers in spore-spore interaction and the distribution of L-ENA operon as mobile genetic elements in B. cereus s.l. strains suggest that L-ENA fibers may increase the survival, spread and virulence of these strains."
Proximity Effects in Single- and Two-Band Superconducting Heterostructures: A Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau Approach,"In this work, we study the proximity effects in a single- and two-band superconducting three-dimensional heterostructure, described by two condensates (condensate 1 and condensate 2) in the presence of an external magnetic field perpendicular to the heterostructure. The distance between the interfaces of both condensates is given by the parameter \(\lambda '\). We solve the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations considering a Josephson-like coupling to explore properties such as magnetization, Gibbs free energy, and the Abrikosov vortex state. We propose three cases: case 1, both condensates are composed of a single-band; case 2, the condensates are composed of two bands; and case 3, condensate 1 has a single-band and condensate 2 has two bands. As a result, we highlight the variation of the first critical field and the novel vortex configurations induced by the proximity effect between the superconducting condensates. This phenomenon substantially influences the arrangement of vortices in each of the superconducting bands."
4 × 4 graphene nano-antenna array for plasmonic sensing applications,"The manuscript presents the design and investigation of square and L-shaped graphene plasmonic nano-antenna arrays on a silicon dioxide substrate for plasmonic biosensing applications. The design parameters, such as the shape of the nanostructure, spacing between the antenna array elements, size of the antenna array and chemical potential of the graphene are used to analyze the plasmonic resonance characteristics of the proposed plasmonic nano-antenna array. Initially, dispersive characteristics of graphene, such as conductivity, permittivity and refractive index are analyzed using its chemical potential for the validation of the graphene material for plasmonic sensing applications. The proposed square and L-shaped nanopatch antenna structures are radiating at 30 THz with a reflection coefficient of -28.4 dB and − 44.6 dB respectively at 0.1 eV chemical potential. It is observed that graphene nanopatch antenna radiates at 30 THz, 115 THz and 176 THz at a chemical potential of 1.3 eV. Further, the study demonstrated that the designed square and L-shaped nano-antenna exhibit a gain of 3.52 dB and 9.51 dB respectively at 30 THz. The gain can be increased further using a square and L-shaped nano-antenna array of dimensions 2 × 2, 3 × 3 and 4 × 4. It is observed that maximum gains of 33.44 dB and 30.86 dB are obtained for the square and L-shaped 4 × 4 plasmonic nanoarray antenna respectively. Finally, a nanocircuit model of square and L-shaped nano-antennas is proposed and validated through CST simulations."
Short-run impact of electricity on social capital: evidence from a rural electricity program,"Access to electricity is increasing in developing nations, driven by the belief that it can enhance economic outcomes. However, beyond its economic impact, electricity availability can influence non-economic outcomes like social capital, especially in rural settings. Social capital plays a crucial role in promoting collective actions and improving the credibility of social contract, which can help alleviate market inefficiencies stemming from challenges in enforcing such agreements. This study investigates the impact of electricity on social capital, focusing on household-level trust, interactions and engagements. To overcome the potential endogeneity of electricity access, we estimate a bivariate probit model, using a plausibly exogenous land gradient as an instrument. Our findings suggest that, in the short run, the influence of electricity on various social capital measures is not statistically significant. However, we do find some evidence of a heterogeneous effect."
Navigating Process Drift: The Power of CUSUM in Monitoring Air Quality Processes and Maintenance Operations,"Nowadays, manufacturers face intense pressure to maintain a high standard of quality. Due to the damage to machine components, manufacturing processes degrade over time, resulting in substandard products. Generally, statistical process control tools such as control charts aid in identifying patterns and trends indicative of process changes. This investigation delves into the effectiveness of cumulative sum control charts using the sample mean and median as plotting statistics. Run-length measurements assess performance after the charts experience linear and quadratic drifts in non-normal setups under zero- and steady-state conditions. The findings reveal that Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) charts outperform zero-state monitoring compared to steady-state monitoring. Notably, the CUSUM chart for the mean is suitable for normal and Gamma distributions, exhibiting a greater ability for drift detection under biased and unbiased Average Run Lengths. This study offers valuable insights into enhancing manufacturing quality through effectively implementing and comparing Shewhart, Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, and CUSUM charts. By evaluating their performance under various conditions and comparing them with other control chart methods, this research provides valuable guidance for industries seeking to improve process monitoring and product quality. It is essential to acknowledge that the findings are based on specific experimental conditions and may not fully capture the complexity of real-world manufacturing environments. For practical purposes, the suggested charts are also applied to real-world case studies, including air quality (focusing on five metal oxide chemistry sensors: carbon monoxide concentration, non-metonic hydrocarbons, benzene, total nitrogen oxides, and nitrogen dioxide) and maintenance data (including air temperature, rotating speed, and equipment failure)."
Self-awareness and career adaptability of new nurses in the oncology hospital: a chain mediating model of creative self-efficacy and work readiness,"In recent years, career adaptability has been a hot topic in the field of career psychology. It can facilitate new nurses' successful career transition, enhance career satisfaction, well-being, employment quality, job performance, and reduce the turnover rate of new nurses, and career adaptability can have a direct impact on the stability of the nursing workforce. Self-awareness has been shown to be associated with career adaptability; however, the mechanisms behind it are not fully understood. Based on career construction theory and empirical research, this study constructs a chain mediating model to test whether they play a mediating role in self-awareness and career adaptability among new nurses. In the oncology hospital, this study looked into how self-awareness affected new nurses' ability to remain resilient in their careers. The relationship between self-awareness and career adaptability is clarified using structural modelling equations and the mediation function of creative self-efficacy and graduate work readiness was assessed. A cross-sectional study design was used. The study was carried out between June 2022 and April 2023. A convenience sampling method was used to survey 767 new nurses from three oncology hospitals.The General Social Demographic Questionnaire, the Nurses' Self-Awareness Scale, the Creative Self-Efficacy Scale, the Chinese version of the Graduate Nurses' Work Readiness Scale, and the Career Adaptation Scale were used.IBM-SPSS25.0 was used to analyze Pearson correlations among work readiness, self-awareness, creative self-efficacy, and career adaptability; MPLUS8 was used for the path analysis; AMOS26 was used to construct structural equation models and the Bootstrap method was used to test the mediating hypotheses. There was a significant positive correlation between the two variables of nurse self-awareness, creative self-efficacy, work readiness, and career adaptability (p <.001); the separate mediating effects of creative self-efficacy and work readiness (β = 0.096, p <.001), between self-awareness and career adaptability were significant (β = 0.094, p <.001), and a significant chain mediating effect of creative self-efficacy and work readiness between nurses' self-awareness and career adaptability (β = 0.127, p <.001). The sum of the indirect effects of these three mediated paths was (0.317) with an effect size of (83.2)%. Self-awareness affects new nurses' career adaptability not only independently through creative self-efficacy and work readiness, but also indirectly through a chain-mediated effect of creative self-efficacy and graduate work readiness."
SAD: semi-supervised automatic detection of BOLD activations in high temporal resolution fMRI data,"Despite the prevalent use of the general linear model (GLM) in fMRI data analysis, assuming a pre-defined hemodynamic response function (HRF) for all voxels can lead to reduced reliability and may distort the inferences derived from it. To overcome the necessity of presuming a specific model for the hemodynamic response, we introduce a semi-supervised automatic detection (SAD) method."
Mining Interpretable Regional Co-location Patterns Based on Urban Functional Region Division,"Discovering the correlation relationships of spatial facilities in urban functional regions is of great significance in analyzing urban planning and promoting urban development. However, existing regional co-location pattern mining methods do not fully consider the attributes of urban functional regions. Consequently, they fail to effectively capture the relationships between spatial facilities and regions, resulting in patterns lacking practical application value and interpretability. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel regional co-location pattern (RCP) mining method based on urban functional region division. First, an ontology-based method for urban functional region division is proposed. On the basis of dividing urban functional regions, the expected mean distance is generated to adaptively calculate the neighbor relationships between instances in each region, and a parallel algorithm is designed to quickly mine RCPs in urban functional regions. Then, the correlation coefficient (\(CC_{RP}\)) measures the association strength between RCP and function type to provide interpretability for RCPs. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness of urban functional region partition and to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RCP mining method."
Surfacing of Latent Time Memories Supports the Representational Basis of Timing Behavior in Mice,"Animals can adapt their reward expectancy to changes in delays to reward availability. When temporal relations are altered, associative models of interval timing predict that the original time memory is lost due to the updating of the underlying associative weights, whereas the representational models render the preservation of the original time memory (as previously demonstrated in the extinction of conditioned fear). The current study presents the critical test of these theoretical accounts by training mice with two different intervals in a consecutive fashion (short → long or long → short) and then testing timing behaviors during extinction where neither temporal relation is in effect. Mice that were trained with the long interval first clustered their anticipatory responses around the average of two intervals (indirect higher-order manifestation of two memories in the form of temporal averaging), whereas mice trained with the short interval first clustered their responses either around the short or long interval (direct manifestation of memory representations by their independent indexing). We assert that the original memory representation formed during training with the long interval “metrically affords” the integration of subsequent experiences with a shorter interval, allowing their co-activation during extinction. The original memory representation formed during training with the short interval would not metrically afford such integration and thus result in the formation of a new (mutually exclusive) time memory representation, which does not afford their co-activation during extinction. Our results provide strong support for the representational account of interval timing. We provide a new theoretical account of these findings based on the “metric affordances” of the original memory representation formed during training with the original intervals."
Quality assessment of ESG reporting among listed maritime companies,"Regulatory obligations and market trends connected to environmental sustainability issues have lately intensified their effect on the shipping industry. New standards are continuously being established, such as IMO’s 2050 aim of lowering greenhouse gas emissions by 50% compared to 2008 levels. These rules have an impact on capital markets and on investors’ ship financing decisions. The standards now include Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) components. These are not only concerned with the environmental impact of shipping, but also with the social and governance dimensions of firms, which are typically associated with maritime transport risks, such as accidents, ship reservations, and marine pollution. Considering the intricacies of the shipping sector, our previous research (Tsatsaronis et al. in Maritime Policy and Management 51(5):698–716, 2024) has developed a unified ESG reporting framework customized for shipping. The present study conducts a quality assessment of existing ESG reporting in various sectors of maritime transport companies, on a large sample of firms listed at major stock exchanges, while it also identifies their level of compliance and areas for improvement. Based on a comprehensive methodological framework for reporting and assessing ESG in shipping (Tsatsaronis et al. in Maritime Policy and Management 51(5):698–716, 2024), the research delivers important, pertinent information to aid management decision-making, stakeholders, and debtholders."
The effect of mood on risk taking: a systematic review,"This research investigates the nuanced influence of internally experienced moods, specifically focusing on positive and negative moods, on individuals' propensity for risk-taking behavior. The objective is to discern the intricate impact of mood on risk-taking, a subject that has elicited varying results in diverse studies. A systematic search for experimental-research studies, spanning from the present to 1983, was conducted using PubMed and Semantic Scholar databases. After a meticulous examination of the complete texts, a final set of 13 studies was chosen for analysis. The results revealed divergent findings: some studies indicated that positive mood increased risk-taking behavior, while others suggested a similar effect for negative mood. These opposing outcomes are explained by two hypotheses: the Mood-Maintenance Hypothesis and the Affect Infusion Model. This study aims to comprehensively explore and compare the substantiation of these two theories across a range of experimental studies, contributing to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between mood and risk-taking behavior."
Improving the Quality of Low-grade Tobacco by Enzymatic Treatment and Co-fermentation with Yeast and Lactic Acid Bacteria,"Enzymatic treatment is a promising method to modulate the chemical composition, flavoring substances and to enhance the sensory quality of cigarettes. This study investigates the feasibility of enzymatic treatment in conjunction with co-fermentation with yeast and lactic acid bacteria to improve the quality of low-quality cigarettes. Amylase, flavourzyme, glucoamylase, protease, and their combinations were used for the enzymatic treatment of tobacco-sorghum by using the liquid-state fermentation method. The biochemical components and flavor substances of the fermented products were analyzed. The findings show that amylase and glucoamylase can effectively degrade starch into fermentable reducing sugars, facilitate microbial growth and proliferation, and significantly enhance the levels of flavoring alcohols and esters. Flavourzyme and glucoamylase, either individually or combined with amylase, achieved a more balanced distribution of flavor substances in the products. Additionally, flavourzyme was capable of increasing the content of guaiacol, solanesol, and 2-acetylpyrrole in the fermented products, thereby improving the richness and depth of the cigarette flavor. While the protease treatment group showed fewer flavor substances and higher nicotine content, which was detrimental to the quality of cigarettes. When integrating the fermentation products into low-quality cigarettes, flavourzyme and glucoamylase combined with amylase treatment received higher scores in sensory quality evaluations. This study provides a beneficial strategy for effectively improving the quality of low-quality cigarettes."
Towards equity & inclusion: a critical examination of genetic Counselling Education on Intersex Healthcare,"Intersex describes a diversity of individuals with variations in sex characteristics (VSC), reflecting underlying differences in reproductive anatomy, hormones, and/or genes and chromosomes. With a shift towards socially-conscious clinical practices, genetic counsellors (GCs) are increasingly needing to provide comprehensive care to individuals with VSC and their families. However, the current quality of training provided to genetic counsellors on intersex health is unclear."
Influence of domestic food waste intrusion on microbes producing cellulose,"The processing of vegetal food generates large quantities of derivatives, presenting economic and environmental challenges due to their high volumes and disposal costs. After isolating essential constituents, significant remnants remain undervalued. Bacterial cellulose (BC) is an exopolysaccharide produced by microorganisms, notable for its unique physical and mechanical properties, and is chemically purer than plant-based cellulose as it lacks hemicellulose and lignin. Characterisation of BC using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed high crystallinity and thermodynamic stability. This study aims to isolate fresh bacterial cellulose from food waste suspension and evaluate its potential as an eco-efficient product, including environmentally friendly disposal of post-use waste. Therefore, the results obtained indicate that domestic food waste had great potency in producing microbes Gluconacetobacter xylinus (Cellulose producing bacterial strain (CPBS-1), Pseudomonas fluorescens (CPBS-2) and Enterobacter cloacae (CPBS-3) that fabricates cellulose. The yield of bacterial cellulose from different food waste sources was quantified, showing that tea waste produced 20 mg/ml, fruit peel waste yielded 25 mg/ml and both vegetable peel waste and fruit waste resulted in 15 mg/ml. These results suggest that the type of food waste significantly impacts the efficiency of bacterial cellulose synthesis, with fruit peel waste being the most promising for high-yield production. Moreover, the study demonstrates the potential applications of BC in various industries, such as packaging, biomedical fields and sustainable materials, underscoring its value as a versatile and environmentally friendly resource."
"Sporangimicins A–D, acylated maltose derivatives from a rare actinomycete of the genus Pseudosporangium","Sporangimicins A–D (1–4), four anomeric pairs of diacyl disaccharides that represent a new metabolite class, were discovered from the culture extract of an actinomycete Pseudosporangium sp. RD061809. Compounds 1–4 caused peak separation in the HPLC chromatogram and partial duplication of the NMR resonances by anomeric interconversion of a maltose core modified at the two sugar 6-positions with an isobutanoyl and a methyl-branched long-chain dienoyl groups. A highlight of the structure elucidation was application of Ohrui-Akasaka’s method to a chromatographically inseparable mixture of 3 and 4, which proved the composition ratio of 3 and 4 to be 82:18 and the R/S ratio at the anteiso-methyl bearing chiral center in 3 to be 66:34. Compounds 1–4 showed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and modest cytotoxicity toward P388 murine leukemia cells."
Mechanical methods for materials concentration of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells and product potential evaluation for recycling,"The production and sales of lithium-ion batteries (LIB) are rapidly expanding nowadays, causing a significant impact on the consumption of critical raw materials, such as lithium. Thus, developing and improving methods for the separation and recovery of materials from LIBs is necessary to ensure the supply of critical raw materials, as well as to meet the recycling targets set by some countries. This study evaluated and compared two mechanical routes to concentrate materials of LiFePO4 (LPF) cells. In addition, the economic, environmental, and scarcity risk potential of the products obtained through the best mechanical route were evaluated. The first route involved 6 grinding cycles in a knife mill, followed by particle size separation into 3 fractions. The second route involved a single grinding cycle (knife and hammer mill were tested), followed by particle size separation into 6 fractions. The second route showed more promise, with obtaining fractions rich in (1) iron, (2) aluminum and copper, and (3) cathode materials. Additionally, less operating time and energy consumption were necessary. The hammer mill offered a better separation for the iron and the cathodic materials (LiFePO4), while the knife mill proved to be more effective in concentrating the aluminum and copper. The product potential evaluation of the best route revealed that the priority fractions for recycling in economic and environmental assessment in LFP2 are 2 < n < 9.5 mm (due Cu and Al) and n < 0.5 mm (due Li). Considering the scarcity risk, priority should be assigned to the recycling of the fraction n < 0.5 due to lithium."
Comparative prevalence of Nosema ceranae infection between wild and managed honey bee(Apis mellifera) colonies in South Texas,"Over the last few decades, honey bee (Apis mellifera) populations have been challenged by multiple factors including pathogens and parasites, which often act concurrently to cause severe health problems. One honey bee pathogen linked to colony losses worldwide is the microsporidian Nosema spp., which affects adult bees. Workers infected with Nosema often exhibit shorter lifespans, forage prematurely, and are susceptible to other pathogens. Our main goals were to quantify the levels of Nosema spp. infection in a wild honey bee population at the Welder Wildlife Refuge (WWR) in south Texas, and to compare them to infection levels in colonies from a nearby managed apiary. We hypothesized that wild colonies would have lower infection levels than managed colonies due to their unique life history traits, including lower colony density per unit area, which decreases the likelihood of cross-colony disease transmission. We collected foragers from the entrance of 18 wild colonies at the WWR and 19 managed colonies at the nearby apiary. We then performed individual Nosema spp. spore counts on ten workers per colony to calculate an average spore count per bee. On average, wild colonies had 25,556 spores/bee, while managed colonies had 130,526 spores/bee, both considered to be low. There were no differences in infection levels between colony types. All samples tested positive for N. ceranae; no N. apis was detected. Our results suggest that wild colonies at the WWR have historically been infected with Nosema spp. at low levels and can thrive in the absence of human intervention."
Responses of plant biomass allocation to changed precipitation timing in a semi-arid steppe,"Precipitation changes can affect patterns of biomass allocation by altering species composition. However, how shifts in species with different growth forms under precipitation changes affect above- and belowground biomass allocation and the vertical root distribution remains unclear."
Time-domain acceleration-based pulse characterization of 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes,"On February 6, 2023, two significant earthquakes struck the region of Kahramanmaraş, Türkiye. The first earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.7 and a depth of 8.6 km, occurred in Pazarcık, and the second earthquake, with a magnitude 7.6 and a depth of 7.0 km, struck Elbistan. These two devastating events led to the loss of lives and massive destruction of civil infrastructures. In this work, pulse components of the ground motions for both earthquakes are characterized through a multi-pulse decomposition method developed by the authors. The work particularly focuses on cumulative energy, period, and amplitude of dominant pulse components using two extensive ground motion ensembles: (1) 103 ground motions from the Pazarcık earthquake, and (2) 79 ground motions from the Elbistan earthquake. It is found that, for the Pazarcık earthquake, pulse cumulative energy is more pronounced for the ground motions in proximity to the rupture lines. However, for the Elbistan earthquake, pulse cumulative energy is not significant for the ground motions in a specific area and is roughly uniformly distributed across all the ground motions and the entire region. It is also seen that dominant pulse periods lie predominantly within the range of 0.5–1.5 s for both earthquakes highlighting the significant damage caused. Finally, the pulse amplitudes exceed 0.5 g for several ground motions of the Pazarcık earthquake while all the amplitudes fall below 0.5 g for the Elbistan earthquake."
Perspectives on Teachers’ Work in Australian Early Childhood Education and Care Settings: Evidence and Ecology,"ECEC educators play a vital role in educating and caring for children during the first five years of life, a critical period for learning, growth, and development. University-trained early childhood teachers make a particularly significant contribution to overall service quality. This exploratory interview study brings an ecological lens to the perspectives of nine Australian university-trained early childhood teachers on the nature and quantity of their work and workload. As part of the mixed methods Early Learning Work Matters project, this Phase II interview study supports findings from the prior international systematic review that work in ECEC is complex and demanding. Interviews yielded new findings indicating the potential changing nature of early childhood teachers’ work, some of whom reported little to no capacity to focus on service quality. Concerningly, analysis revealed burdensome influences at all ecological levels, with only a few uplifting microsystems which were inconsistently experienced by participants."
Stable isotopes and diet metabarcoding reveal trophic overlap between native and invasive Banded Killifish (Fundulus diaphanus) subspecies,"Researchers, managers, and policymakers have historically neglected non-game fishes relative to game fishes, and this oversight has extended to invasive non-game fishes in the United States. One such fish—the Eastern Banded Killifish (Fundulus diaphanus diaphanus Lesueur 1817)—has established and rapidly spread in Lake Michigan and connected waters since 2000. Here, we assess potential drivers of the successful invasion of Eastern Banded Killifish, as well as their potential to disrupt native communities and food webs. Specifically, we compare the trophic niche breadth and diet composition between Eastern Banded Killifish and a native subspecies, Western Banded Killifish (Fundulus diaphanus menona Jordan and Copeland 1877), using stable isotope and gut content metabarcoding analyses. Stable isotope analysis showed that Eastern Banded Killifish had a higher variance in littoral dependence and trophic position than Western Banded Killifish, but both stable isotope and gut content metabarcoding analyses revealed an overlap in the diet composition and trophic position between the subspecies. Eastern Banded Killifish may successfully establish outside its native range due to higher feeding variability than Western Banded Killifish, including in habitats historically unused by the native subspecies, but the trophic niche between these two subspecies was similar overall. This study provides insights into the successful invasion of a potentially overlooked non-game fish—Eastern Banded Killifish—while also comparing stable isotope and gut content metabarcoding analyses for an invasive freshwater fish for the first time."
MARVEL-minimising the emergence and dissemination of HIV-1 drug resistance in Portuguese-speaking African Countries (PALOP): low-cost portable NGS platform for HIV-1 surveillance in Africa,"HIV-1 infections remain a global public health concern. Scaled-up antiretroviral treatment (ART) is crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality related to HIV/AIDS. The emergence of drug-resistance mutations (DRMs) compromises viral suppression and contributes to the continued HIV-1 transmission. Several reports indicate a recent increase in acquired (ADR) and transmitted (TDR) drug resistance in Africa, probably linked to the lack of implementation of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) testing and suboptimal treatment adherence. Herein, we will develop a low-cost protocol using third-generation sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technology) for HIV-1 surveillance in Portuguese-speaking African Countries - PALOP [Angola (AO), Cape Verde (CV), Mozambique (MZ), and Sao Tome & Principe (STP)]."
Automated analysis of the void structure in hardened concrete based on shape from focus,"The quality of the air void system is essential for the frost resistance of concrete. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the quality of the air void system in hardened concrete in an appropriate way. In this study, the shape from focus (SFF) method is applied to identify the focused image of each point on the polished surface of hardened concrete and thereby acquire the depth information of the entire surface. The performance of various focus measure operators and window sizes is evaluated. Thereafter, the selected focus measure operator and window size are applied for the SFF analysis of all samples. Based on the obtained depth map, the voids are identified, and the void parameters of the hardened concrete are determined by an automated procedure. The main advantage of the SFF method is that it is possible to carry out an automated air void analysis without contrast enhancement."
Quasi-equilibrium growth of inch-scale single-crystal monolayer α-In2Se3 on fluor-phlogopite,"Epitaxial growth of two-dimensional (2D) materials with uniform orientation has been previously realized by introducing a small binding energy difference between the two locally most stable orientations. However, this small energy difference can be easily disturbed by uncontrollable dynamics during the growth process, limiting its practical applications. Herein, we propose a quasi-equilibrium growth (QEG) strategy to synthesize inch-scale monolayer α-In2Se3 single crystals, a semiconductor with ferroelectric properties, on fluor-phlogopite substrates. The QEG facilitates the discrimination of small differences in binding energy between the two locally most stable orientations, realizing robust single-orientation epitaxy within a broad growth window. Thus, single-crystal α-In2Se3 film can be epitaxially grown on fluor-phlogopite, the cleavage surface atomic layer of which has the same 3-fold rotational symmetry with α-In2Se3. The resulting crystalline quality enables high electron mobility up to 117.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 in α-In2Se3 ferroelectric field-effect transistors, exhibiting reliable nonvolatile memory performance with long retention time and robust cycling endurance. In brief, the developed QEG method provides a route for preparing larger-area single-crystal 2D materials and a promising opportunity for applications of 2D ferroelectric devices and nanoelectronics."
Modeling and multi-objective optimization of a drill-string system in the tripping operation,"The increase in deep and ultra-deep wells demands higher drilling efficiency and more drilling safety. Since the undesired oscillation associated with the tripping in/out of the drill-string increases the risk of downhole safety, it is important to master the axial dynamics of the drill-string system and choose appropriate tripping parameters. In this study, the drill-string system during the tripping operation is modeled as a continuous Euler–Bernoulli beam with the equivalent mass-spring-damper at the top and free at the bottom. The finite element method is employed to solve the axial dynamics of the drill-string system. Then, the dynamic characteristics of the underground drill-string for different system parameters are investigated in detail. Moreover, a multi-objective optimization framework is proposed, aiming to find the optimal tripping parameters and reach a balance between drilling safety and drilling efficiency. The results show that the axial vibration of the drill-string brings about the dynamic load fluctuation of the system, which becomes more serious in the tripping out process. The proposed optimization procedure can reach a desired balance between drilling efficiency and drilling safety and obtain appropriate tripping parameters for different conditions."
The effect of novel β-lactam derivatives synthesized from substituted phenethylamines on resistance genes of MRSA isolates,"This study focuses on the activity of previously reported imine and β-lactam derivatives against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates. The presence of mecA and blaZ genes in the isolates was determined, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined based on the antibacterial activity against these isolates. Active compounds were selected and their ability to act against resistant isolates in vitro was determined. Concurrently, biochemical (nitrocefin) and molecular (qRT-PCR) tests were used to investigate the ability of the compounds to induce resistance genes in MRSA isolates. The cytotoxicity of the compounds on human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) was investigated. The MIC values of compounds (10) and (12) against MSSA and MRSA isolates were 7.81 and 15.62 μg ml−1, respectively. The most active compounds were identified as (10) and (12), and it was observed that the isolates did not develop resistance to these compounds in vitro. These compounds were found to inhibit β-lactamase, reduce the expression of resistance genes, and exhibit reduced HDF cell toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. According to the findings of the study, it can be concluded that these compounds show promise as hits with an interesting mechanism of action for further chemical modifications to develop new MRSA inhibitors."
"Exploring the moral acceptability of older adults’ lies about their physical health, mental health, and medication adherence","Adults have been found to tell lies about their physical and mental health concerns, but no research has assessed how health lies are perceived by others. The present study explored the moral acceptability of older adults’ health lies. A sample of 73 younger and 61 older adults assessed how good or bad it is for older adults to tell health lies (about physical health, mental health, medication use) to their doctor, spouse, and adult child. All health lies were rated quite negatively but lies about medication adherence and lies to doctors were rated the most negatively. Compared with younger adults, older adults were more approving of lying to a doctor about physical health but less approving of lying to one’s adult child about mental health. Across participants, those with greater depressive symptoms viewed mental health lies less negatively. Given that health lies were rated quite negatively, telling health lies may hold negative social implications for older adults."
On the Uniform Duality in Copositive Optimization,"In this paper, we establish new necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing the uniform LP duality for linear problems of Copositive Programming and formulate these conditions in different equivalent forms. The main results are obtained using the approach developed in previous papers of the authors and based on a concept of immobile indices that permits alternative representations of the set of feasible solutions."
Breaking Barriers and Building Opportunities: Employer Perspectives on Working with People with Psychosocial Disabilities in a Rural Setting in Kenya,"In low-resource settings where unemployment rates are already high, persons with disabilities experience even greater challenges in finding work and employment opportunities. While employers' viewpoints are critical to shaping organizational cultures and employment practices, their perspectives on the employment of people with psychosocial disabilities (PWPD) in rural settings have not been adequately examined. This study explored perspectives of rural employers in Kenya on working with and employing PWPD, so as to strengthen the practice of inclusive work and employment. We utilized a qualitative research methodology to explore the perspectives of a heterogeneous group of employers from Tana River County Kenya. A total of 12 employers participated in the study. We found that employer awareness of inclusive employment practices of PWPD is limited, with several barriers identified. Reported barriers include productivity concerns, occupational hazards, brand image, and disclosure. To improve work and employment rates for PWPD, employers highlighted workplace adjustments, holistic socioeconomic empowerment, and policy changes. Despite differing opinions, employers expressed a willingness to work with and employ PWPD. This study sheds light on the current practices, perceived barriers, and enablers for improving work and employment rates of PWPD in rural settings. While there is a lack of awareness among employers and multiple barriers, it is encouraging to note that employers are willing to work with and employ PWPD. To achieve this, a holistic approach that includes raising awareness on mental illnesses and implementing policies that promote inclusivity is needed."
Production of Levoglucosan and Levoglucosenone from Cellulose Using Brønsted Acid Catalysts in Polar Aprotic Solvents,"Levoglucosan and levoglucosenone are important platform molecules typically produced by pyrolysis of cellulosic feedstocks. Commercial manufacture of levoglucosenone uses phosphoric acid in sulfolane to convert cellulose at high temperatures and catalyst concentrations. We report the synthesis of levoglucosan and levoglucosenone from cellulose at moderate temperatures in polar aprotic solvents using low concentrations of Brønsted acid catalysts. We discovered that the basicity of the solvents has a linear relationship with the cellulose reaction rate. The initial turnover frequency of cellulose conversion increased as the basicity of the solvent decreased. Using a flow reactor with a reactive bed to produce levoglucosan and levoglucosenone we found that moderate temperatures promoted the production of levoglucosan and levoglucosenone, whereas higher temperatures promoted degradation reactions, decreasing the yields of levoglucosan and levoglucosenone. We also found that catalysts with high pKa (lower strength) only promoted the production of levoglucosan and its isomerization, whereas using a catalyst with a low pKa (higher strength) favored subsequent reactions and degradation products, like when we used high temperatures. At 430 K with a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min of 5 mM sulfuric acid in γ-valerolactone, we found yields of up to 34 and 24 wt% for levoglucosan and levoglucosenone, respectively."
When long jumps fall short: control-flow tracking and misuse detection for nonlocal jumps in C,"The C programming language offers setjmp/ longjmp as a mechanism for nonlocal control flow. This mechanism has complicated semantics. As most developers do not encounter it day-to-day, they may be unfamiliar with all its intricacies – leading to subtle programming errors. At the same time, most static analyzers lack proper support, implying that otherwise sound tools miss whole classes of program deficiencies. We propose a concrete semantics of a subset of C with setjmp/ longjmp, where interprocedural longjmps are performed directly, as well as an equivalent formulation where such jumps are implemented via stack-unwinding at the call-sites. Reflecting this semantic equivalence, we propose an approach for lifting existing interprocedural analyses to support setjmp/ longjmp and to flag their misuse. To deal with the nonlocal semantics, our approach leverages side-effecting transfer functions, which, when executed, may additionally trigger contributions for program points that are not static control-flow successors. We showcase our analysis on a real-world example and propose a set of litmus tests for other analyzers."
N-carboxyacyl and N-α-aminoacyl derivatives of aminoaldehydes as shared substrates of plant aldehyde dehydrogenases 10 and 7,"Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) represent a superfamily of enzymes, which oxidize aldehydes to the corresponding acids. Certain families, namely ALDH9 and ALDH10, are best active with ω-aminoaldehydes arising from the metabolism of polyamines such as 3-aminopropionaldehyde and 4-aminobutyraldehyde. Plant ALDH10s show broad specificity and accept many different aldehydes (aliphatic, aromatic and heterocyclic) as substrates. This work involved the above-mentioned aminoaldehydes acylated with dicarboxylic acids, phenylalanine, and tyrosine. The resulting products were then examined with native ALDH10 from pea and recombinant ALDH7s from pea and maize. This investigation aimed to find a common efficient substrate for the two plant ALDH families. One of the best natural substrates of ALDH7s is aminoadipic semialdehyde carrying a carboxylic group opposite the aldehyde group. The substrate properties of the new compounds were demonstrated by mass spectrometry of the reaction mixtures, spectrophotometric assays and molecular docking. The N-carboxyacyl derivatives were good substrates of pea ALDH10 but were only weakly oxidized by the two plant ALDH7s. The N-phenylalanyl and N-tyrosyl derivatives of 3-aminopropionaldehyde were good substrates of pea and maize ALDH7. Particularly the former compound was converted very efficiently (based on the kcat/Km ratio), but it was only weakly oxidized by pea ALDH10. Although no compound exhibited the same level of substrate properties for both ALDH families, we show that these enzymes may possess more common substrates than expected."
Anisotropic Fractional Brownian Field Synthesis via Curvelet Transform,"The proposed model employs curvelet-based techniques to generate anisotropic Fractional Brownian Fields, simulating systems with orientation-dependent self-similar properties. Curvelets are a mathematical tool that allows for an efficient representation of data with edges and other anisotropic singularities, being essential for capturing the directional complexity in the self-similar properties of the modeled systems. The synthesis procedure involves generating coefficients in curvelet space with a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. This approach is tailored to depict the stochastic behavior of natural systems, particularly in scenarios where angular distributions of correlations are critical. The main contribution of this paper is presenting a novel method for generating 2-D anisotropic Fractional Brownian Fields (AFBFs) using the Curvelet Transform, demonstrating the Curvelet Transform’s efficiency in modeling anisotropic properties. Potential applications include modeling heterogeneous geological structures, anisotropic materials, and complex disordered media."
GFPT1 accelerates immune escape in breast cancer by modifying PD-L1 via O-glycosylation,"Immune escape is one of the causes of poor prognosis in breast cancer (BC). Glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1) is the first speed-limiting enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and is essential for the progression of BC. Nevertheless, the mechanism of the influence of GFPT1 in BC immune escape is not clear."
A case report of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia of the bronchial mucosa,"Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide and poses an immediate health threat. Despite decades of basic and clinical research, the 5-year survival rate for lung cancer patients is less than 10%.The most important drawbacks in efficient treatment of lung cancer are delayed diagnosis and absence of effective screening. Detection and study of precancerous lesions of the bronchial mucosa might be one of the turning points in understanding of neoplastic transformation. Therefore, it would be the most effective prevention and early treatment modality. We report a case of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia of the bronchial mucosa in which a neoplastic growth in the lumen of intrinsic segment in the upper lobe of the left lung was detected on electronic bronchoscopy, and biopsy confirmed squamous papillary hyperplasia with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia."
A Fe-NC electrocatalyst boosted by trace bromide ions with high performance in proton exchange membrane fuel cells,"Replacement of expensive and rare platinum with metal–nitrogen–carbon catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions in proton exchange membrane fuel cells is hindered by their inferior activity. Herein, we report a highly active iron-nitrogen-carbon catalyst by optimizing the carbon structure and coordination environments of Fe-N4 sites. A critical high-temperature treatment with ammonium chloride and ammonium bromide not only enhances the intrinsic activity and density of Fe-N4 sites, but also introduces numerous defects, trace Br ions and creates mesopores in the carbon framework. Notably, surface Br ions significantly improve the interaction between the ionomer and catalyst particles, promoting ionomer infiltration and optimizing the O2 transport and charge transfer at triple-phase boundary. This catalyst delivers a high peak power density of 1.86 W cm−2 and 54 mA cm−2 at 0.9 ViR-free in a H2-O2 fuel cells at 80 °C. Our findings highlight the critical role of interface microenvironment regulation."
SLAPSHOT reveals rapid dynamics of extracellularly exposed proteome in response to calcium-activated plasma membrane phospholipid scrambling,"To facilitate our understanding of proteome dynamics during signaling events, robust workflows affording fast time resolution without confounding factors are essential. We present Surface-exposed protein Labeling using PeroxidaSe, H2O2, and Tyramide-derivative (SLAPSHOT) to label extracellularly exposed proteins in a rapid, specific, and sensitive manner. Simple and flexible SLAPSHOT utilizes recombinant soluble APEX2 protein applied to cells, thus circumventing the engineering of tools and cells, biological perturbations, and labeling biases. We applied SLAPSHOT and quantitative proteomics to examine the TMEM16F-dependent plasma membrane remodeling in WT and TMEM16F KO cells. Time-course data ranging from 1 to 30 min of calcium stimulation revealed co-regulation of known protein families, including the integrin and ICAM families, and identified proteins known to reside in intracellular organelles as occupants of the freshly deposited extracellularly exposed membrane. Our data provide the first accounts of the immediate consequences of calcium signaling on the extracellularly exposed proteome."
Enhancing Sustainable Concrete Production by Utilizing Fly Ash and Recycled Concrete Aggregate with Experimental Investigation and Machine Learning Modeling,"Over the last decade, there has been a substantial increase in the amount of construction waste, leading to growing societal and environmental concerns around the recycling of this refuse. Concrete waste is one of the most significant forms of construction waste. As a result, in order to examine the influence of recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) on concrete, this study substitutes natural coarse aggregate (NCA) with RCA at varying replacement percentages: 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%. Additionally, fly ash is used to replace cement at a consistent replacement rate of 36% in all combinations. The controlled concrete was evaluated, and its fresh and hardened characteristics were compared using various mixed amounts. Subsequently, two machine learning (ML) techniques, Linear Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) were used to forecast and examine the fresh and hardened characteristics. In this experiment, the results showed that when RCA increased, the concrete's performance dropped. The addition of 10% to 30% RCA content was shown to almost decrease the workability value of new concrete from 11.45% to 34.14%. Recycled aggregate (RCA) with a replacement rate of 20% produced the best compressive strength values for lightweight concrete, and it has been shown that up to 30% RCA replacement may offer optimal tensile strength. The RF model showed superior forecasting performance than the RF model, with a high correlation coefficient (R2) value of 0.98. Both ML models prove feasible for accurately predicting the fresh characteristics of RCA concrete, demonstrating strong correlation values. However, the RF model provides more satisfactory results for predicting mechanical properties compared to the LR model."
Monolithic poly(methylsilsesquioxane) aerogels with glasslike transparency: from sol-gel synthesis to ambient pressure drying,"Practical aspects of the successful preparation of monolithic poly(methylsilsesquioxane) (PMSQ) aerogels with glasslike transparency via ambient pressure drying (APD) are discussed in detail. Two-step acid-base process starting from methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) in the presence of nonionic poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) surfactant and the use of strong base as polycondensation catalyst resulted in fine mesoporous structure, showing low bulk density (0.148 g cm−3) and glasslike transparency (95% at 10 mm thickness). Cracking and irreversible shrinkage during APD have been prevented by optimized aging and drying processes. In particular, aging in an aqueous alcohol solution containing a low concentration of MTMS under controlled temperature has been found to be crucial in obtaining PMSQ aerogels with crack-free, low-density, glasslike transparency, and monolithic nature. A large-area APD aerogel in 93 × 93 × 6 mm3, with thermal conductivity of 15.6 mW m−1 K−1, has successfully been obtained due to optimizations of aging and drying conditions. Similar APD aerogels have also been obtained when alkali metal hydroxides, especially lithium hydroxide, are employed as base catalysts. These findings are expected to play important roles in designing industrial productions of monolithic aerogels for thermal superinsulation and other applications."
Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Mechanical and Tribological Properties of Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polyethylene Enhanced by Modified Silica Nanoparticles,"Silica nanoparticles have been proved to be one of the effective methods to improve the tribological properties of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UPE). However, the tribological mechanisms have not been clarified. Herein, the mechanical and tribological properties of UPE were improved by grafting silica with KH550, KH560 and KH570, respectively. The molecular dynamics simulation was used to study the binding energies of nano-silica and UPE, and temperature distribution, atomic relative concentration distribution and radial distribution function value of UPE and copper atomic layer along the thickness direction during the friction process. The results showed that the silica grafted with coupling agent can improve the shear modulus and decrease the wear rates of materials. Compared with that of UPE, the shear modulus of KH560 grafted nano-silica-modified UPE was increased by 98.2%, and wear rate was decreased by 68.6%. The research provides a technical guidance for the water-lubricated bearing of UPE modified by nano-silica."
"Stabilizer-free preparation of titanium-based nanowires combined with copper for sensitive detection of 2,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid: application in edible oil samples","2,4,5-Trihydroxybenzoic acid (THBA) is a synthetic antioxidant used in the food industry that has attracted attention due to the potential risks it may pose to human health; thus, ensuring compliance with legal standards is essential. In this regard, the present study describes the development of an electrochemical platform based on a carbon-printed electrode (SPE) modified with titanium (Ti)-based nanowires (NWs) for THBA detection. However, the synthesis of Ti-based NWs involved varying copper (Cu) quantities, resulting in few morphological changes compared to the unmodified counterpart. Interestingly, the syntheses were carried out without organic stabilizers, resulting in the preparation of cleaner nanostructures; such an approach was planned to enhance the electrochemical sensing performance, reduce costs, and promote environmental friendliness. Moreover, it improves charge transfer efficiency, making the synthesis process ideal for sustainable nanomaterial production. XRD analyses indicate that the addition of the metal affected the structure of the Ti-based NWs. Also, SEM images revealed that the unmodified SPE exhibited a smooth surface, whereas the Cu-modified Ti-based NWs/SPE showed a dense network of such material. In addition, the electrochemical studies have shown an enhancing of the electrocatalytic properties after the introduction of copper. Under optimized conditions, it was found that THBA can be determined over a wide working range from 500 pmol L−1 to 5000 µmol L−1. The applicability of the sensor was verified by detecting THBA in soybean oil and sunflower oil samples, showing excellent recovery values between 96.30 and 101.87%, suggesting that the proposed sensor demonstrates good accuracy and can be successfully applied to edible oil samples."
Socioeconomic Inequities in Pap Test Use Among Black Women in the United States: An Intersectional Approach,"Research investigating racialized inequities in cervical cancer screening has rarely considered the influence of socioeconomic position (SEP), a key social determinant of health that intersects with race/ethnicity and racism. Thus, data on socioeconomic inequities in Pap test use within racialized groups—including Black women, who are at elevated risk of cervical cancer morbidity and mortality—are limited."
Two-year clinical performance of indirect resin composite restorations in endodontically treated teeth with different cavity preparation designs: a randomized clinical trial,"This is a randomized, controlled, superiority, double-blinded, parallel-group, two-arms trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1. This study aimed to assess whether the cavity design could affect the clinical performance of the CAD/CAM generated indirect resin composite restoration in endodontically treated teeth (ETT) evaluated using the Modified USPHS criteria after a two-year follow up."
LC contact lens sensor for ultrasensitive intraocular pressure monitoring,"Twenty-four hours continuous intraocular pressure (IOP) monitoring is beneficial for glaucoma care. Contact lens sensors using LC technology can achieve non-invasive continuous IOP measuring around the clock and are relatively simple in principle and structure, thus dominating the mainstream. Among them, stretchable inductive LC contact lens sensors constructed with liquid metal have advantages in signal quality as well as wearing comfort, but currently its sensitivity is slightly insufficient. Here, we propose an LC sensor that constructed with liquid metal to form the stretchable inductance and capacitance further. The capacitive plate and inductive coil can response to IOP changes simultaneously, thus able to enhance the sensitivity in principle. We modeled the sensing mechanism and conducted design, fabrication, as well as various tests. The device exhibits good characteristics, including reliability, good signal quality, etc. Especially, it has a threefold increase in sensitivity, exceeding the current state-of-the-art contact lens sensors."
Association between high-density lipoprotein and functional outcome of ischemic stroke patients in a Taiwanese population,"Despite recent findings indicating a paradoxical association between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, the impact of HDL-C on subsequent outcomes after ischemic stroke remains unclear. The study aims to investigate the relationships between HDL-C levels and post-stroke functional outcomes while examining the potential modifying influence of HDL-C-related single nucleotide polymorphisms identified through genome-wide association studies. This cohort study included 1,310 patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), all of whom had their admission serum lipid profile and genotyping information. Participants were categorized into four groups based on gender and HDL-C level. Prognostic outcomes were assessed using a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 1, 3, and 12 months post-admission. Multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline regression analysis were used to assess the associations between HDL-C levels and outcomes. The mean age of patients was 61.17 ± 12.08 years, and 69.31% were men. After adjusting confounders, patients with the highest HDL-C level group had a significantly higher risk of poor functional outcomes at 1, 3, and 12 months following stroke compared to the reference group. Restricted cubic splines depicted a nonlinear association between HDL-C levels and poor prognosis in both men and women. The ABCA1 gene rs2575876 AA genotype combined with abnormal HDL-C levels exhibited a significantly heightened risk of post-stroke adverse outcomes at 1 and 3 months compared to patients with normal HDL-C levels and GG + GA genotype. These findings suggest that the combined effects of ABCA1 genetic variants with either low or high HDL-C levels could further heighten this risk."
Results of two cross-sectional database analyses regarding nap-induced modulations of tinnitus,"The influence of naps on tinnitus was systematically assessed by exploring the frequency, clinical and demographic characteristics of this phenomenon. 9,724 data from two different tinnitus databases (Tinnitus Hub: n = 6115; Tinnitus Research Initiative (TRI): n = 3627) were included. After separate analysis of the databases, these results were then compared with each other. In the Tinnitus Hub survey database, a total of 31.1% reported an influence on tinnitus by taking a nap (26.9% in the TRI database), with much more frequent worsening after a nap than improvement (23.0% a little or a lot worse; TRI: 17.7% worse; 8.1% a little or a lot better; TRI: 9.2% better). The influence of napping on tinnitus was associated in both databases with other clinical features, such as the dependence of tinnitus on night quality, stress and somatosensory maneuvers. The present study confirms the clinical observation that more tinnitus sufferers report worsening after a nap than tinnitus sufferers reporting an improvement. It was consistently shown that tinnitus sufferers reporting nap-induced modulation of tinnitus also report more frequently an influence of night sleep on their tinnitus. Further clinical and polysomnographic research is warranted to better understand the interaction between sleep and tinnitus."
Development and optimization of a self micro-emulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) for co-administration of sorafenib and curcumin,"In this study, we developed a novel co-administration of curcumin and sorafenib using a Self micro-emulsifying Drug Delivery System (SMEDDS) called Sorafenib-Curcumin Self micro-emulsifying Drug Delivery System (SOR-CUR-SMEDDS). The formulation was optimized using star point design-response surface methodology, and in vitro cellular experiments were conducted to evaluate the delivery ratio and anti-tumor efficacy of the curcumin and sorafenib combination. The SOR-CUR-SMEDDS exhibited a small size distribution of 13.48 ± 0.61 nm, low polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.228 ± 0.05, and negative zeta potential (ZP) of − 12.4 mV. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the SOR-CUR-SMEDDS was 3-fold lower for curcumin and 5-fold lower for sorafenib against HepG2 cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma cells). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and particle size detection confirmed that the SOR-CUR-SMEDDS droplets were uniformly round and within the nano-emulsion particle size range of 10–20 nm. The SMEDDS were characterized then studied for drug release in vitro via dialysis membranes. Curcumin was released more completely in the combined delivery system, showing the largest in vitro drug release (79.20%) within 7 days in the medium, while the cumulative release rate of sorafenib in the release medium was low, reaching 58.96% on the 7 day. In vitro pharmacokinetic study, it demonstrated a significant increase in oral bioavailability of sorafenib (1239.88-fold) and curcumin (3.64-fold) when administered in the SMEDDS. These findings suggest that the SMEDDS formulation can greatly enhance drug solubility, improve drug absorption and prolong circulation in vivo, leading to increased oral bioavailability of sorafenib and curcumin."
Adolescents with Elevated Psychopathic Traits are Associated with an Increased Risk for Premature Mortality,"The mortality rate among adolescents has been steadily increasing in recent years. Researchers have previously identified forms of externalizing psychopathology measured during adolescence associated with an increased risk for premature mortality, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), substance use disorders (SUDs), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder (CD). The current study investigated whether additional personality traits (i.e., adolescent psychopathic traits, assessed via the Hare Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version [PCL:YV]) were also associated with premature mortality risk among maximum-security incarcerated adolescents (N = 332). During a follow-up period ranging from 10 to 14 years, premature mortality was observed in n = 33 participants (9.94%), a mortality rate nearly ten times higher than population norms. We observed that adolescents scoring the highest on PCL:YV total scores exhibited significantly higher rates of premature mortality compared to adolescents scoring lower on PCL:YV total scores via Fisher’s exact tests. Additionally, through univariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses, PCL:YV total, Factor 2 (measuring lifestyle/behavioral and antisocial/developmental psychopathic traits), Facet 1 (measuring interpersonal psychopathic traits), and Facet 3 (measuring lifestyle/behavioral psychopathic traits) scores were associated with faster time to premature mortality. In supplemental analyses performed, we observed that adolescents meeting criteria for externalizing psychopathology (i.e., ADHD, SUDs, ODD, and CD) did not exhibit higher rates of premature mortality compared to control participants. The current study therefore identifies additional maladaptive personality traits to consider in relation to premature mortality risk (i.e., psychopathic traits) among a high-risk sample of incarcerated adolescents."
Flux Calibration of Coronal Magnetic Field,"Romashets and Vandas (2024) derived a method for the determination of Euler potentials at a spherical surface and applied it to the geomagnetic field. Here, we apply it to find Euler potentials at the source surface. A regular mesh defined by Euler potentials divides the source surface to surface elements with the same magnetic flux. By tracing magnetic-field lines away from the source surface, Euler potentials can be extended into the heliosphere."
Elliptic deformation of the Gaiotto-Rapčák corner VOA and the associated partially symmetric polynoimals,"We construct the elliptic Miura transformation and use it to obtain the expression of the currents of elliptic corner VOA. We subsequently prove a novel combinatorial formula that is essential for deriving the quadratic relations of the currents. In addition, we give a conjecture that relates the correlation function of the currents of elliptic corner VOA to a certain family of partially symmetric polynomials. The elliptic Macdonald polynomials, constructed recently by Awata-Kanno- Mironov-Morozov-Zenkevich, and Fukuda-Ohkubo-Shiraishi, can be obtained as a particular case of this family."
Moderating Effects of Housing Tenure Change on the Longitudinal Relationship Between Housing Relocation and Life Satisfaction,"This study aimed to estimate (a) trajectories of life satisfaction before and after housing relocation and (b) how changes in housing tenure at the time of relocation affect life satisfaction trajectories. Using data from the Korea Welfare Panel Study spanning 2006 to 2021 (N = 9,369), we examined the anticipatory, immediate, and long-term impacts of housing relocation on life satisfaction. We employed individual-level fixed effects models. This study also conducted housing tenure-stratified analysis to determine whether changes in tenure at the time of relocation affect the longitudinal association between housing relocation and life satisfaction. Our study found that life satisfaction decreased in the year leading up to housing relocation but showed an immediate increase during the relocation year. However, this rebound did not result in a long-term improvement, as life satisfaction eventually returned to baseline levels. Regarding housing tenure changes, persistent owner-occupiers experienced an immediate increase in life satisfaction during the year of relocation, while persistent renters did not experience any significant changes in life satisfaction before or after relocation. Individuals transitioning from renters to owner-occupiers reported higher levels of life satisfaction both before and after relocation. In contrast, those transitioning from owner-occupiers to renters experienced a decline in life satisfaction before relocation, with no significant changes in the year of relocation or afterward. These findings highlight the varying impacts of housing relocation on life satisfaction, influenced by changes in housing tenure."
Robust IMPT and follow-up toxicity in skull base chordoma and chondrosarcoma—a single-institution clinical experience,"Chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the skull base are rare, slowly growing malignant bone neoplasms. Despite their radioresistant properties, proton therapy has been successfully used as an adjunct to resection or as a definitive treatment. Herewith, we present our experience with robustly optimized intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) and related toxicities in skull base chordoma and chondrosarcoma patients treated at HollandPTC, Delft, the Netherlands."
Effect of Biochar Addition on Biogas Production Using Konjac Waste through Mesophilic Two-Phase Anaerobic Digestion,This study aimed to investigate the influence of biochar supplementation in the mesophilic two-phase anaerobic digestion process for konjac waste.
A case study of supporting group awareness to facilitate CSCL through a minimalist approach,"Group awareness tools have garnered significant interest within the realm of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), as they foster collaborative learning behaviors. However, in the context of a CSCL environment devoid of rich technologies, supporting group awareness is challenging. Contextualized in a teacher professional development course in a large normal university in southwestern China, this study followed a minimalist approach to develop group awareness support through collaborating authoring software. An 8-week-long quasi-experiment was conducted to explore whether supporting group awareness in project-based learning (PBL) through a minimalist approach could (1) improve the quality of group project, and (2) improve students’ participation in collaborative learning. The sample consisted of 125 junior students. Students received regular instruction in stage 1 (week 1 to week 4) and instruction with group awareness support in stage 2 (week 5 to week 8). After each stage, students’ group projects and self-reported surveys were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. It was found that supporting group awareness led to significantly better group performance but did not significantly influence student participation. Group awareness support also contributed to equal involvement among group members. Furthermore, cross-group awareness encouraged students to co-construct knowledge across groups. These findings might help practitioners in economically disadvantaged and technologically underprivileged areas to design group awareness support. It might also benefit instructors who prefer a light-tech solution to support CSCL."
"Baseline renal function modified the association between total, plant or animal protein intake and the risk of developing renal composite outcome in people with type 2 diabetes: a prospective cohort study [diabetes distress and care registry at Tenri (DDCRT25)]","This study aimed to identify the longitudinal associations between protein intake, and composite renal outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes."
Exploring the interplay between kidney function and urinary metabolites in young adults: the African-PREDICT study,"The exposure to modifiable risk factors at young ages have been linked to premature fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. The use of urinary metabolomics has shown strong predictability of kidney function and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We therefore determined the associations between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary metabolites in young adults with and without CVD risk factors. Apparently healthy Black and White sexes were included (aged 20–30 years) and categorised by the presence or absence of risk factors, i.e., obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, excessive alcohol intake, masked hypertension, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and low socio-economic status, forming the CVD risk group (N = 1036), CVD risk clusters (i.e. presenting with 1 CVD risk factor (N = 344), 2 CVD risk factors (N = 360) and 3 + CVD risk factors (N = 332)) and the control group (N = 166). eGFR was calculated with CKD-EPI equations. A targeted metabolomics approach using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure amino acids and acylcarnitines. Lower cystatin C-based eGFR were indicated in the CVD risk group, 2 and 3 + CVD risk clusters compared to the control group (all P ≤ 0.033). In the CVD risk group, eGFR associated positively with histidine, lysine, asparagine, glycine, serine, glutamine, dimethylglycine, threonine, alanine, creatine, cystine, methionine, tyrosine, pyroglutamic acid, leucine/isoleucine, aspartic acid, tryptophan, glutamic acid, free carnitine, acetylcarnitine, propionylcarnitine, isovalerylcarnitine, octanoylcarnitine and decanoylcarnitine (all P ≤ 0.044), with similar results found in the CVD risk clusters, particularly the 2 CVD risk cluster. eGFR was positively associated with metabolites linked to aromatic amino acid and branched-chain amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism and oxidative stress. These findings may indicate altered reabsorption of these metabolites or altered metabolic regulation to preserve renal health in the setting of CVD risk factors at this young age without established CVD."
Note on warped compactification. Finite brane potentials and non-Hermiticity,"We study radius stabilization in the Randall-Sundrum model without assuming any unnaturally large stabilizing scalar potential parameter at the boundary branes (γ) by the frequently used superpotential method. Employing a perturbative expansion in 1/γ2 and the backreaction parameter, we obtain approximate analytical expressions for the radion mass and wavefunction. We validate them through a dedicated numerical analysis, which solves the linearized coupled scalar and metric field equations exactly. It is observed that the radion mass decreases with decreasing γ. Below a critical value of γ, the radion becomes tachyonic, suggesting destabilization of the extra dimension. We also address the issue of non-Hermiticity of the differential operator that determines the radion and Kaluza-Klein (KK) mode wavefunctions in the finite γ limit. It is accomplished by finding an explicit form of the general scalar product that re-establishes the orthogonality in the KK decomposition."
Corrosion Resistance and Wear Response of Plasma Spray Nano-Ceramic Composite Coatings on AZ91D Alloy,"Herein, various combinations of ceramic coatings (A100-100 wt.% Al2O3; AT20-80 wt.% Al2O3 + 20 wt.% TiO2; and AZ20-80 wt.% Al2O3 + 20 wt.% ZrO2) on AZ91D alloys were deposited by optimized plasma spray techniques. Further, the samples were examined for microstructure, phase analysis, corrosion, wear and mechanical properties as per ASTM standards. The corrosion resistance of the coatings was evaluated after a soaking time of 60 min in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. Notably, all coatings exhibited a corrosion rate (mpy) substantially lower than that of AZ91D (31.805): A100 (0.665), AT20 (0.283) and AZ20 (0.341). Moreover, these coatings effectively shielded the AZ91D substrates, with a protection level exceeding 98%, against a corrosive 3.5 wt.% NaCl environment. On the one hand, the coated samples reveal the lower wear rates (mm3/N m) of A100 (0.48 × 10−4), AT20 (0.31 × 10−4) and AZ20 (0.212 × 10−4) compared to AZ91D (11.4 × 10−4). As a result, the composite coatings improved corrosion and wear resistance, thereby extending the life span of magnesium alloys."
Inflight Performance and Calibrations of the Lyman-Alpha Solar Telescope on Board the Advanced Space-Based Solar Observatory,"The Ly\(\alpha \) Solar Telescope (LST) is the first instrument to achieve imaging of the full solar disk and the coronal region in both white light (WL) and ultraviolet (UV) H i Ly\(\alpha \), extending up to 2.5 solar radii (Rs), contributing to solar physics research and space weather forecasting. Since its launch on 9 October 2022, LST has captured various significant solar activity phenomena, including flares, filaments, prominences, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). On-orbit observation and test results show that LST covers a continuous spatial range and the wavelengths of 121.6, 360, and 700 nm. The Ly\(\alpha \) Solar Disk Imager (SDI) has a field of view (FOV) of 38.4′ and a spatial resolution of around 9.5″, while the White-Light Solar Telescope (WST) has an FOV of 38.43′ and a spatial resolution of around 3.0″. The FOV of the Ly\(\alpha \) Solar Corona Imager (SCI) reaches 81.1′ and its spatial resolution is 4.3″. The stray-light level in the 700 nm waveband is about 7.8 × 10−6 MSB at 1.1 Rs and 7.6 × 10−7 MSB at 2.5 Rs, and in Ly\(\alpha \) waveband it is around 4.3 × 10−3 MSB at 1.1 Rs and 4.1 × 10−4 MSB at 2.5 Rs (MSB: mean solar brightness). This article will detail the results from on-orbit tests and calibrations."
Epistemic logic with partial grasp,"We have to gain from recognizing a relation between epistemic agents and the parts of subject matters that play a role in their cognitive lives. I call this relation “grasping”. Namely, I zone in on one notion of having a partial grasp of a subject matter—that of agents grasping part of the subject matter that they are attending to—and characterize it. I propose that giving up the idealization that we fully grasp the subject matters we attend to allows one to more realistically characterize the epistemic life of agents. To show this, I propose an epistemic logic with partial grasp that has in mind considerations from first-order aboutness theory with the aim of avoiding certain forms of logical omniscience, and which provides an alternative to immanent closure (Yablo Aboutness, Princeton University Press, 2014)."
Brane mechanics and gapped Lie n-algebroids,"We draw a parallel between the BV/BRST formalism for higher-dimensional (≥ 2) Hamiltonian mechanics and higher notions of torsion and basic curvature tensors for generalized connections in specific Lie n-algebroids based on homotopy Poisson structures. The gauge systems we consider include Poisson sigma models in any dimension and “generalised R-flux” deformations thereof, such as models with an (n + 2)-form-twisted R-Poisson target space. Their BV/BRST action includes interaction terms among the fields, ghosts and antifields whose coefficients acquire a geometric meaning by considering twisted Koszul multibrackets that endow the target space with a structure that we call a gapped almost Lie n-algebroid. Studying covariant derivatives along n-forms, we define suitable polytorsion and basic polycurvature tensors and identify them with the interaction coefficients in the gauge theory, thus relating models for topological n-branes to differential geometry on Lie n-algebroids."
Laser-induced graphene based triboelectric nanogenerator for smart electronic device,"Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and TENG sensors have received great attention in cutting-edged electrical device applications, including energy collectors, wearable electronics, health monitoring, and human-machine interfaces. However, film TENG still has the problem of high cost, complicated production process, low integration and slow production speed. Furthermore, there are problems such as uneven and difficult to cut after processing. Here, laser-induced graphene based TENG (L-TENG) assembled with polyimide (PI) paper was developed for environmental energy harvesting and tactile perception. Laser programmable processing has the advantages of patterning, customization and efficiency, thereby producing diversified TENG in one step. L-TENG can be captured not only for mechanical energy harvesting but also for environmental sensing. By means of laser parameter optimization, L-TENG can produce voltage as high as 245 V. Through special shape design, the performance of L-TENG can be increased from 48 to 94 V. The L-TENG was first applied to wearable devices that collect energy from human movement to drive LED lights. In addition, the smart mask is synchronously made to capture human health information, such as breathing, speaking, detection. The wind energy collection device was constructed to realize the collection of environmental energy. To further illustrate L-TENG multifunctionally applied in the field of sensing, matrix sensor can also be applied by voltage signals to detect gesture touch recognition and writing movement detection. This laser-manufactured TENG using PI paper provides a promising platform for the development of environmental energy capture, flexible tactile sensing, human-computer interaction and intelligent wearable devices."
"Comprehensive assessment of current municipal solid waste management in Chennai, India: a critical case study with real-time analysis","Chennai city has implemented numerous strategies and plans to effectively manage the municipal solid waste by the municipal corporation. One of the prime strategy is the establishment of public–private partnership schemes, which play a crucial role in enhancing waste management practices. This case study focus to assess the conservancy operations carried out by multiple stakeholders in order to identify the strengths and areas for improvement in the waste management system. The study involved a range of strategies, including data collection, interviews, surveys, documentation, quantitative and thematic analysis, triangulation, and validation methods to ensure reliable outcomes. The findings reveal that 12.54% wet waste, 7.42% dry waste, and 0.07% hazardous waste are currently being segregated, while the majority of waste ends up in dumping grounds. Despite of private company’s involvement, waste management practices are not optimized due to inadequate infrastructure, improper placement of facilities, underutilized design capacities, complex routing mechanisms, and outdated waste management plans. To achieve operational excellence and minimize compliance deviations, it is imperative for public sectors to prioritize integration of technological infrastructure and establishing real time regulatory plans and frameworks. As an outcome, full potential of service can be harnessed leading to a more efficient and sustainable waste management system. At the outset, this study emphasizes the need for strategic interventions, improved infrastructure, revised waste management plans, and increased collaboration between public and private sectors to address existing challenges and enhance the waste management practices in Chennai city."
A method for image–text matching based on semantic filtering and adaptive adjustment,"As image–text matching (a critical task in the field of computer vision) links cross-modal data, it has captured extensive attention. Most of the existing methods intended for matching images and texts explore the local similarity levels between images and sentences to align images with texts. Even though this fine-grained approach has remarkable gains, how to further mine the deep semantics between data pairs and focus on the essential semantics in data remains to be quested. In this work, a new semantic filtering and adaptive approach (FAAR) was proposed to ease the above problem. To be specific, the filtered attention (FA) module selectively focuses on typical alignments with the interference of meaningless comparisons eliminated. Next, the adaptive regulator (AR) further adjusts the attention weights of key segments for filtered regions and words. The superiority of our proposed method was validated by a number of qualitative experiments and analyses on the Flickr30K and MSCOCO data sets."
An Economical and Efficient Physico-Chemical Approach for the Reuse of Wastewater in Small and Medium Scale Paint Enterprises,"This study aims to apply the concept of decentralized water treatment to develop an economically viable and stable industrial recycling technology for the treatment and reuse of wastewater from small and medium scale paint enterprises. The effects of coagulant type, coagulant dosage, pH value, coagulant aid type, and dosage, as well as hydraulic mixing parameters on the results were investigated using CODCr, turbidity, and coagulation settling volume ratio as the evaluation indicators during the coagulation process. The coagulation mechanism was discussed in conjunction with the analysis results of microscopic morphology and ζ potential. Activated carbon adsorption was employed as an advanced treatment method, and further studies were conducted on adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherms, and secondary adsorption dynamic tests. Based on the indicators and constraints for recycling water, a practical treatment and reuse scheme for paint wastewater was formulated. A detailed economic analysis of the combined technology was performed using Net Present Value (NPV), considering the specific circumstances. This combined process also demonstrates high removal rates for CODCr (96.4%) and turbidity (99.9%) in actual wastewater. The reuse water rate is 80%, with a maximum of 5 cycles, and the economic benefit over the lifecycle is $2322. This process achieves multiple rounds of reuse for paint wastewater, conserving water resources and reducing the pressure on water treatment, thereby possessing high environmental value and economic feasibility."
Determining the Effects of Operational Parameters and Geotechnical Conditions on the Behavior of Soil–Cement Columns Using a Small-Scale Physical Model in Sandy Soil,"The behavior of jet grouting columns is influenced by several operational and geotechnical parameters, but relatively little attention has been paid to the significance of the initial soil moisture content on the columns. In the current study, a small-scale jet grouting device has been used to create 47 small-scale columns in dry and wet (20% moisture content) sand to investigate the effects of the soil moisture content on the diameter, uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), and the treatment efficiency. The columns were constructed using different injection times, rotational speeds of 10 and 25 rpm, and soil relative densities of 5% and 95% to assess the comparative influence of the moisture content on the effectiveness of other parameters. The results demonstrated that the initial soil moisture had the most significant effect on the column diameter. In sand with a 20% moisture content, the column diameter increased an average of 63% and 87% in loose and dense sand, respectively, compared to dry sand. However, an increase in the injection time in wet sand caused a significant decrease in the treatment efficiency. A 60% decrease in the rotational speed from 25 to 10 rpm had a greater effect on increasing the diameter in dry sand than doubling the injection time. The relative density had a much smaller effect on the column diameter created in wet sand than in dry sand. The high cement-to-soil ratio of the columns increased the UCS of the core samples and eliminated the effect of the aforementioned parameters on the UCS."
Relationship between childhood trauma and postpartum psychotic experiences: the role of postnatal anxiety and depression as mediators,"Postpartum psychosis (PP) is a psychological emergency requiring rapid intervention, hospitalization and psychiatric management. However, PP has been neglected in the postpartum literature. Understanding the detrimental consequences of childhood trauma across mother’s life span is crucial to prevent this serious condition. The study’s objectives were to demonstrate the relationship between childhood trauma and postpartum psychotic experiences (PPEs) and to look over the mediating role of postnatal depression (PD) and anxiety (PA) in this relationship."
Genome-wide characterization of DELLA gene family in blueberry (Vaccinium darrowii) and their expression profiles in development and response to abiotic stress,"The DELLA proteins, a class of GA signaling repressors, belong to the GRAS family of plant-specific nuclear proteins. Members of DELLA gene family encode transcriptional regulators with diverse functions in plant development and abiotic stress responses. To date, DELLAs have been identified in various plant species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Malus domestica, Populus trichocarpa, and other land plants. Most information of DELLA family genes was obtained from A. thaliana, whereas little is known about the DELLA gene family in blueberry."
Spatially controllable and mechanically switchable isomorphous organoferroeleastic crystal optical waveguides and networks,"The precise, reversible, and diffusionless shape-switching ability of organic ferroelastic crystals, while maintaining their structural integrity, positions them as promising materials for next-generation hybrid photonic devices. Herein, we present versatile bi-directional ferroelasticity and optical waveguide properties of three isomorphous, halogen-based, Schiff base organic crystals. These crystals exhibit sharp bending at multiple interfaces driven by molecular movement around the CH = N bond and subsequent 180° rotational twinning, offering controlled light path manipulation. The ferroelastic nature of these crystals allowed the construction of robust hybrid photonic structures, including Z-shaped configurations, closed-loop networks, and staircase-like hybrid optical waveguides. This study highlights the potential of shape-switchable organoferroelastic crystals as waveguides for applications in programmable photonic devices."
Prediction model for lateral lymph node metastasis of papillary thyroid carcinoma in children and adolescents based on ultrasound imaging and clinical features: a retrospective study,The presence of lateral lymph node metastases (LNM) in paediatric patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is an independent risk factor for recurrence. We aimed to identify risk factors and establish a prediction model for lateral LNM before surgery in children and adolescents with PTC.
Spectrum invariance dilemma for nonuniformly kinematically similar systems,"We unveil instances where nonautonomous linear systems manifest distinct nonuniform \(\mu \)-dichotomy spectra despite admitting nonuniform \((\mu , \varepsilon )\)-kinematic similarity. Exploring the theoretical foundations of this lack of invariance, we discern the pivotal influence of the parameters involved in the property of nonuniform \(\mu \)-dichotomy such as in the notion of nonuniform \((\mu , \varepsilon )\)-kinematic similarity. To effectively comprehend these dynamics, we introduce the stable and unstable optimal ratio maps, along with the \(\varepsilon \)-neighborhood of the nonuniform \(\mu \)-dichotomy spectrum. These new concepts provide a framework for understanding scenarios governed by the noninvariance of the nonuniform \(\mu \)-dichotomy spectrum."
Application of URANS Simulation and Experimental Validation of Axial Flow-Induced Vibrations on a Blunt-End Cantilever Rod for Nuclear Applications,"Fretting wear caused by flow-induced vibration (FIV) is a leading cause of fuel failure in light water nuclear reactors. This study describes a numerical methodology, validated with dedicated experiments, for predicting flow-induced vibrations in cantilever rods exposed to axial water flow, a paradigmatic configuration informative for fuel rods in water-cooled nuclear reactor cores. Utilising strong two-way fluid–structure interaction (FSI) simulations with an efficient computational approach, the study focuses on two key aspects of self-excited FIV: the dominant vibration frequency and the amplitude of the vibration. Correctly reproducing the former depends on optimising the solid domain and FSI coupling, while the latter hinges on the fluid solver’s ability to accurately replicate unsteady flow behaviour, especially in areas of flow separation. Two unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes turbulence models, both being high-Reynolds number versions, and several discretisation schemes for the convection transport are evaluated for their capacity to reproduce the correct unsteady flow behaviour. When the axial flow is directed from the free end to the fixed end of the rod, both the Eddy viscosity model k-\(\omega \) SST and the Reynolds stress model by Launder, Reece, and Rodi reliably predicted the frequency and amplitude of vibrations for a Reynolds number range between 16.4k and 61.7k. When the flow direction is reversed, while vibration frequencies were accurately modelled, replicating precise unsteady flow behaviour proved more challenging. The study underscores the importance of properly resolving the flow in areas of flow separation to achieve accurate simulation of unsteady flow behaviour."
A deep convolutional neural network approach using medical image classification,"The epidemic diseases such as COVID-19 are rapidly spreading all around the world. The diagnosis of epidemic at initial stage is of high importance to provide medical care to and recovery of infected people as well as protecting the uninfected population. In this paper, an automatic COVID-19 detection model using respiratory sound and medical image based on internet of health things (IoHT) is proposed. In this model, primarily to screen those people having suspected Coronavirus disease, the sound of coughing used to detect healthy people and those suffering from COVID-19, which finally obtained an accuracy of 94.999%. This approach not only expedites diagnosis and enhances accuracy but also facilitates swift screening in public places using simple equipment. Then, in the second step, in order to help radiologists to interpret medical images as best as possible, we use three pre-trained convolutional neural network models InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3 and EfficientNetB4 and two data sets of chest radiology medical images, and CT Scan in a three-class classification. Utilizing transfer learning and pre-existing knowledge in these models leads to notable improvements in disease diagnosis and identification compared to traditional techniques. Finally, the best result obtained for CT-Scan images belonging to InceptionResNetV2 architecture with 99.414% accuracy and for radiology images related to InceptionV3 and EfficientNetB4 architectures with the accuracy is 96.943%. Therefore, the proposed model can help radiology specialists to confirm the initial assessments of the COVID-19 disease."
Shifting Towards Didactic Thinking Development as a Tool for Mathematics Teachers’ Agency,"Contributing to a scientific field is not always a scenic route. One cannot always act in the world according to the posted signs others have thought constituted relevant information. In doing so, one would prevent itself from taking uncharted roads with possibly much to discover. This autoethnographic journey of a didactician of mathematics tells the story of what might happen if we take a side road. Moving from a deficit-oriented perspective of professional development, summarized as teaching didactic knowledge to teachers, to contributing to the development of the teachers’ didactic thinking as a tool for agency is not easy. To do so, one needs to become conscious he needs to listen to the other, really listen, which can be risky. I needed to listen to what Ms. Callaghan had to say and she needed to listen to what Javier, her student, had to say, even if it did not fit our respective intended narratives. This is the story of how a didactician and a teacher worked together to raise each other’s consciousness and bring forth a new orientation for the development of a didactic of mathematics that anchors itself in and for actual people teaching–learning mathematics."
Enhancing Mechanical Performance of Friction Stir Welded AZ31 Magnesium Alloy with Nano-TiC Reinforcements Using Grey Relational Analysis,"The solid-state joining method known as friction stir welding has recently gained popularity because of the many benefits it provides in terms of mechanical characteristics and weld quality. Using a Grey Rational Coefficient optimization strategy to examine the effect of Titanium Carbide nanoparticles (TiCnp) reinforcement on welds of Grade AZ31 magnesium alloy. The key parameters under investigation include TiCnp content (ranging around 1.5 wt%), tilt angle (0°, 1°, and 2°), tool rotation speed (1000, 1250, and 1500 rpm), tool profile shape (Square, Cylinder, and Triangle), traverse feed rate (25, 50, and 75 mm/min), and axial load (5, 10, and 15 kN). The mechanical parameters tested in this research comprise micro hardness, tensile strength, wear rate, and impact strength. The findings reveal that when the TiCnp concentration is tuned within the prescribed range, welds with a peak tensile strength of 242 MPa significantly improve mechanical characteristics. In this study the value of 1250-rpm rotational speed, 50 mm/min traverse speed, 1° tilt angle and tool profile shape square is significantly increases the mechanical properties. Adding of TiCnp with AZ31 Mg alloy is widely increase the tensile strength up to 230 MPa, micro hardness about 70 MPa, impact strength 89.34 MPa and wear rate of 0.0046 m3/m."
Shear behavior of short stud in I-beam-ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) composite structure,"As the connecting component of I-beam and UHPC, the stud is the basis of the cooperative work of each component, and is crucial to the stability and safety of the structure. To further study the shear behavior of studs in I-beam-UHPC composite structures, the push-out test was carried out by numerical simulation. The numerical simulation is in line with the load-relative slip curve and failure mode obtained by the experiment, verifying the accuracy of the numerical model. On the basis of verifying the model, the influences of the diameter, height and ultimate tensile strength of the stud on the relative slip curve, shear strength, yield strength and shear stiffness of the stud are studied. The findings indicate that a stud with a diameter of 22 mm exhibits a shear strength 156% greater than that of a stud with a diameter of 10 mm. Additionally, the yield strength increases by 135%, and the shear stiffness by 160 kN, highlighting the significant impact of stud diameter on shear resistance. When the ratio of length to diameter is less than 2.7, the shear strength of the stud increases with the height of the stud. The shear strength of a stud with a length-to-diameter ratio of 2.7 is 35% higher than that of a stud with a ratio of 1.5. The ultimate tensile strength of the stud ranges from 360 to 510 MPa, with only an 11 kN increase in yield strength, indicating that the ultimate tensile strength has a limited influence on shear properties. As the height of the stud decreases, its ultimate tensile strength gradually increases, bringing the numerical model closer to the predicted values. For shorter studs with higher ultimate tensile strength, the finite element simulation results are closer to the predicted values."
Low platelet to high-density lipoprotein ratio predicts poor short-term prognosis in hepatitis B-related acute-on-chronic liver failure,"Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response, predominantly associated with hepatitis B virus in the Asia-Pacific region, with a high short-term mortality rate. The platelet to high-density lipoprotein ratio (PHR) has been used to predict the prognosis of patients with various inflammatory diseases. We aim to is to use the PHR to predict the short-term prognosis of patients with HBV-ACLF."
Evaluating trends in damage to attractive targeted sugar baits (ATSBs) deployed during the second year of a two-year Phase III trial in Western Zambia,"Attractive Targeted Sugar Baits (ATSBs) are a proposed new vector control tool for malaria that contain sugar and an ingestion toxicant, and are designed to attract and kill sugar-feeding mosquitoes. During a two-arm cluster randomized Phase III trial conducted in Zambia to test the efficacy of ATSB stations on malaria incidence, ATSB stations deployed on eligible household structures within intervention clusters were routinely monitored to ensure their good physical condition and high coverage. This study investigates trends in prevalence and rate of damage to ATSB stations during year 2 of the two-year trial."
"Benvitimod upregulates filaggrin, involucrin and loricrin expressions via aryl hydrocarbon receptor-OVO-like 1 axis","Benvitimod has been successfully used in the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD). However, the mechanism remains to be clarified. We aim to assess the effects of benvitimod on MC903-induced dermatitis in mice and to investigate the effects of benvitimod on filaggrin (FLG), involucrin (IVL), and loricrin (LOR) expressions and possible mechanism. MC903-induced mouse AD model was used to evaluate the effects of benvitimod. Filaggrin, involucrin, and loricrin protein and mRNA expressions in lesions of mice dermatitis were measured by Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR. In vitro, normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) were cultured and benvitimod was used to treat NHEKs primed with IL-4 and IL-13. Then AHR and OVOL1 in NHEKs were knocked down to evaluate the role of AHR and OVOL1 in the effects of benvitimod. Topical treatment of benvitimod repaired skin barrier and alleviated skin inflammation in mouse AD model. This effect was inhibited by pretreatment with an AHR antagonist. Benvitimod upregulated the filaggrin, involucrin, and loricrin expressions in lesions of mouse AD model. In addition, benvitimod upregulated the filaggrin, involucrin, and loricrin expressions in NHEKs. Knockdown of AHR or OVO-like (OVOL)1 abrogated the upregulation of filaggrin, involucrin, and loricrin induced by benvitimod. Benvitimod attenuated MC903-induced mouse dermatitis and upregulated filaggrin, involucrin, and loricrin expressions via AHR-OVOL1 axis."
Unmet community care needs among older adults in China: an observational study on influencing factors,"With the rapidly aging population in China, there is an urgent need to understand and address the community care needs of older adults. This study sought to examine these unmet community care needs of older adults in China and the factors influencing them, with the goal of providing essential groundwork for the development of community care health policies."
A meta-analysis of performance advantages on athletes in multiple object tracking tasks,"This study compared the multiple object tracking (MOT) performance of athletes vs. non-athletes and expert athletes vs. novice athletes by systematically reviewing and meta-analyzing the literature. A systematic literature search was conducted using five databases for articles published until July 2024. Healthy people were included, specifically classified as athletes and non-athletes, or experts and novices. Potential sources of heterogeneity were selected using a random-effects model. Moderator analyses were also performed. A total of 23 studies were included in this review. Regarding the overall effect, athletes were significantly better at MOT tasks than non-athletes, and experts performed better than novices. Subgroup analyses showed that expert athletes had a significantly larger effect than novices, and that the type of sport significantly moderated the difference in MOT performance between the two groups. Meta-regression revealed that the number of targets and duration of tracking moderated the differences in performance between experts and novices, but did not affect the differences between athletes and non-athletes. This meta-analysis provides evidence of performance advantages for athletes compared with nonathletes, and experts compared with novices in MOT tasks. Moreover, the two effects were moderated by different factors; therefore, future studies should classify participants more specifically according to sports levels."
Temporalities of oxytocin for labour augmentation: a mixed-methods study of time factors shaping labour practices in a busy maternity unit in Tanzania,"High rates of labour augmentation with oxytocin have been found in some low- and lower-middle-income countries, causing potential perinatal harm. It is critical to understand the reasons for this overuse. Aim was to explore factors that shape practices around using oxytocin for labour augmentation in a high-volume labour ward in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania."
Elevational variations in climate warming impacts on West Himalayan fir growth,"The Himalayas are undergoing significant changes in temperature and moisture availability due to global climate change. Understanding how these changes affect tree growth is critical for conserving and managing this biodiverse region. To investigate the growth-limiting climatic factors, we collected tree-ring data from Abies pindrow old-growth mountain forests across 3190 to 3700 m a.s.l. in the inner valleys of the Garhwal Himalayas. This area faces significant temperature increases, reduced summer monsoon activity, and decreased winter precipitation. We found that over the past century, tree growth suffered from warm and dry springs and benefited from cool and moist springs, particularly at lower elevations (< 3400 m a.s.l.). Conversely, summer climate dynamics had minimal impact on radial growth. The sensitivity of Abies growth to spring climate can be attributed to the inner valleys’ continental climate, marked by spring water deficit. Additionally, higher elevation trees (> 3400 m a.s.l.) showed positive correlations with dormant period temperatures in prior October and January, with the positive effect of October warmth strengthening over time. A dynamic analysis of the impact of spring (March–May) temperature, precipitation and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index revealed a recent unification (the 1980–2010s) of the climate–growth relationship across elevations. Specifically, the low-elevation trees have become less sensitive to warm springs, while the high-elevation trees have only recently become sensitive to warm and dry springs. The varying growth responses along the elevation gradient highlight the necessity of site-dependent differentiation when assessing the impacts of global climate change on species performance and geographic range shifts."
An atlas of the human liver diurnal transcriptome and its perturbation by hepatitis C virus infection,"Chronic liver disease and cancer are global health challenges. The role of the circadian clock as a regulator of liver physiology and disease is well established in rodents, however, the identity and epigenetic regulation of rhythmically expressed genes in human disease is less well studied. Here we unravel the rhythmic transcriptome and epigenome of human hepatocytes using male human liver chimeric mice. We identify a large number of rhythmically expressed protein coding genes in human hepatocytes of male chimeric mice, which includes key transcription factors, chromatin modifiers, and critical enzymes. We show that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a major cause of liver disease and cancer, perturbs the transcriptome by altering the rhythmicity of the expression of more than 1000 genes, and affects the epigenome, leading to an activation of critical pathways mediating metabolic alterations, fibrosis, and cancer. HCV-perturbed rhythmic pathways remain dysregulated in patients with advanced liver disease. Collectively, these data support a role for virus-induced perturbation of the hepatic rhythmic transcriptome and pathways in cancer development and may provide opportunities for cancer prevention and biomarkers to predict HCC risk."
"Pupils’ gendered experiences in the mathematics classroom: “When you’re in a class with such dominant boys, it’s not easy to put yourself forward”","Many studies worldwide conclude that there are no significant differences between the academic performance of boys and girls in school mathematics. In fact, girls are often found to outperform boys in several countries. However, girls and women continue to participate less in mathematics classrooms and have lower enrolment rates in STEM-related subjects. To investigate this paradox, we utilise the theoretical framework of figured worlds (Holland, Lachicotte, Skinner, and Cain in Identity and agency in cultural worlds, Harvard University Press, 1998) and examine how a group of three boys and a group of four girls experience participation in the mathematics classroom. All children had attended the same 9th grade (ages 14–15) in Norway. Based on focus-group and individual interviews with the children, this study identifies three themes around which children construct their experiences: (a) gendered participation in the mathematics classroom, (b) what it means to be a ‘good’ mathematics pupil, and (c) the teacher’s role in fostering pupil participation. In closing, we discuss implications of our work and make recommendations for future research."

Emigration of Juvenile Tarpon Megalops atlanticus from Ephemerally Connected Coastal Ponds,"Worldwide, coastal wetlands are threatened by disrupted hydrology, urbanization, and sea-level rise. In southwest Florida, coastal wetlands include tidal creeks and coastal ponds, which are the primary habitats used by juvenile Tarpon, Megalops atlanticus, an important sport fish. Coastal ponds can occur near uplands and are ephemerally connected to the open estuary, creating conditions of variable dissolved oxygen and salinity. Juveniles can tolerate wide-ranging abiotic conditions, but little is known about how they egress from their remote nursery habitats, which often requires them to cross > 1 km of mangrove forest to reach the open estuary. The objective of this study was to (1) compare Tarpon body condition among ponds close to the open estuary versus those ponds farther away on the Cape Haze peninsula of Charlotte Harbor, Florida, and (2) using acoustic telemetry determine what factors contribute to Tarpon emigration from the ponds to open estuarine waters. We tested the hypothesis that distinct groups of Tarpon occur in isolated ponds, leading to variation in fish length and body condition, and that opportunities for emigration from these ponds hinge on high water events. No pond stood out as having Tarpon of low body condition. Factors contributing to increased probabilities of Tarpon emigration were low barometric pressure, high-water level, and Tarpon body length. Tarpon emigrated from ponds near tidal creeks during summer king tides, while tropical cyclone conditions were needed to allow for movement from ponds farther in the landscape. The juvenile Tarpon were later detected at the mouths of large rivers 30 km up-estuary. The characterizations of water levels and event criteria needed for successful Tarpon nurseries should aid in habitat conservation and the creation of Tarpon nursery habitat in restoration designs."
"Assessment of solid waste quantity considering pertinent factors: a case study of Cuttack City, Odisha, India","Solid waste management is a critical issue in India as the country continues to develop. Accurately estimating the types, quantities, and distribution of solid waste is essential for effective waste management. The methods and processes for managing waste in any city, including collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal, rely heavily on accurate estimations of waste quantities. These estimates are in turn influenced by various factors, including socio-cultural, economic, environmental, political, and technological factors. The research aims to identify specific social and spatial factors that influence solid waste generation in municipal cities of the present times through a literature study. It then undertakes the study of a selected area in the city of Cuttack, Orissa, India, as a case study and formulates a model for quantifying solid waste based on the measurements of derived indicators. The research utilizes both primary and secondary data to achieve its objectives. The analysis revealed that factors such as monthly family income, house occupancy, and occupation have a strong positive correlation with the quantity of solid waste. Conversely, factors such as educational qualification and the incentive system provided to citizens exhibit a negative correlation with the amount of solid waste generated. Based on these factors, the model derived will facilitate the accurate estimation of solid waste generated in similar contexts, thereby aiding efficient waste management. By conducting this case study in Cuttack City, we aim to contribute to the existing body of knowledge on solid waste management in India and provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting waste quantity."
Model-agnostic variable importance for predictive uncertainty: an entropy-based approach,"In order to trust the predictions of a machine learning algorithm, it is necessary to understand the factors that contribute to those predictions. In the case of probabilistic and uncertainty-aware models, it is necessary to understand not only the reasons for the predictions themselves, but also the reasons for the model’s level of confidence in those predictions. In this paper, we show how existing methods in explainability can be extended to uncertainty-aware models and how such extensions can be used to understand the sources of uncertainty in a model’s predictive distribution. In particular, by adapting permutation feature importance, partial dependence plots, and individual conditional expectation plots, we demonstrate that novel insights into model behaviour may be obtained and that these methods can be used to measure the impact of features on both the entropy of the predictive distribution and the log-likelihood of the ground truth labels under that distribution. With experiments using both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the utility of these approaches to understand both the sources of uncertainty and their impact on model performance."
Diagnostic challenges and outcome of fatty acid oxidation defects in a tertiary care center in Lebanon,"Fatty acid oxidation defects are rare autosomal recessive disorders with variable clinical manifestations and outcome. Early detection by systematic neonatal screening may improve their prognosis. Long-term outcome studies of these disorders in the Middle East and North Africa region are limited. The purpose of this study is to report the diagnostic challenges and outcome of fatty acid oxidation defects in a major tertiary care center in Lebanon, a resource-constrained country in the Middle East."
PRDM16-DT is a novel lncRNA that regulates astrocyte function in Alzheimer’s disease,"Astrocytes provide crucial support for neurons, contributing to synaptogenesis, synaptic maintenance, and neurotransmitter recycling. Under pathological conditions, deregulation of astrocytes contributes to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). While most research in this field has focused on protein-coding genes, non-coding RNAs, particularly long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), have emerged as significant regulatory molecules. In this study, we identified the lncRNA PRDM16-DT as highly enriched in the human brain, where it is almost exclusively expressed in astrocytes. PRDM16-DT and its murine homolog, Prdm16os, are downregulated in the brains of AD patients and in AD models. In line with this, knockdown of PRDM16-DT and Prdm16os revealed its critical role in maintaining astrocyte homeostasis and supporting neuronal function by regulating genes essential for glutamate uptake, lactate release, and neuronal spine density through interactions with the RE1-Silencing Transcription factor (Rest) and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). Notably, CRISPR-mediated overexpression of Prdm16os mitigated functional deficits in astrocytes induced by stimuli linked to AD pathogenesis. These findings underscore the importance of PRDM16-DT in astrocyte function and its potential as a novel therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders characterized by astrocyte dysfunction."
Square values of Littlewood polynomials,"We study the square values of Littlewood polynomials. Using various methods we give all these values for the degrees \(n=3, 5\) and \(n\le 24\) even. Beside this, we gather computational data (by providing all solutions in a certain range) for n odd with \(n\le 17\). We propose some striking problems for further research, as well."
Intra-familial dynamics of knowledge and ignorance experienced by donor-conceived adults in Germany,"This study explores how donor-conceived adults experience pre- and post-disclosure intra-familial dynamics of knowledge and ignorance in relation to their means of conception. Data were collected through an online survey of 59 individuals aged 21–46 years, who were recruited through the German support and advocacy group Verein Spenderkinder (the Association of Donor-conceived Children). Participants were born into families with heterosexual parents and learned about their conception via anonymous sperm donation between 5 and 46 years of age. Thematic qualitative text analysis revealed four main themes regarding the challenges donor-conceived adults face in reconciling their sense of identity and their relationships within the family: non-absoluteness of pre-disclosure ignorance, new fields of ignorance emerging post-disclosure, ways of dealing with the newly acquired knowledge, and conflicting ownership claims on knowledge and ignorance. These challenges pertain not only to knowledge and ignorance of the participants’ means of conception but also to the way in which (non-)knowing is perceived and managed by family members. Utilizing Peter Wehling’s taxonomy of ignorance as a theoretical framework, the study argues that intra-familial conflicts and challenges experienced by the participants can be attributed to either shifts in or stakeholders’ colliding claims to control the epistemic, social, and temporal dimensions of (non-)knowing in relation to the participants being donor-conceived."
Acute toxicity of sodium chloride-based road salt formulations to juvenile aquatic invertebrates,"Globally millions of tons of de-icing agents are applied each year, and about half of these salts enter surface water adjacent to sites of application. While numerous studies have demonstrated the potential impact de-icing agents such as NaCl have on freshwater invertebrates, many of these studies have used laboratory grade NaCl for evaluation, and less is known about the relative toxicity of formulations. The purpose of this study was to compare the 24 and 96 h LC50s of NaCl and two NaCl-based road salt formulations for three aquatic species: juvenile Hyalella azteca, Hexagenia rigida, and Chironomous dilutus. As expected, LC50 values were greater for 24 h exposures than 96 h exposures. However, the relative toxicity of the road salt formulations varied by exposure duration and species.    Although the acute LC50 values found in this study were within environmental concentrations of chloride ions reported by existing literature, more research is needed to evaluate chronic or sublethal effects of road salt formulations on a range of freshwater macroinvertebrates."
Identification and culture of functional salivary gland ductal epithelial cells,"Sialadenitis is a prevalent salivary gland disease resulting in decreased salivary flow rate. To date, little is known about the exact changes and mechanism of ductal cells in sialadenitis. This study aims to establish an efficient method to identify and isolate ductal cells, thereby facilitating further research on this specific cell type. Immunofluorescence for cytokeratin 13 and cytokeratin 19 was conducted in salivary glands to confirm their specificity as ductal cell markers. The dissected ducts were assessed through PCR and Western blot of cytokeratin 19 and digested by dispase and collagenase. The functionality of the isolated ductal cells was determined by measuring intracellular calcium. Cytokeratin 19 and cytokeratin 13 were expressed in all segments of human ducts. Cytokeratin 19 was limited to ducts excluding granular convoluted tubules in rat and mouse. The purities of the obtained ductal cells were approximately 98% in humans and 93% in rats. Furthermore, intracellular free calcium increased with time and concentration of carbachol treatment. Cytokeratin 19 serves as a dependable marker for identifying ductal cells in salivary glands, except for granular convoluted tubules. Moreover, we have successfully developed an efficient method for isolating ductal cells from salivary glands."
Enhanced recovery and reduced conversion rates in robotic rectal cancer surgery: a single-center retrospective cohort study,"This study aimed to compare the outcomes of robotic-assisted rectal resection with conventional laparoscopic and open approaches, focusing on complication rates, conversion rates, length of hospital stay, and oncologic outcomes."
Post-discharge functional outcomes in older patients with sepsis,"The post-discharge prognosis of patients with sepsis remains a crucial issue; however, few studies have investigated the relationship between pre-sepsis health status and subsequent prognosis in a large population. This study aimed to examine the effect of the pre-sepsis care needs level on changes in care needs and mortality in patients with sepsis 1 year post-discharge."
"Sm3+-substituted NiZnCd nanoferrites: synthesis, magnetic interactions, and DC electrical resistivity characteristics","The sol–gel auto-combustion method was used to prepared 5Zn0.4Cd0.1Fe2-xSmxO4 (x = 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08) doped with rare earth Sm3+. To adjust the structural, DC electrical resistivity, and magnetic characteristics of the spinel ferrites, rare earth Sm3+ was doped. As a result, using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field effect scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), two-probe technique, and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), respectively, researchers investigated the systematic impact of Sm3+ on the structural, morphological, DC resistivity, and magnetic studies. The synthesized materials' ability to form a single-phase nanostructure was confirmed by XRD investigation. Images captured by field effect scanning electron microscopy show that all samples exhibit spherical nanocrystalline activity. Spinel formation was verified using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). NiZnCd ferrite's magnetic properties are examined to Sm3+ doping using vivid sample magnetometry spectra. Coercivity values and saturation magnetization decrease due to the increased Sm3+ doping. Data on saturation magnetization, coercivity, and remanence magnetization were obtained from the Sm3+ doping of NiZnCd micro ferrites. These results suggest that the device may find use in magnetic recording and memory applications. A two-probe approach is used to measure the DC electrical resistivity, which reveals the semiconducting nature. The carrier concentration and activation energy were found using data on DC electrical resistivity and were subsequently linked to Sm3+ replacement. The DC electrical resistivity testing of the prepared ferrite samples was conducted using a standard two-probe method."
The Medial Prefrontal Cortex-Basolateral Amygdala Circuit Mediates Anxiety in Shank3 InsG3680 Knock-in Mice,"Anxiety disorder is a major symptom of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with a comorbidity rate of ~40%. However, the neural mechanisms of the emergence of anxiety in ASD remain unclear. In our study, we found that hyperactivity of basolateral amygdala (BLA) pyramidal neurons (PNs) in Shank3 InsG3680 knock-in (InsG3680+/+) mice is involved in the development of anxiety. Electrophysiological results also showed increased excitatory input and decreased inhibitory input in BLA PNs. Chemogenetic inhibition of the excitability of PNs in the BLA rescued the anxiety phenotype of InsG3680+/+ mice. Further study found that the diminished control of the BLA by medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and optogenetic activation of the mPFC-BLA pathway also had a rescue effect, which increased the feedforward inhibition of the BLA. Taken together, our results suggest that hyperactivity of the BLA and alteration of the mPFC-BLA circuitry are involved in anxiety in InsG3680+/+ mice."
Data-access performance anti-patterns in data-intensive systems,"Data-intensive systems handle variable, high-volume, and high-velocity data generated by human and digital devices. Like traditional software, data-intensive systems are prone to technical debts introduced to cope-up with the pressure of time and resource constraints on developers. Data-access is a critical component of data-intensive systems, as it determines their overall performance and functionality. While data access technical debts are getting attention from the research community, technical debts that affect performance are not well investigated. This study aims to identify, categorize, and validate data-access performance anti-patterns. We collected issues from NoSQL-based and polyglot persistence open-source data-intensive systems, implemented in Java programing language, and identified 14 new data access-performance anti-patterns categorized under seven high-level categories. We conducted a developer survey to evaluate the perceived relevance and criticality of the newly identified anti-patterns and found that Improper Handling of Node Failures, Using Synchronous Connection, and Inefficient Driver API performance anti-patterns are the most critical data-access performance anti-patterns. The study findings can help improve the quality of data-intensive software systems by raising awareness of practitioners about the impact of the data-access performance anti-patterns. At the same time, the findings will help quality assurance teams to prioritize the correction of performance anti-patterns based on their criticality."
CrowdChain: A privacy-preserving crowdfunding system based on blockchain and PUF,"Crowdfunding refers to the online collection of certain capital from a vast number of individuals or groups that each contribute a relatively small amount. Recently, the credibility of crowdfunding platforms has been undermined by fraudulent projects, inadequate fund management, and other forms of disorder. The decentralization and anti-tampering features of blockchain provide the possibility to solve the above problems, and many studies have proposed blockchain-based crowdfunding schemes. However, the existing state-of-the-art methods do not provide user authentication, transaction auditing, and identity management in a privacy-preserving way. Accordingly, this paper presents a novel blockchain-based crowdfunding system called CrowdChain. Initially, the distributed identity and BLS signature are employed to establish a user authentication mechanism, enabling CrowdChain to withstand Sybil attacks while preserving the non-linkability of user identities. Secondly, the physically unclonable function (PUF) is used to generate keys associated with digital identities that are not stored in external devices to resist physical attacks. Subsequently, a crowdfunding mechanism is constructed utilizing zero-knowledge proofs to facilitate streamlined auditing procedures while safeguarding the confidentiality of transactions. Additionally, the formal security analysis proves the security of the CrowdChain scheme. The system prototype is implemented on the Hyperledger Fabric. Empirical evidence indicates the viable efficiency of CrowdChain."
Hemodynamic tolerability and efficacy of hemodialysis modalities in critically ill patients,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequently seen in critically ill patients and is associated with high mortality and morbidity. However, the optimal dialysis modality in such patients remains controversial. We examined the hemodynamic tolerability of hemodialysis modalities in critically ill individuals with AKI."
ATAXIN-2 intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions elicit ALS-associated metabolic and immune phenotypes,"Intermediate-length repeat expansions in ATAXIN-2 (ATXN2) are the strongest genetic risk factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). At the molecular level, ATXN2 intermediate expansions enhance TDP-43 toxicity and pathology. However, whether this triggers ALS pathogenesis at the cellular and functional level remains unknown. Here, we combine patient-derived and mouse models to dissect the effects of ATXN2 intermediate expansions in an ALS background. iPSC-derived motor neurons from ATXN2-ALS patients show altered stress granules, neurite damage and abnormal electrophysiological properties compared to healthy control and other familial ALS mutations. In TDP-43Tg-ALS mice, ATXN2-Q33 causes reduced motor function, NMJ alterations, neuron degeneration and altered in vitro stress granule dynamics. Furthermore, gene expression changes related to mitochondrial function and inflammatory response are detected and confirmed at the cellular level in mice and human neuron and organoid models. Together, these results define pathogenic defects underlying ATXN2-ALS and provide a framework for future research into ATXN2-dependent pathogenesis and therapy."
Comparative case study on NAMs: towards enhancing specific target organ toxicity analysis,"Traditional risk assessment methodologies in toxicology have relied upon animal testing, despite concerns regarding interspecies consistency, reproducibility, costs, and ethics. New Approach Methodologies (NAMs), including cell culture and multi-level omics analyses, hold promise by providing mechanistic information rather than assessing organ pathology. However, NAMs face limitations, like lacking a whole organism and restricted toxicokinetic interactions. This is an inherent challenge when it comes to the use of omics data from in vitro studies for the prediction of organ toxicity in vivo. One solution in this context are comparative in vitro–in vivo studies as they allow for a more detailed assessment of the transferability of the respective NAM data. Hence, hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic pesticide active substances were tested in human cell lines and the results subsequently related to the biology underlying established effects in vivo. To this end, substances were tested in HepaRG and RPTEC/tERT1 cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations and analyzed for effects on the transcriptome and parts of the proteome using quantitative real-time PCR arrays and multiplexed microsphere-based sandwich immunoassays, respectively. Transcriptomics data were analyzed using three bioinformatics tools. Where possible, in vitro endpoints were connected to in vivo observations. Targeted protein analysis revealed various affected pathways, with generally fewer effects present in RPTEC/tERT1. The strongest transcriptional impact was observed for Chlorotoluron in HepaRG cells (increased CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 expression). A comprehensive comparison of early cellular responses with data from in vivo studies revealed that transcriptomics outperformed targeted protein analysis, correctly predicting up to 50% of in vivo effects."
Multi-level Reflecting Brownian Motion on the Half Line and Its Stationary Distribution,"A semi-martingale reflecting Brownian motion is a popular process for diffusion approximations of queueing models including their networks. In this paper, we are concerned with the case that it lives on the nonnegative half-line, but the drift and variance of its Brownian component discontinuously change at its finitely many states. This reflecting diffusion process naturally arises from a state-dependent single server queue, studied by the Miyazawa (Diffusion approximation of the stationary distribution of a two-level single server queue, 2024. https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11284). Our main interest is in its stationary distribution, which is important for application. We define this reflecting diffusion process as the solution of a stochastic integral equation, and show that it uniquely exists in the weak sense. This result is also proved in a different way by Atar et al. (Parallel server systems under an extended heavy traffic condition: A lower bound, 2022. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07855). In this paper, we consider its Harris irreducibility and stability, that is, positive recurrence, and derive its stationary distribution under this stability condition. The stationary distribution has a simple analytic expression, likely extendable to a more general state-dependent SRBM. Our proofs rely on the generalized Ito formula for a convex function and local time."
Real-time assessment of relative mitochondrial ATP synthesis response against inhibiting and stimulating substrates (MitoRAISE),"Mitochondria are known to synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. Understanding and accurately measuring mitochondrial ATP synthesis rate can provide insights into the functional status of mitochondria and how it contributes to overall cellular energy homeostasis. Traditional methods only estimate mitochondrial function by measuring ATP levels at a single point in time or through oxygen consumption rates. This study introduced the relative mitochondrial ATP synthesis response against inhibiting and stimulating substrates (MitoRAISE), designed to detect real-time changes in ATP levels as the cells respond to substrates."
Effect of Hemp and Sheep Wool Reinforcements on Mechanical and Acoustic Properties in Natural Fibre Polymer Composite using Vacuum Bag Moulding Process,"Natural Fibre composites are gaining popularity due to their lightweight and high strength properties and these composites are widely used in various applications like, engineering, construction, aircraft, automotive, biomedical and marine sectors. The aim is to investigate the impact of natural fibre reinforcing on mechanical and acoustic characteristics in natural fibre composites. In the current study, a 60:40 (resin: fibre) weight ratio of hemp and sheep wool fibre reinforcements with resin matrix is employed to generate natural fibre composites. Vacuum bag moulding is used to create sandwich-structured composites made of various fibres (hemp and sheep wool). The mechanical and acoustic characteristics of the generated samples are evaluated. The results demonstrate that hemp fibre reinforced polymer composites have the maximum tensile strength of 35.940 MPa when compared to sheep wool fibre reinforced polymer composites. When compared to the hemp-wool-hemp fibre sandwich-structured composite, the acoustic characteristics have a peak value of 0.817 sound absorption coefficient at 500 Hz. The study concludes that these fibres are a feasible alternative to synthetic fibres for sound absorption."
Effects of a deductive structure of oral case presentation on recipient listener’s comprehension,"Oral patient presentations are often presented in a SOAP (subjective–objective-assessment-plan), or inductive structure, which provides a diagnostic anchor at the end of the presentation. Prior qualitative work in surgical education literature has suggested that a deductive structure contributes to an effective oral case presentation by providing the diagnostic anchor early to define the relevancy of subsequent information. This experimental study tests if a deductive structure of presentation improves the recipient’s comprehension."
Network linkages between housing prices and crime risk: evidence from 26 regions in Türkiye,"The increasing housing prices in Türkiye have generated substantial public concern due to their potential to disrupt social and economic stability, exacerbate social inequality, and contribute to criminal issues. This study investigates the multifaceted impacts of housing prices on crime rates within the Turkish context. Utilizing annual data encompassing 26 regions in Türkiye from 2016 to 2019, we adopt a sophisticated mediating effect model to analyze the intricate relationships between pertinent variables. Our findings show that housing prices directly and indirectly influence crime rates. Notably, the mediating role of the Gini coefficient is unveiled, shedding light on its function in moderating the relationship between housing price escalation and crime rates in landTürkiye. This study underscores the pivotal role of economic distortion as a mediating factor in understanding the nexus between rising housing costs and the incidence of criminal activities in the Turkish context."
Diet and food availability of the critically endangered pygmy raccoon (Procyon pygmaeus),"Cozumel Island is one of the most important tourist destinations in Mexico. Unfortunately, this has been associated with a deterioration of the integrity of essential habitats for native fauna, including the Critically Endangered pygmy raccoon (Procyon pygmaeus). Environmental degradation can affect, among other things, their food availability. Here we focused on examining the diet of the pygmy raccoon in two main subpopulations of the species, by analyzing scat samples and assessing (natural and anthropogenic) food availability. Scat analysis showed that crabs are the dominant component of the pygmy raccoon diet, followed by fruits. The frequency of occurrence correlates with temporal (monthly) food availability. Although anthropogenic food sources can be found in both sampling sites, the availability of natural resources was greater. A better understanding of the diet and food resources availability in their habitats is important to understand the impacts of disturbances on wildlife health, distribution, abundance, and survival."
Elevated level of extracellular vimentin is associated with an increased fibrin formation potential in sepsis: ex vivo swine study,"Sepsis can lead to coagulopathy and microvascular thrombosis. Prior studies, including ours, reported an increased level of extracellular vimentin in blood derived from septic patients. Moreover, we identified the contribution of extracellular vimentin to fibrin formation and to the fibrin clot structure ex vivo in plasma from septic patients. Here, we tested the status of plasma vimentin and its impact on fibrin clots using our recently described swine model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sepsis-induced coagulopathy."
Floral morphology and development reveal extreme diversification in some species of Croton (Euphorbiaceae),"Floral diversity of Croton, the second largest genus in Euphorbiaceae, is currently under-explored. Several clades demonstrate an unusual floral morphology, e.g., lower or higher stamen number, bilateral symmetry and reduced ovary, but have never been investigated in a comparative study with typical Croton. This study examined morphology and ontogeny of flowers in nine Croton species from different clades within the genus with light and scanning microscopy, resin sectioning and micro-computed tomography. In staminate flowers, great variations of stamen number and arrangement are observed. The ancestral androecium likely consisted of two or more whorls with the outermost antepetalous stamen whorl developing centrifugally. Modification by reduction of the antepetalous whorl resulted in an outer alternipetalous stamen whorl in Croton section Moacroton, subgenus Quadrilobi. Several species in the subgenus Geiseleria show an independent reduction of stamen numbers by absence of a centrifugal development with the antepetalous whorl the first whorl to develop. Petal losses are observed in the distantly related C. setiger and C. dioicus. Chaotic stamen arrangement is found in C. celtidifolius (subgenus Adenophylli) as a result of a secondary stamen increase. In pistillate flowers, reduction of carpel numbers happened three times in the subgenus Geiseleria. C. monanthogynus has a bicarpellate ovary, while in C. setiger and C. michauxii the ovary is monocarpellate. Reduction of carpel number is linked with merism change and perianth reduction. The ovary in C. michauxii has basal placentation which is unique among all Croton. Moreover, strong bilateral sepals and nectaries are observed in species from section Julocroton. Therefore, the floral diversity of some species in the genus Croton could be explained by developmental modification of an ancestral form via reduction, rearrangement of stamen whorls, and symmetry shifts."
Analysis and profiling of the purple acid phosphatase gene family in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.),"Purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) play a vital role in plant phosphorus nutrition, serving as a crucial family of metallo-phosphoesterase enzymes. This research aimed to identify the PAP genes from the A/B/D genomes of Triticum aestivum to elucidate evolutionary mechanisms of the gene family in plants and provide genomic information for subsequent research on phosphorous-use efficiency in wheat crops. In total, 105 PAP genes (TaPAPs) were identified from the A/B/D genomes by using the Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa PAP protein sequences as queries for BLASTP against the wheat protein database. The TaPAPs were grouped into six subfamilies, Ia (17), Ib (26), IIa (11), IIb (30), IIIa (12), and IIIb (9), based on their similarities in the structure of genes and the presence of conserved protein motifs. A majority of TaPAPs were derived from tandemly (20) or segmentally (87) duplicated, with the homoeologous chromosomes 5A/B/D harboring the most duplicated PAP genes. Further analysis indicated that TaPAPs were responsible for the modulation of seed, root, and leaf development and hormone synthesis and signaling, as well as plant responses to abiotic stresses, including low temperatures, drought, and anaerobic conditions. Nine TaPAPs (TaPAP9-4A/4B/4D, TaPAP24-6A/6B/6D, and TaPAP28-7A/7B/7D) were constitutively expressed in diverse tissues such as root, shoot, leaf, spike, and seed, while the remaining genes exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns. Concerning the response to phosphate (Pi) deprivation, 57 TaPAPs were highly expressed in roots under Pi stress, including TaPAP31-4A, 4B, and 4D homeologs from the subfamily IIIb. A TaPAP31-4A transgene in A. thaliana promoted plant growth and development while increasing plant resistance to Pi-deficiency stress by enhancing the secretion of phosphatase. These discoveries provide a scientific foundation for comprehending the role of TaPAPs, offering valuable insights for identifying additional candidate genes and fostering the development of new wheat varieties with enhanced tolerance to low phosphorus conditions."
"Integration and validation of host transcript signatures, including a novel 3-transcript tuberculosis signature, to enable one-step multiclass diagnosis of childhood febrile disease","Whole blood host transcript signatures show great potential for diagnosis of infectious and inflammatory illness, with most published signatures performing binary classification tasks. Barriers to clinical implementation include validation studies, and development of strategies that enable simultaneous, multiclass diagnosis of febrile illness based on gene expression."
Myths about suicide - validating the Hungarian version of the Literacy of Suicide Scale (H-LOSS) on a community sample,"Suicide was exceptionally high in Hungary in the last century. According to Eurostat, Hungary ranks second in the EU in death by suicide and was among the few countries where the suicidal tendencies increased in 2020. Primary tasks of suicide prevention programs are to develop suicide literacy and dispel myths and misconceptions about suicide. Therefore, the goal of our research was the Hungarian validation of the 26-item Literacy of Suicide Scale (LOSS). Methods: 749 people (382 female (51.0%), 364 male (48.6%), 3 identify as non-binary or other (0.4%); 4 identifying as transgender (0.5%)) participated in our online cross-sectional survey with a mean age of 32.4 years (SD = 14.5 years). The H-LOSS questionnaire was adapted using the 2PL (two-parameter logistic) model with WLSE (weighted least squares) estimation in item response theory method, similarly to the original English version."
Correlation between Charlson comorbidity index and surgical prognosis in elderly patients with femoral neck fractures: a retrospective study,Femoral neck fractures (FNF) are known to have significant morbidity and mortality rates. Multiple chronic conditions (MCC) are defined as the presence of two or more chronic diseases that greatly affect the quality of life in older adults. The aim of this study is to explore the impact of MCC and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) on surgical outcomes in patients with FNF.
Effects of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in people with diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease,"Although the benefits of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) use in chronic kidney disease (CKD) are well established, the effects of these therapeutic agents in patients with advanced CKD are less certain. We hypothesised that the continued use of these drugs, even when renal function deteriorates to stage 4 CKD or worse, is safe and associated with improved cardiorenal survival."
Comparison between imidacloprid effects on AChE and nAChRα1 in target Aphis craccivora and non-target Apis mellifera: experimental and theoretical approaches,"Neonicotinoids are widespread insecticides because of their potent effects against aphids and other piercing-sucking insects in addition to having high selectivity toward insects rather than vertebrates. However, they affect severely some non-target insects, mainly honeybee in a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder (CCD)."
A registry-based comparative analysis of antibiotic usage reporting for adult cattle on Danish dairy farms,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant global health concern, necessitating the monitoring of antimicrobial usage (AMU). However, there is a lack of consensus on the standardized collection and reporting of AMU data in the veterinary field. In Denmark, the Danish Cattle Database (DCDB) contains treatment information on animal level, which allows counting of number of treatments carried out, used daily doses (UDD). The Danish VetStat database (VetStat) contains information on veterinary medicinal prescriptions at farm level and uses fixed standard doses of each product to calculate number of daily treatments, animal daily doses (ADD). This study aimed to compare two different numerators, UDD and ADD, used to describe AMU on Danish cattle farms, and estimate their correlation."
"The comparison of metabolic syndrome parameters, trichoscopic and trichoscan characteristics in androgenetic alopecia (AGA) and early-onset androgenetic alopecia (early-onset AGA)","Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), the most common cause of hair loss, is influenced by various risk factors. Metabolic syndrome constitutes a collection of risk factors elevating the risk of cardiovascular disease. The presence of early-onset AGA could serve as an indicator of the emergence of metabolic syndrome, yet to date, no research has examined these parameters in AGA. This is a cross-sectional study comparing two groups; early onset versus normal onset AGA. Forty participants were enlisted and evenly distributed into the two groups. Subsequently, participants underwent examinations utilizing trichoscopy, trichoscan, and laboratory assessments. Apart from waist circumference, BMI, and age of alopecia onset, there were no notable differences concerning sociodemographic and clinical features. In terms of hair growth parameters, the telogen hair rate stands out as the sole indicator exhibiting a significant difference between both groups, while trichoscopy data also revealed varying hair characteristics. Lastly, metabolic parameters namely triglyceride, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c and HDL differ significantly, with the normal onset group demonstrating a higher prevalence of metabolic abnormality. This suggests a potential association between AGA and metabolic syndrome. However, the exact nature of this relationship remains uncertain, necessitating further research with larger samples, specific age groups and diverse study designs."
Unequal-radius clustering in WSN-based IoT networks: energy optimization and load balancing in UDCOPA protocol,"The internet of things (IoT) is an exponentially growing network of physical objects equipped with sensors, software and network connectivities to collect, process, transmit and receive data. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play an essential role in supporting the IoT. These networks, made up of nodes with the ability to monitor their environment, enable the collection and transmission of specific data in real time, offering enhanced applications and services within IoT networks. This symbiosis between WSN and IoT can be defined as WSN-based IoT. The complexity of WSN-based IoT lies in the effective management of these varied devices, each with its own distinct capabilities. Clustering is a popular technique for reducing the communication load, conserving energy, aggregating data and optimizing the performance of WSN-based IoT systems. Once the cluster heads (CHs) are chosen, conventional clustering algorithms typically use a single radius of clustering (RC) to group devices into multiple clusters. However, this approach may not be optimized for WSN-based IoT networks, as devices may have different features, for example, the residual energy (\(R_{\rm Enrg}\)) and the distance to the base station (DistBS). In a previous work, we proposed the DCOPA (a distributed clustering based on objects performances aggregation for hierarchical communications in IoT applications) protocol for clustering in WSN-based IoT networks. DCOPA applies the same clustering algorithm to the elected CHs, without considering their distinctions in terms of \(R_{\rm Enrg}\) and DistBS. The proposed new approach, called unequal-DCOPA (UDCOPA), allows us to define for each CH its adaptive radius of clustering (ARC) which will be sensitive to the local criteria of \(R_{\rm Enrg}\) and DistBS of the CH concerned. The ARC is modeled as a multicriteria system applied to each CH. Simulation results show that our new UDCOPA approach outperforms DCOPA and LEACH protocols for energy management, load balancing, scalability and network lifetime. UDCOPA increases lifetime by (62.61%) over LEACH and by (32.72%) over DCOPA."
Engineering active and robust alloy-based electrocatalyst by rapid Joule-heating toward ampere-level hydrogen evolution,"Rational design of bimetallic alloy is an effective way to improve the electrocatalytic activity and stability of Mo-based cathode for ampere-level hydrogen evolution. However, it is still critical to realise desirable syntheses due to the wide reduction potentials between different metal elements and uncontrollable nucleation processes. Herein, we propose a rapid Joule heating method to effectively load RuMo alloy onto MoOx matrix. As-prepared catalyst exhibits excellent stability (2000 h @ 1000 mA cm−2) and ultralow overpotential (9 mV, 18 mV and 15 mV in 1 M KOH, 1 M PBS, 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, respectively) at 10 mA cm−2. Based on first-principle simulations and operando measurements, the impressive electrocatalytic stability and activity are investigated. And the role of rapid Joule heating method is highlighted and discussed in details. This study showcases rapid Joule heating as a feasible strategy to construct highly efficient alloy-based electrocatalysts."
Design specifications and capabilities of a 3D simulation software for clinical education of physiotherapy students in the neurology department,"In this revolutionized era, thanks to cutting-edge technological breakthroughs like 3-dimensional (3D) computerized environments, physiotherapy trainers can improve their knowledge and confidence by using such training tools. Hence, there is room for developing these technologies for training medical students to expand their skills and expertise. This study aims to identify the design requirements and key functionalities of a 3D simulation software for the clinical education of physiotherapy students in neurology departments."
Ketamine-assisted buprenorphine initiation: a pilot case series,"Many people with opioid use disorder who stand to benefit from buprenorphine treatment are unwilling to initiate it due to experience with or fear of both spontaneous and buprenorphine-precipitated opioid withdrawal (BPOW). An effective means of minimizing withdrawal symptoms would reduce patient apprehensiveness, lowering the barrier to buprenorphine initiation. Ketamine, approved by the FDA as a dissociative anesthetic, completely resolved BPOW in case reports when infused at a sub-anesthetic dose range in which dissociative symptoms are common. However, most patients attempt buprenorphine initiation in the outpatient setting where altered mental status is undesirable. We explored the potential of short-term use of ketamine, self-administered sublingually at a lower, sub-dissociative dose to assist ambulatory patients undergoing transition to buprenorphine from fentanyl and methadone."
Experimental Investigation on the Variation in Solid Fuel Fire Whirl Properties with Imposed and Fuel Rotation,"This work presents a study on the formation of laboratory- scale fire whirls using forest fuels to replicate real-world fire whirls. A total of 48 experiments are conducted using three distinct types of forest fuels, namely Pinus Roxburghii, Shorea Robusta, and Grevillea Robusta, with three fuel pans of diameter 0.2 m, 0.3 m, and 0.4 m, respectively. Different characteristics such as Mass Burning Rate (MBR), Heat Release Rate (HRR), flame height, flame temperature, radiative heat flux and fire effluents are measured for a range of HRRs 40-346 kW and correlations are developed in terms of circulation and diameter. In comparison to free burning, the HRR was found to be increased by 300% with imposed rotation which was further increased up to 65% with fuel rotation. The flame heights are  also increased by 30% in the case of imposed rotation and 40% with both imposed and fuel rotation. A detailed measurement of fire effluents revealed that their concentrations for fire whirls were reduced in the range of 50% to 400% compared to free burning fires. Furthermore, the developed correlations were applied to fire whirls of HRRs (up to ∼ 1900 kW) and their validity in predicting the characteristics was ensured."
Public mental health services in Southern China and related health outcomes among individuals living with severe mental illness,"Although national policies in China are comprehensive and instructive, a wide disparity exists between different cities. The current status of public mental health services by region in China remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate policies related to public mental health services, the contact coverage of public mental health services and outcomes of service users."
Thermal effects and ephaptic entrainment in Hodgkin–Huxley model,"The brain is understood as an intricate biological system composed of numerous elements. It is susceptible to various physical and chemical influences, including temperature. The literature extensively explores the conditions that influence synapses in the context of cellular communication. However, the understanding of how the brain’s global physical conditions can modulate ephaptic communication remains limited due to the poorly understood nature of ephapticity. This study proposes an adaptation of the Hodgkin and Huxley (HH) model to investigate the effects of ephaptic entrainment in response to thermal changes (HH-E). The analysis focuses on two distinct neuronal regimes: subthreshold and suprathreshold. In the subthreshold regime, circular statistics are used to demonstrate the dependence of phase differences with temperature. In the suprathreshold regime, the Inter-Spike Interval are employed to estimate phase preferences and changes in the spiking pattern. Temperature influences the model’s ephaptic interactions and can modify its preferences for spiking frequency, with the direction of this change depending on specific model conditions and the temperature range under consideration. Furthermore, temperature enhance the anti-phase differences relationship between spikes and the external ephaptic signal. In the suprathreshold regime, ephaptic entrainment is also influenced by temperature, especially at low frequencies. This study reveals the susceptibility of ephaptic entrainment to temperature variations in both subthreshold and suprathreshold regimes and discusses the importance of ephaptic communication in the contexts where temperature may plays a significant role in neural physiology, such as inflammatory processes, fever, and epileptic seizures."
Generalizability and treatment with sodium-glucose co-trasporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) among patients with type 2 diabetes: an assessment using an Italian primary care database,"This study aimed to assess the proportions of type 2 diabetes (T2D) subjects meeting cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) criteria for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and estimate SGLT2i utilization, along with associated demographic and clinical characteristics, in a primary care setting."
Association between intraoperative tidal volume and postoperative acute kidney injury in non-cardiac surgical patients using a propensity score-weighted analysis,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is related to adverse clinical outcomes. Therefore, identifying patients at increased risk of postoperative AKI and proactively providing appropriate care is crucial. However, only a limited number of modifiable risk factors have been recognized to mitigate AKI risk. We retrospectively analyzed adult patients who underwent endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation of more than 2 h during non-cardiac surgery at Seoul National University Hospital from January 2011 to November 2022. Patients were grouped into low- or high-tidal volume groups based on their intraoperative tidal volume relative to their predicted body weight (PBW) of 8 ml/kg. The association between intraoperative tidal volume and postoperative AKI was evaluated using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), adjusting for various preoperative confounders. Among the 37,726 patients included, the incidence of postoperative AKI was 4.1%. The odds of postoperative AKI risk were significantly higher in the high-tidal volume group than in the low-tidal volume group before and after IPTW (odds ratio [OR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–1.32, P = 0.001 and OR: 1.10, 95% CI 1.02–1.19, P = 0.010, respectively). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis after IPTW, a high tidal volume was independently associated with an increased risk of postoperative AKI (OR: 1.21, 95% CI 1.12–1.30, P < 0.001). In this propensity score-weighted analysis, an intraoperative high tidal volume of more than 8 ml/kg PBW was significantly associated with an increased risk of postoperative AKI after IPTW in non-cardiac surgical patients. Intraoperative tidal volume showed potential as a modifiable risk factor for preventing postoperative AKI."
Analysis of energy losses and head produced by a radial impeller using particle image velocimetry,"Centrifugal pumps play a crucial role in industrial operations involving fluid transport. The quest for optimizing efficiency and reducing energy usage is a driving force behind research into their performance. The literature continues to offer opportunities for the creation of models that accurately depict the head generated by pumps, with a particular focus on impellers. The current pumps, however, are still far from being completely optimized. The idea of this paper is to conduct an analysis of energy losses and propose a mathematical expression to represent the head produced by a radial impeller, P23 model, working with water flow, considering that head is influenced by losses due to recirculation, shock/incidence, internal friction. The head losses are quantitatively evaluated from experimental data acquired via particle image velocimetry, which provides information on velocity vector direction and wall shear stress, both useful for the analysis. Our results reveal that the loss due to friction is the most significant, accounting for 40–90% of the total head loss, while shock and recirculation losses are restricted to 35% and 25%, respectively. Friction factors vary from 1.0 to 26 depending on the flow rate, as a result of wall shear stresses reaching up to 430 N/m2, mainly influenced by pressure and pseudoforces. The head calculated through the new proposed expression is finally compared with the actual head generated by the impeller, measured via experiments dedicated to assess the pump performance. According to our results, the relative deviations between the calculated and measured heads are limited to 5%. Although our results have been validated for a single P23 impeller geometry, the methodology developed here can be extended to other impellers in the future. The results may thus represent a step forward for designing more efficient and power-saving pumps."
Comparison of exsanguination and hemostasis devices for Limb surgery: a multicenter randomized controlled study,Excessive intraoperative bleeding remains a challenge in limb surgeries.

"EANM guidelines on the use of [18F]FDG PET/CT in diagnosis, staging, prognostication, therapy assessment, and restaging of plasma cell disorders","We provide updated guidance and standards for the indication, acquisition, and interpretation of [18F]FDG PET/CT for plasma cell disorders. Procedures and characteristics are reported and different scenarios for the clinical use of [18F]FDG PET/CT are discussed. This document provides clinicians and technicians with the best available evidence to support the implementation of [18F]FDG PET/CT imaging in routine practice and future research."
Not all oil types are alike in trade substitution,"Motivated by the ongoing war in Ukraine and the public debate on sanctioning crude oil imports from Russia, we estimate the elasticity of substitution between different crude oil types. Using European data on country-level crude oil imports by their field of origin, we argue that crude oil is far from a homogenous good, and that the relevant substitutability for analyzing the impact of trade sanctions must account for the quality of different oil types in terms of their density and sulfur content. Distinguishing crude oil imports by their chemical composition, the elasticity of substitution between types is substantially lower than suggested by previous estimates. Our results also suggest that, by neglecting these differences in quality, standard estimates underestimate the production disruptions and price effects in crude oil refining resulting from sanctions."
Aerial and terrestrial root habits influence the composition of the cell walls of Vanilla phaeantha (Orchidaceae),"In response to the restrictions imposed by their epiphytic habit, orchids have developed structural traits that allow greater efficiency in water uptake and use, such as a complex adventitious root system with velamen. The composition of cell wall of this specialized epidermis can be altered according to the substrate to which it is fixed, influencing wall permeability, absorption, and storage of water in roots. The current study aimed to evaluate the cell wall composition of adventitious roots of Vanilla phaeantha (Orchidaceae) that grow attached to the phorophyte, fixed in the soil, or hung free. Immunocytochemical analyses were used to determine the protein, hemicellulose, and pectin composition of the cell walls of aerial and terrestrial roots. We observed that pectins are present in the different tissues of the aerial roots, while in the terrestrial roots, they are concentrated in the cortical parenchyma. The deposition of xyloglucans, extensins, and arabinogalactans was greater in the epidermis of the free side of the roots attached to the phorophyte. The strong labeling of pectins in aerial roots may be related to the influx of water and nutrients, which are generally scarce in this environment. The arrangement of hemicelluloses and proteins with the pectins may be associated with increased cell rigidity and sustainability, a feature of interest for the aerial roots. In summary, the habit of roots can interfere with the non-cellulosic composition of the cell walls of V. phaeantha, possibly related to changes in cell functionality."
Data Sovereignty in Inter-organizational Information Systems,"Car manufacturers and suppliers in the Automotive industry increasingly face the issue of optimization of highly complex supply chains that need to accommodate each customer's precise demands, requiring a vast array of parts and information to be available at the right place and at the right time. This involves data sharing between organizations, which is hindered by various issues, such as fear of data misappropriation by the data receiver or the involuntary disclosure of business secrets. The paper proposes design principles for a novel type of Inter-Organizational Information System, which addresses these challenges through the technical implementation of data sovereignty. The study reports on an Action Design Research study in the Automotive industry between a car manufacturer and a 1st-tier supplier. It contributes (a) design requirements, (b) design features, (c) an instantiation, and (d) design principles for this type of data sovereign inter-organizational information system."
Temperature Dependent Thermodynamical and Thermoelectric Behaviour of Hafnium Based Insulators: An Ab-inito Characterization,"This study aims to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the thermodynamic and thermoelectric potential of the (Ca,Sr,Ba)HfO\(_3\) family. This family has been selected for recognition because of their remarkable achievements in the areas of solar cell and energy storage applications using perovskites. The materials showcased exceptional efficiency and displayed immense potential in these areas of research. Our study delves into the thermodynamically assisted intruding thermoelectric properties of (Ca,Sr,Ba)HfO\(_3\) compounds. We thoroughly investigate their thermoelectric response, analyzing the impact of carrier concentrations and temperature effects. Our study reveals the noteworthy influence of the high entropic behavior of BaHfO\(_3\), leading to a reduction in thermal conductivity and ultimately enhancing thermoelectric performance. This study utilizes Density Functional Theory to analyze the structural, electronic, thermodynamic, and thermoelectric properties of the hafnium based perovskite oxide family (Ca,Sr,Ba)HfO\(_3\). Compounds confirm their cubic symmetry through the calculated tolerance factors (\(\tau\)). The lack of negative frequencies in the phonon dispersion curves suggests the thermal stability of this group. The decrease in Helmholtz free energy reliably indicates the thermodynamic stability of the system. This study explores the thermoelectric properties of (Ca,Sr,Ba)HfO\(_3\) under various levels of electron and hole doping. Variation in carrier concentration and temperature lead to a rise in the power factor. At a temperature of 700 K, the figure of merit (zT) exhibits a correlation with the electron doping concentration, ranging from 77 to 99%. The zT factor achieved a peak value of 88% within the temperature range of 300–700 K, accompanied by hole carrier concentrations ranging from 10\(^{17}\) to 10\(^{22}\). The zT value remains relatively constant within a specific temperature range, typically between 500 and 700 K, despite variations in hole carrier concentration. Furthermore, BaHfO\(_3\) demonstrates a significantly greater entropy in comparison to the other two members of its family. It appears that BaHfO\(_3\) has the potential to provide a substantial response in thermoelectric applications."
Application of biohybrid membranes for arsenic and chromium removal and their impact on pollutant accumulation in soybean (Glycine max L.) seedlings,"Chromium and arsenic are among the priority pollutants to be controlled by regulatory and health agencies due to their ability to accumulate in food chains and the harmful effects on health resulting from the ingestion of food contaminated with metals and metalloids. In the present work, four biohybrid membrane systems were developed as alternatives for the removal of these pollutants, three based on polyvinyl alcohol polymeric mesh (PVA, PVA-magnetite, PVA L-cysteine) and one based on polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), all associated with bioremediation agents. The efficiency of the bioassociation process was assessed through count methods and microscopy. The removal capacity of these systems was evaluated in synthetic liquid medium, both in the absence and in the presence of soybean (Glycine max L.) seedlings. The content of chromium and arsenic was also analyzed in aerial and hypogeous tissues of seedlings grown on contaminated solid substrate. PVA and PVA-magnetite biohybrid membranes showed the highest removal rates, between 57 and 75% of the initial arsenic content and more than 80% of the initial chromium content after 48 h of treatment, when evaluated in synthetic liquid media with initial concentrations of 2.5 ppm of pentavalent arsenic and 5 ppm of hexavalent chromium, both in presence and absence of seedlings. PVA and PBAT promoted a significant reduction of arsenic translocation to the aerial parts, generally edible, of this crop of agronomic interest. The systems tested showed a high potential for biotechnological applications in matrices affected by the presence of arsenic and chromium."
"Development of working memory, processing speed, and psychosocial functions in patients with pediatric cancer","Many patients after pediatric cancer suffer from long-term cognitive difficulties. This study investigates the development of cognitive and psychosocial functions between diagnosis and one year after cancer treatment and reveals insight into the association between cognitive and psychosocial development and various risk factors. This retrospective clinical record review included fifty-seven patients, aged 4–16 years, that were examined at the beginning of the cancer treatment (T1) and one year after cancer treatment (T2) to evaluate the development of working memory (WM), processing speed (PS), psychosocial functions, and quality of life (QoL). About half of the patients showed stable/favorable cognitive development (PS 51.9%; WM 41.4%). The other half exhibited a non-favorable cognitive development, with a decrease of performance between T1 and T2. In 51.6–77.4%, psychosocial functions remained stable/increased between T1 and T2 and QoL scores remained stable in 42.9–61.9%. Changes in prosocial behavior correlated with the development of PS (r = 0.472, p = 0.010). Age at T1 predicted PS at T2 (p = 0.020) and sex predicted peer relations at T2 (p = 0.046). About half of the patients showed stable/favorable whereas the other half experiencing non-favorable cognitive development. The observed disparities in initial and subsequent cognitive performances highlight the importance of early individualized patient monitoring and interventions."
Design and high-power testing of offline conditioning cavity for CiADS RFQ high-power coupler,"To validate the design rationality of the power coupler for the RFQ cavity and minimize cavity contamination, we designed a low-loss offline conditioning cavity and conducted high-power testing. This offline cavity features two coupling ports and two tuners, operating at a frequency of \({162.5}\,\textrm{MHz}\) with a tuning range of \({3.2}\,\textrm{MHz}\). Adjusting the installation angle of the coupling ring and the insertion depth of the tuner helps minimize cavity losses. We performed electromagnetic structural and multiphysics simulations, revealing a minimal theoretical power loss of \({4.3}\,{\%}\). However, when the cavity frequency varied by \({110}\,\textrm{kHz}\), theoretical power losses increased to \({10}\,{\%}\), necessitating constant tuner adjustments during conditioning. Multiphysics simulations indicated that increased cavity temperature did not affect frequency variation. Upon completion of the offline high-power conditioning platform, we measured the transmission performance, revealing a power loss of \({6.3}\,{\%}\), exceeding the theoretical calculation. Conditioning utilized efficient automatic range scanning and standing wave resonant methods. To fully condition the power coupler, a \({15}^\circ\) phase difference between two standing wave points in the conditioning system was necessary. Notably, the maximum continuous wave power surpassed \({20}\,\textrm{kW}\), exceeding the expected target."
Methylene blue for COVID-19 ARDS: insights from a randomized Clinical Trial,"Around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented many difficulties, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has become a major worry. The antiviral and anti-inflammatory characteristics of methylene blue (MB) have garnered interest for potential medicinal applications. The object of the current study is to assess the effect of orally administered MB on the treatment of ARDS associated with COVID-19."
The Effects of Substitution Degree in the Carboxymethylation of Jackfruit Seed Starch on Starch Digestibility,"Starch from jackfruit seeds shows potential for use in food production processes with high starch content. Modification of jackfruit seed starch to increase the resistant starch content makes it a promising candidate for prebiotics in the food industry. Carboxymethylation can provide benefits for starch utilization in improving starch functional properties such as solubility, viscosity, and resistant starch content. This study chemically modified starch through carboxymethylation at different concentrations of sodium hydroxide to investigate the effect of carboxymethyl substitution on the digestible properties of the starch. Carboxymethylation exhibited a high degree of substitution from 0.28% to 0.57% as a function of the concentration of sodium hydroxide (5–10 wt%). The treatment enhanced the swelling, water solubility, and water/oil absorption. The resistant starch content increased from ~ 21 to ~ 39.67%. However, the high degree of substitution showed structural deformation of the starch granules with a decrease in crystallinity from about 35 to 1% by SEM and XRD. The degree of carboxymethyl substitution increased resistant starch content, reduced rapidly digestible starch, and had negligible impact on slowly digestible starch. Jackfruit seed starch treated with 10% by weight of NaOH was the optimal value that increased carboxymethyl substitution to 0.57% and resistant starch content to ~ 40%. This concentration was also optimal for the functional properties of starch with the highest values of swelling degree (~ 27 g/g), water solubility (~ 50%), freeze–thaw stability (~ 20% of syneresis after 4 freeze–thaw cycles), and oil and water absorption (150% of oil absorption and 180% of water absorption)."
Antibacterial blue light is a promising tool for inactivating Escherichia coli in the food sector due to its low risk of cross-stress tolerance,"Escherichia coli is an integral part of the colonic microflora, though its pathogenic intestinal strains can contaminate animal and plant products and cause significant challenges in the food industry. Thermal processing is one of the most common methods used to preserve food. Nevertheless, non-thermal antibacterial methods, such as antibacterial blue light (aBL), are attracting more interest due to the growing demand for minimally processed products. Thus, the current study was aimed at assessment whether the risk of co-selection for these two food processing approaches exist."
"What Silent Pauses Can ‘Tell’ Us About the Storytelling Skills of Autistic Children: Relations Between Pausing, Language Skills and Executive Functions","Silent pauses may serve communicative purposes such as demarcating boundaries between discourse units in language production. Previous research has shown that autistic children differ in their pausing behavior from typically-developing (TD) peers, however, the factors behind this difference remain underexplored. The current study was aimed at comparing the use of silent pauses in the narrative production of autistic children and age-matched TD children, and also to identify possible relations between pausing behavior and the children’s language and executive function abilities. According to the study’s findings, the autistic children did not differ from their TD peers in the use of grammatical pauses, however, the former tended to produce significantly less syntactically complex narratives than the TD group, which increased the likelihood that the autistic group would pause appropriately at phrasal boundaries. Though we have found low rates of ungrammatical silent pauses and omitted pauses in obligatory discourse contexts across both groups, autistic children with lower cognitive flexibility tended to use more ungrammatical pauses than their peers with higher cognitive flexibility scores. Also, the autistic group tended to omit obligatory silent pauses more often as their narration became more complex. The results demonstrate that syntactic complexity in narrative production modulated autistic children’s pausing behavior, and that structurally simple narrations boosted the autistic group’s appropriate use of grammatical pauses. The overall findings also demonstrate the importance of studying silent pauses in the narrative discourse of autistic children, and also highlight the links between silent pauses and the children’s syntactic and cognitive skills."
"Preparation and evaluation of the LaCu1-xNixO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) perovskite catalysts for total oxidation of methane","A series of Ni-substituted LaCu1-xNixO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) catalysts were prepared by a mechanochemical synthesis method and the prepared samples were used in catalytic combustion of methane. The catalytic results indicated that the partial substitution of Ni affected the catalytic performance and the increase in nickel content increased the catalytic activity and among the prepared catalysts the LaCu0.5Ni0.5O3 sample possessed the highest catalytic activity and thermal stability. The results showed that methane conversion reached from 7.8 to 73.8% at 500 °C with the substitution of Ni in the amount of x = 0.5. Also, the addition of Ni instead of Cu in the LaCu1-xNixO3 led to an increase in total pore volume and specific surface area and a decrease in average crystalline size. According to O2-TPD profiles of the LaCu1-xNixO3 catalysts, mobility of lattice oxygen (O2−) has a crucial role in determining the performance of these catalysts. The H2-TPR results indicated that the addition of Ni slightly improved the reducibility of catalysts. Furthermore, a decrease in calcination temperature of LaCu0.5Ni0.5O3 catalyst resulted in an increase in the catalytic activity due to the enhancement in the concentration of oxygen vacancy and specific surface area. Also, the results revealed that the increase in feed ratio (CH4/O2) leads to an increment in methane conversion."
Common molecular and pathophysiological underpinnings of delirium and Alzheimer’s disease: molecular signatures and therapeutic indications,"Delirium and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are common causes of cognitive dysfunction among older adults. These neurodegenerative diseases share a common and complex relationship, and can occur individually or concurrently, increasing the chance of permanent mental dysfunction. However, the common molecular pathophysiology, key proteomic biomarkers, and functional pathways are largely unknown, whereby delirium is superimposed on AD and dementia."
An experimental approach on dynamic occlusal fingerprint analysis to simulate use-wear localisation and development on stone tools,"Information about the use of stone tools in the past is encoded in the wear patterns left on their surface; however, post-depositional processes can modify and obstruct these traces. One aim in the field of lithic functional analysis is to develop methods to detect and quantify these traces on stone tools. The occlusal fingerprint analysis (OFA) is a well-established method in dental wear studies to virtually simulate dental occlusal (contact between teeth) stroke movements and thus locate and quantify the sequential contact between opposing tooth crowns. Reaching across disciplines, we conducted controlled experiments to test the applicability of the OFA method on stone tools to address the challenge of use-wear quantification and localisation, and therefore the identification of post-depositional wear. Our findings reveal a clear overlap between zones of experimentally produced use-wear and OFA-calculated contact areas. We demonstrate OFA as a potential method to generate models of multiscale use-wear that can be used as references on experimental tools to identify post-depositional surface modifications on stone tool artefacts."
Single-cell multi-omics in the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus: a new era of next generation therapeutics,"Developments in single-cell omics have enormous potential to revolutionize plant metabolic engineering and gene discovery. Additionally, this might pave a new path for next-generation therapeutics and stress alleviation in plants. The medicinal plant species Catharanthus roseus produces the natural product monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIAs), through a multistep biochemical activity. The high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing followed by semi-quantitative single-cell metabolomics showed MIA biosynthesis with distinct metabolite profiles across the organs. Therefore, understanding the function of gene/s and their product is necessary to find all the candidates in a complex metabolic circuit. In this commentary, we focused on the advances in single-cell multi-omic technologies in C. roseus about the methods illustrating cell states and the metabolites."
Adversarial robustness of deep reinforcement learning-based intrusion detection,"Machine learning techniques, including Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), enhance intrusion detection systems by adapting to new threats. However, DRL’s reliance on vulnerable deep neural networks leads to susceptibility to adversarial examples-perturbations designed to evade detection. While adversarial examples are well-studied in deep learning, their impact on DRL-based intrusion detection remains underexplored, particularly in critical domains. This article conducts a thorough analysis of DRL-based intrusion detection’s vulnerability to adversarial examples. It systematically evaluates key hyperparameters such as DRL algorithms, neural network depth, and width, impacting agents’ robustness. The study extends to black-box attacks, demonstrating adversarial transferability across DRL algorithms. Findings emphasize neural network architecture’s critical role in DRL agent robustness, addressing underfitting and overfitting challenges. Practical implications include insights for optimizing DRL-based intrusion detection agents to enhance performance and resilience. Experiments encompass multiple DRL algorithms tested on three datasets: NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIoV2024, against gradient-based adversarial attacks, with publicly available implementation code."
"Effect of alternative fuels on the emissions of a passenger car under real-world driving conditions: a comparison of biodiesel, gas-to-liquid, coal to liquid","Fossil fuel energy crisis and environmental pollution have initiated the scientific research on alternative fuels. Biodiesel (B100), gas to liquid (G100), and coal to liquid (C100) are superb selections to be substitutes for conventional diesel. To better investigate the emission characteristics of the alternative fuels mentioned above, a portable emission measurement system (PEMS) was used to carry out this study under real-world driving conditions. Results showed that the driving conditions had a notable effect on the vehicle emissions, the CO, THC, and CO2 emissions were higher under urban condition, and the NOx, PM (particle mass), and PN (particle number) emissions were higher under suburban condition. The expressway condition resulted in lower emissions except for PN due to more nucleation particles emitted. The use of B100, G100, and C100 fuels led to a reduction of more than 50% in the CO emission, especially for the C100, but the reduction effects for the THC were not obvious, and among them, G100 is the most prominent. Higher NOx emission was emitted after using the three fuels, especially for the B100; meanwhile, B100 increased the CO2, but G100 and C100 decreased the CO2 emission compared with D100. The PN emissions reduced by 1–2 orders of magnitude in comparison with those from D100 after using the three alternative fuels, and more than 50% of the PM could be reduced. B100 has the most significant particle reduction effect due to its oxygen-containing property, and it produced an evidently higher proportion of nucleation particles than D100, followed by G100 and C100."
The assessment of bone health in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis; comparison of different imaging-based methods,"Osteoporosis is increasingly being recognized in children, mostly secondary to systemic underlying conditions or medication. However, no imaging modality currently provides a full evaluation of bone health in children. We compared DXA, a radiographic bone health index (BHI (BoneXpert) and cone-beam CT for the assessment of low bone mass in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)."
Research on DC Component Suppression Method of Non-isolated Grid-Connected Inverter,"The zero drift occurring to the sampling conditioning circuit of the non-isolated grid-connected inverter will make the output develop a DC component, thus resulting in system failure and posing safety risks. According to the IEEE standard 1547-2003, the DC component injected into the grid side should be less than 0.5% of the rated current. In this paper, a moving average filter is proposed to extract the DC component of the three-phase AC output current. The filter has a very strong attenuation ability to the fundamental integer multiple harmonics, and can accurately extract the DC component. Then the proportional integral resonant controller (PIR) is used to control the system. The control system has sufficient bandwidth to avoid the stability problem caused by frequency offset. Through the above methods, the purpose of accurately suppressing the DC component in the non-isolated grid-connected inverter is realized. Also, a 50 kVA prototype is built in this study. The experimental results show that the moving average filter is advantageous over the conventional low-pass filter method in extracting the DC component, and the PIR controller used in the closed-loop control system outperforms the proportional integral and proportional resonant controllers. Under the strategy proposed in this study, the DC component is reduced to less than 0.5% of the rated current, and the THD of the grid-connected current falls below 5%."
"The effects of sawing methods on the lumber recovery rate and lumber grading of Eucalyptus globulus at the small-scale sawmill enterprise, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","The sawmill industry process a significant quantity of the logs into lumber for wood industry in Ethiopia. The cost of raw materials have a significant role in the wood industry. Therefore, it is critical to pay attention to the proper log sawing method, which optimize the sawing process and increase the lumber recovery rate and lumber grading. Eucalyptus, is currently gaining significance in wood industry for lumber production and for construction purposes in Ethiopia. In the present study, Eucalyptus globulus logs were processed into lumber using plain, quarter and radial sawing methods. In the plain sawing, the results showed that a total 6.77 m3 of lumber were produced from log categories 1, 2, 3, and 4. In the quarter sawing, a total 5.07 m3 of lumber were produced from log categories 1, 2, 3, and 4. While in the radial (rift) sawing, a total 4.76 m3 of lumber were produced from log categories 1, 2, 3, and 4. Overall, the lumber recovery rate 49% were recorded. There was a highly significant difference (P ≤ 0.001) in the sawing methods. Visual grading is based on a visual inspection of the each piece of the lumber and the judgment of the grader. In the present study, lumber grade yield was classified into percent’s of 83–100%, 66–82%, 50–65%, and below 50%, and lumber grade names were No. 1C and better, No. 2AC, No. 3AC, and No. 4 (economy), respectively. The major structural factors that determined in the sawn wood grade were the size and frequency of the defects on the lumber because log characteristics would appear in a given piece of the lumber and affects the grading of sawn wood or appearance. The study results shows that the logs with a lower grade or more defects resulted in lower lumber recovery and grade yield. In conclusion, the plain sawing method is the most commonly used for E. globulus lumber production in the sawmill industry. Apparently, plain sawing is a least wasteful, most economically used for sawing the logs, and producing the widest lumber than others. However, the lumber produced using this method are more liable to warp, split, shrinkage and distortion than those of other methods. Quarter sawing has the benefits of reducing warping, shrinking, twisting, and cupping, checking and splitting lumber rather than those which are plain sawn. This is the best technique for E. globulus lumber production, especially more appropriate for sawing a large diameter of the logs. Lastly, radial sawing has the highest wood waste, the time consuming and expensive, and the strongest sawing technique for E. globulus lumber production. This investigation confirms that the quarter sawing method is suitable for producing high quality lumber from E. globulus. The enhanced lumber recovery and grade yield increase the profitability, energy efficiency, optimum use of the resources, manage wood waste (e.g., recycling and prevention), and mitigate climate change impacts effectively for green economic development and industrial transformation."
Recycling machinery of integrin coupled with focal adhesion turnover via RAB11-UNC13D-FAK axis for migration of pancreatic cancer cells,"Recycling of integrin via endosomal vesicles is critical for the migration of cancer cells, which leads to the metastasis of pancreatic cancer and devastating cancer-related death. So, new diagnostic and therapeutic molecules which target the recycling of endosomal vesicles need to be developed."
Evaluating the impact of reducing POFA’s particle fineness on its pozzolanic reactivity and mortar strength,"This paper presents the effect of size reduction of palm oil fuel ash (POFA) in the nanoscale to improve the mortar strength. In this work, three different particle sizes of POFA prepared using the LA abrasion machine were used as a cement replacement. The physical and chemical properties, mineralogy, and morphology of all POFA specimens were studied. The effect of size reduction on the pozzolanic reactivity of POFA is also studied. The mortar mix design that contained micro and nano POFA was prepared and evaluated for its compressive and flexural properties at the ages of 7, 28, 56, and 90 days. Response surface methodology was used to evaluate the relationship between the factors (cement replacement) and responses (compressive and flexural strength), aiming to find the best mix design. The grinding method in this work produced POFA as small as 110 nm. The nano POFAs were observed to have better pozzolanic reactivity compared to micro POFA. The results show that nano POFA increased the mortar strength activity index by up to 20% compared to micro POFA. The best mix design was found using a combination of 10 and 3% of micro and nano POFA as cement replacement. The best mix design shows excellent early compressive strength (7 days) compared to other mixes, although the difference in long-term compressive strength is insignificant. Similar findings were observed for the flexural strength, whereby the best mix design was obtained using a combination of 10 and 3% of micro and nano POFA. This work may provide useful insight into the effect of size reduction on the pozzolanic reactivity of POFA."
BSP-Net: automatic skin lesion segmentation improved by boundary enhancement and progressive decoding methods,"Automatic skin lesion segmentation from dermoscopy images is of great significance in the early treatment of skin cancers, which is yet challenging even for dermatologists due to the inherent issues, i.e., considerable size, shape and color variation, and ambiguous boundaries. In this paper, we propose a network BSP-Net that implements the combination of critical boundary information and segmentation tasks to simultaneously solve the variation and boundary problems in skin lesion segmentation. The architecture of BSP-Net primarily consists of a multi-scale boundary enhancement (MBE) module and a progressive fusion decoder (PD). The MBE module, by deeply extracting boundary information in both multi-axis frequency and multi-scale spatial domains, generates precise boundary key-point prediction maps. This process not only accurately models local boundary information but also effectively retains global contextual information. On the other hand, the PD employs an asymmetric decoding strategy, guiding the generation of refined segmentation results by combining boundary-enhanced features rich in geometric details with global features containing semantic information about lesions. This strategy progressively fuses boundary and semantic information at different levels, effectively enabling high-performance collaboration between cross-level contextual features. To assess the effectiveness of BSP-Net, we conducted extensive experiments on two public datasets (ISIC-2016 &PH2, ISIC-2018) and one private dataset (XJUSKin). BSP-Net achieved Dice coefficients of 90.81, 92.41, and 83.88%, respectively. Additionally, it demonstrated precise boundary delineation with Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD) scores of 7.96, 6.88, and 10.92%, highlighting its strong performance in skin lesion segmentation."
GIS and AHP-based flood susceptibility mapping: a case study of Bangladesh,"Bangladesh, situated within the vast Bengal Delta, faces a significant challenge due to its low-lying and flat topography: frequent and devastating floods. Acknowledging the influence of physical elements on flood events, flood susceptibility assessment emerges as a critical tool for establishing effective and sustainable flood mitigation strategies. This study endeavors to delineate flood-prone zones within Bangladesh by employing a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework that integrates Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), a well-established approach in this field. Eight flood-influencing factors were considered in this study: elevation, slope, drainage density, rainfall, distance to the river, flow accumulation, curve number, and permeability. These factors represent physical elements and derivatives of the morphological, hydrological, meteorological, and hydrographical characteristics of the study area. Following their necessary processing, weights were assigned to each factor based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Subsequently, geospatial analysis was conducted within the GIS interface. Flood-prone zones were categorized into five susceptibility classes: very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. Elevation emerged as the key factor, with a comparatively higher influence on flood occurrence compared to the other factors. The study revealed that 16.03% of Bangladesh falls within the very high susceptibility class, while 42.78%, 25.78%, 7.62%, and 7.74% fall within the high, moderate, low, and very low susceptibility classes, respectively."
Improvement of bioanalytical parameters through automation: suitability of a hand-like robotic system,"Commercial automation systems for small- and medium-sized laboratories, including research environments, are often complex to use. For liquid handling systems (LHS), development is required not only for the robot’s movements but also for adapting the bioanalytical method to the automated system. This study investigates whether a more human-like automation strategy—using a robotic system (RS)—is more suitable for research laboratories than a professional automation approach utilizing a commercial automated LHS. We conducted a series of measurements for protein determination using a Bradford assay manually, with a fully automated LHS, and with our human-like RS. Although the hand-like RS approach requires more than twice the time of the LHS, it achieved the best standard deviation in this setup (RS = 0.5, manual = 0.71, LHS = 0.86). Due to the low limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ), most protein samples could be quantified with the RS (samples below LOQ = 9.7%, LOD = 0.23; LOQ = 0.25) compared to manual (samples below LOQ = 28.8%, LOD = 0.24; LOQ = 0.26) and the LHS (samples below LOQ = 36.1%, LOD = 0.27; LOQ = 0.31). In another time-dependent enzymatic assay test, the RS achieved results comparable to the manual method and the LHS, although the required time could be a constraint for short incubation times. Our results demonstrate that a more hand-like automation system closely models the manual process, leading easier to accurate bioanalytical results. We conclude that such a system could be more suitable for typical research environments than a complex LHS."

"Using alpha, beta, and zeta diversity to map the structure and function of fish community in the central East China Sea","Exploring the seasonal dynamics of different components of biodiversity (alpha, beta, and zeta) and identifying the factors driving these patterns can help to reveal the health conditions and changes of ecosystems across different seasons. Seasonal differences in coastal fish biodiversity components were determined based on data of species abundance, traits, and mitochondrial genes. We then used multiple models to assess the relative importance of environmental and geographic variables in shaping the spatial patterns of different components of diversity. The results showed that the variation patterns of alpha diversity indices among seasons were inconsistent. All beta diversity indices showed significant seasonal variations. The rate of zeta diversity decline was highest in winter, and the compositional turnover showed no significant variations among the other three seasons. In spring, longitude was the most important factor influencing variations in alpha and beta diversity, while sea surface temperature and distance from mainland were important drivers for fish zeta diversity. Distance from mainland, sea surface temperature, and salinity were the most critical factors shaping the spatial pattern of diversity in summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. Our results suggest that environmental and geographic factors play an important role in shaping the patterns of coastal fish diversity."
What are the functional outcomes and service experiences of patients with head and neck cancer treated during the COVID-19 pandemic?,Head and neck cancer (HNC) care was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Source apportionment of some heavy metals in metropolitan and nearby agricultural soils using the multivariate statistical technique and kriging in the North of Iran,"This research was established to explore the variability and sources of some heavy metals; HMs (Zn, Fe, Cu, Cr, Mn, Co, Pb, and Ni), in a metropolitan and surrounding agricultural area in northern Iran using multivariate statistical analysis. One hundred and two soil samples were randomly taken from 0 to 20 cm depth and heavy metal concentrations and some soil properties included electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic matter (SOM), soil texture, soil carbonate, and pH were measured. The mean and standard deviation of selected metals in the total dataset were 81.06 ± 77.69 mg kg− 1 for Pb, 61 ± 14.35 mg kg− 1 for Ni, 17.48 ± 3.53 mg kg− 1 for Co, 29.24 ± 6.35 mg kg− 1 for Cr, 353 ± 172 mg kg− 1 for Mn, 17,953 ± 25,193 mg kg− 1 for Fe, 30.58 ± 21.32 mg kg− 1 for Cu and 50.33 ± 33.13 mg kg− 1 for Zn. Correlation analysis showed that all HMs have positive relationships together and some have higher coefficients displaying their common sources. Positive significant correlations (P < 0.01) were found between HMs and SOM and clay content confirming the high influence of colloidal surfaces in HMs affinity. Multivariate analysis resulted in three principal complements or factors that explained about 82.5% of the total variance. Factor 1 with a high contribution of Zn, Pb, Cu, and Mn showed higher involvement of anthropogenic activities such as fertilizing in farmlands, urbanization, and industrial activities. Factor 2 with a higher contribution of Fe and Co was dominantly widespread spatially somewhere igneous and tuff were distributed. Factor 3 with the highest loading of Cr and Ni as well as high relative loadings in two other factors, indicating both sources. The results are so crucial for decision-makers and governors to implement appropriate strategies to reduce the risk of HMs and soil remediation policies."
Deep learning to predict risk of lateral skull base cerebrospinal fluid leak or encephalocele,"Skull base features, including increased foramen ovale (FO) cross-sectional area, are associated with lateral skull base spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (sCSF) leak and encephalocele. Manual measurement requires skill in interpreting imaging studies and is time consuming. The goal of this study was to develop a fully automated deep learning method for FO segmentation and to determine the predictive value in identifying patients with sCSF leak or encephalocele."
Racial Disparities in the Diagnosis of Inborn Errors of Immunity,
A chemical approach to extend flower longevity of Japanese morning glory via inhibition of master senescence regulator EPHEMERAL1,"Petal senescence in flowering plants is a type of programmed cell death with highly regulated onset and progression. A NAM/ATAF1,2/CUC2 transcription factor, EPHEMERAL1 (EPH1), has been identified as a key regulator of petal senescence in Japanese morning glory (Ipomoea nil). Here we used a novel chemical approach to delay petal senescence in Japanese morning glory by inhibiting the DNA-binding activity of EPH1. A cell-free high-throughput screening system and subsequent bioassays found two tetrafluorophthalimide-based compounds, Everlastin1 and Everlastin2, that inhibited the EPH1–DNA interaction and delayed petal senescence. The inhibitory mechanism was due to the suppression of EPH1 dimerization. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that the chemical treatment strongly suppressed the expression of programmed cell death- and autophagy-related genes. These results suggest that a chemical approach targeting a transcription factor can regulate petal senescence."
Cerebral blood flow and cognition after 3 months tadalafil treatment in small vessel disease (ETLAS-2): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Targeted treatment is highly warranted for cerebral small vessel disease, a causal factor of one in four strokes and a major contributor to vascular dementia. Patients with cerebral small vessel disease have impaired cerebral blood flow and vessel reactivity. Tadalafil is a specific phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor shown to improve vascular reactivity in the brain."
Plant diversity enhances ecosystem multifunctionality via multitrophic diversity,"Ecosystem functioning depends on biodiversity at multiple trophic levels, yet relationships between multitrophic diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality have been poorly explored, with studies often focusing on individual trophic levels and functions and on specific ecosystem types. Here, we show that plant diversity can affect ecosystem functioning both directly and by affecting other trophic levels. Using data on 13 trophic groups and 13 ecosystem functions from two large biodiversity experiments—one representing temperate grasslands and the other subtropical forests—we found that plant diversity increases multifunctionality through elevated multitrophic diversity. Across both experiments, the association between multitrophic diversity and multifunctionality was stronger than the relationship between the diversity of individual trophic groups and multifunctionality. Our results also suggest that the role of multitrophic diversity is greater in forests than in grasslands. These findings imply that, to promote sustained ecosystem multifunctionality, conservation planning must consider the diversity of both plants and higher trophic levels."
"Spexin and its receptors in the yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi): identification, expression profiles and reproductive function","Spexin (SPX1) is a neuropeptide of 14 amino acids (aa), originally identified by bioinformatics, which has been implicated in various physiological functions in vertebrates via galanin receptors 2 and 3 (GALR2/3). To clarify the biological role of SPX1 in the control of reproduction in yellowtail kingfish, which is regarded as a promising species for offshore aquaculture worldwide, cDNA sequences of spx1 and six potential receptors were identified in the current study. The open reading frame of yellowtail kingfish spx1 was 363 nucleotides in size that encoded a 120-aa preprohormone, and its mature peptide was highly conserved among other species. The cDNA sequences of six GALRs (galr1a, galr1b, galr2a, galr2b, galr type 1, and galr type 2) were 1053 base pairs (bp), 1068 bp, 981 bp, 1137 bp, 1038 bp, 924 bp, which encoded G protein-coupled receptors of 350 aa, 355 aa, 326 aa, 378 aa, 345 aa, 307 aa, respectively. Tissue distribution analysis showed that spx1, galr1b, and galr2b transcripts were mainly detected in the brain. The highest mRNA levels of galr1a and galr2a were observed in the pituitary, followed by the brain and ovary. Both galr type 1 and galr type 2 were widely expressed in various tissues, with a peak level in the kidney. Moreover, all spx1 and galr genes significantly fluctuated during early ontogeny, exhibiting different expression patterns. Intraperitoneal injection of SPX1 significantly increased brain gnrh1, gnih, spx1, gal, and tac3 expression, while it inhibited gnrh2, kiss1r, and kiss2r mRNA levels. In the pituitary, SPX1 injection reduced transcript levels of gh, lhβ, and fshβ. Overall, our results have revealed the involvement of SPX1 in the reproductive functions in yellowtail kingfish."
Application of coastal hazard index to advance nature based protection for coastal communities in the small islands,"In the face of rising the seas, relying solely on seawalls and other reinforced coastlines is unsustainable due to the high costs associated with their construction and upkeep and unforeseen effects on habitats. Restoring and conserving coastal habitats can be more affordable, long-term solutions for protecting the coast. Yet, basic knowledge about where, how, and for whom habitats decrease the risk of coastal disasters is typically lacking from decision-makers. This study investigates how climate change may affect coastal areas and how natural coastal habitats may help protect them. We studied two small tropical islands, Bintan and Seribu Islands, Indonesia. The research applied the InVEST Coastal Vulnerability model to calculate the hazard index. To assess the effect on the vulnerable population, a grid system for the coastal population was created and overlaid with the hazard index. The comprehensive analysis indicates that if the coastal habitat is lost in the future, Bintan and Seribu Islands will face a severe threat from rising sea levels, with 96% and 63% of the inhabitants being highly exposed to climate hazards. Furthermore, the model shows that preserving natural coastal habitats by 2040 could help protect approximately 104 and 17 km of coastline areas in Bintan and Seribu Islands, respectively. Ecosystems offer safeguards to certain thinly inhabited, distant coastal villages, certain of those with a large, vulnerable population. Thus, this study highlights that natural coastal habitat is essential in climate change adaptation. Enhancing and safeguarding these natural habitats is crucial for mitigating climate-related hazards and ensuring community resilience."
Trends in vervet monkey admissions to a wildlife rehabilitation centre: a reflection of human-wildlife conflict in an urban-forest mosaic landscape,"Despite the common destructive effects of urbanisation on biodiversity assemblages, certain species thrive in urban environments. One mammalian species that has persisted in the urban-forest mosaic landscape is the vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus). It is a common resident primate in Durban, eThekwini Municipality, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, with frequent contact with humans and domestic wildlife. Due to their adaptability in using human-altered landscapes, the interactions between humans and vervet monkeys have increased and are often negative. Our study determined trends in the admission cases of vervet monkeys to a Durban wildlife rehabilitation centre and assessed the main factors contributing to these admissions to mitigate human-vervet monkey conflict. Our analyses were conducted on recorded admission data for vervet monkeys at a wildlife rehabilitation centre from 2011 to 2018. Members of the public (90.0%) mostly reported vervet cases, with admissions mostly recorded from the central district (46.8%) of the municipality. The number of admitted vervet monkeys increased significantly over the years and months, with a mean (± SE) of 127.3 ± 21.34 and 84.8 ± 5.37, respectively. Only 34.3% of vervet monkeys were alive at the end of the admission process from the 83.7% that were admitted alive at the rehabilitation centre. The high number of deaths resulted from anthropogenic activities, primarily motor vehicle strikes (30.8%) and domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) attacks (13.9%). We modelled survivability for vervet monkeys, and our results showed that season, age category, and the cause of admission were all significant factors influencing survival after admission. The sex of vervet monkeys had no significant effects on survivability after admission to the rehabilitation centre. We suggest that wildlife rehabilitation centres in priority areas use these findings in education to improve human coexistence with vervet monkeys. The trends also serve as a foundation for human-vervet conflict resolution programmes. The advantages of publishing records from rehabilitation centres are that they will raise awareness of the challenges posed by vervet monkeys in urban environments, where they are sometimes perceived as a nuisance because of anthropogenic influences in the urban mosaic landscape."
First year-round movement tracking of the Mediterranean Gull (Ichthyaetus melanocephalus) in Europe: insights and conservation recommendations for declining population,"This study examines the Mediterranean Gull (Ichthyaetus melanocephalus), utilizing GPS/GSM transmitters year-round for the first time on this species. The research covers habitat use, migration patterns, and breeding behaviors, tracking 19 birds captured at breeding colonies in Poland. To capture the birds and fit transmitters, we selected representative locations: islands in dam reservoirs, gravel pits, rivers, and lakes. Mediterranean Gulls nested mainly in colonies of Black-headed Gulls (Chroicocephalus ridibundus). By tracking birds with transmitters, we identified nine additional breeding sites within Poland, the Czechia, and Germany. We determined the mean length of phenological periods: breeding (76, April 10–June 26), autumn migration (11, June 26–July 7), winter (261, July 5–March 23), and spring migration (18, March 23–April 10). According to residence sites analysis, cropland was the most frequently used habitat during breeding (52.9%), while the open sea was predominant in winter (25.8%). We identified key wintering areas: the English Channel, the Utrecht–Antwerpen area, the North Sea coast, and the Irish Sea coast. One individual wintered along the coast of Portugal and near Malaga in Spain. An interesting discovery was the longer spring migration than autumn what involved visits to multiple potential breeding sites, leading to the mapping of a network of potential breeding areas. This underscores the need for proactive habitat protection and comprehensive conservation strategies. Given the Mediterranean Gull’s migratory behavior and lifecycle, the study advocates for it as a model for conserving migratory waterbirds."
Discovery of NRG1-VII: the myeloid-derived class of NRG1,"The growth factor Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) has pleiotropic roles in proliferation and differentiation of the stem cell niche in different tissues. It has been implicated in gut, brain and muscle development and repair. Six isoform classes of NRG1 and over 28 protein isoforms have been previously described. Here we report a new class of NRG1, designated NRG1-VII to denote that these NRG1 isoforms arise from a myeloid-specific transcriptional start site (TSS) previously uncharacterized. Long-read sequencing was used to identify eight high-confidence NRG1-VII transcripts. These transcripts presented major structural differences from one another, through the use of cassette exons and alternative stop codons. Expression of NRG1-VII was confirmed in primary human monocytes and tissue resident macrophages and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages (iPSC-derived macrophages). Isoform switching via cassette exon usage and alternate polyadenylation was apparent during monocyte maturation and macrophage differentiation. NRG1-VII is the major class expressed by the myeloid lineage, including tissue-resident macrophages. Analysis of public gene expression data indicates that monocytes and macrophages are a primary source of NRG1. The size and structure of class VII isoforms suggests that they may be more diffusible through tissues than other NRG1 classes. However, the specific roles of class VII variants in tissue homeostasis and repair have not yet been determined."
Single-pulse ultrafast real-time simultaneous planar imaging of femtosecond laser-nanoparticle dynamics in flames,"The creation of carbonaceous nanoparticles and their dynamics in hydrocarbon flames are still debated in environmental, combustion, and material sciences. In this study, we introduce single-pulse femtosecond laser sheet-compressed ultrafast photography (fsLS-CUP), an ultrafast imaging technique specifically designed to shed light on and capture ultrafast dynamics stemming from interactions between femtosecond lasers and nanoparticles in flames in a single-shot. fsLS-CUP enables the first-time real-time billion frames-per-second (Gfps) simultaneous two-dimensional (2D) imaging of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and laser-induced heating (LIH) that are originated from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and soot particles, respectively. Furthermore, fsLS-CUP provides the real-time spatiotemporal map of femtosecond laser-soot interaction as elastic light scattering (ELS) at an astonishing 250 Gfps. In contrast to existing single-shot ultrafast imaging approaches, which are limited to millions of frames per second only and require multiple laser pulses, our method employs only a single pulse and captures the entire dynamics of laser-induced signals at hundreds of Gfps. Using a single pulse does not change the optical properties of nanoparticles for a following pulse, thus allowing reliable spatiotemporal mapping. Moreover, we found that particle inception and growth are derived from precursors. In essence, as an imaging modality, fsLS-CUP offers ultrafast 2D diagnostics, contributing to the fundamental understanding of nanoparticle’s inception and broader applications across different fields, such as material science and biomedical engineering."
Quantum-classical separations in shallow-circuit-based learning with and without noises,"An essential problem in quantum machine learning is to find quantum-classical separations between learning models. However, rigorous and unconditional separations are lacking for supervised learning. Here we construct a classification problem defined by a noiseless constant depth (i.e., shallow) quantum circuit and rigorously prove that any classical neural network with bounded connectivity requires logarithmic depth to output correctly with a larger-than-exponentially-small probability. This unconditional near-optimal quantum-classical representation power separation originates from the quantum nonlocality property that distinguishes quantum circuits from their classical counterparts. We further characterize the noise regimes for demonstrating such a separation on near-term quantum devices under the depolarization noise model. In addition, for quantum devices with constant noise strength, we prove that no super-polynomial classical-quantum separation exists for any classification task defined by Clifford circuits, independent of the structures of the circuits that specify the learning models."
A new and simplified extraoral approach for inferior alveolar nerve block: a cadaveric study and clinical case reports,"Inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and lingual nerve (LN) blocks are commonly performed using the intraoral landmark techniques. However, these methods have a risk of unanticipated nerve and arterial injury or a higher failure rate. We developed a novel extraoral approach for the IAN and LN blocks, the “inferior alveolar nerve block mandibular angle approach (IANB-MA),” using ultrasound guidance. The mechanism of action of this nerve block was examined anatomically, and its clinical feasibility was reported."
Underlying dimensions of real-time word recognition in cochlear implant users,"Word recognition is a gateway to language, linking sound to meaning. Prior work has characterized its cognitive mechanisms as a form of competition between similar-sounding words. However, it has not identified dimensions along which this competition varies across people. We sought to identify these dimensions in a population of cochlear implant users with heterogenous backgrounds and audiological profiles, and in a lifespan sample of people without hearing loss. Our study characterizes the process of lexical competition using the Visual World Paradigm. A principal component analysis reveals that people’s ability to resolve lexical competition varies along three dimensions that mirror prior small-scale studies. These dimensions capture the degree to which lexical access is delayed (“Wait-and-See”), the degree to which competition fully resolves (“Sustained-Activation”), and the overall rate of activation. Each dimension is predicted by a different auditory skills and demographic factors (onset of deafness, age, cochlear implant experience). Moreover, each dimension predicts outcomes (speech perception in quiet and noise, subjective listening success) over and above auditory fidelity. Higher degrees of Wait-and-See and Sustained-Activation predict poorer outcomes. These results suggest the mechanisms of word recognition vary along a few underlying dimensions which help explain variable performance among listeners encountering auditory challenge."
Treatment of secondary uterine malignancy following radiotherapy for cervical cancer: a study based on the SEER database,"Radiotherapy is one of the main treatments for cervical cancer. Long-term complications of radiation exposure include the emergence of secondary tumors. This is a retrospective study based on an American population. We discuss the optimal treatment modality for patients with radiation-induced secondary uterine malignancy based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database."
Nanosecond infrared laser (NIRL) for cutting roots of human teeth: thermal effects and quality of cutting edges,"A nanosecond infrared laser (NIRL) was investigated in cutting dental roots. The focus of the investigation was defining the preparation accuracy and registration of thermal effects during laser application. Ten teeth were processed in the root area using a NIRL in several horizontal, parallel incisions to achieve tooth root ablation as in an apicoectomy. Temperature change was monitored during ablation and the quality of the cutting edges in the roots were studied by means of micro-CT, optical coherence tomography, and histology of decalcified and undecalcified specimens. NIRL produced clearly defined cut surfaces in dental hard tissues. The automated guidance of the laser beam created regular, narrow dentin defects that tapered in a V-shape towards the ablation plane. A biologically significant increase in the temperature of the object and its surroundings did not occur during the laser application. Thermal dentin damage was not detected in histological preparations of treated teeth. Defined areas of the tooth root may be ablated using a NIRL. For clinical translation of NIRL in apicoectomy, it would be necessary to increase energy delivered to hard tissue and develop beam application facilitating beam steering for oral treatment."
Prognostic significance of an innovative staging system based on the logarithmic odds of positive lymph nodes for resectable gastroesophageal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiation: a population-based study with external validation of data,"After receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation, the number of examined lymph nodes in resectable gastroesophageal cancer (GEC) will decrease, this may not accurately determine the N staging. So our study evaluates the clinical significance of a new staging model based on the logarithmic odds of positive lymph nodes (LODDS) in patients with GEC after receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation."
Identification of a specific APOE transcript and functional elements associated with Alzheimer’s disease,"The APOE gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s Disease (LOAD). However, the gene regulatory mechanisms at this locus remain incompletely characterized."
Climate change will exacerbate land conflict between agriculture and timber production,"Timber and agricultural production must both increase throughout this century to meet rising demand. Understanding how climate-induced shifts in agricultural suitability will trigger competition with timber for productive land is crucial. Here, we combine predictions of agricultural suitability under different climate change scenarios (representative concentration pathways RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) with timber-production maps to show that 240–320 Mha (20–26%) of current forestry land will become more suitable for agriculture by 2100. Forestry land contributes 21–27% of new agricultural productivity frontiers (67–105 Mha) despite only occupying 10% of the surface of the land. Agricultural frontiers in forestry land occur disproportionately in key timber-producing nations (Russia, the USA, Canada and China) and are closer to population centres and existing cropland than frontiers outside forestry land. To minimize crop expansion into forestry land and prevent shifting timber harvests into old-growth tropical and boreal forests to meet timber demand, emissions must be reduced, agricultural efficiency improved and sustainable intensification invested in."
ImAge quantitates aging and rejuvenation,"For efficient, cost-effective and personalized healthcare, biomarkers that capture aspects of functional, biological aging, thus predicting disease risk and lifespan more accurately and reliably than chronological age, are essential. We developed an imaging-based chromatin and epigenetic age (ImAge) that captures intrinsic age-related trajectories of the spatial organization of chromatin and epigenetic marks in single nuclei, in mice. We show that such trajectories readily emerge as principal changes in each individual dataset without regression on chronological age, and that ImAge can be computed using several epigenetic marks and DNA labeling. We find that interventions known to affect biological aging induce corresponding effects on ImAge, including increased ImAge upon chemotherapy treatment and decreased ImAge upon caloric restriction and partial reprogramming by transient OSKM expression in liver and skeletal muscle. Further, ImAge readouts from chronologically identical mice inversely correlated with their locomotor activity, suggesting that ImAge may capture elements of biological and functional age. In sum, we developed ImAge, an imaging-based biomarker of aging with single-cell resolution rooted in the analysis of spatial organization of epigenetic marks."
Global ocean carbon uptake enhanced by rainfall,"Rain alters local sea surface physical and biogeochemical properties but its spatiotemporal variability has led to its overlook in global ocean carbon uptake studies. Different physical and chemical processes in the gaseous and liquid phases control the transfer of carbon dioxide (CO2) between the atmosphere and ocean. Rain impacts the interfacial flux by (1) increasing turbulence in the ocean and (2) modulating the air–sea CO2 concentration gradient. Concurrently, raindrops inject CO2 absorbed during their fall into the ocean through wet deposition. Here this study presents a comprehensive estimate of these effects on the global ocean carbon uptake over 2008–2018 based on observational products (satellite and in situ) and reanalysis. Using various representations of the ocean surface response to rainfall and different rain products, we show that rain increases the ocean carbon sink by +0.14–0.19 PgC yr−1 over 2008–2018, representing an increase of 5–7% of the ocean carbon uptake (2.66 PgC yr−1). Rain-induced interfacial flux and wet deposition have comparable orders of magnitude. The former mainly increases the CO2 sink in the tropics because strong rain rates and weak winds induce noticeable salinity and CO2 dilution. The latter is important in the tropics, storm track regions and the Southern Ocean."
From admission to discharge: a systematic review of clinical natural language processing along the patient journey,"Medical text, as part of an electronic health record, is an essential information source in healthcare. Although natural language processing (NLP) techniques for medical text are developing fast, successful transfer into clinical practice has been rare. Especially the hospital domain offers great potential while facing several challenges including many documents per patient, multiple departments and complex interrelated processes."
"Spectroscopic, spectrophotometric and thermal characterization of synthesized nitrobenzyl-pyridyl ether compounds and Ag (I) complexes, evaluation of their antibacterial activities against plant-borne and food-borne pathogens","New nitrobenzyl-pyridyl ether ligands were synthesized by reacting nitrobenzyl bromide (2-, 3- and 4-nitro) and halogen-substituted hydroxy pyridine (2-chloro-3-hydroxy-pyridine, 2-bromo-3-hydroxy-pyridine) compounds in DMF. By interacting the obtained ligands (L1, L3, L4 and L6) with silver (I) nitrate, transition metal complexes were prepared (AgL1, AgL3, AgL4 and AgL6). The structures of the synthesized ligands and complexes were characterized using FTIR, HRMS, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopic techniques. In addition, fluorescence spectra of the ligands (L1-L6) were detected in the presence of different metal cations (Li+, Na+, Mg2+, Al3+, K+, Ca2+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+ and Ag+). In addition, the thermal behavior of all compounds were examined by TGA-DTA methods and the data of silver complexes and ligands were compared. Within the scope of the study, the antibacterial activities of all compounds were investigated against 4 pathogens, 2 of which were plant-borne (Xanthomonas vesicotoria, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. Michiganensis) and 2 were food-borne (Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes)."
Possibility of Discovering the Super-Heavy Elements Z=119 and 120,"We reveal that inclusion of fission barrier, nuclear level densities, neutron and fission decay widths in a better way in the advanced statistical method and dinuclear system model can lead to reproduce well the measured production cross sections of the cold and hot fusion reactions in the range \(Z=102-118\). In addition, we show that the optimal beam energies, where the production cross section reaches its maximum, can also be effectively determined using quasielastic barrier distribution curves. This theoretical approach helps us to verify the cause of low production cross section measured for the super-heavy element (SHE) \(^{278}\)Nh with the reaction \(^{70}\)Zn + \(^{209}\)Bi and null results from the reaction \(^{86}\)Kr+\(^{208}\)Pb used for synthesizing the SHE Z=118. Furthermore, the same has been employed to explore the reason for the failure of many trials in synthesizing the SHEs for \(Z=119\) and 120. ER cross sections at the optimal energies for a few heavy-ion reactions in synthesizing the SHE \(Z=119\) and 120 are seen to be measurable. Thus, the synthesis of the SHEs for \(Z=\)119 and 120 is on the cards."
Methane Emissions Associated with Bald Cypress Knees Across the Mississippi River Alluvial Valley,"In freshwater forested wetlands, bald cypress knees (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.) have the potential to emit large amounts of methane (CH4), but only a few studies have examined their greenhouse gas contribution. In this study, we measured CH4 fluxes associated with cypress knees across various climate and flooding gradients of the Mississippi River Alluvial Valley in southcentral United States. Greenhouse gases were measured using a portable gas analyzer with a custom-made chamber placed over the knees. We also conducted 3D lidar scans of knees using a smartphone to estimate the surface area and volume of knees. We investigated the following: (1) What parameters influence CH4 fluxes (i.e., knee height, distance to stream, temperature, relative humidity, water level, precipitation)? and (2) Which type of knee shape measurement (i.e., cone, frustrum, or lidar scan) provides the best fit to model data while maximizing measurement efficiency? We found that knee CH4 flux rates ranged from − 0.005 to 182 mmol m− 2 d− 1. There were positive correlations between CH4 fluxes, water levels, and temperature, and a negative correlation with knee height. Sites that had been dry for longer periods of time emitted less CH4 than sites where the soil remained saturated. The frustrum shape produced a knee volume estimate that was within 12% of lidar scans, whereas cone shapes underestimate knee dimensions (-100%). Further research of emissions and fluxes in cypress knees could fill knowledge gaps within the carbon cycle and could represent a major component of wetland CH4 budgets."
Fixed parameters in the population pharmacokinetic modeling of valproic acid might not be suitable: external validation in Chinese adults with epilepsy or after neurosurgery,This study aims to assess the predictive performance of published valproic acid (VPA) population pharmacokinetic (PPK) models using an external data set in Chinese adults with epilepsy or after neurosurgery.
Enlivening a place brand inclusively: evidence from ten European cities,"This study contributes to the stream of research investigating the influence of the creative sector on the development of cities and the importance of place branding to local development. Place branding increasingly influences the competitiveness and attractiveness of cities. We examined ten European cities as creative places and how integrating creative economy strategies, social inclusion, and sustainable practices into city branding contributes to differentiation and competitiveness. The current research contributes to the research area by examining certain cities in the context of the creative economy and investigating how, as creative brands, they can be differentiated from their competitors by utilizing inclusive planning of the image of the place."
Enhancing Sustainable Construction Practices: Utilizing Heat-Treated Recycled Concrete Fines for Improving Slag-Based Geopolymer Materials,"This study explores the untapped potential of utilizing heat-treated recycled fines (HT-RFs) from mortar as a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative for slag-based geopolymer materials in construction. The RFs undergo a novel heat treatment process at 650 °C to significantly enhance their reactivity. Geopolymer mixtures incorporating both heat-treated and untreated RFs at various replacement ratios (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) are meticulously evaluated for their porosity, flexural strength, and compressive strength after 28 days of curing. The load-midspan displacement and failure behavior are analyzed using digital image correlation techniques. The microstructure of the mortar samples is comprehensively analyzed using state-of-the-art techniques including thermogravimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The results showed that the incorporation of 30% heat-treated recycled fines into slag based geopolymer increased compressive and flexural strengths by 30.67% and 27.31%, respectively, while substantially reducing the porosity by 16%, compared to the control geopolymer mixture. This study promotes sustainability in construction with eco-friendly materials by minimizing waste."
The Italian experience on liver transplantation for unresectable peri-hilar cholangiocarcinoma: a national survey and future perspectives,"Liver transplantation (LT) was considered an ineffective treatment for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (pCCA) until the successful experience of the Mayo Clinic, proposing a protocol with strict inclusion criteria and neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy. Since 2015, pCCA is considered an indication for LT in Italy only in the context of controlled prospective studies. We performed a survey among the 22 Italian Liver Transplant Centers to assess the results of LT for pCCA. Eight centers reported 53 cases from 1986 to 2021 (Bologna 12, Padova 10, Niguarda 10, Milano Tumori 8, Torino 5, Pisa 4, Ancona 2, Modena 2). Patients were divided according to whether they recieved neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy (Group 1, 25 cases) or not (Group 2, 28 cases). Eleven patients were transplanted without neoadjuvant treatment after 2015. Overall survival at 1, 3 and 5 years was 83.8%, 56.6% and 50.6% in Group 1 and 72.4%, 41.4% and 35.5% in Gropu 2 (p = 0.13). Recurrence-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 91.2%, 61.1% and 47.2% in Group 1 and 58.2%, 42.2%, and 36.1% in Group 2 (p = 0.16). A competing risk regression analysis showed a 5-year risk of cancer-related death of 19% for patients in Group 1 against 62.3% in Group 2, with a hazard ratio of 0.31 (95%CI [0.10–0.98], p 0.047). This survey promoted a discussion about the limitations of the Mayo protocol and set the basis for the adoption of a new nationwide protocol (LITHALICA–NCT06125769), having the same inclusion criteria but proposing standard of care chemotherapy as neoadjuvant regimen."
Anatomical relationship between maxillary posterior teeth and the maxillary sinus in an Indonesian population: a CT scan study,"The anatomical proximity between the root apex of the maxillary posterior teeth and the maxillary sinus can lead to complications, including odontogenic maxillary sinusitis. While several studies have investigated similar variables in different populations, there is limited research on the Indonesian population. This study aimed to describe the anatomical position of the maxillary posterior teeth in relation to the floor of the maxillary sinus using CT scans."
Transcatheter stenting of superior vena cava to treat postoperative SVC syndrome in a child: a case report,"Superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction leading to SVC syndrome is an uncommon but potential complication of cardiac surgeries that involve dissection and anastomosis around the great vein. We present a case of iatrogenic SVC obstruction that was initially treated with transcatheter balloon angioplasty, which provided temporary relief, and ultimately resolved by stenting the affected segment."
Synthesis of non-canonical amino acids through dehydrogenative tailoring,"Amino acids are essential building blocks in biology and chemistry. While nature relies on a small number of amino acid structures, chemists desire access to a vast scope of structurally diverse analogs1–3 The selective modification of amino acid side-chain residues represents an efficient strategy to access non-canonical derivatives of value in chemistry and biology. While semi-synthetic methods leveraging the functional groups found in polar and aromatic amino acids have been extensively explored, highly selective and general approaches to transform unactivated C–H bonds in aliphatic amino acids remain less developed4,5 Here, we disclose a stepwise dehydrogenative method to convert aliphatic amino acids into structurally diverse analogs. The key to the success of this approach lies in the development of a selective catalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation method driven by photochemical irradiation, which provides access to terminal alkene intermediates for downstream functionalization. Overall, this strategy enables the rapid synthesis of new amino acid building blocks and suggests possibilities for the late-stage modification of more complex oligopeptides."
Magneto-thermo-optic characterization of ZnFe2O4/Ag/AgCl nanocomposite/water nanofluid,"Herein, we report how the magnetic tunability of thermal diffusivity of nanofluids of zinc ferrite/silver/silver chloride in water can be achieved. High resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area analysis are performed to validate the characteristics and suitability of the sample in designing the magneto-thermo-optic characteristics. The dual beam thermal lens technique was employed for the first-time estimation of the thermal diffusivity of nanofluids in the presence of an external magnetic field which demonstrated up to a ten-fold increase in thermal diffusivity of nanofluid [\(14.5\times {10}^{-7}{m}^{2}{s}^{-1}\)] than that of base fluid water attributed to the clustering/chaining effects. The optical microscopic and field emission scanning electron microscopic images of the nanofluid films dried in the presence of magnetic field pointed to the dominant effects of percolation due to the aggregate formation of nanoparticles in attributing magnetic tunability of thermal diffusivity. Thus zinc ferrite/silver/silver chloride nanofluid can be tailored for several heat transfer applications such as heat sinks in electronics, magnetic hyperthermia and photothermal therapy."
Thermoelectric energy harvesting associated with heat pipes for monitoring highways weather conditions,"This work aims to develop a prototype for autonomously monitoring highway weather conditions using thermoelectric energy. The prototype utilizes solar thermal energy, heat absorbed by the asphalt and soil heat to generate, convert, manage, and store energy. The study investigates the optimal functioning of the thermoelectric generator, including utilizing the soil as a heat sink and incorporating passive thermal control devices like heat pipes. A commercial ultra-low power converter model LTC3108 was experimentally tested for efficient energy conversion. The monitoring system is designed to acquire readings from sensors measuring relevant climate parameters such as temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity, focusing on ultra-low power characteristics. The acquired data is transmitted via LoRa technology to a server for processing and analysis. The prototype generated 286.24 J of energy with a maximum temperature gradient of 4.25 ºC in the thermoelectric generator. The energy cost of transmitting a 40-byte message through the LoRaWAN module was 0.625 J. The proposed climate data acquisition circuit had a theoretical consumption of 17.69 J. Experimental tests with the LTC3108 converter, and a 0.22 F supercapacitor demonstrated successful data transmission. This work provides a solid foundation for future studies utilizing thermoelectric energy in highway applications, resulting in a prototype suitable for real-world road scenarios."
The long-term efficacy and safety of balloon dilation eustachian tuboplasty combined with tympanostomy tube insertion for patients with otitis media with effusion: study protocol for a prospective randomized controlled trial,"Otitis media with effusion (OME) is a common disease in ear, nose, and throat clinics characterized by aural fullness and hearing loss and mainly caused by eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD). Tympanostomy tube insertion (TTI) is a conventional surgical treatment option that can alleviate symptoms but does not provide a definitive cure, and it is prone to recurrence. Balloon dilation eustachian tuboplasty (BDET) has become a novel procedure for the treatment of ETD, demonstrating significant potential in addressing the aforementioned limitations. However, it is not widely available in the clinic and few high-quality randomized clinical trials was conducted to investigate its long-term efficacy and security in OME. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to verify the efficacy of BDET combined with TTI for patients with OME and its prospects for providing a definitive cure."

Optimization of TIG welding parameters for enhanced mechanical properties in AISI 316L stainless steel welds,"The objective of this research is to examine the impact of welding parameters on the surface roughness, hardness, and tensile strength of welds produced by a single-pass TIG welding process in austenitic stainless-steel plates (AISI 316L). Furthermore, the optimal processing variable settings will be identified in order to provide the highest levels of hardness, lowest levels of surface roughness, and highest levels of tensile strength. This study focuses on three parameters: arc current, voltage, and shielding gas flow rate, which were altered across three levels. A large number of tests were carried out on 3-mm thick AISI 316L stainless steel plates in order to determine the efficient and realistic operating limits of TIG welding settings. The welding process parameters’ operational limitations were determined by visual examination and bead shape. The values of current are taken as 100, 125, and 150 (A); voltage as 16, 18, and 20 (V); and gas flow rate as 6, 9, and 12 (L/min). Their impact on tensile strength, microhardness, and surface roughness was inspected. The experiments were conducted using Taguchi L9 orthogonal array (OA). Each input parameter was found to have an impact on the response. The optimized welding parameters for improved mechanical properties and surface roughness were identified. The results indicated an optimum tensile strength, 624.92 MPa, achieved at the parametric combination of 100 A current, voltage of 16 V, and gas flow of rate 6 L/min. The microhardness results indicated an optimum value, of 319.2 HV, achieved at the parametric combination of a current of 125 A, 16 V of voltage, and a gas flow rate of 9 L/min. A minimum surface roughness, 7.33 µm, was attained at 125 A current, voltage of 16 V, and gas flow rate of 9 L/min. These results highlight the significant impact of welding parameters on the mechanical properties and surface roughness of AISI 316L stainless steel welds."
ESC-YOLO: optimizing apple fruit recognition with efficient spatial and channel features in YOLOX,"Accurate localization of apple fruits and recognition of occlusion types in complex orchard environments play an important role in precision agriculture. This work proposes an efficient fruit recognition model called Efficient Spatial and Channel Feature YOLOX (ESC-YOLO). ESC-YOLO is built upon YOLOX and fully leverages and emphasizes spatial channel information, ensuring coherence between global information and local features. The optimization strategies for the backbone network involve adopting EfficientViT as the foundational backbone, integrating Spatial and Channel Reconstruction Convolution (SCConv) into the input stem to reorganize spatial channel features and reduce redundancy, and constructing the Efficient-MBConv module, which is optimally combined with the EfficientViTBlock for feature extraction. The optimization strategies for the neck network involve utilizing the Centralized Feature Pyramid Net (CFPNet) as the neck network and employing a Simple, Parameter-Free Attention Module (SimAM) to enhance model performance. In this work, we adopted the lightweight model of the ESC-YOLO for performance evaluation, namely ESC-YOLO-S. It achieves a 4.26% improvement in Top-1 mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to YOLOX-S and significantly reduces the false and missed detections caused by various types of occlusions. Therefore, the improved model meets the requirements for high-precision identification in complex orchard environments."

By examining all these potential relationships from a cross-country perspective, we aim to estimate potential cross-national differences."
The potential of carbon dots produced from mangosteen through green synthesis for induced-cell proliferation and fluorescence bioimaging,"We report the simple one-step hydrothermal green synthesis of carbon dots (CDs) without any chemical reagents using mangosteen pulp (CDs1), peel (CDs2), and leaf (CDs3) extract as a green carbon source. In the aqueous medium, these CDs had a size of 8–15 nm with an energy gap of about 4 eV. The CDs emitted a bright green color under ultraviolet (UV) irritation with an average fluorescence quantum yield of the CDs of 1.6%. Moreover, the CDs contained various functional groups, such as C = C, C–C, C–O–C, C–O, C = O, C–H, and O–H, which were beneficial for enhancing their fluorescence property. Furthermore, the CDs were applied in the stain fluorescent imaging of myosatellite chicken stem cells and Vero cells. The CDs2 and CDs3 induced a strong fluorescence emission intensity of the strain cells, whereas CDs1 acted as the highest potential enhancer in cell proliferation as confirmed by its cellular viability which was the around four times that of the control. Therefore, the CDs were highly biocompatible and acted as enhancers in cell proliferation in myosatellite chicken stem cells and Vero cells. Thus, simple, cost-effective, scalable, and green synthetic approach-based CDs show promise for the development of selective organelle labeling and optical sensing probes."
Expression of IL-33 in subjects with periodontitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Activation of the IL-33/ST2 axis leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and thus to the triggering of osteoclastogenesis, which is why it plays an important role in the immunopathogenesis of periodontitis. The aim of this study was to compare IL-33 levels in serum, plasma, saliva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of subjects with chronic periodontitis (CP) in comparison with the control group (CG)."
Simple recurrent selection-mediated improvement in quantitative traits of white onion,"Present investigation was conducted at the ICAR-Directorate of Onion and Garlic Research (DOGR), Pune, Maharashtra, India to assess the impact of simple recurrent selection on quantitative traits in. Fifteen white onion germplasm accessions were subjected to repeated cycles of selection for yield traits and TSS followed by intermating of the selects. The resulting selects (26), the basal germplasm accessions (15) and commercial varieties (03) were evaluated during the winter season of 2021–22. The study indicated considerable variability in the test genotypes and significant influence of genetic factors determining these traits. The trait marketable bulb weight exhibited high variability as evidenced from wide range indicating scope for improvement through selection. High heritability was noted for important yield traits i.e. marketable bulb weight, marketable bulb yield, total bulb yield and TSS indicating their amenability to selection. The selects W 448 BR-10 and W 398 AD-6 were found best for important traits indicating effectiveness of selection. Selection resulted in notable improvement in TSS over basal germplasm and commercial varieties. However, marketable and total bulb yield in the selects recorded improvement over the basal germplasm only. Cluster analysis using the D2 statistic indicated moderate variability existing in the test material. Clustering patterns indicated that several selects diverged from their corresponding basal germplasm. In contrast, a few selects were grouped together with their corresponding basal germplasm. The sister-selections clustered together can be considered as duplicates. The best distinct selects with respect to yield traits and TSS may be utilized in further improvement."
Profitable pathways: unraveling sales strategies and collusion impact in e-tailer-manufacturer supply chains,"Today, as market competition intensifies and competition costs rise, manufacturers are increasingly incentivized to engage in anti-competitive contracts or collusion, disrupting the market and harming non-colluding members; on top of all, the growing dominance of e-tailers further complicates supply chain relationships. While addressing the research gap in the specific dynamics between e-tailers and multiple manufacturers in the context of collusion and competition, the principal objective of this article is to get the best sales strategies and decision-making methods according to the standpoint of manufacturers, the e-tailer, and the entire supply chain. This study investigates the relationships and decisions of supply chain members, including an online retailer (e-tailer) and two manufacturers. Our findings indicate that fines for manufacturer collusion and higher e-tailer referral fees can reduce collusion incentives in reselling formats. When both manufacturers sell their products in a reselling sale format, the overall supply chain profit is appreciably higher in all cases, including centralized decision-making, Stackelberg-Bertrand competition, collusion, and deviation. Additionally, different sales formats increase collusion likelihood compared to identical formats, though reselling formats make collusion more sustainable. E-tailers should invest in high-intensity services to boost profitability, while manufacturers prioritize the agency sale format for optimal profits. The findings of this paper are significant as they provide practical guidance for supply chain management and help in monitoring commercial behavior to prevent collusion."

Distributed non-disclosive validation of predictive models by a modified ROC-GLM,"Distributed statistical analyses provide a promising approach for privacy protection when analyzing data distributed over several databases. Instead of directly operating on data, the analyst receives anonymous summary statistics, which are combined into an aggregated result. Further, in discrimination model (prognosis, diagnosis, etc.) development, it is key to evaluate a trained model w.r.t. to its prognostic or predictive performance on new independent data. For binary classification, quantifying discrimination uses the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and its area under the curve (AUC) as aggregation measure. We are interested to calculate both as well as basic indicators of calibration-in-the-large for a binary classification task using a distributed and privacy-preserving approach."
MCC’s First-Ever Observation of a High-Altitude Plume Cloud on Mars: Linkages with Space Weather?,"Various Mars missions and telescopic remote observations have provided a comprehensive understanding of the complex atmospheric phenomenon and the structure of the Martian atmosphere. Several studies reported remote observation of layered clouds up to 100 km on Mars. Based on telescope data, observation of an unusual plume at an altitude of 200–250 km during March–April 2012 was reported. No such observation from any Mars orbiting spacecraft has been reported so far. Using data from the Mars Colour Camera onboard the Mars Orbiter Mission acquired on 4 January 2016, we report the occurrence of a high-altitude bright plume at the Martian evening terminator at an altitude of 260–300 km above the surface. The plume is observed at Meridiani Planum with a central location near 4.9°E and 9.5°S. Five images acquired within 10 min shows rapid variability in plume shape due to the movement of spacecraft and Mars. Preliminary analysis of MAVEN in-situ measurements shows an extremely disturbed solar wind plasma state during the plume observation time. We cautiously conclude that the formation of this high-altitude plume may result from interplanetary coronal mass ejection that occurred on 28 December 2015 that impacted Mars at around 3–4 January 2016 as confirmed by the analysis of simulation results and of in-situ solar wind data."
"Knowledge, attitudes, and practice of physicians and pharmacists regarding the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular toxicity associated with cancer treatment","This study aimed to explore physicians’ and pharmacists’ knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) regarding the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular toxicity associated with cancer treatment.

Enhancing ocular diseases recognition with domain adaptive framework: leveraging domain confusion,"Visual health and optimal eyesight hold immense importance in our lives. However, ocular diseases can inflict emotional and financial hardships on patients and families. While various clinical methods exist for diagnosing ocular conditions, early screening of retinal images offers not only a cost-effective approach but also the detection of potential ocular diseases at earlier stages. Simultaneously, many studies have harnessed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition, capitalizing on their potential. Nevertheless, the applicability of most networks tends to be limited across different domains. When well-trained models from a domain are applied to another domain, a significant decline in accuracy might occur, thereby constraining the networks’ practical implementation and wider adoption. In this research endeavor, we present a domain adaptive framework, ResNet-50 with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (RMMD). Initially, we employed ResNet-50 architecture as a foundational network, a popular network used for modification and experimenting with whether a module could improve the accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the concept of Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), a metric for quantifying domain differences. Subsequently, we integrate MMD into the loss function, inducing a state of confusion within the network concerning domain disparities. The outcomes derived from the OIA-ODIR dataset substantiate the efficacy of our proposed network. Our framework attains an impressive accuracy of 40.51% (F1) and 81.06% (AUC, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve), marking a notable enhancement of 9.52% and 7.18% respectively when juxtaposed with the fundamental ResNet-50 model, compared with raw ResNet-50 30.99% (F1) and 73.88% (AUC)."
Large AdS6 black holes from CFT5,"We study supersymmetric AdS6 black holes at large angular momenta, from the index of 5d SCFTs on S4 × ℝ in the large N and Cardy limit. Our examples are the strong coupling limits of 5d gauge theories on the D4-D8-O8 system. The large N free energy scales like N5/2, statistically accounting for the entropy of large black holes in AdS6. Instanton solitons play subtle roles to realize these deconfined degrees of freedom."
The Potential Role of Phytoplankton Functional Groups Under Anthropogenic Stressed Wetlands: Characterizing The Environmental Sensitivity,"Anthropogenic and climatic changes are continuously altering the freshwater plankton, necessitating an evaluation of the complex structure of plankton communities to understand and mitigate these impacts. In this context, the present study focuses on evaluating the structure of plankton communities, specifically Phytoplankton Functional Groups (FGs) for assessing the environmental sensitivity of wetlands under changing scenario. These FGs are defined by shared adaptive features rather than taxonomic traits. Over the period from 2016 to 2018, two ecologically distinct wetlands were examined, analysing their phytoplankton FGs and their relationship with water quality parameters. Ecohydrological data revealed significant seasonal variations (p ≤ 0.05) in key parameters such as water depth, temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total alkalinity, total hardness, NO3-N, and PO4-P. Notably, there were no significant differences observed among the sampling stations within each wetland. A total of 125 phytoplankton genera/species were classified into 23 FGs in the open wetland and 22 FGs in the closed wetland. Spatial and seasonal analyses of dominant FGs suggested both wetlands were experiencing pollution pressures. This study highlights the powerful role of phytoplankton functional groups (FGs) as bioindicators of wetland health, uncovering pollution pressures. In open wetlands, 15 phytoplankton FGs with 36 key taxa (Indicator Value ≥ 40%) emerged as critical indicators, while in closed wetlands, only 10 FGs with 17 taxa were identified. To assess eutrophication, the occurrence of these indicator species was evaluated using BVSTEP function analysis. The study recommends pollution reduction in catchment areas and restoration of riverine connectivity to enhance FG diversity. Phytoplankton FG methodologies are deemed effective for assessing the environmental sensitivity of wetlands significantly impacted by human activities. This research offers a scientific foundation for the evaluation and restoration of wetland ecosystems."
"Gustatory receptor 11 is involved in detecting the oviposition water of Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus","Aedes albopictus is a major arbovirus vector with small stagnant water containers being its oviposition sites. Mosquitoes search for these sites based on their olfactory cues (odor and moisture emanating from the water at the oviposition site), visual cues (size and color of the site), and gustatory cues (ion and nutrient concentration in that water). The gustatory mechanism through which mosquitoes search for oviposition sites remains unknown."

Evaluating the impact of reducing POFA’s particle fineness on its pozzolanic reactivity and mortar strength,"This paper presents the effect of size reduction of palm oil fuel ash (POFA) in the nanoscale to improve the mortar strength. In this work, three different particle sizes of POFA prepared using the LA abrasion machine were used as a cement replacement. The physical and chemical properties, mineralogy, and morphology of all POFA specimens were studied. The effect of size reduction on the pozzolanic reactivity of POFA is also studied. The mortar mix design that contained micro and nano POFA was prepared and evaluated for its compressive and flexural properties at the ages of 7, 28, 56, and 90 days. Response surface methodology was used to evaluate the relationship between the factors (cement replacement) and responses (compressive and flexural strength), aiming to find the best mix design. The grinding method in this work produced POFA as small as 110 nm. The nano POFAs were observed to have better pozzolanic reactivity compared to micro POFA. The results show that nano POFA increased the mortar strength activity index by up to 20% compared to micro POFA. The best mix design was found using a combination of 10 and 3% of micro and nano POFA as cement replacement. The best mix design shows excellent early compressive strength (7 days) compared to other mixes, although the difference in long-term compressive strength is insignificant. Similar findings were observed for the flexural strength, whereby the best mix design was obtained using a combination of 10 and 3% of micro and nano POFA. This work may provide useful insight into the effect of size reduction on the pozzolanic reactivity of POFA."
BSP-Net: automatic skin lesion segmentation improved by boundary enhancement and progressive decoding methods,"Automatic skin lesion segmentation from dermoscopy images is of great significance in the early treatment of skin cancers, which is yet challenging even for dermatologists due to the inherent issues, i.e., considerable size, shape and color variation, and ambiguous boundaries. In this paper, we propose a network BSP-Net that implements the combination of critical boundary information and segmentation tasks to simultaneously solve the variation and boundary problems in skin lesion segmentation. The architecture of BSP-Net primarily consists of a multi-scale boundary enhancement (MBE) module and a progressive fusion decoder (PD). The MBE module, by deeply extracting boundary information in both multi-axis frequency and multi-scale spatial domains, generates precise boundary key-point prediction maps. This process not only accurately models local boundary information but also effectively retains global contextual information. On the other hand, the PD employs an asymmetric decoding strategy, guiding the generation of refined segmentation results by combining boundary-enhanced features rich in geometric details with global features containing semantic information about lesions. This strategy progressively fuses boundary and semantic information at different levels, effectively enabling high-performance collaboration between cross-level contextual features. To assess the effectiveness of BSP-Net, we conducted extensive experiments on two public datasets (ISIC-2016 &PH2, ISIC-2018) and one private dataset (XJUSKin). BSP-Net achieved Dice coefficients of 90.81, 92.41, and 83.88%, respectively. Additionally, it demonstrated precise boundary delineation with Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD) scores of 7.96, 6.88, and 10.92%, highlighting its strong performance in skin lesion segmentation."
GIS and AHP-based flood susceptibility mapping: a case study of Bangladesh,"Bangladesh, situated within the vast Bengal Delta, faces a significant challenge due to its low-lying and flat topography: frequent and devastating floods. Acknowledging the influence of physical elements on flood events, flood susceptibility assessment emerges as a critical tool for establishing effective and sustainable flood mitigation strategies. This study endeavors to delineate flood-prone zones within Bangladesh by employing a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework that integrates Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), a well-established approach in this field. Eight flood-influencing factors were considered in this study: elevation, slope, drainage density, rainfall, distance to the river, flow accumulation, curve number, and permeability. These factors represent physical elements and derivatives of the morphological, hydrological, meteorological, and hydrographical characteristics of the study area. Following their necessary processing, weights were assigned to each factor based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Subsequently, geospatial analysis was conducted within the GIS interface. Flood-prone zones were categorized into five susceptibility classes: very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. Elevation emerged as the key factor, with a comparatively higher influence on flood occurrence compared to the other factors. The study revealed that 16.03% of Bangladesh falls within the very high susceptibility class, while 42.78%, 25.78%, 7.62%, and 7.74% fall within the high, moderate, low, and very low susceptibility classes, respectively."
Improvement of bioanalytical parameters through automation: suitability of a hand-like robotic system,"Commercial automation systems for small- and medium-sized laboratories, including research environments, are often complex to use. For liquid handling systems (LHS), development is required not only for the robot’s movements but also for adapting the bioanalytical method to the automated system. This study investigates whether a more human-like automation strategy—using a robotic system (RS)—is more suitable for research laboratories than a professional automation approach utilizing a commercial automated LHS. We conducted a series of measurements for protein determination using a Bradford assay manually, with a fully automated LHS, and with our human-like RS. Although the hand-like RS approach requires more than twice the time of the LHS, it achieved the best standard deviation in this setup (RS = 0.5, manual = 0.71, LHS = 0.86). Due to the low limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ), most protein samples could be quantified with the RS (samples below LOQ = 9.7%, LOD = 0.23; LOQ = 0.25) compared to manual (samples below LOQ = 28.8%, LOD = 0.24; LOQ = 0.26) and the LHS (samples below LOQ = 36.1%, LOD = 0.27; LOQ = 0.31). In another time-dependent enzymatic assay test, the RS achieved results comparable to the manual method and the LHS, although the required time could be a constraint for short incubation times. Our results demonstrate that a more hand-like automation system closely models the manual process, leading easier to accurate bioanalytical results. We conclude that such a system could be more suitable for typical research environments than a complex LHS."

Source apportionment of some heavy metals in metropolitan and nearby agricultural soils using the multivariate statistical technique and kriging in the North of Iran,"This research was established to explore the variability and sources of some heavy metals; HMs (Zn, Fe, Cu, Cr, Mn, Co, Pb, and Ni), in a metropolitan and surrounding agricultural area in northern Iran using multivariate statistical analysis. One hundred and two soil samples were randomly taken from 0 to 20 cm depth and heavy metal concentrations and some soil properties included electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic matter (SOM), soil texture, soil carbonate, and pH were measured. The mean and standard deviation of selected metals in the total dataset were 81.06 ± 77.69 mg kg− 1 for Pb, 61 ± 14.35 mg kg− 1 for Ni, 17.48 ± 3.53 mg kg− 1 for Co, 29.24 ± 6.35 mg kg− 1 for Cr, 353 ± 172 mg kg− 1 for Mn, 17,953 ± 25,193 mg kg− 1 for Fe, 30.58 ± 21.32 mg kg− 1 for Cu and 50.33 ± 33.13 mg kg− 1 for Zn. Correlation analysis showed that all HMs have positive relationships together and some have higher coefficients displaying their common sources. Positive significant correlations (P < 0.01) were found between HMs and SOM and clay content confirming the high influence of colloidal surfaces in HMs affinity. Multivariate analysis resulted in three principal complements or factors that explained about 82.5% of the total variance. Factor 1 with a high contribution of Zn, Pb, Cu, and Mn showed higher involvement of anthropogenic activities such as fertilizing in farmlands, urbanization, and industrial activities. Factor 2 with a higher contribution of Fe and Co was dominantly widespread spatially somewhere igneous and tuff were distributed. Factor 3 with the highest loading of Cr and Ni as well as high relative loadings in two other factors, indicating both sources. The results are so crucial for decision-makers and governors to implement appropriate strategies to reduce the risk of HMs and soil remediation policies."
Deep learning to predict risk of lateral skull base cerebrospinal fluid leak or encephalocele,"Skull base features, including increased foramen ovale (FO) cross-sectional area, are associated with lateral skull base spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (sCSF) leak and encephalocele. Manual measurement requires skill in interpreting imaging studies and is time consuming. The goal of this study was to develop a fully automated deep learning method for FO segmentation and to determine the predictive value in identifying patients with sCSF leak or encephalocele."
Object Recognition Consistency in Regression for Active Detection,"Active learning has achieved great success in image classification because of selecting the most informative samples for data labeling and model training. However, the potential of active learning has been far from being realised in object detection due to its unique challenge in utilizing localization information. A popular compromise is to simply take active classification learning over detected object candidates. To consider the localization information of object detection, current effort usually falls into the model-dependent fashion, which either works on specific detection frameworks or relies on additionally designed modules. In this paper, we propose model-agnostic Object Recognition Consistency in Regression (ORCR), which can holistically measure the uncertainty information of classification and localization of each detected candidate from object detection. The philosophy behind ORCR is to obtain the detection uncertainty by calculating the classification consistency through localization regression at two successive detection scales. In the light of the proposed ORCR, we devise an active learning framework that enables an effortless deployment to any object detection architecture. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO benchmarks show that our method achieves better performance while simplifying the active detection process."
Analysis of the anti-Candida activity of tricyclic antidepressants in association with amphotericin B and their antifungal mechanisms,"Candida species are among the priority pathogens in the area of research and development. Due to the problems associated with resistance to antifungals, new therapeutic alternatives are necessary. In this regard, drug repositioning has gained prominence. The objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of three tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) – amitriptyline (AMT), nortriptyline (NOR) and clomipramine (CLO) – isolated or associated with antifungals against strains of Candida spp., as well as to analyze the possible mechanism of action. Among the methods used were broth microdilution tests, tolerance level assessment, checkerboard assays, flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, Candida cells were visualized after treatments by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). AMT presented MIC 50% in the range of 16 to 128 µg/mL, NOR from 8 to 128 µg/mL, and CLO from 8 to 64 µg/mL, with all three TCAs having a fungicidal inhibitory action profile. For these TCAs, there was synergism with amphotericin B (AMB) in 100% of the isolates. In association with fluconazole (FLC) and itraconazole (ITR), there were mostly indifferent interactions. TCAs isolated and associated with AMB reduced cell viability, promoted DNA fragmentation and damage, caused mitochondrial depolarization, externalization of phosphatidylserine, produced reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) and increased carbonyl protein levels, causing morphological changes. The results suggest the antifungal mechanism of the TCAs works via the apoptotic pathway."
Quantifying wildland fire resources deployed during the compound threat of COVID-19,"Fire agencies across the United States must make complex resource allocation decisions to manage wildfires using a national network of shared firefighting resources. Firefighters play a critical role in suppressing fires and protecting vulnerable communities. However, they are exposed to health and safety risks associated with fire, smoke inhalation, and infectious disease transmission. The COVID-19 pandemic further complicated these risks, prompting fire agencies to propose resource management adaptations to minimize COVID-19 exposure and transmission. It is unclear if and how the pandemic may have operationally influenced wildland firefighting personnel resource use given compounding wildfire and COVID-19 risks. Therefore, we developed generalized linear mixed models that were fit using multiple integrated datasets to detect changes in personnel resource use for years prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, while controlling for historical fire and landscape conditions, societal risks, and management objectives. Analyses of observed and predicted firefighting resource use revealed reductions in the mean personnel resources used per wildfire per day during the pandemic for models developed across the western U.S. and for various western U.S. fire regions. Notably, the Northern California and the Great Basin Coordination Centers showed statistically significant reductions in ground personnel use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Learning from wildland fire management strategies and resource use trends that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, fire agencies can better anticipate resource constraints that may arise during the compounding threats of severe wildland fire activity and infectious disease outbreaks to proactively prepare and adapt suppression management strategies."
Software defined networking based network traffic classification using machine learning techniques,"The classification of network traffic has become increasingly crucial due to the rapid growth in the number of internet users. Conventional approaches, such as identifying traffic based on port numbers and payload inspection are becoming ineffective due to the dynamic and encrypted nature of modern network traffic. A number of researchers have implemented Software Defined Networking (SDN) based traffic classification using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. However, the studies had various limitations such as encrypted traffic detection, payload inspection, poor detection accuracy, and challenges with testing models both in offline and real-time traffic modes. ML models together with SDN are adopted nowadays to enhance classification performance. In this paper, both supervised (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Support Vector Machine) and unsupervised (K-means clustering) ML models were used to classify Domain Name System (DNS), Telnet, Ping, and Voice traffic flows simulated using the Distributed Internet Traffic Generator (D-ITG) tool. The use of this tool effectively manages and classifies traffic types based on their application. The study discussed the dataset used, model selection, implementation of the model, and implementation techniques (such as pre-processing, feature extraction, ML algorithm, and model evaluation metrics). The proposed model in SDN was implemented in Mininet for designing the network architecture and generating network traffic. Anaconda Python environment was utilized for traffic classification using various ML techniques. Among the models tested, the Decision Tree supervised learning achieved the highest accuracy of 99.81%, outperforming other supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. These results indicate that the integration of ML with SDN provides an efficient classification method for identifying and accurately classifying both offline and real-time network traffic, enhanced quality of service (QoS), detection of encrypted packets, deep packet inspection and management."
Effect of technological voids on hydro-mechanical behavior of compacted bentonite,"In the high-level radioactive waste geological disposal, the gaps between the waste canisters, buffer layer, and surrounding rock, will affect the hydro-mechanical behavior of bentonite blocks. In this paper, the gaps between the buffer layers were simulated by setting different technological void widths. The interaction between technological void width and the swelling pressure and hydraulic conductivity of compacted bentonite was investigated. Meanwhile, the effect of different boundary conditions on the hydration process of compacted bentonite simulated through stepwise pre-set technological void (SV) and completely pre-set technological void (CV) was studied. The results showed that, keeping the same dry density, the swelling pressure of compacted bentonite blocks with 33% technological voids remained unchanged compared to specimens without voids, while the hydraulic conductivity increased by 10%. Comparing the SV with CV specimens, the swelling pressure was similar, but the hydraulic conductivity of the latter increased by 6%. Microstructural test results indicated differences in overall homogeneity between compacted bentonite blocks with 33% technological voids and those without voids after complete hydration, and distinct differences were also observed between the void and block areas in specimens with voids. The SV method reduced the cumulative pore volume in the void area, resulting in a more uniform hydration process."
Synthesis and characterization of ZnO–NiO composites for efficient U(VI) scavenger,"(1-x)ZnO–xNiO nanocomposites (where x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20) have been successfully synthesized using a mechanical mixing approach. Structural phase, morphological, and elemental composition analysis have been carried out using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, EDX, and XPS analysis. The systematic batch mode adsorption studies were carried out to evaluate the optimized adsorption behavior of synthesized nanocomposites (pH = 6; contact time = 90 min and adsorption dose = 0.5 g/L). Kinetic studies revealed that the prepared nanocomposite (0.80ZnO0.20NiO) successfully adsorbs U(VI) through a chemisorption nature with the maximum Langmuir capacity (~ 151.20 mg/g). The results demonstrated that the prepared 0.80ZnO0.20NiO can be used as a packaging material for column units in water purifiers."
Comparative study of machine-and deep-learning based classification algorithms for biomedical Raman spectroscopy (RS): case study of RS based pathogenic microbe identification,"One key aspect pushing the frontiers of biomedical RS is dedicated machine- or deep- learning (ML or DL) algorithms. Yet, systematic comparative study between ML and DL algorithms has not been conducted for biomedical RS, largely due to the limited availability of open-source and large Raman spectra dataset. Therefore we compared typical ML partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and DL one dimensional convolution neural network (1D-CNN) based pathogenic microbe identification on 12,000 Raman spectra from six species of microbe (i.e., K. aerogenes (Klebsiella aerogenes), C. albicans (Candida albicans), C. glabrata (Candida glabrata), Group A Strep. (Group A Streptococcus), E. coli1 (Escherichia coli1), E. coli2 (Escherichia coli2)) when 100%, 75%, 50% and 25% of the 12,000 Raman spectra were retained. The total Raman dataset was analyzed with 80% split for training and 20% for testing. The 100% retained testing dataset accuracy, area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were 95.25% and 0.997 for 1D-CNN, which are higher than those (89.42% and 0.979) of PLS-DA. Yet, PLS-DA outperforms 1D-CNN for 75%, 50% and 25% retained testing dataset. The resultant accuracies and AUCs demonstrated the performance reliance of PLS-DA and 1D-CNN on Raman spectra number. Besides, both loadings on the latent variables of PLS-DA and the saliency maps of 1D-CNN largely captured Raman peaks arising from DNA and proteins with comparable interpretability. The results of the current work indicated that both ML and DL algorithms should be explored for application-wise Raman spectra identification to select whichever with higher accuracies and AUCs."
Differential gene expression in the kidneys of SHR and WKY rats after intravenous administration of Akkermansia muciniphila-derived extracellular vesicles,"Although Akkermansia muciniphila (Am) plays a beneficial role as a probiotic in the treatment of metabolic syndrome, the mechanisms remain elusive. We tested the hypothesis that Am extracellular vesicles (AmEVs) protect against hypertension through modulation of gene expression in the kidneys of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Extracellular vesicles purified from anaerobically cultured Am (1.0 × 108 or 1.0 × 109 particles/kg) or vehicles were injected into the tail veins of Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs) and SHRs weekly for 4 weeks. Renal cortical tissues isolated from both rat strains were analyzed by trichrome stain and RT-qPCR. AmEVs protect against the development of hypertension in SHRs without a serious adverse reaction. AmEVs increased the expression of vasocontracting Agt and At1ar as well as vasodilating At2r, Mas1 and Nos2 in the kidneys of both strains. These results indicate that AmEVs have a protective effect against hypertension without a serious adverse reaction. Therefore, it is foreseen that AmEVs may be utilized as a novel therapeutic for the treatment of hypertension."
Glucose Oxidase Coupling with Pistol-Like DNAzyme Based Colorimetric Assay for Sensitive Glucose Detection in Tears and Saliva,"Non-invasive monitoring of glucose levels in tears and saliva is crucial for diagnosing and predicting various illnesses, such as diabetic nephropathy. However, the capability of the current glucose detection methods to identify small amounts of glucose with a high sensitivity remains a significant obstacle. This study proposes a simple, visual technique for sensitively detecting glucose levels from tears and saliva using glucose oxidase (GOx) to catalyze glucose and pistol-like DNAzyme (PLDz) to enhance the signal. In particular, the β-D-glucose present in the samples serves as the initial molecule that GOx identifies and catalyzes to generate gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The H2O2 induces the self-cleavage of PLDz, activating the “part b” sequence. This activation initiates catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) and releases the DNAzyme section in the H1 probe. The DNAzyme acts as a peroxidase analog, facilitating the catalysis of the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)-hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) system and resulting in color changes. The proposed method exhibits a broad detection range of six orders of magnitude and a low limit of 0.32 μM for glucose detection. Furthermore, the proposed method was highly effective in detecting glucose in saliva and tears, suggesting that it could potentially diagnose hyperglycemia-related disorders in clinical environments."
Coupling advection–dispersion equation and dynamic model for phytoremediation of 134Cs in soil,"This study proposes a model for phytoremediation coupling transport in soil and dynamic model using sunflower plants and 134Cs radionuclide. The model was validated by comparison with experimental measurements. The error value obtained, ranging from 0.00045–0.5268, is quite small, and the overall simulation data has approached the experiment. Factors influencing radionuclide concentration in different blocks include saturation point values, absorption rates of plant parts, soil dispersion coefficient, and velocity. The model is used to predict doses from ingesting sunflower seeds and estimates the soil-to-plant transfer factor. This new model is recommended for accurate assessment of environmental risks associated with radionuclides and for efficient decontamination."
The degree of a class of minimal non-PS-groups,"We show that the least n such that we can embed the minimal non-PS-group \(\,\,G ={\big <}a, b \,:\, a^{q} = b^{4} = 1, ab=ba^{q-1} {\big >}\) in the symmetric group \(\textrm{S}_{n}\) is \(q+4\)."
Primary biliary cholangitis has causal effects on systemic rheumatic diseases: a Mendelian randomization study,"An association has been observed between primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and systemic rheumatic diseases (SRDs) in observational studies, however the exact causal link remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the causal effects of PBC on SRDs through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis."
A systematic study of data augmentation for protected AES implementations,"Side-channel attacks against cryptographic implementations are mitigated by the application of masking and hiding countermeasures. Hiding countermeasures attempt to reduce the Signal-to-Noise Ratio of measurements by adding noise or desynchronization effects during the execution of the cryptographic operations. To bypass these protections, attackers adopt signal processing techniques such as pattern alignment, filtering, averaging, or resampling. Convolutional neural networks have shown the ability to reduce the effect of countermeasures without the need for trace preprocessing, especially alignment, due to their shift invariant property. Data augmentation techniques are also considered to improve the regularization capacity of the network, which improves generalization and, consequently, reduces the attack complexity. In this work, we deploy systematic experiments to investigate the benefits of data augmentation techniques against masked AES implementations when they are also protected with hiding countermeasures. Our results show that, for each countermeasure and dataset, a specific neural network architecture requires a particular data augmentation configuration to achieve significantly improved attack performance. Our results clearly show that data augmentation should be a standard process when targeting datasets with hiding countermeasures in deep learning-based side-channel attacks."
Feasibility of a deep-inspiration breath-hold [18F]AlF-NOTA-LM3 PET/CT imaging on upper-abdominal lesions in NET patients: in comparison with respiratory-gated PET/CT,To explore the clinical feasibility and efficacy of a deep inspiration breath-hold (BH) PET/CT using [18F]AlF-NOTA-LM3 on upper abdominal lesions in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).
"Knockdown of HM13 Inhibits Metastasis, Proliferation, and M2 Macrophage Polarization of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Cells by Suppressing the JAK2/STAT3 Signaling Pathway","An upregulated histocompatibility minor 13 (HM13) has been studied in various tumors, yet the exact mechanism of HM13 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unclear. In view of same, the present study investigates crucial role and action mechanism of HM13 in human NSCLC. HM13 expression was higher in NSCLC tissue and cells through the Western blotting technique along with qRT-PCR. As per data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), NSCLC patients having high HM13 expression show lower overall survival. 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU), Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), and transwell tests were assessed for NSCLC cell growth, and invasion, and we found that silencing of HM13 inhibited the NSCLC cell proliferation, invasion. Additionally, to investigate the effects of HM13 on THP-1 macrophage polarization, a co-culture model of NSCLC and THP-1 macrophages were used. The CD206 + macrophages were examined using flow cytometry. As the markers of M2 macrophage, the mRNA levels of IL-10 and TGF-β of THP-1 cells were also detected by qRT-PCR. Knockdown of HM13 could inhibit the M2 polarization. Further experiments demonstrated that downregulated HM13 could inhibit the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. RO8191 (activator of JAK/STAT3 pathway) influenced the invasion, proliferation, and expression of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers induced by HM13 silencing. HM13 knockdown also inhibited the tumor growth in vivo by xenograft nude mouse model. By inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, HM13 knockdown inhibited the NSCLC cell proliferation, metastasis tumor growth, and tumor-associated macrophage M2 polarization. In NSCLC, HM13 could be a therapeutic target to treat the NSCLC."
"Exploring the function and prognostic value of RPLP0, RPLP1 and RPLP2 expression in lung adenocarcinoma","Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is characterized by its heterogeneity and poor prognosis. The role of ribosomal proteins RPLP0, RPLP1 and RPLP2 in multiple cancers has been implicated. However, their function in LUAD and their correlation with the poor prognosis of LUAD remains elusive. In this study, we performed a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of the impact of these ribosomal proteins on LUAD. Our findings reveal that RPLP0, RPLP1 and RPLP2 are overexpressed in LUAD, which are likely attributed to abnormal copy number variations and decreased methylation levels of their promoters. LUAD patients with high expression of RPLP0, RPLP1 or RPLP2 have worse clinical outcomes in terms of overall survival (OS), first progression (FP) and post-progression survival (PPS), indicating poor prognosis. Moreover, the expression of RPLP0, RPLP1 and RPLP2 affects immune cell infiltration in LUAD tissues. Finally, we identified multiple existing drugs that may inhibit the expression of RPLP1 and RPLP2. Collectively, our data implicate the oncogenic role of RPLP0, RPLP1 and RPLP2 in LUAD and underscore their prognostic value in LUAD patients."
"Lepidagathis ananthapuramensis Leaf Extract Stabilized Co3O4 Nanoparticles and its Structural, Optical and Magnetic Properties","The present work focusses on the green synthesis of Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) using Lepidagathis ananthapuramensis leaf extract and to investigate its structural, optical, morphological and magnetic properties. The structural information confirmed the formation of spinel type polycrystalline cubic symmetry with space group Fd-3 m. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic studies revealed the sharp doublet peak in the finger print region pertaining to the Co2+ and Co3+ ions. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy further confirmed the presence of Co3+ and Co2+ ions in which Co3+ ions are present more than Co2+ ions. The UV–Visible spectroscopic studies indicate that there are two characteristic absorptions of Co3O4 NPs indicating the ligand to metal charge transfer. The morphological analysis of Co3O4 NPs using field emission scanning microscope and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, showed irregular shapes of different sizes with Co mostly at surface than the core. The magnetic data revealed the existence of antiferromagnetic nature co-hosting weak ferromagnetism. The detailed explanations of a straightforward and affordable method for creating spinel type Co3O4 and their structural and magnetic properties were explained."
Gastrin-related circRNA_0017065 promotes the proliferation and metastasis of colorectal cancer through the miR-3174/RBFOX2 axis,"Gastrin is a gastrointestinal peptide hormone that plays an important role in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we identified gastrin-related circRNAs via high-throughput sequencing and selected circRNA_0017065 as the research focus. We further studied its specific role and molecular mechanism in the progression of CRC. Knockdown and overexpression of circRNA_0017065 were performed, and the biological function of circRNA_0017065 in CRC progression was studied via in vitro and in vivo functional experiments. The potential downstream target genes were subsequently identified via screening of databases and gene chip data. The expression of circRNA_0017065 in tumour tissues was significantly upregulated compared with that in adjacent normal tissues. In vitro and in vivo functional experiments revealed that the proliferation and migration of CRC cells were significantly suppressed after circRNA_0017065 knockdown, while apoptosis was promoted. After overexpression of circRNA_0017065, the proliferation and migration of CRC cells were significantly promoted, while apoptosis was inhibited. Mechanistic studies revealed that circRNA_0017065 can act as a sponge for miR-3174 and promote CRC progression via the miR-3174/RBFOX2 axis. In general, gastrin-related circRNA_0017065 plays a key role in the occurrence and development of CRC and is expected to be a potential molecular target for the treatment of CRC metastasis."
"Network structure of depressive symptoms, school anxiety and perfectionism in Peruvian adolescents","Few studies have examined common patterns between perfectionist traits, depressive symptomatology and anxiety in adolescents. We analyzed these simultaneous associations and identified the most influential measures through network analysis. A total of 533 high school Peruvian students (48.97% female) participated from two educational institutions. Adapted Oros’ Perfectionism, Reynolds Depression Scale and a single item school anxiety measure for adolescents were used. Spinglass algorithm found a solution of three domains of perfectionism: self-demands, distress-worry and reactions to failure, as well as one cluster of depressive symptoms. When analyzing the interconnections between these dimensions, it was found that worry-distress perfectionism (WDP) and reactions to failure perfectionism (RFP) played a central role in activating other variables in the network. In particular, RFP had the strongest connection with depression, while WDP was related to school anxiety. On the other hand, self-demands perfectionism was the only dimension that showed a negative relationship with depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that perfectionist reactions focused on anticipating and responding to errors may share common patterns that should be addressed to reduce depression and school anxiety in adolescents."
Chien-physics-informed neural networks for solving singularly perturbed boundary-layer problems,"A physics-informed neural network (PINN) is a powerful tool for solving differential equations in solid and fluid mechanics. However, it suffers from singularly perturbed boundary-layer problems in which there exist sharp changes caused by a small perturbation parameter multiplying the highest-order derivatives. In this paper, we introduce Chien’s composite expansion method into PINNs, and propose a novel architecture for the PINNs, namely, the Chien-PINN (C-PINN) method. This novel PINN method is validated by singularly perturbed differential equations, and successfully solves the well-known thin plate bending problems. In particular, no cumbersome matching conditions are needed for the C-PINN method, compared with the previous studies based on matched asymptotic expansions."
"Antibacterial activity of Au(I), Pt(II), and Ir(III) biotin conjugates prepared by the iClick reaction: influence of the metal coordination sphere on the biological activity","A series of biotin-functionalized transition metal complexes was prepared by iClick reaction from the corresponding azido complexes with a novel alkyne-functionalized biotin derivative ([Au(triazolatoR,R′)(PPh3)], [Pt(dpb)(triazolatoR,R′)], [Pt(triazolatoR,R′)(terpy)]PF6, and [Ir(ppy)(triazolatoR,R′)(terpy)]PF6 with dpb = 1,3-di(2-pyridyl)benzene, ppy = 2-phenylpyridine, and terpy = 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine and R = C6H5, R′ = biotin). The complexes were compared to reference compounds lacking the biotin moiety. The binding affinity toward avidin and streptavidin was evaluated with the HABA assay as well as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). All compounds exhibit the same binding stoichiometry of complex-to-avidin of 4:1, but the ITC results show that the octahedral Ir(III) compound exhibits a higher binding affinity than the square-planar Pt(II) complex. The antibacterial activity of the compounds was evaluated on a series of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains. In particular, the neutral Au(I) and Pt(II) complexes showed significant antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium at very low micromolar concentrations. The cytotoxicity against a range of eukaryotic cell lines was studied and revealed that the octahedral Ir(III) complex was non-toxic, while the square-planar Pt(II) and linear Au(I) complexes displayed non-selective micromolar activity."
Anti-OJ antibody-positive anti-synthetase syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 infection: a case report and literature review,"COVID-19 can induce a systemic inflammatory response with variable clinical manifestations. Similar to various viruses, COVID-19 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. This article highlights the potential for infections including the SARS-CoV-2 virus to induce exacerbations of pre-existing autoimmune diseases or even potentially unmask de novo autoimmune diseases in particular anti-synthetase syndrome (ASSD) in predisposed individuals. Although there are other case reports of ASSD following SARS-CoV-2 infection, here we present the first reported case of a gentleman with a newly diagnosed anti-OJ positive anti-synthetase syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 infection."
"Association between the guardians’ educational levels and unintentional injuries in children aged 6–18 in Shenzhen, China","Unintentional injuries is the leading cause of death in children aged 6–18 in China. Previous studies on the association between the guardians’ educational levels and unintentional injuries in children have been inconclusive, and it remains unclear among the Chinese population. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the association between guardians’ educational levels and unintentional injuries in children aged 6–18 in Shenzhen, China."
Delineating emotional differences between depressed and non-depressed individuals using a novel multimodal framework,"Affective computing has garnered substantial attention for its potential in mental health diagnostics, including the nuanced differentiation of emotional states in depressed versus non-depressed individuals. This study significantly advances the field by introducing EmoFusion-AttNet, a state-of-the-art computational model that employs a multimodal approach for emotion classification. Leveraging a statistically robust and demographically diverse sample, participants were first screened for depressive symptoms using BDI & PHQ-Q questionnaires, ensuring a representative distribution. The EmoFusion-AttNet model employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract spatial features from facial data, while Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks capture the temporal intricacies of EEG signals. A fusion layer equipped with an attention mechanism synthesizes these multi-dimensional data streams, enhancing feature selection and accuracy. Impressively, the model achieved a classification accuracy of 95%, setting a new benchmark for emotion-based classification models. To validate these findings, we conducted an in-depth analysis of EEG data, focusing on Alpha and Theta band activities. Our results revealed a decrease in Alpha power and an increase in Theta power in the depressed group, aligning with current neurophysiological understandings. These findings validate the model’s clinical applicability and set the stage for future research in affective computing, particularly its implications for mental health diagnostics and treatment planning."
The study findings demonstrated a significant association between C-reactive protein levels and trabecular bone score : NHANES 2005–2008,"The association between C-reactive protein and bone density has been primarily investigated in previous studies, with little to no research investigating its relationship with total bone trabecular score."
Recommendations for strain elastography of the uterine cervix,"Conventional vaginal strain ultrasound elastography, not based on shear-wave elastography imaging, can assess the biomechanical properties of the uterine cervix. This assessment may inform the risks of preterm birth and failed induction of labor. However, there is considerable variation in the approaches to strain elastography, including the placement of the region of interest (ROI). Therefore, our aim was to provide recommendations for cervical elastography."
Efficient multi-target classification for bug priority and resolution time prediction,"Bug triage teams allocate substantial resources to determine the priority and resolution time of reported defects, frequently hampered by a lack of specialized knowledge in the relevant subject. This work presents sophisticated multi-target classification models for the simultaneous prediction of problem priority and resolution time. We investigate transformation strategies, such as Classifier Chains, Binary Relevance, Label Power Sets, and Random k-Label Sets (RAKEL), over various machine learning and deep learning models utilising the Functional API. The models are trained using a newly launched dataset, the Spring JIRA Bug Dataset, available at IEEE DataPort ieee-dataport.org/documents/spring-jira-bug-dataset, which includes bug summaries from the Jira bug tracking software. Model performance evaluation involves using metrics such as Hamming Loss, Accuracy, Weighted Precision, Weighted Recall, Weighted F1-Score, and MCC. The experimental findings indicate substantial enhancements in prediction accuracy and computing efficiency, showcasing the potential of these models to significantly improve the bug triage process by automating estimations of priority and resolution time."
Synergistic effects of combined BET and FAK inhibition against Vestibular Schwannomas in NF2-related Schwannomatosis,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare disorder that causes vestibular schwannomas (VS), meningiomas and ependymomas. To date, there is no FDA approved drug-based treatment for NF2. We have previously identified that BET inhibition can selectively reduce growth of the NF2-null schwannoma and Schwann cells in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo and, separately, reported that inhibition of Focal Adhesion Kinase 1 (FAK1) via crizotinib has antiproliferative effects in NF2-null Schwann cells. The current study was aimed at determining whether combined BET and FAK inhibition can synergize and to identify the mechanisms of action. A panel of normal and NF2-null Schwann and schwannoma cell lines were used to characterize the effects of combined BET and FAK inhibition in vitro and in vivo using pharmacological and genetic approaches. The mechanism of action was explored by chromatin immunoprecipitation, ChIP-PCR, western blotting, and functional approaches. We find that combined BET and FAK inhibition are synergistic and inhibit the proliferation of NF2-null schwannoma and Schwann cell lines in vitro and in vivo, by arresting cells in the G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Further, we identify the mechanism of action through the downregulation of FAK1 transcription by BET inhibition, which potentiates inhibition of FAK by 100-fold. Our findings suggest that combined targeting of BET and FAK1 may offer a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of NF2-related schwannomas."
Advancing sustainability in concrete construction: enhancing thermal resilience and structural strength with ground granulated blast furnace slag,"This study investigates the effects of Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) on the thermal stability and compressive strength of concrete, aiming to identify novel insights and contribute to sustainable construction practices. The experimental approach integrates innovative methodologies to analyse concrete properties and assess the suitability of GGBS as a supplementary cementitious material. Through meticulous sample preparation and testing, a nuanced relationship between GGBS content and concrete performance is observed. Key findings reveal that moderate levels of GGBS replacement enhance compressive strength, supporting previous research. However, beyond a certain threshold, diminishing returns are observed, highlighting the importance of optimizing GGBS content in concrete mix designs. Microstructural analysis unveils reductions in porosity and alterations in hydration products with increasing GGBS content, indicative of improved mechanical properties and thermal stability. The results underscore the potential of GGBS as a sustainable alternative in concrete production, offering both environmental benefits and performance enhancements. By leveraging GGBS, engineers can achieve a balance between structural integrity, thermal resilience, and environmental sustainability in concrete structures."
Construction of artificial microbial consortia for efficient degradation of chicken feathers and optimization of degradation conditions,"Microbes within a consortium exhibit a synergistic interaction, enhancing their collective capacity to perform functions more effectively than a single species, especially in the degradation of keratin-rich substrates. To achieve a more stable and efficient breakdown of chicken feathers, a comprehensive screening of over 9,000 microbial strains was undertaken. This meticulous selection process identified strains with the capability to degrade keratin effectively. Subsequently, antagonistic tests were conducted to isolate strains of fungi and bacteria that were non-antagonistic, which were then used to form the artificial microbial consortia. The optimal fermentation conditions for the keratinophilic microbial consortia were determined through the optimization of response surface methodology. The results revealed that 11 microbial strains–comprising of 4 fungi and 7 bacteria–were particularly proficient in degrading chicken feathers. The artificially constructed microbial consortia (AMC) comprised two bacterial strains and one fungal strain. The optimal conditions for feathers degradation were identified as a 10 g/L concentration of chicken feathers, a 2.6% microbial inoculation volume and a fermentation fluid pH of 9. Under these conditions, the degradation rate for chicken feathers reached a significant 74.02%, representing an 11.45% increase over the pre-optimization rate.

"OsSNDP4, a Sec14-nodulin Domain Protein, is Required for Pollen Development in Rice","Pollen is encased in a robust wall that shields the male gametophyte from various stresses and aids in pollination. The pollen wall consists of gametophyte-derived intine and sporophyte-derived exine. The exine is mainly composed of sporopollenin, which is biopolymers of aliphatic lipids and phenolics. The process of exine formation has been the subject of extensive research, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we identified a rice mutant of the OsSNDP4 gene that is impaired in pollen development. We demonstrated that OsSNDP4, a putative Sec14-nodulin domain protein, exhibits a preference for binding to phosphatidylinositol (3)-phosphate [PI(3)P], a lipid primarily found in endosomal and vacuolar membranes. The OsSNDP4 protein was detected in association with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), vacuolar membranes, and the nucleus. OsSNDP4 expression was detected in all tested organs but was notably higher in anthers during exine development. Loss of OsSNDP4 function led to abnormal vacuole dynamics, inhibition in Ubisch body development, and premature degradation of cellular contents and organelles in the tapetal cells. Microspores from the ossndp4 mutant plant displayed abnormal exine formation, abnormal vacuole enlargement, and ultimately, pollen abortion. RNA-seq assay revealed that genes involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acid and secondary metabolites, the biosynthesis of lipid polymers, and exosome formation were enriched among the down-regulated genes in the mutant anthers, which correlated with the morphological defects observed in the mutant anthers. Base on these findings, we propose that OsSNDP4 regulates pollen development by binding to PI(3)P and influencing the dynamics of membrane systems. The involvement of membrane systems in the regulation of sporopollenin biosynthesis, Ubisch body formation, and exine formation provides a novel mechanism regulating pollen wall development."
GAPDH-Silence Microsphere via Reprogramming Macrophage Metabolism and eradicating Bacteria for Diabetic infection bone regeneration,"Macrophage metabolism dysregulation, which is exacerbated by persistent stimulation in infectious and inflammatory diseases, such as diabetic infectious bone defects (DIBD), eventually leads to the failure of bone repair. Here, we have developed an injectable, macrophage-modulated GAPDH-Silence drug delivery system. This microsphere comprises chondroitin sulfate methacrylate (CM) and methacrylated gelatin (GM), while the dimethyl fumarate (DMF)-loaded liposome (D-lip) is encapsulated within the microsphere (CM@GM), named D-lip/CM@GM. Triggered by the over-expressed collagenase in DIBD, the microspheres degrade and release the encapsulated D-lip. D-lip could modulate metabolism by inhibiting GAPDH, which suppresses the over-activation of glycolysis, thus preventing the inflammatory response of macrophages in vitro. While beneficial for macrophages, D-lip/CM@GM is harmful to bacteria. GAPDH, while crucial for glycolysis of staphylococcal species (S. aureus), can be effectively countered by D-lip/CM@GM. We are utilizing existing drugs in innovative ways to target central metabolism for effective eradication of bacteria. In the DIBD model, our results confirmed that the D-lip/CM@GM enhanced bacteria clearance and reprogrammed dysregulated metabolism, thereby significantly improving bone regeneration. In conclusion, this GAPDH-Silence microsphere system may provide a viable strategy to promote diabetic infection bone regeneration."
Understanding self-esteem in the consumer journey: A model of purchase self-esteem antecedents,"While the significance of self-esteem in various consumer behaviors has been well recognized, there is still a noticeable research gap in understanding its specific determinants, especially in the context of the purchase process. The purpose of our study is to fill this gap by elucidating the factors shaping consumers’ self-esteem throughout the purchase journey utilizing our model of purchase self-esteem antecedents. Based on social exchange theory and affect theory of social exchange our model proposes that consumer brand engagement (CBE) and feelings of authentic pride play an important role in predicting self-esteem. We tested this model with longitudinal data collected at two measurement times: 1 week before a purchase (n = 111) and around 1 week after a purchase (n = 99). The longitudinal structural equation modeling results revealed that CBE elicited feelings of authentic pride, and feelings of authentic pride led to higher self-esteem. Both relationships were statistically significant within and between measurement times. The results confirmed that authentic pride mediated the relationship between CBE and self-esteem. These findings provide strong support for our model of purchase self-esteem antecedents."
Natural vibration and critical velocity of translating Timoshenko beam with non-homogeneous boundaries,"In most practical engineering applications, the translating belt wraps around two fixed wheels. The boundary conditions of the dynamic model are typically specified as simply supported or fixed boundaries. In this paper, non-homogeneous boundaries are introduced by the support wheels. Utilizing the translating belt as the mechanical prototype, the vibration characteristics of translating Timoshenko beam models with non-homogeneous boundaries are investigated for the first time. The governing equations of Timoshenko beam are deduced by employing the generalized Hamilton’s principle. The effects of parameters such as the radius of wheel and the length of belt on vibration characteristics including the equilibrium deformations, critical velocities, natural frequencies, and modes, are numerically calculated and analyzed. The numerical results indicate that the beam experiences deformation characterized by varying curvatures near the wheels. The radii of the wheels play a pivotal role in determining the change in trend of the relative difference between two beam models. Comparing the results unearths that the relative difference in equilibrium deformations between the two beam models is more pronounced with smaller-sized wheels. When the two wheels are of equal size, the critical velocities of both beam models reach their respective minima. In addition, the relative difference in natural frequencies between the two beam models exhibits nonlinear variation and can easily exceed 50%. Furthermore, as the axial velocities increase, the impact of non-homogeneous boundaries on modal shape of translating beam becomes more significant. Although dealing with non-homogeneous boundaries is challenging, beam models with non-homogeneous boundaries are more sensitive to parameters, and the differences between the two types of beams undergo some interesting variations under the influence of non-homogeneous boundaries."
"First-principles study of the structure, electronic and optical properties of monolayer ZrX3 (X = S, Se, Te)","The structure, electronic and optical properties of single-layer transition metallic chalcogenides ZrX3 (X = S, Se, Te) have been studied by density functional theory. The electron energy dispersion curve shows that ZrX3 has semiconductor properties, in which the conduction band is mainly contributed by the correlated states of the Zr-d orbital, and the valence band is mainly contributed by the correlated states of the X-p orbital. It is found that b-axis and biaxial strain have great influence on the bandgap and the shift of density of states is also large. At the same time, the peak value of density of states increases greatly when biaxial strain is applied. It is of guiding significance for selecting suitable substrates to prepare two-dimensional ZrX3 materials to study their electronic properties. The calculation of optical constants confirms that ZrX3 has strong optical anisotropy. In the visible range, the light absorption efficiency of ZrX3 in the direction of electric field polarization [100] is higher than that in the direction of [010]. The reflectance spectral results show that ZrS3 and ZrSe3 in the [100] directions have the highest reflectance, and ZrTe3 in the [010] direction has the highest reflectance, even in the long electromagnetic radiation range (up to 10 eV), which is of great significance for the construction of visible optical devices."
Sediment size effects on non-Darcy flow: insights from Izbash equation and Forchheimer inertial coefficient analysis,"The transition from Darcy to non-Darcy flow regimes was investigated using column experiments. This revealed key relationships between sediment characteristics and critical thresholds for the onset of the non-Darcy flow regime, as well as inertial flow parameters. An exponential dependence of the critical Reynolds number (Rec) on hydraulic conductivity (K) and a linear dependence on sediment size (d50) was found. The analysis revealed a potentially universal relationship between the critical hydraulic gradient (Ic) and K, with a power-law exponent of –3/2, consistent with previous investigations. Additionally, Ic was found to be inversely proportional to the power law of the square root of d50. Novel relationships are derived for estimating the Izbash equation inertial exponent (n) and the Forchheimer inertial coefficient (\(\beta\)) based on sediment characteristics. The exponent (n) was found to decrease with d50 and increase with K, following power-law relationships. A new equation is proposed, capable of predicting \(\beta\) with slightly improved accuracy, outperforming numerous and previously proposed empirical equations. Additionally, these data validate the works of Ergun and Irmay as an alternative for \(\beta\) estimation using porosity and sediment size. As the attainment of statistical significance in multiparameter curve fitting can be trivial, it has led to the proliferation of empirical equations for estimating β. This study highlights the limitations of existing empirical methods in determining β and emphasizes the necessity for a universal approach to predict this critical parameter, which will facilitate broader adoption of the Forchheimer equation."
Prokaryotic-virus-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes throughout the global oceans,"Prokaryotic microbes have impacted marine biogeochemical cycles for billions of years. Viruses also impact these cycles, through lysis, horizontal gene transfer, and encoding and expressing genes that contribute to metabolic reprogramming of prokaryotic cells. While this impact is difficult to quantify in nature, we hypothesized that it can be examined by surveying virus-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) and assessing their ecological context."
Analytical modeling and approaches of multihelix cables incorporating with interwire mutual contacts,"This study aims to develop an analytical model based on the curve beam theory to capture the mechanical response of a multihelix cable considering the internal contact displacements. Accordingly, a double-helix cable subjected to axial tension and torsion is analyzed, and both the line and point contacts between the neighboring wires and strands are considered via an equivalent homogenized approach. Then, the proposed theoretical model is extended to a hierarchical multihelix cable with mutual contact displacements by constructing a recursive relationship between the high- and low-level multihelix structures. The global tensile stiffness and torsional stiffness of the double-helix cable are successfully evaluated. The results are validated by a finite element (FE) model, and are found to be consistent with the findings of previous studies. It is shown that the contact deformations in multihelix cables significantly affect their equivalent mechanical stiffness, and the contact displacements are remarkably enhanced as the helix angles increase. This study provides insights into the interwire/interstrand mutual contact effects on global and local responses."
The use of match-based exact movement activities to classify elite rugby league players into positional groups,"The cluster analysis of elite rugby league players identified groups of distinct playing positions that can be referred to as broad positional groups. However, the identified positional groups were based on traditional indicators (physical and technical–tactical) that provided no information about the exact match-based movement activities that led to such similarity grouping and the classification of elite rugby league players into these broad positional groups remains unexplored. Hence, this study finds the best model to classify elite rugby league players into positional groups, using data characterised by movement patterns to uncover the similar movement activities of distinct playing positions within a positional group. Key movement patterns for the positional group classification and differences between the groups were also investigated. A total of 18,173 unique movement patterns were derived from 422 players’ GPS data across the 2019 and 2020 seasons, where only 36 were identified as key patterns. The highest classification accuracy of 77.58% using all unique patterns and 74.5% accuracy using the key patterns was achieved, outperforming studies that used traditional indicators. Further analyses based on key patterns revealed differences between forwards and backs. These findings establish movement patterns as viable indicators to classify rugby league players into positional groups, enabling coaches and trainers to develop position-specific training programmes that cater to the unique physical demands of each position, leading to better player development and team performance. Movement patterns are therefore recommended as an alternative approach to quantifying players’ external loads and obtaining granular information."
Optimizing resistance training intensity in supportive care for survivors of breast cancer: velocity-based approach in the row exercise,"Resistance training mitigates side effects during and after cancer treatment. To provide a new approach for precisely and safely assessing and prescribing the intensity of resistance training in supportive cancer care, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the load-velocity relationship during the row exercise in women survivors of breast cancer."
Thermal effects and ephaptic entrainment in Hodgkin–Huxley model,"The brain is understood as an intricate biological system composed of numerous elements. It is susceptible to various physical and chemical influences, including temperature. The literature extensively explores the conditions that influence synapses in the context of cellular communication. However, the understanding of how the brain’s global physical conditions can modulate ephaptic communication remains limited due to the poorly understood nature of ephapticity. This study proposes an adaptation of the Hodgkin and Huxley (HH) model to investigate the effects of ephaptic entrainment in response to thermal changes (HH-E). The analysis focuses on two distinct neuronal regimes: subthreshold and suprathreshold. In the subthreshold regime, circular statistics are used to demonstrate the dependence of phase differences with temperature. In the suprathreshold regime, the Inter-Spike Interval are employed to estimate phase preferences and changes in the spiking pattern. Temperature influences the model’s ephaptic interactions and can modify its preferences for spiking frequency, with the direction of this change depending on specific model conditions and the temperature range under consideration. Furthermore, temperature enhance the anti-phase differences relationship between spikes and the external ephaptic signal. In the suprathreshold regime, ephaptic entrainment is also influenced by temperature, especially at low frequencies. This study reveals the susceptibility of ephaptic entrainment to temperature variations in both subthreshold and suprathreshold regimes and discusses the importance of ephaptic communication in the contexts where temperature may plays a significant role in neural physiology, such as inflammatory processes, fever, and epileptic seizures."
Effect of Hemp and Sheep Wool Reinforcements on Mechanical and Acoustic Properties in Natural Fibre Polymer Composite using Vacuum Bag Moulding Process,"Natural Fibre composites are gaining popularity due to their lightweight and high strength properties and these composites are widely used in various applications like, engineering, construction, aircraft, automotive, biomedical and marine sectors. The aim is to investigate the impact of natural fibre reinforcing on mechanical and acoustic characteristics in natural fibre composites. In the current study, a 60:40 (resin: fibre) weight ratio of hemp and sheep wool fibre reinforcements with resin matrix is employed to generate natural fibre composites. Vacuum bag moulding is used to create sandwich-structured composites made of various fibres (hemp and sheep wool). The mechanical and acoustic characteristics of the generated samples are evaluated. The results demonstrate that hemp fibre reinforced polymer composites have the maximum tensile strength of 35.940 MPa when compared to sheep wool fibre reinforced polymer composites. When compared to the hemp-wool-hemp fibre sandwich-structured composite, the acoustic characteristics have a peak value of 0.817 sound absorption coefficient at 500 Hz. The study concludes that these fibres are a feasible alternative to synthetic fibres for sound absorption."
Association between intraoperative tidal volume and postoperative acute kidney injury in non-cardiac surgical patients using a propensity score-weighted analysis,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is related to adverse clinical outcomes. Therefore, identifying patients at increased risk of postoperative AKI and proactively providing appropriate care is crucial. However, only a limited number of modifiable risk factors have been recognized to mitigate AKI risk. We retrospectively analyzed adult patients who underwent endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation of more than 2 h during non-cardiac surgery at Seoul National University Hospital from January 2011 to November 2022. Patients were grouped into low- or high-tidal volume groups based on their intraoperative tidal volume relative to their predicted body weight (PBW) of 8 ml/kg. The association between intraoperative tidal volume and postoperative AKI was evaluated using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), adjusting for various preoperative confounders. Among the 37,726 patients included, the incidence of postoperative AKI was 4.1%. The odds of postoperative AKI risk were significantly higher in the high-tidal volume group than in the low-tidal volume group before and after IPTW (odds ratio [OR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–1.32, P = 0.001 and OR: 1.10, 95% CI 1.02–1.19, P = 0.010, respectively). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis after IPTW, a high tidal volume was independently associated with an increased risk of postoperative AKI (OR: 1.21, 95% CI 1.12–1.30, P < 0.001). In this propensity score-weighted analysis, an intraoperative high tidal volume of more than 8 ml/kg PBW was significantly associated with an increased risk of postoperative AKI after IPTW in non-cardiac surgical patients. Intraoperative tidal volume showed potential as a modifiable risk factor for preventing postoperative AKI."
Generalizability and treatment with sodium-glucose co-trasporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) among patients with type 2 diabetes: an assessment using an Italian primary care database,"This study aimed to assess the proportions of type 2 diabetes (T2D) subjects meeting cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) criteria for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and estimate SGLT2i utilization, along with associated demographic and clinical characteristics, in a primary care setting."
"What Silent Pauses Can ‘Tell’ Us About the Storytelling Skills of Autistic Children: Relations Between Pausing, Language Skills and Executive Functions","Silent pauses may serve communicative purposes such as demarcating boundaries between discourse units in language production. Previous research has shown that autistic children differ in their pausing behavior from typically-developing (TD) peers, however, the factors behind this difference remain underexplored. The current study was aimed at comparing the use of silent pauses in the narrative production of autistic children and age-matched TD children, and also to identify possible relations between pausing behavior and the children’s language and executive function abilities. According to the study’s findings, the autistic children did not differ from their TD peers in the use of grammatical pauses, however, the former tended to produce significantly less syntactically complex narratives than the TD group, which increased the likelihood that the autistic group would pause appropriately at phrasal boundaries. Though we have found low rates of ungrammatical silent pauses and omitted pauses in obligatory discourse contexts across both groups, autistic children with lower cognitive flexibility tended to use more ungrammatical pauses than their peers with higher cognitive flexibility scores. Also, the autistic group tended to omit obligatory silent pauses more often as their narration became more complex. The results demonstrate that syntactic complexity in narrative production modulated autistic children’s pausing behavior, and that structurally simple narrations boosted the autistic group’s appropriate use of grammatical pauses. The overall findings also demonstrate the importance of studying silent pauses in the narrative discourse of autistic children, and also highlight the links between silent pauses and the children’s syntactic and cognitive skills."
Adversarial robustness of deep reinforcement learning-based intrusion detection,"Machine learning techniques, including Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), enhance intrusion detection systems by adapting to new threats. However, DRL’s reliance on vulnerable deep neural networks leads to susceptibility to adversarial examples-perturbations designed to evade detection. While adversarial examples are well-studied in deep learning, their impact on DRL-based intrusion detection remains underexplored, particularly in critical domains. This article conducts a thorough analysis of DRL-based intrusion detection’s vulnerability to adversarial examples. It systematically evaluates key hyperparameters such as DRL algorithms, neural network depth, and width, impacting agents’ robustness. The study extends to black-box attacks, demonstrating adversarial transferability across DRL algorithms. Findings emphasize neural network architecture’s critical role in DRL agent robustness, addressing underfitting and overfitting challenges. Practical implications include insights for optimizing DRL-based intrusion detection agents to enhance performance and resilience. Experiments encompass multiple DRL algorithms tested on three datasets: NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIoV2024, against gradient-based adversarial attacks, with publicly available implementation code."
"Effect of alternative fuels on the emissions of a passenger car under real-world driving conditions: a comparison of biodiesel, gas-to-liquid, coal to liquid","Fossil fuel energy crisis and environmental pollution have initiated the scientific research on alternative fuels. Biodiesel (B100), gas to liquid (G100), and coal to liquid (C100) are superb selections to be substitutes for conventional diesel. To better investigate the emission characteristics of the alternative fuels mentioned above, a portable emission measurement system (PEMS) was used to carry out this study under real-world driving conditions. Results showed that the driving conditions had a notable effect on the vehicle emissions, the CO, THC, and CO2 emissions were higher under urban condition, and the NOx, PM (particle mass), and PN (particle number) emissions were higher under suburban condition. The expressway condition resulted in lower emissions except for PN due to more nucleation particles emitted. The use of B100, G100, and C100 fuels led to a reduction of more than 50% in the CO emission, especially for the C100, but the reduction effects for the THC were not obvious, and among them, G100 is the most prominent. Higher NOx emission was emitted after using the three fuels, especially for the B100; meanwhile, B100 increased the CO2, but G100 and C100 decreased the CO2 emission compared with D100. The PN emissions reduced by 1–2 orders of magnitude in comparison with those from D100 after using the three alternative fuels, and more than 50% of the PM could be reduced. B100 has the most significant particle reduction effect due to its oxygen-containing property, and it produced an evidently higher proportion of nucleation particles than D100, followed by G100 and C100."
"Preparation and evaluation of the LaCu1-xNixO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) perovskite catalysts for total oxidation of methane","A series of Ni-substituted LaCu1-xNixO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) catalysts were prepared by a mechanochemical synthesis method and the prepared samples were used in catalytic combustion of methane. The catalytic results indicated that the partial substitution of Ni affected the catalytic performance and the increase in nickel content increased the catalytic activity and among the prepared catalysts the LaCu0.5Ni0.5O3 sample possessed the highest catalytic activity and thermal stability. The results showed that methane conversion reached from 7.8 to 73.8% at 500 °C with the substitution of Ni in the amount of x = 0.5. Also, the addition of Ni instead of Cu in the LaCu1-xNixO3 led to an increase in total pore volume and specific surface area and a decrease in average crystalline size. According to O2-TPD profiles of the LaCu1-xNixO3 catalysts, mobility of lattice oxygen (O2−) has a crucial role in determining the performance of these catalysts. The H2-TPR results indicated that the addition of Ni slightly improved the reducibility of catalysts. Furthermore, a decrease in calcination temperature of LaCu0.5Ni0.5O3 catalyst resulted in an increase in the catalytic activity due to the enhancement in the concentration of oxygen vacancy and specific surface area. Also, the results revealed that the increase in feed ratio (CH4/O2) leads to an increment in methane conversion."
The assessment of bone health in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis; comparison of different imaging-based methods,"Osteoporosis is increasingly being recognized in children, mostly secondary to systemic underlying conditions or medication. However, no imaging modality currently provides a full evaluation of bone health in children. We compared DXA, a radiographic bone health index (BHI (BoneXpert) and cone-beam CT for the assessment of low bone mass in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)."
Research on DC Component Suppression Method of Non-isolated Grid-Connected Inverter,"The zero drift occurring to the sampling conditioning circuit of the non-isolated grid-connected inverter will make the output develop a DC component, thus resulting in system failure and posing safety risks. According to the IEEE standard 1547-2003, the DC component injected into the grid side should be less than 0.5% of the rated current. In this paper, a moving average filter is proposed to extract the DC component of the three-phase AC output current. The filter has a very strong attenuation ability to the fundamental integer multiple harmonics, and can accurately extract the DC component. Then the proportional integral resonant controller (PIR) is used to control the system. The control system has sufficient bandwidth to avoid the stability problem caused by frequency offset. Through the above methods, the purpose of accurately suppressing the DC component in the non-isolated grid-connected inverter is realized. Also, a 50 kVA prototype is built in this study. The experimental results show that the moving average filter is advantageous over the conventional low-pass filter method in extracting the DC component, and the PIR controller used in the closed-loop control system outperforms the proportional integral and proportional resonant controllers. Under the strategy proposed in this study, the DC component is reduced to less than 0.5% of the rated current, and the THD of the grid-connected current falls below 5%."
Common molecular and pathophysiological underpinnings of delirium and Alzheimer’s disease: molecular signatures and therapeutic indications,"Delirium and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are common causes of cognitive dysfunction among older adults. These neurodegenerative diseases share a common and complex relationship, and can occur individually or concurrently, increasing the chance of permanent mental dysfunction. However, the common molecular pathophysiology, key proteomic biomarkers, and functional pathways are largely unknown, whereby delirium is superimposed on AD and dementia."
An experimental approach on dynamic occlusal fingerprint analysis to simulate use-wear localisation and development on stone tools,"Information about the use of stone tools in the past is encoded in the wear patterns left on their surface; however, post-depositional processes can modify and obstruct these traces. One aim in the field of lithic functional analysis is to develop methods to detect and quantify these traces on stone tools. The occlusal fingerprint analysis (OFA) is a well-established method in dental wear studies to virtually simulate dental occlusal (contact between teeth) stroke movements and thus locate and quantify the sequential contact between opposing tooth crowns. Reaching across disciplines, we conducted controlled experiments to test the applicability of the OFA method on stone tools to address the challenge of use-wear quantification and localisation, and therefore the identification of post-depositional wear. Our findings reveal a clear overlap between zones of experimentally produced use-wear and OFA-calculated contact areas. We demonstrate OFA as a potential method to generate models of multiscale use-wear that can be used as references on experimental tools to identify post-depositional surface modifications on stone tool artefacts."
Single-cell multi-omics in the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus: a new era of next generation therapeutics,"Developments in single-cell omics have enormous potential to revolutionize plant metabolic engineering and gene discovery. Additionally, this might pave a new path for next-generation therapeutics and stress alleviation in plants. The medicinal plant species Catharanthus roseus produces the natural product monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIAs), through a multistep biochemical activity. The high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing followed by semi-quantitative single-cell metabolomics showed MIA biosynthesis with distinct metabolite profiles across the organs. Therefore, understanding the function of gene/s and their product is necessary to find all the candidates in a complex metabolic circuit. In this commentary, we focused on the advances in single-cell multi-omic technologies in C. roseus about the methods illustrating cell states and the metabolites."
ATAXIN-2 intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions elicit ALS-associated metabolic and immune phenotypes,"Intermediate-length repeat expansions in ATAXIN-2 (ATXN2) are the strongest genetic risk factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). At the molecular level, ATXN2 intermediate expansions enhance TDP-43 toxicity and pathology. However, whether this triggers ALS pathogenesis at the cellular and functional level remains unknown. Here, we combine patient-derived and mouse models to dissect the effects of ATXN2 intermediate expansions in an ALS background. iPSC-derived motor neurons from ATXN2-ALS patients show altered stress granules, neurite damage and abnormal electrophysiological properties compared to healthy control and other familial ALS mutations. In TDP-43Tg-ALS mice, ATXN2-Q33 causes reduced motor function, NMJ alterations, neuron degeneration and altered in vitro stress granule dynamics. Furthermore, gene expression changes related to mitochondrial function and inflammatory response are detected and confirmed at the cellular level in mice and human neuron and organoid models. Together, these results define pathogenic defects underlying ATXN2-ALS and provide a framework for future research into ATXN2-dependent pathogenesis and therapy."
Comparative case study on NAMs: towards enhancing specific target organ toxicity analysis,"Traditional risk assessment methodologies in toxicology have relied upon animal testing, despite concerns regarding interspecies consistency, reproducibility, costs, and ethics. New Approach Methodologies (NAMs), including cell culture and multi-level omics analyses, hold promise by providing mechanistic information rather than assessing organ pathology. However, NAMs face limitations, like lacking a whole organism and restricted toxicokinetic interactions. This is an inherent challenge when it comes to the use of omics data from in vitro studies for the prediction of organ toxicity in vivo. One solution in this context are comparative in vitro–in vivo studies as they allow for a more detailed assessment of the transferability of the respective NAM data. Hence, hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic pesticide active substances were tested in human cell lines and the results subsequently related to the biology underlying established effects in vivo. To this end, substances were tested in HepaRG and RPTEC/tERT1 cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations and analyzed for effects on the transcriptome and parts of the proteome using quantitative real-time PCR arrays and multiplexed microsphere-based sandwich immunoassays, respectively. Transcriptomics data were analyzed using three bioinformatics tools. Where possible, in vitro endpoints were connected to in vivo observations. Targeted protein analysis revealed various affected pathways, with generally fewer effects present in RPTEC/tERT1. The strongest transcriptional impact was observed for Chlorotoluron in HepaRG cells (increased CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 expression). A comprehensive comparison of early cellular responses with data from in vivo studies revealed that transcriptomics outperformed targeted protein analysis, correctly predicting up to 50% of in vivo effects."
Multi-level Reflecting Brownian Motion on the Half Line and Its Stationary Distribution,"A semi-martingale reflecting Brownian motion is a popular process for diffusion approximations of queueing models including their networks. In this paper, we are concerned with the case that it lives on the nonnegative half-line, but the drift and variance of its Brownian component discontinuously change at its finitely many states. This reflecting diffusion process naturally arises from a state-dependent single server queue, studied by the Miyazawa (Diffusion approximation of the stationary distribution of a two-level single server queue, 2024. https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11284). Our main interest is in its stationary distribution, which is important for application. We define this reflecting diffusion process as the solution of a stochastic integral equation, and show that it uniquely exists in the weak sense. This result is also proved in a different way by Atar et al. (Parallel server systems under an extended heavy traffic condition: A lower bound, 2022. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07855). In this paper, we consider its Harris irreducibility and stability, that is, positive recurrence, and derive its stationary distribution under this stability condition. The stationary distribution has a simple analytic expression, likely extendable to a more general state-dependent SRBM. Our proofs rely on the generalized Ito formula for a convex function and local time."
Temporalities of oxytocin for labour augmentation: a mixed-methods study of time factors shaping labour practices in a busy maternity unit in Tanzania,"High rates of labour augmentation with oxytocin have been found in some low- and lower-middle-income countries, causing potential perinatal harm. It is critical to understand the reasons for this overuse. Aim was to explore factors that shape practices around using oxytocin for labour augmentation in a high-volume labour ward in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania."
Elevational variations in climate warming impacts on West Himalayan fir growth,"The Himalayas are undergoing significant changes in temperature and moisture availability due to global climate change. Understanding how these changes affect tree growth is critical for conserving and managing this biodiverse region. To investigate the growth-limiting climatic factors, we collected tree-ring data from Abies pindrow old-growth mountain forests across 3190 to 3700 m a.s.l. in the inner valleys of the Garhwal Himalayas. This area faces significant temperature increases, reduced summer monsoon activity, and decreased winter precipitation. We found that over the past century, tree growth suffered from warm and dry springs and benefited from cool and moist springs, particularly at lower elevations (< 3400 m a.s.l.). Conversely, summer climate dynamics had minimal impact on radial growth. The sensitivity of Abies growth to spring climate can be attributed to the inner valleys’ continental climate, marked by spring water deficit. Additionally, higher elevation trees (> 3400 m a.s.l.) showed positive correlations with dormant period temperatures in prior October and January, with the positive effect of October warmth strengthening over time. A dynamic analysis of the impact of spring (March–May) temperature, precipitation and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index revealed a recent unification (the 1980–2010s) of the climate–growth relationship across elevations. Specifically, the low-elevation trees have become less sensitive to warm springs, while the high-elevation trees have only recently become sensitive to warm and dry springs. The varying growth responses along the elevation gradient highlight the necessity of site-dependent differentiation when assessing the impacts of global climate change on species performance and geographic range shifts."
Hemodynamic tolerability and efficacy of hemodialysis modalities in critically ill patients,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequently seen in critically ill patients and is associated with high mortality and morbidity. However, the optimal dialysis modality in such patients remains controversial. We examined the hemodynamic tolerability of hemodialysis modalities in critically ill individuals with AKI."
An atlas of the human liver diurnal transcriptome and its perturbation by hepatitis C virus infection,"Chronic liver disease and cancer are global health challenges. The role of the circadian clock as a regulator of liver physiology and disease is well established in rodents, however, the identity and epigenetic regulation of rhythmically expressed genes in human disease is less well studied. Here we unravel the rhythmic transcriptome and epigenome of human hepatocytes using male human liver chimeric mice. We identify a large number of rhythmically expressed protein coding genes in human hepatocytes of male chimeric mice, which includes key transcription factors, chromatin modifiers, and critical enzymes. We show that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a major cause of liver disease and cancer, perturbs the transcriptome by altering the rhythmicity of the expression of more than 1000 genes, and affects the epigenome, leading to an activation of critical pathways mediating metabolic alterations, fibrosis, and cancer. HCV-perturbed rhythmic pathways remain dysregulated in patients with advanced liver disease. Collectively, these data support a role for virus-induced perturbation of the hepatic rhythmic transcriptome and pathways in cancer development and may provide opportunities for cancer prevention and biomarkers to predict HCC risk."
"Association between Childhood Trauma, Mental Health Symptoms and Adherence Among Youth Living with HIV in Botswana","People living with HIV experience traumatic incidents at higher rates than the general population; and research has documented significant association between trauma exposure and the development of mental disorders. Mental health problems have a a negative impact on anti-retroviral treatment adherence. All of these psychosocial concerns play a role in potentially increasing HIV transmission to sexual partners resulting in increased incidence rates. To inform interventions that improve quality of life, and decrease risky behaviors for adolescents and youth, it is critical to understand the extent to which childhood trauma, mental health problems, and poor adherence occur and coexist in this population of adolescents living with HIV. Thus, this study examined the associations between childhood trauma, mental health problems (depression, anxiety, and substance use) and adherence to ART among HIV infected youth in Botswana."
The influence of peritumoral parenchyma on local tumor progression of hepatocellular carcinoma after thermal ablation: a retrospective multicenter study,"With the increasing importance of thermal ablation (TA) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment, local tumor progression (LTP) has become a nonignorable recurrence type after ablation."
Laboratory Profile of Lupus Anticoagulant Positive Cases and its Association with Clinical Presentation- Experience from a Tertiary Care Centre in Southern India,"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease with specific clinical features and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) like anti-beta2 glycoprotein 1 (anti-β2gp1), anti-cardiolipin antibody (aCL), and/or lupus anticoagulant (LA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the laboratory profile of LA-positive cases and study its association with various clinical presentations. In this ambispective analytical study over 20 months, LA-positive cases (n = 167) from among 970 cases screened were included. Tests for LA were integrated dilute Russell’s Viper venom time (dRVVT) and silica clotting time (SCT) using screen-confirm procedure with mixing whenever necessary. The clinical profile and other investigations like aCL and anti-β2gp1were noted from records. The sensitivity of dRVVT and SCT for LA positivity were 78.4% and 79.4%, respectively. Based on the clinical presentation the cases were grouped as abortion, thrombosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and others. The thrombotic group showed significantly higher (94%) dRVVT positivity, with an odds ratio of 5.56 (95% CI: 1.61 to 19.15). SCT, aCL, or anti-β2gp1 positivity did not show any significant risk association with thrombosis or abortion. SLE- group showed more frequent dual-LA (dRVVT and SCT) positivity. All groups showed higher anti-β2gp1 positivity than aCL. Persistent LA positivity after 12-weeks was more frequent with dual-LA positive (91.67%), double (LA + aCL/anti-β2gp1) and triple (LA + aCL + anti-β2gp1) positive cases (100%). Both dRVVT and SCT had comparable sensitivity. dRVVT positivity was significantly associated with increased thrombotic risk. Persistent LA positivity was more often seen with initially dual, double or triple LA positive cases."
Interacting internal waves explain global patterns of interior ocean mixing,"Across the stable density stratification of the abyssal ocean, deep dense water is slowly propelled upward by sustained, though irregular, turbulent mixing. The resulting mean upwelling determines large-scale oceanic circulation properties like heat and carbon transport. In the ocean interior, this turbulent mixing is caused mainly by breaking internal waves: generated predominantly by winds and tides, these waves interact nonlinearly, transferring energy downscale, and finally become unstable, break and mix the water column. This paradigm, long parameterized heuristically, still lacks full theoretical explanation. Here, we close this gap using wave-wave interaction theory with input from both localized and global observations. We find near-ubiquitous agreement between first-principle predictions and observed mixing patterns in the global ocean interior. Our findings lay the foundations for a wave-driven mixing parameterization for ocean general circulation models that is entirely physics-based, which is key to reliably represent future climate states that could differ substantially from today’s."
A novel procedure for selection of molecular descriptors: QSAR model for mutagenicity of nitroaromatic compounds,"Nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) stand out as pervasive organic pollutants, prompting an imperative need to investigate their hazardous effects. Computational chemistry methods play a crucial role in this exploration, offering a safer and more time-efficient approach, mandated by various legislations. In this study, our focus lay on the development of transparent, interpretable, reproducible, and publicly available methodologies aimed at deriving quantitative structure–activity relationship models and testing them by modelling the mutagenicity of NACs against the Salmonella typhimurium TA100 strain. Descriptors were selected from Mordred and RDKit molecular descriptors, along with several quantum chemistry descriptors. For that purpose, the genetic algorithm (GA), as the most widely used method in the literature, and three alternative algorithms (Boruta, Featurewiz, and ForwardSelector) combined with the forward stepwise selection technique were used. The construction of models utilized the multiple linear regression method, with subsequent scrutiny of fitting and predictive performance, reliability, and robustness through various statistical validation criteria. The models were ranked by the Multi-Criteria Decision Making procedure. Findings have revealed that the proposed methodology for descriptor selection outperforms GA, with Featurewiz showing a slight advantage over Boruta and ForwardSelector. These constructed models can serve as valuable tools for the quick and reliable prediction of NACs mutagenicity."
Testing a Psychological Model of Post-Pandemic Academic Cheating,"Concerns over students engaging in various forms of academic misconduct persist, especially with the post-COVID19 rise in online learning and assessment. Research has demonstrated a clear role of the personality trait psychopathy in cheating, yet little is known about why this relationship exists. Building on the research by Curtis et al. (Personality and Individual Differences, 185, 111277, 2022a), this study tested an extended Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) model, including psychopathy as a precursor to attitudes and subjective norms, and measures of anticipated moral emotions (shame and guilt), to predict cheating intentions and cheating behaviours. A cross-sectional survey was administered online to university students from around the globe (n = 257). Results from a serial mediation analysis revealed that psychopathy predicted academic misconduct behaviours indirectly through attitudes, subjective norms, anticipated guilt (but not anticipated shame), and intentions. These findings indicate that cheating may be reduced by modifying attitudes to cheating, subjective norms regarding cheating, and anticipated feelings of guilt related to engaging in academic misconduct. In addition, the results revealed high rates of several forms of cheating, particularly in unsupervised online tests, which have been used more widely since the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding raises concerns regarding the poor security of such assessments."
Designing optimal middle-mile network architecture for smart farming applications in rural areas,"Agriculture 4.0 has transformed farmers’ outlooks with the advent of digital technologies and smart farming applications, offering the promise of improved agricultural techniques and sustainable crop practices. These applications rely on advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, edge computing, big data, and the internet of things, necessitating robust network services with low latency, high bandwidth, and uninterrupted connectivity. However, rural communities often find themselves neglected by network service providers due to their sparse population density. Although optical fiber-based communication (OF) serves as the standard for broadband, its high installation costs render it unsuitable for rural middle-mile connectivity. In recent years, alternatives such as fixed wireless and free-space optics (FSO) have emerged, yet they face technical challenges hindering their full replacement of OF. To address the need for cost-effective middle-mile connectivity in rural areas, this study proposes three heterogeneous broadband-access network topologies that integrate OF, fixed wireless, and FSO technologies. Through optimization, the appropriate technologies are chosen for individual segments to maximize the network operator’s profit while meeting the minimum bandwidth requirements for each rural cluster. Simulations utilizing real-life data from eight target rural population clusters compare and determine the optimal middle-mile and last-mile connectivity solutions, achieving annual returns-on-investment of \(11.18\%\) for ring topology, \(17.19\%\) for star topology, and \(10.81\%\) for wheel topology, while ensuring the desired bandwidth levels for each cluster."
A novel approach to study ascorbic acid oxidation using hexavalent chromium species—theoretical and practical perspectives of the use of potentiometric titration technique,"This paper highlights the advantages of using the potentiometric titration technique as a valuable tool for studying the oxidation reaction of ascorbic acid by hexavalent chromium species in aqueous solutions. Particular attention was paid to the method of determining diagnostic points allowing the quantification of ascorbic acid in the sample under study. Additionally, the influence of experimental conditions, specifically the pH of the system and the concentration of the reactants, on the type of hexavalent chromium species involved in the interaction with ascorbic acid was analyzed. It has been shown that the method presented provides a simple, cost-effective, and rapid tool that can be widely used for the direct determination of ascorbic acid."
Pin-on-disc tribological characterization of single ingredients used in a brake pad friction material,"Researchers have long been studying the effects of the modification of friction material compositions on their tribological properties. Predictive models have also been developed, but they are of limited use in the design of new compositions. Therefore, this research aims to investigate the tribological behaviour of single ingredients in friction materials to develop a tribological dataset. This dataset could then be used as a foundation for a cellular automaton (CA) predictive model, intended to be a tool for designing friction materials. Tribological samples were almost entirely composed of four distinct friction material ingredients, and one sample composed of their mixture was successfully produced. Pin-on-disc (PoD) tribometer testing and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDXS) analysis were used for the tribological characterization. Each material showed distinct tribological properties and evolution of the contact surface features, and the synergistic effect of their mutual interaction was also demonstrated by their mixture."
The application of deep learning technology in integrated circuit design,"This study addresses the intricate challenge of circuit layout optimization central to integrated circuit (IC) design, where the primary goals involve attaining an optimal balance among power consumption, performance metrics, and chip area (collectively known as PPA optimization). The complexity of this task, evolving into a multidimensional problem under multiple constraints, necessitates the exploration of advanced methodologies. In response to these challenges, our research introduces deep learning technology as an innovative strategy to revolutionize circuit layout optimization. Specifically, we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in developing an optimized layout strategy, a performance prediction model, and a system for fault detection and real-time monitoring. These methodologies leverage the capacity of deep learning models to learn from high-dimensional data representations and handle multiple constraints effectively. Extensive case studies and rigorous experimental validations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed deep learning-driven approaches. The results highlight significant enhancements in optimization efficiency, with an average power consumption reduction of 120% and latency decrease by 1.5%. Furthermore, the predictive capabilities are markedly improved, evidenced by a reduction in the average absolute error for power predictions to 3%. Comparative analyses conclusively illustrate the superiority of deep learning methodologies over conventional techniques across several dimensions. Our findings underscore the potential of deep learning in achieving higher accuracy in predictions, demonstrating stronger generalization abilities, facilitating superior design quality, and ultimately enhancing user satisfaction. These advancements not only validate the applicability of deep learning in IC design optimization but also pave the way for future advancements in addressing the multidimensional challenges inherent to circuit layout optimization."
Oxidation of hydrogen peroxide by tungstate ion: formation and decay of a long-lived intermediate,"The kinetics of the reaction between tungstate ion and hydrogen peroxide in aqueous medium containing phosphate ions has been followed spectrophotometrically at 225 nm. This wavelength led to two different kinds of absorbance-time plots, showing either an increasing-maximum-decreasing temporal pattern or a continuously decreasing one, depending on the medium pH. This allowed to carry out two independent kinetic studies, one at high pH (first reaction stage) concerning the formation of a long-lived intermediate, thought to be W(V), and the other at low pH (second reaction stage) concerning its decay. The kinetic tool chosen to obtain the quantitative information was that of the initial rate method. The results indicated that, whereas both reaction stages were of first order in hydrogen peroxide, the rate dependence on the concentration of tungstate ion differed for the two stages: an apparent kinetic order intermediary between 1 and 2 for the first stage, and a well-defined order 1 for the second stage. There was also a difference between the dependences of the initial rates of the two stages on the concentrations of phosphate ions (the rate of the first stage independent and that of the second decreasing) and of the background electrolyte KCl (for the first stage an increasing effect and for the second a decreasing one). Both stages showed catalysis by hydrogen, copper(II), zinc and manganese(II) ions, the latter three probably acting as superoxide radical scavengers. Although the activation energy of the first stage was unusually close to zero (1.0 ± 1.2 kJ mol−1), that of the second stage was considerably higher (28 ± 3 kJ mol−1). Finally, a mechanism coherent with the available experimental information, and where the solvent cage effect plays an important role, has been proposed for each reaction stage."
Study on OSA screening and influencing factors in community-based elderly hypertensive patients based on single-lead wearable ECG devices,"Assessing whether single-lead ECG can be effectively and relatively inexpensively used in large-scale OSA screening, and identifying factors influencing moderate-to-severe OSA among elderly hypertensive patients without atypical symptoms in primary care."
Sensitivity Investigation of Underlap Gate Cavity-Based Reconfigurable Silicon Nanowire Schottky Barrier Transistor for Biosensor Application,"This study investigates the sensitivity of Underlap Gate Cavity-based Reconfigurable Silicon Nanowire Schottky Barrier Transistor (UCG-RSiNW SBT) with an underlap gate-drain region for biosensing application. The featured unique reconfigurable capability enables the device to operate as either p-type or n-type, dependent on the applied bias polarity. The proposed biosensor incorporates a cavity beneath the control gate on the source side, facilitating the placement of both neutral and charged biomolecules with varying dielectric constant (K) values. Upon injection of biomolecules into the cavity, the device changes electrostatic characteristics, including modulation in threshold voltage, potential, electric field, and sub-threshold swing, \(I_{ON}\), \(I_{ON}\)/\( I_{OFF}\) ratio. The threshold voltage (\(V_{TH}\)) Sensitivity of n-mode is enhanced by \(97.91\%\), while that of p-mode is raised by \(16\%\) compared to conventional RFET biosensors. The drain current sensitivity and the linearity of proposed biosensor is enhanced upto the values of 2792 and 0.997 respectively in n-mode configuration whereas in p-mode configuration, the drain current sensitivity and the linearity comes out to be 968 and 0.995 respectively. These high sensitivity and linearity values make this biosensor superior to the existing state-of-the-art biosensors. The findings from this study provide valuable insights into the development of highly sensitive biosensors for applications in diverse fields, including healthcare and biotechnology."

Comparative prevalence of Nosema ceranae infection between wild and managed honey bee(Apis mellifera) colonies in South Texas,"Over the last few decades, honey bee (Apis mellifera) populations have been challenged by multiple factors including pathogens and parasites, which often act concurrently to cause severe health problems. One honey bee pathogen linked to colony losses worldwide is the microsporidian Nosema spp., which affects adult bees. Workers infected with Nosema often exhibit shorter lifespans, forage prematurely, and are susceptible to other pathogens. Our main goals were to quantify the levels of Nosema spp. infection in a wild honey bee population at the Welder Wildlife Refuge (WWR) in south Texas, and to compare them to infection levels in colonies from a nearby managed apiary. We hypothesized that wild colonies would have lower infection levels than managed colonies due to their unique life history traits, including lower colony density per unit area, which decreases the likelihood of cross-colony disease transmission. We collected foragers from the entrance of 18 wild colonies at the WWR and 19 managed colonies at the nearby apiary. We then performed individual Nosema spp. spore counts on ten workers per colony to calculate an average spore count per bee. On average, wild colonies had 25,556 spores/bee, while managed colonies had 130,526 spores/bee, both considered to be low. There were no differences in infection levels between colony types. All samples tested positive for N. ceranae; no N. apis was detected. Our results suggest that wild colonies at the WWR have historically been infected with Nosema spp. at low levels and can thrive in the absence of human intervention."
Responses of plant biomass allocation to changed precipitation timing in a semi-arid steppe,"Precipitation changes can affect patterns of biomass allocation by altering species composition. However, how shifts in species with different growth forms under precipitation changes affect above- and belowground biomass allocation and the vertical root distribution remains unclear."
Time-domain acceleration-based pulse characterization of 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes,"On February 6, 2023, two significant earthquakes struck the region of Kahramanmaraş, Türkiye. The first earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.7 and a depth of 8.6 km, occurred in Pazarcık, and the second earthquake, with a magnitude 7.6 and a depth of 7.0 km, struck Elbistan. These two devastating events led to the loss of lives and massive destruction of civil infrastructures. In this work, pulse components of the ground motions for both earthquakes are characterized through a multi-pulse decomposition method developed by the authors. The work particularly focuses on cumulative energy, period, and amplitude of dominant pulse components using two extensive ground motion ensembles: (1) 103 ground motions from the Pazarcık earthquake, and (2) 79 ground motions from the Elbistan earthquake. It is found that, for the Pazarcık earthquake, pulse cumulative energy is more pronounced for the ground motions in proximity to the rupture lines. However, for the Elbistan earthquake, pulse cumulative energy is not significant for the ground motions in a specific area and is roughly uniformly distributed across all the ground motions and the entire region. It is also seen that dominant pulse periods lie predominantly within the range of 0.5–1.5 s for both earthquakes highlighting the significant damage caused. Finally, the pulse amplitudes exceed 0.5 g for several ground motions of the Pazarcık earthquake while all the amplitudes fall below 0.5 g for the Elbistan earthquake."
Perspectives on Teachers’ Work in Australian Early Childhood Education and Care Settings: Evidence and Ecology,"ECEC educators play a vital role in educating and caring for children during the first five years of life, a critical period for learning, growth, and development. University-trained early childhood teachers make a particularly significant contribution to overall service quality. This exploratory interview study brings an ecological lens to the perspectives of nine Australian university-trained early childhood teachers on the nature and quantity of their work and workload. As part of the mixed methods Early Learning Work Matters project, this Phase II interview study supports findings from the prior international systematic review that work in ECEC is complex and demanding. Interviews yielded new findings indicating the potential changing nature of early childhood teachers’ work, some of whom reported little to no capacity to focus on service quality. Concerningly, analysis revealed burdensome influences at all ecological levels, with only a few uplifting microsystems which were inconsistently experienced by participants."
Stable isotopes and diet metabarcoding reveal trophic overlap between native and invasive Banded Killifish (Fundulus diaphanus) subspecies,"Researchers, managers, and policymakers have historically neglected non-game fishes relative to game fishes, and this oversight has extended to invasive non-game fishes in the United States. One such fish—the Eastern Banded Killifish (Fundulus diaphanus diaphanus Lesueur 1817)—has established and rapidly spread in Lake Michigan and connected waters since 2000. Here, we assess potential drivers of the successful invasion of Eastern Banded Killifish, as well as their potential to disrupt native communities and food webs. Specifically, we compare the trophic niche breadth and diet composition between Eastern Banded Killifish and a native subspecies, Western Banded Killifish (Fundulus diaphanus menona Jordan and Copeland 1877), using stable isotope and gut content metabarcoding analyses. Stable isotope analysis showed that Eastern Banded Killifish had a higher variance in littoral dependence and trophic position than Western Banded Killifish, but both stable isotope and gut content metabarcoding analyses revealed an overlap in the diet composition and trophic position between the subspecies. Eastern Banded Killifish may successfully establish outside its native range due to higher feeding variability than Western Banded Killifish, including in habitats historically unused by the native subspecies, but the trophic niche between these two subspecies was similar overall. This study provides insights into the successful invasion of a potentially overlooked non-game fish—Eastern Banded Killifish—while also comparing stable isotope and gut content metabarcoding analyses for an invasive freshwater fish for the first time."
MARVEL-minimising the emergence and dissemination of HIV-1 drug resistance in Portuguese-speaking African Countries (PALOP): low-cost portable NGS platform for HIV-1 surveillance in Africa,"HIV-1 infections remain a global public health concern. Scaled-up antiretroviral treatment (ART) is crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality related to HIV/AIDS. The emergence of drug-resistance mutations (DRMs) compromises viral suppression and contributes to the continued HIV-1 transmission. Several reports indicate a recent increase in acquired (ADR) and transmitted (TDR) drug resistance in Africa, probably linked to the lack of implementation of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) testing and suboptimal treatment adherence. Herein, we will develop a low-cost protocol using third-generation sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technology) for HIV-1 surveillance in Portuguese-speaking African Countries - PALOP [Angola (AO), Cape Verde (CV), Mozambique (MZ), and Sao Tome & Principe (STP)]."
Automated analysis of the void structure in hardened concrete based on shape from focus,"The quality of the air void system is essential for the frost resistance of concrete. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the quality of the air void system in hardened concrete in an appropriate way. In this study, the shape from focus (SFF) method is applied to identify the focused image of each point on the polished surface of hardened concrete and thereby acquire the depth information of the entire surface. The performance of various focus measure operators and window sizes is evaluated. Thereafter, the selected focus measure operator and window size are applied for the SFF analysis of all samples. Based on the obtained depth map, the voids are identified, and the void parameters of the hardened concrete are determined by an automated procedure. The main advantage of the SFF method is that it is possible to carry out an automated air void analysis without contrast enhancement."
Modeling and multi-objective optimization of a drill-string system in the tripping operation,"The increase in deep and ultra-deep wells demands higher drilling efficiency and more drilling safety. Since the undesired oscillation associated with the tripping in/out of the drill-string increases the risk of downhole safety, it is important to master the axial dynamics of the drill-string system and choose appropriate tripping parameters. In this study, the drill-string system during the tripping operation is modeled as a continuous Euler–Bernoulli beam with the equivalent mass-spring-damper at the top and free at the bottom. The finite element method is employed to solve the axial dynamics of the drill-string system. Then, the dynamic characteristics of the underground drill-string for different system parameters are investigated in detail. Moreover, a multi-objective optimization framework is proposed, aiming to find the optimal tripping parameters and reach a balance between drilling safety and drilling efficiency. The results show that the axial vibration of the drill-string brings about the dynamic load fluctuation of the system, which becomes more serious in the tripping out process. The proposed optimization procedure can reach a desired balance between drilling efficiency and drilling safety and obtain appropriate tripping parameters for different conditions."
The effect of novel β-lactam derivatives synthesized from substituted phenethylamines on resistance genes of MRSA isolates,"This study focuses on the activity of previously reported imine and β-lactam derivatives against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates. The presence of mecA and blaZ genes in the isolates was determined, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined based on the antibacterial activity against these isolates. Active compounds were selected and their ability to act against resistant isolates in vitro was determined. Concurrently, biochemical (nitrocefin) and molecular (qRT-PCR) tests were used to investigate the ability of the compounds to induce resistance genes in MRSA isolates. The cytotoxicity of the compounds on human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) was investigated. The MIC values of compounds (10) and (12) against MSSA and MRSA isolates were 7.81 and 15.62 μg ml−1, respectively. The most active compounds were identified as (10) and (12), and it was observed that the isolates did not develop resistance to these compounds in vitro. These compounds were found to inhibit β-lactamase, reduce the expression of resistance genes, and exhibit reduced HDF cell toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. According to the findings of the study, it can be concluded that these compounds show promise as hits with an interesting mechanism of action for further chemical modifications to develop new MRSA inhibitors."
"Exploring the moral acceptability of older adults’ lies about their physical health, mental health, and medication adherence","Adults have been found to tell lies about their physical and mental health concerns, but no research has assessed how health lies are perceived by others. The present study explored the moral acceptability of older adults’ health lies. A sample of 73 younger and 61 older adults assessed how good or bad it is for older adults to tell health lies (about physical health, mental health, medication use) to their doctor, spouse, and adult child. All health lies were rated quite negatively but lies about medication adherence and lies to doctors were rated the most negatively. Compared with younger adults, older adults were more approving of lying to a doctor about physical health but less approving of lying to one’s adult child about mental health. Across participants, those with greater depressive symptoms viewed mental health lies less negatively. Given that health lies were rated quite negatively, telling health lies may hold negative social implications for older adults."
Quasi-equilibrium growth of inch-scale single-crystal monolayer α-In2Se3 on fluor-phlogopite,"Epitaxial growth of two-dimensional (2D) materials with uniform orientation has been previously realized by introducing a small binding energy difference between the two locally most stable orientations. However, this small energy difference can be easily disturbed by uncontrollable dynamics during the growth process, limiting its practical applications. Herein, we propose a quasi-equilibrium growth (QEG) strategy to synthesize inch-scale monolayer α-In2Se3 single crystals, a semiconductor with ferroelectric properties, on fluor-phlogopite substrates. The QEG facilitates the discrimination of small differences in binding energy between the two locally most stable orientations, realizing robust single-orientation epitaxy within a broad growth window. Thus, single-crystal α-In2Se3 film can be epitaxially grown on fluor-phlogopite, the cleavage surface atomic layer of which has the same 3-fold rotational symmetry with α-In2Se3. The resulting crystalline quality enables high electron mobility up to 117.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 in α-In2Se3 ferroelectric field-effect transistors, exhibiting reliable nonvolatile memory performance with long retention time and robust cycling endurance. In brief, the developed QEG method provides a route for preparing larger-area single-crystal 2D materials and a promising opportunity for applications of 2D ferroelectric devices and nanoelectronics."
Quality assessment of ESG reporting among listed maritime companies,"Regulatory obligations and market trends connected to environmental sustainability issues have lately intensified their effect on the shipping industry. New standards are continuously being established, such as IMO’s 2050 aim of lowering greenhouse gas emissions by 50% compared to 2008 levels. These rules have an impact on capital markets and on investors’ ship financing decisions. The standards now include Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) components. These are not only concerned with the environmental impact of shipping, but also with the social and governance dimensions of firms, which are typically associated with maritime transport risks, such as accidents, ship reservations, and marine pollution. Considering the intricacies of the shipping sector, our previous research (Tsatsaronis et al. in Maritime Policy and Management 51(5):698–716, 2024) has developed a unified ESG reporting framework customized for shipping. The present study conducts a quality assessment of existing ESG reporting in various sectors of maritime transport companies, on a large sample of firms listed at major stock exchanges, while it also identifies their level of compliance and areas for improvement. Based on a comprehensive methodological framework for reporting and assessing ESG in shipping (Tsatsaronis et al. in Maritime Policy and Management 51(5):698–716, 2024), the research delivers important, pertinent information to aid management decision-making, stakeholders, and debtholders."
"Using Municipal Solid-Waste Incinerator Fly Ash, Wash Water, and Propylene Fibers in Self-Compacting Repair Mortar, Greenhouse Gas Emissions Potential","Wash water, municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash, and propylene (PP) fibers were employed simultaneously to produce self-compacting repair mortar (SCRM). Different SCRM mixtures were utilized, incorporating 35, 70, and 140 kg/m3 of MSWI fly ash, along with 0.1% of PP fibers. The research focused on investigating the workability, mechanical properties, and global warming potential (GWP) of SCRM. The incorporation of MSWI fly ash and wash water in SCRM resulted in reduced workability, necessitating an increase in the use of superplasticizer. Adding MSWI fly ash decreases compressive strength. The minimum compressive strength was observed when employing 140 kg/m3 of MSWI fly ash and wash water instead of tap water simultaneously. By increasing the proportion of MSWI fly ash content and correspondingly reducing the cement content in SCRM samples, there was a decrease in flexural strength. The ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) of all SCRM samples falls within acceptable range. Adding MSWI fly ash to SCRM reduces fracture toughness, and the concurrent use of wash water and MSWI fly ash significantly decreases fracture toughness. Incorporating PP fibers into SCRM resulted in increased compressive strength. Utilizing wash water and MSWI fly ash in SCRM significantly reduces GWP. The avoidance of wash water consumption mitigates the environmental impact of SCRM."

Neural mechanisms of altruistic decision-making: EEG functional connectivity network analysis,"Altruism is an enigmatic form of prosocial behavior, characterized by diverse motivations and significant interindividual differences. Studying neural mechanisms of altruism is crucial to identify objective markers of pro- and antisocial tendencies in behavior. This study was designed to delve into the mechanisms of altruism by analyzing EEG-based functional connectivity patterns within the framework of the network approach. To experimentally induce a situation of altruistic decision-making, we employed the Pain versus Gain (PvsG) task, which implies making choices concerning financial self-benefit and pain of the other. Our results reveal that the behavioral measure of altruism in the experiment correlated with emotional empathy, which is in line with the “empathy-altruism” hypothesis. Applying the network approach to EEG functional connectivity analysis, we discovered that the very process of decision-making in the PvsG is characterized by the synchronous activity of structures in the right hemisphere, which are involved in empathy for pain. The prosociality of decisions was reflected in functional connectivity between the rostral ACC and orbital IFG in the left hemisphere and the overall network centrality of the caudal ACC. This finding additionally points to the distinct functional roles of the ACC subregions in altruistic decision-making. The proposed neural mechanisms of altruism can further be used to identify neurophysiological markers of prosociality in behavior."
Is endurantism the folk friendly view of persistence?,"Many philosophers have thought that our folk, or pre-reflective, view of persistence is one on which objects endure. This assumption not only plays a role in disputes about the nature of persistence itself, but is also put to use in several other areas of metaphysics, including debates about the nature of change and temporal passage. In this paper, we empirically test three broad claims. First, that most people (i.e. most non-philosophers) believe that, and it seems to them as though, objects persist by enduring rather than perduring. Second, that most people have a view of change on which enduring but not perduring objects count as changing. Third, that one reason why the folk represent time as dynamical is because it seems to them, and they believe that, they endure through time. We found no evidence to support these claims. While there are certainly plenty of ‘folk’ endurantists in the population we tested, there are also plenty of ‘folk’ perdurantists. We did not find robust evidence that a majority of people believed that, or it seemed to them as though, objects endure rather than perdure. We conclude that many arguments in favour of endurantism that appeal to folk beliefs about, or experiences of, persisting objects and change rest on views about those beliefs and experiences that are empirically unsupported. There is no evidence to suggest that endurantism is the folk friendly view of persistence, and so we should stop treating it as such without argument."
Shifting sentiments: analyzing public reaction to COVID-19 containment policies in Wuhan and Shanghai through Weibo data,"This study examines the dynamic relationship between China’s COVID-19 containment policies and public sentiment, focusing on the significant lockdowns in Wuhan and Shanghai. We employed natural language processing (NLP) on Weibo text data to uncover how people’s emotions towards these containment measures changed over time and space. Our analysis reveals a critical evolution in public sentiment, transitioning from initial support to growing dissatisfaction, highlighting the impact of ‘pandemic fatigue’ and the socio-economic factors influencing these shifts. This study contributes to understanding the complex interplay between public health strategies and societal reactions, providing practical insights into the spatial variations of sentiment across different demographic and socio-economic groups. By elucidating the causal effects of containment policies on public sentiment and the subsequent rise in public skepticism, our research offers valuable lessons for policymakers in tailoring communication and interventions to mitigate negative public perceptions and foster compliance during health crises."
A Specialized Combination: The Relationship between Reproductive Structure Arrangement and Breeding Systems in oil-rewarding Calceolaria Species (Calceolariaceae),"Plants have different strategies to avoid selfing and buffer its negative consequences on plant fitness. One strategy is the arrangement of petals and the disposition of the reproductive structures (RS) inside the flowers, allowing the development of different pollination mechanisms. In Calceolaria L. species two possible floral phenotypes can be found: short RS protected by the upper corolla lip (nototribic flowers) and long RS resting in the lower corolla lip (sternotribic flowers), the latter being hypothesized to favor selfing."
PatchBreaker: defending against adversarial attacks by cutting-inpainting patches and joint adversarial training,"Adversarial patches can disrupt computer vision systems, seriously threatening people’s lives and property security. Existing defense methods seldom consider the generalization for defending against different patches and the compatibility with various models. Furthermore, the severe security situation necessitates the combination of data defense and model defense to build a comprehensive defense system. To address these issues, we propose a defense method named PatchBreaker, which consists of three components. In data defense, PatchBreaker uses the Semantic-Cutter trained by annotated patch images to cut patches and output incomplete images. Next, the Image-Inpainter trained by clean-incomplete image pairs is used to inpaint these incomplete images and output inpainted images. In model defense, the Adversaril-Classifier will be trained by joint adversarial training with clean images and patch images. Finally, PatchBreaker inputs inpainted images into Adversarial-Classifier to output correct results. Comparative experiments show that PatchBreaker outperforms other comparative defense methods in most cases, which indicates the excellent patch generalization and model compatibility of PatchBreaker. Meanwhile, ablation studies show the effectiveness of combining data defense and model defense. Additionally, PatchBreaker has minimal impact on the clean accuracy (about 1\(\%\))."
Impact of Radial Perturbations on Expansion-free Anisotropic Fluid Spheres in D-dimensional Modified Gravity,"In this manuscript, we have continued the work of Herrera et al. (Gen. Relativ. Gravit. 44, 1143, 2012) to investigate the instability of non-static spheres supported by anisotropic matter configuration in the background of D-dimensional Einstein gravity. For this purpose, we assume that our relativistic sphere undergoes adiabatic evolution with a vanishing expansion scalar condition. We compute gravitational field equations, conservation equations, and junction conditions in D-dimensional Einstein theory. After considering the evolution of the systems under an expansion-free background, some significant constraints are established by using a perturbation scheme. This leads us to develop the dynamical instability of expansion-free anisotropic fluid spheres in the Newtonian (N) and Post-Newtonian (PN) domains. After focusing on the N and PN eras, our study reveals that the adiabatic index (\(\Gamma \)), does not contribute to the instability ranges in these domains. Instead, these ranges are being determined solely by the anisotropy of fluid pressure, D-dimensional Einstein gravity parameter, and the radial energy density profile."
In search of per capita effects of Prunus serotina Ehrh. invasion on temperate forest understory alpha diversity,"Prunus serotina is one of the most widespread alien tree species in temperate European forests. Although numerous studies revealed both negative and positive impacts on native ecosystems, only a few assessed the quantitative impacts along a species abundance gradient, based on aboveground biomass of per capita effects. Here we studied how alpha diversity of forest understory changes with increasing aboveground biomass of P. serotina. In Wielkopolska National Park (W Poland) we established 92 plots in both nutrient-rich and poor Pinus sylvestris stands. We assessed the effects of P. serotina proportion on understory species composition using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). We also assessed the effects of P. serotina proportion on alpha diversity metrics using generalized mixed-effects linear models, accounting also for stand age, soil C:N ratio, and light availability. P. serotina biomass ranged from 0.0 to 34.29 Mg ha−1 (with an average of 5.70 ± 0.83 Mg ha−1), comprising 0% to 17.26% (with an average of 2.93 ± 0.43%) of total woody species biomass. NMDS revealed a lack of P. serotina proportion effects on understory species composition. We found small positive impacts of P. serotina proportion on total species richness (+ 8.8 species along a gradient with a 10% increase of P. serotina biomass proportion) and functional richness (+ 0.08). The positive impacts of P. serotina were mostly related to the confounding effect of two factors: an increase in light availability facilitates both the development of understory plants as well as the growth of P. serotina."
Face Index of Silicon Carbide Structures: An Alternative Approach,"Face index is a critical topological descriptor that provides important information about the structural variations of various materials. Initially introduced as a novel metric, the face index has become essential in characterizing the complexity and properties of molecular structures like silicate networks, carbon sheets, and nanotubes. This analysis focuses on the face index within the Silicon Carbide structure, highlighting its profound significance as a pivotal structural descriptor. By shedding light on its implications for the fundamental properties of three different Silicon Carbide structures: \(Si_2C_3\)-I[m, n], \(Si_2C_3\)-II[m, n] and \(Si_2C_3\)-III[m, n], this study aims to advance our understanding of the structural complexities and potential applications of this unique material system."
Association of HDL and LDL levels with osteoporosis in rheumatoid arthritis: a retrospective cohort study,"A correlation exists between lipids and osteoporosis (OP), as well as between lipids and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, lipids, the relationship between RA and OP is still unclear. This study mainly investigates the relationship between lipid levels and OP risk in RA patients."
Recycling valid inequalities for robust combinatorial optimization with budgeted uncertainty,"Robust combinatorial optimization with budgeted uncertainty is one of the most popular approaches for integrating uncertainty into optimization problems. The existence of a compact reformulation for (mixed-integer) linear programs and positive complexity results give the impression that these problems are relatively easy to solve. However, the practical performance of the reformulation is quite poor when solving robust integer problems, in particular due to its weak linear relaxation. To overcome this issue, we propose procedures to derive new classes of valid inequalities for robust combinatorial optimization problems. For this, we recycle valid inequalities of the underlying deterministic problem such that the additional variables from the robust formulation are incorporated. The valid inequalities to be recycled may either be readily available model constraints or actual cutting planes, where we can benefit from decades of research on valid inequalities for classical optimization problems. We first demonstrate the strength of the inequalities theoretically, by proving that recycling yields a facet-defining inequality in many cases, even if the original valid inequality was not facet-defining. Afterwards, we show in an extensive computational study that using recycled inequalities can lead to a significant improvement of the computation time when solving robust optimization problems."
Data-access performance anti-patterns in data-intensive systems,"Data-intensive systems handle variable, high-volume, and high-velocity data generated by human and digital devices. Like traditional software, data-intensive systems are prone to technical debts introduced to cope-up with the pressure of time and resource constraints on developers. Data-access is a critical component of data-intensive systems, as it determines their overall performance and functionality. While data access technical debts are getting attention from the research community, technical debts that affect performance are not well investigated. This study aims to identify, categorize, and validate data-access performance anti-patterns. We collected issues from NoSQL-based and polyglot persistence open-source data-intensive systems, implemented in Java programing language, and identified 14 new data access-performance anti-patterns categorized under seven high-level categories. We conducted a developer survey to evaluate the perceived relevance and criticality of the newly identified anti-patterns and found that Improper Handling of Node Failures, Using Synchronous Connection, and Inefficient Driver API performance anti-patterns are the most critical data-access performance anti-patterns. The study findings can help improve the quality of data-intensive software systems by raising awareness of practitioners about the impact of the data-access performance anti-patterns. At the same time, the findings will help quality assurance teams to prioritize the correction of performance anti-patterns based on their criticality."
CrowdChain: A privacy-preserving crowdfunding system based on blockchain and PUF,"Crowdfunding refers to the online collection of certain capital from a vast number of individuals or groups that each contribute a relatively small amount. Recently, the credibility of crowdfunding platforms has been undermined by fraudulent projects, inadequate fund management, and other forms of disorder. The decentralization and anti-tampering features of blockchain provide the possibility to solve the above problems, and many studies have proposed blockchain-based crowdfunding schemes. However, the existing state-of-the-art methods do not provide user authentication, transaction auditing, and identity management in a privacy-preserving way. Accordingly, this paper presents a novel blockchain-based crowdfunding system called CrowdChain. Initially, the distributed identity and BLS signature are employed to establish a user authentication mechanism, enabling CrowdChain to withstand Sybil attacks while preserving the non-linkability of user identities. Secondly, the physically unclonable function (PUF) is used to generate keys associated with digital identities that are not stored in external devices to resist physical attacks. Subsequently, a crowdfunding mechanism is constructed utilizing zero-knowledge proofs to facilitate streamlined auditing procedures while safeguarding the confidentiality of transactions. Additionally, the formal security analysis proves the security of the CrowdChain scheme. The system prototype is implemented on the Hyperledger Fabric. Empirical evidence indicates the viable efficiency of CrowdChain."
"Pupils’ gendered experiences in the mathematics classroom: “When you’re in a class with such dominant boys, it’s not easy to put yourself forward”","Many studies worldwide conclude that there are no significant differences between the academic performance of boys and girls in school mathematics. In fact, girls are often found to outperform boys in several countries. However, girls and women continue to participate less in mathematics classrooms and have lower enrolment rates in STEM-related subjects. To investigate this paradox, we utilise the theoretical framework of figured worlds (Holland, Lachicotte, Skinner, and Cain in Identity and agency in cultural worlds, Harvard University Press, 1998) and examine how a group of three boys and a group of four girls experience participation in the mathematics classroom. All children had attended the same 9th grade (ages 14–15) in Norway. Based on focus-group and individual interviews with the children, this study identifies three themes around which children construct their experiences: (a) gendered participation in the mathematics classroom, (b) what it means to be a ‘good’ mathematics pupil, and (c) the teacher’s role in fostering pupil participation. In closing, we discuss implications of our work and make recommendations for future research."
Square values of Littlewood polynomials,"We study the square values of Littlewood polynomials. Using various methods we give all these values for the degrees \(n=3, 5\) and \(n\le 24\) even. Beside this, we gather computational data (by providing all solutions in a certain range) for n odd with \(n\le 17\). We propose some striking problems for further research, as well."
Emigration of Juvenile Tarpon Megalops atlanticus from Ephemerally Connected Coastal Ponds,"Worldwide, coastal wetlands are threatened by disrupted hydrology, urbanization, and sea-level rise. In southwest Florida, coastal wetlands include tidal creeks and coastal ponds, which are the primary habitats used by juvenile Tarpon, Megalops atlanticus, an important sport fish. Coastal ponds can occur near uplands and are ephemerally connected to the open estuary, creating conditions of variable dissolved oxygen and salinity. Juveniles can tolerate wide-ranging abiotic conditions, but little is known about how they egress from their remote nursery habitats, which often requires them to cross > 1 km of mangrove forest to reach the open estuary. The objective of this study was to (1) compare Tarpon body condition among ponds close to the open estuary versus those ponds farther away on the Cape Haze peninsula of Charlotte Harbor, Florida, and (2) using acoustic telemetry determine what factors contribute to Tarpon emigration from the ponds to open estuarine waters. We tested the hypothesis that distinct groups of Tarpon occur in isolated ponds, leading to variation in fish length and body condition, and that opportunities for emigration from these ponds hinge on high water events. No pond stood out as having Tarpon of low body condition. Factors contributing to increased probabilities of Tarpon emigration were low barometric pressure, high-water level, and Tarpon body length. Tarpon emigrated from ponds near tidal creeks during summer king tides, while tropical cyclone conditions were needed to allow for movement from ponds farther in the landscape. The juvenile Tarpon were later detected at the mouths of large rivers 30 km up-estuary. The characterizations of water levels and event criteria needed for successful Tarpon nurseries should aid in habitat conservation and the creation of Tarpon nursery habitat in restoration designs."
Identification and culture of functional salivary gland ductal epithelial cells,"Sialadenitis is a prevalent salivary gland disease resulting in decreased salivary flow rate. To date, little is known about the exact changes and mechanism of ductal cells in sialadenitis. This study aims to establish an efficient method to identify and isolate ductal cells, thereby facilitating further research on this specific cell type. Immunofluorescence for cytokeratin 13 and cytokeratin 19 was conducted in salivary glands to confirm their specificity as ductal cell markers. The dissected ducts were assessed through PCR and Western blot of cytokeratin 19 and digested by dispase and collagenase. The functionality of the isolated ductal cells was determined by measuring intracellular calcium. Cytokeratin 19 and cytokeratin 13 were expressed in all segments of human ducts. Cytokeratin 19 was limited to ducts excluding granular convoluted tubules in rat and mouse. The purities of the obtained ductal cells were approximately 98% in humans and 93% in rats. Furthermore, intracellular free calcium increased with time and concentration of carbachol treatment. Cytokeratin 19 serves as a dependable marker for identifying ductal cells in salivary glands, except for granular convoluted tubules. Moreover, we have successfully developed an efficient method for isolating ductal cells from salivary glands."
"Assessment of solid waste quantity considering pertinent factors: a case study of Cuttack City, Odisha, India","Solid waste management is a critical issue in India as the country continues to develop. Accurately estimating the types, quantities, and distribution of solid waste is essential for effective waste management. The methods and processes for managing waste in any city, including collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal, rely heavily on accurate estimations of waste quantities. These estimates are in turn influenced by various factors, including socio-cultural, economic, environmental, political, and technological factors. The research aims to identify specific social and spatial factors that influence solid waste generation in municipal cities of the present times through a literature study. It then undertakes the study of a selected area in the city of Cuttack, Orissa, India, as a case study and formulates a model for quantifying solid waste based on the measurements of derived indicators. The research utilizes both primary and secondary data to achieve its objectives. The analysis revealed that factors such as monthly family income, house occupancy, and occupation have a strong positive correlation with the quantity of solid waste. Conversely, factors such as educational qualification and the incentive system provided to citizens exhibit a negative correlation with the amount of solid waste generated. Based on these factors, the model derived will facilitate the accurate estimation of solid waste generated in similar contexts, thereby aiding efficient waste management. By conducting this case study in Cuttack City, we aim to contribute to the existing body of knowledge on solid waste management in India and provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting waste quantity."
Model-agnostic variable importance for predictive uncertainty: an entropy-based approach,"In order to trust the predictions of a machine learning algorithm, it is necessary to understand the factors that contribute to those predictions. In the case of probabilistic and uncertainty-aware models, it is necessary to understand not only the reasons for the predictions themselves, but also the reasons for the model’s level of confidence in those predictions. In this paper, we show how existing methods in explainability can be extended to uncertainty-aware models and how such extensions can be used to understand the sources of uncertainty in a model’s predictive distribution. In particular, by adapting permutation feature importance, partial dependence plots, and individual conditional expectation plots, we demonstrate that novel insights into model behaviour may be obtained and that these methods can be used to measure the impact of features on both the entropy of the predictive distribution and the log-likelihood of the ground truth labels under that distribution. With experiments using both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the utility of these approaches to understand both the sources of uncertainty and their impact on model performance."
Diagnostic challenges and outcome of fatty acid oxidation defects in a tertiary care center in Lebanon,"Fatty acid oxidation defects are rare autosomal recessive disorders with variable clinical manifestations and outcome. Early detection by systematic neonatal screening may improve their prognosis. Long-term outcome studies of these disorders in the Middle East and North Africa region are limited. The purpose of this study is to report the diagnostic challenges and outcome of fatty acid oxidation defects in a major tertiary care center in Lebanon, a resource-constrained country in the Middle East."
Enhancing Mechanical Performance of Friction Stir Welded AZ31 Magnesium Alloy with Nano-TiC Reinforcements Using Grey Relational Analysis,"The solid-state joining method known as friction stir welding has recently gained popularity because of the many benefits it provides in terms of mechanical characteristics and weld quality. Using a Grey Rational Coefficient optimization strategy to examine the effect of Titanium Carbide nanoparticles (TiCnp) reinforcement on welds of Grade AZ31 magnesium alloy. The key parameters under investigation include TiCnp content (ranging around 1.5 wt%), tilt angle (0°, 1°, and 2°), tool rotation speed (1000, 1250, and 1500 rpm), tool profile shape (Square, Cylinder, and Triangle), traverse feed rate (25, 50, and 75 mm/min), and axial load (5, 10, and 15 kN). The mechanical parameters tested in this research comprise micro hardness, tensile strength, wear rate, and impact strength. The findings reveal that when the TiCnp concentration is tuned within the prescribed range, welds with a peak tensile strength of 242 MPa significantly improve mechanical characteristics. In this study the value of 1250-rpm rotational speed, 50 mm/min traverse speed, 1° tilt angle and tool profile shape square is significantly increases the mechanical properties. Adding of TiCnp with AZ31 Mg alloy is widely increase the tensile strength up to 230 MPa, micro hardness about 70 MPa, impact strength 89.34 MPa and wear rate of 0.0046 m3/m."
Shear behavior of short stud in I-beam-ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) composite structure,"As the connecting component of I-beam and UHPC, the stud is the basis of the cooperative work of each component, and is crucial to the stability and safety of the structure. To further study the shear behavior of studs in I-beam-UHPC composite structures, the push-out test was carried out by numerical simulation. The numerical simulation is in line with the load-relative slip curve and failure mode obtained by the experiment, verifying the accuracy of the numerical model. On the basis of verifying the model, the influences of the diameter, height and ultimate tensile strength of the stud on the relative slip curve, shear strength, yield strength and shear stiffness of the stud are studied. The findings indicate that a stud with a diameter of 22 mm exhibits a shear strength 156% greater than that of a stud with a diameter of 10 mm. Additionally, the yield strength increases by 135%, and the shear stiffness by 160 kN, highlighting the significant impact of stud diameter on shear resistance. When the ratio of length to diameter is less than 2.7, the shear strength of the stud increases with the height of the stud. The shear strength of a stud with a length-to-diameter ratio of 2.7 is 35% higher than that of a stud with a ratio of 1.5. The ultimate tensile strength of the stud ranges from 360 to 510 MPa, with only an 11 kN increase in yield strength, indicating that the ultimate tensile strength has a limited influence on shear properties. As the height of the stud decreases, its ultimate tensile strength gradually increases, bringing the numerical model closer to the predicted values. For shorter studs with higher ultimate tensile strength, the finite element simulation results are closer to the predicted values."
Evaluating trends in damage to attractive targeted sugar baits (ATSBs) deployed during the second year of a two-year Phase III trial in Western Zambia,"Attractive Targeted Sugar Baits (ATSBs) are a proposed new vector control tool for malaria that contain sugar and an ingestion toxicant, and are designed to attract and kill sugar-feeding mosquitoes. During a two-arm cluster randomized Phase III trial conducted in Zambia to test the efficacy of ATSB stations on malaria incidence, ATSB stations deployed on eligible household structures within intervention clusters were routinely monitored to ensure their good physical condition and high coverage. This study investigates trends in prevalence and rate of damage to ATSB stations during year 2 of the two-year trial."
"Benvitimod upregulates filaggrin, involucrin and loricrin expressions via aryl hydrocarbon receptor-OVO-like 1 axis","Benvitimod has been successfully used in the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD). However, the mechanism remains to be clarified. We aim to assess the effects of benvitimod on MC903-induced dermatitis in mice and to investigate the effects of benvitimod on filaggrin (FLG), involucrin (IVL), and loricrin (LOR) expressions and possible mechanism. MC903-induced mouse AD model was used to evaluate the effects of benvitimod. Filaggrin, involucrin, and loricrin protein and mRNA expressions in lesions of mice dermatitis were measured by Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR. In vitro, normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) were cultured and benvitimod was used to treat NHEKs primed with IL-4 and IL-13. Then AHR and OVOL1 in NHEKs were knocked down to evaluate the role of AHR and OVOL1 in the effects of benvitimod. Topical treatment of benvitimod repaired skin barrier and alleviated skin inflammation in mouse AD model. This effect was inhibited by pretreatment with an AHR antagonist. Benvitimod upregulated the filaggrin, involucrin, and loricrin expressions in lesions of mouse AD model. In addition, benvitimod upregulated the filaggrin, involucrin, and loricrin expressions in NHEKs. Knockdown of AHR or OVO-like (OVOL)1 abrogated the upregulation of filaggrin, involucrin, and loricrin induced by benvitimod. Benvitimod attenuated MC903-induced mouse dermatitis and upregulated filaggrin, involucrin, and loricrin expressions via AHR-OVOL1 axis."
Unmet community care needs among older adults in China: an observational study on influencing factors,"With the rapidly aging population in China, there is an urgent need to understand and address the community care needs of older adults. This study sought to examine these unmet community care needs of older adults in China and the factors influencing them, with the goal of providing essential groundwork for the development of community care health policies."
Intra-familial dynamics of knowledge and ignorance experienced by donor-conceived adults in Germany,"This study explores how donor-conceived adults experience pre- and post-disclosure intra-familial dynamics of knowledge and ignorance in relation to their means of conception. Data were collected through an online survey of 59 individuals aged 21–46 years, who were recruited through the German support and advocacy group Verein Spenderkinder (the Association of Donor-conceived Children). Participants were born into families with heterosexual parents and learned about their conception via anonymous sperm donation between 5 and 46 years of age. Thematic qualitative text analysis revealed four main themes regarding the challenges donor-conceived adults face in reconciling their sense of identity and their relationships within the family: non-absoluteness of pre-disclosure ignorance, new fields of ignorance emerging post-disclosure, ways of dealing with the newly acquired knowledge, and conflicting ownership claims on knowledge and ignorance. These challenges pertain not only to knowledge and ignorance of the participants’ means of conception but also to the way in which (non-)knowing is perceived and managed by family members. Utilizing Peter Wehling’s taxonomy of ignorance as a theoretical framework, the study argues that intra-familial conflicts and challenges experienced by the participants can be attributed to either shifts in or stakeholders’ colliding claims to control the epistemic, social, and temporal dimensions of (non-)knowing in relation to the participants being donor-conceived."
Acute toxicity of sodium chloride-based road salt formulations to juvenile aquatic invertebrates,"Globally millions of tons of de-icing agents are applied each year, and about half of these salts enter surface water adjacent to sites of application. While numerous studies have demonstrated the potential impact de-icing agents such as NaCl have on freshwater invertebrates, many of these studies have used laboratory grade NaCl for evaluation, and less is known about the relative toxicity of formulations. The purpose of this study was to compare the 24 and 96 h LC50s of NaCl and two NaCl-based road salt formulations for three aquatic species: juvenile Hyalella azteca, Hexagenia rigida, and Chironomous dilutus. As expected, LC50 values were greater for 24 h exposures than 96 h exposures. However, the relative toxicity of the road salt formulations varied by exposure duration and species.    Although the acute LC50 values found in this study were within environmental concentrations of chloride ions reported by existing literature, more research is needed to evaluate chronic or sublethal effects of road salt formulations on a range of freshwater macroinvertebrates."
Cervical lung herniation of the azygous lobe: a case report and literature review,To report an adult case of cervical lung herniation involving the azygous lobe and to review the literature.
Does cross-validation work in telling rankings apart?,"Although cross-validation (CV) is a standard technique in machine learning and data science, its efficacy remains largely unexplored in ranking environments. When evaluating the significance of differences, cross-validation is typically coupled with statistical testing, such as the Dietterich, Alpaydin, or Wilcoxon test. In this paper, we evaluate the power and false positive error rate of the Dietterich, Alpaydin, and Wilcoxon statistical tests combined with cross-validation each operating with folds ranging from 5 to 10, resulting in a total of 18 variants. Our testing setup utilizes a ranking framework, similar to the Sum of Ranking Differences (SRD) statistical procedure: we assume the existence of a reference ranking, and distances are measured in \(L_1\)-norm. We test the methods under artificial scenarios as well as on real data borrowed from sports and chemistry. The choice of the optimal CV test method depends on preferences related to the minimization of errors in type I and II cases, the size of the input, and anticipated patterns in the data. Among the investigated input sizes, the Wilcoxon method with eight folds proved to be the most effective, although its performance in type I situations is subpar. While the Dietterich and Alpaydin methods excel in type I situations, they perform poorly in type II scenarios. The inadequate performances of these tests raises questions about their efficacy outside of ranking environments too."
K-means Pelican Optimization Algorithm based Search Space Reduction for Remote Sensing Image Retrieval,"In remote sensing field, the image retrieval is considered a complex task and attained higher attention, because of the data acquired from the earth observation satellites. An understanding of remote sensing images is obstructed because of the large amount of remote sensing images, lack of labeled samples, and complex contents. Content-based image retrieval made the powerful tool to mine huge remote sensing image databases. In content-based image retrieval, the query image is given for acquiring the images with identical visual content from the huge amount of remote sensing image database. In this research, the K-means pelican optimization algorithm is proposed for ensuring the search space reduction to enhance the retrieval of remote sensing images. The different feature extraction approaches such as Resnet-18, gray level co-occurrence matrix, Color moments, and local binary pattern are used to perform an effective feature extraction. Further, the feature transformation and neighborhood component analysis based feature selection is performed to transform the features into the similar significance and to select optimum features. Three different datasets such as Aerial Image Dataset, Remote Sensing-Image Classification Benchmark-256 and Wuhan University-Remote Sensing datasets are used to evaluate the proposed K-means pelican optimization algorithm. The proposed method is analyzed using precision, recall, F1-score and Average Normalized Modified Retrieval Rank. The existing research such as gabor-channel attention-ResNet, squeeze and excitation networks with ResNet50 and fused convolutional neural network-relevance feedback model are used to compare the K-means pelican optimization algorithm. The precision of the K-means pelican optimization algorithm for the Aerial Image Dataset dataset is 96.29% which is high when compared to the gabor-channel attention-ResNet, squeeze and excitation networks-ResNet50 and fused convolutional neural network- relevance feedback model."
Integrated multi-omics characterization of SMAD4 mutant colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers around the world, which is a severe threat to people’s health. SMAD4 belongs to the dwarfin/SMAD family, which plays a crucial role in TGF-β and BMP signal pathways. As the molecular characterization of colon cancer patients following SMAD4 mutations remains unclear, we integrated multi-omics data of SMAD4 mutant patients to reveal the profile of molecular characterization of SMAD4 mutation. A missense mutation is the most common mutant type of SMAD4. Patients with SMAD4 mutation had worse survival. Tumor tissues from patients carrying the SMAD4 mutation showed a reduction in various immune cells, such as CD4 + memory T cells and memory B cells. Many differential genes were identified compared to the SMAD4 mutation-free group and could be significantly enriched for tumor- and immune-related signaling pathways. In addition, the mutant group had different drug sensitivities than the non-mutant group."
Successful pain control with add-on methadone for refractory neuropathic pain due to radiation necrosis in pontine metastatic lesion: a case report,"Central pain, characterized by neuropathic pain, can manifest due to injury to the superior spinothalamic tract. The brainstem includes sensory and motor pathways as well as nuclei of the cranial nerves, and therefore cancer metastasis in the region requires early intervention. Although stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is commonly employed for the treatment of brain metastasis, it poses risks of late complications like radiation necrosis (RN). RN exacerbates the progression of brain lesions within the irradiated area, and in the brainstem, it can damage multiple nerves, including the superior spinothalamic tract. Central neuropathic pain is often intractable and empirically managed with a combination of conventional drugs, such as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and anticonvulsants. However, their efficacy is often limited, leading to a decline in performance status (PS) and quality of life (QOL)."

Sagittal morphometry of intervertebral spaces in subaxial cervical region of asymptomatic Chinese,"This study aimed to quantify and evaluate morphology of intervertebral space between neighboring cervical units using radiographic imaging indices, to help spine surgeons when performing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) surgery on the Chinese population."
Dissecting the invasion history of Spotted-Wing Drosophila (Drosophila suzukii) in Portugal using genomic data,"The invasive pest Spotted-Wing Drosophila, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura), causes extensive damage and production losses of soft-skinned fruits. Native to Asia, the species has now spread worldwide, with first reports in Portugal in 2012. In this study, we focus on the genomic signatures of the recent Portuguese invasion, in the context of worldwide patterns established in previous works. We analyzed whole genome pool sequencing data from three Portuguese populations (N = 240) sampled in 2019 and 2021."
Theoretical investigation the selective separation of Am(III)/Eu(III) by bis-succinamides ligands,"The selective separation of Am(III) over Eu(III) from high-level radioactive liquid waste using four bis-succinamide ligands (THE-BisSCA, L1; THDM-BisSCA, L2; THDPh-BisSCA, L3; THDi−P-BisSCA, L4) was explored with density functional theory. Ligands with phenyl groups near the nitrogen, particularly L3, showed the highest Eu(III) affinity. The π bonds orbitals of the benzene ring may conjugate with the long pair N-2p orbital, and this special p-π conjugation effect can lead to charge transfer from benzene ring to the donor N atoms on L3 ligand, resulting a lower energy and more stable structure of the complex formed with the L3 ligand compared to other complexes. Thermodynamic analysis corroborates L3 has Eu(III) preference, offering valuable guidance for efficient Am(III) and Eu(III) separation with these ligands."
"Histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A mitigates ionizing radiation induced redox imbalance by regulating NRF2/GPX4/PINK1/PARKIN signaling in mice intestine","Gastrointestinal-acute radiation syndrome (GI-ARS) caused by moderate to high doses of ionizing radiation exposure contribute to early death in humans. GI injury is also a common adverse effect seen in cancer patients undergoing abdominal/pelvic radiotherapy. Currently, no countermeasure agents have been approved for medical management of GI-ARS. The present study aims to evaluate the mechanism of action of Trichostatin A(TSA), a pan histone deacetylase inhibitor, against radiation-induced GI injury."
Stabilizing lithium deposition within bimodal porous SiO2-TiO2 microspheres as 3D host structure,"Three-dimensional (3D) host materials for lithium metal anodes (LMAs) have gained attention because they can mitigate volume expansion and local current density through their large surface area and suppress the dendritic growth of lithium. Recent research on 3D host materials has focused on conductive materials; however, the benefits of 3D host materials cannot be fully utilized because lithium deposition begins at the top of the structure. Herein, we fabricate SiO2-TiO2 composite microspheres with bimodal pore structures (bi-SiTiO) by simple spray pyrolysis. These microspheres effectively store lithium within the structure from the bottom of the electrode while preventing lithium dendrite formation. Focused ion beam-scanning transmission electron microscopy (FIB-STEM) analysis reveals that the lithiophilic properties of composite microspheres enhanced their effectiveness in storing lithium, with small pores acting as “lithium-ion sieves” for a uniform lithium-ion flux and large pores that provide sufficient volume for lithium deposition. The bi-SiTiO composite microspheres exhibit a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.5% over 200 cycles at 2.0 mA·cm−2 when operated in a lithium half-cell. With a high lithium loading of 5.0 mAh·cm−2, the symmetrical cell of the bi-SiTiO electrode sustains more than 900 h. A full cell coupled with an LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode also exhibits enhanced electrochemical properties in terms of cycling stability and rate capability."
Multiple habitat graphs: how connectivity brings forth landscape ecological processes,"Habitat connectivity is integral to current biodiversity science and conservation strategies. Originally, the connectivity concept stressed the role of individual movements for landscape-scale processes. Connectivity determines whether populations can survive in sub-optimal patches (i.e., source-sink effects), complete life cycles relying on different habitat types (i.e., landscape complementation), and benefit from supplementary resources distributed over the landscape (i.e., landscape supplementation). Although the past decades have witnessed major improvements in habitat connectivity modeling, most approaches have yet to consider the multiplicity of habitat types that a species can benefit from. Without doing so, connectivity analyses potentially fail to meet one of their fundamental purposes: revealing how complex individual movements lead to landscape-scale ecological processes."
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes among Asians: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could increase the susceptibility of individuals to develop obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Obesity and T2DM are closely related pathophysiologically, thus similar SNPs could mediate both these diseases, but this is rarely reported. Furthermore, limited studies have been performed to summarize SNP data in the Asian population compared to the Western population. In this study, we aimed to summarize SNPs that are associated with the development of obesity and T2DM among Asian populations. We searched six literature databases and Review Manager (RevMan) was used for meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated with a random effects model for the heterogeneity among studies. The pooled analysis showed that rs9939609 (FTO gene) and rs17782313 and rs571312 (MC4R gene) are associated with obesity with an odd ratio (OR) of 1.37, 1.36 and 1.29 respectively. For T2DM, five SNPs, rs7903146 and rs12255372 (TCF7L2 gene), rs13266634 and rs11558471 (SLC30A8 gene) and rs2283228 (KCNQ1 gene) have also shown strong associations with T2DM at OR of 1.64, 1.61, 1.22, 1.29 and 1.60 respectively. This data could be used to develop a gene screening panel for assessing obesity and T2DM susceptibility."
"Unusual arrangement of mirror-image dextrocardia with viscero-atrial situs solitus, with morphological right atrium anterior and to the right of the morphological left atrium — diagnosis and surgery of associated defects","In this case report, we have described a novel variant of mirror-image dextrocardia associated with viscero-atrial situs solitus, and not inversus, and the embryological basis for this presentation. The use of a pericardial baffle to correct the underlying intracardiac defects and the importance of confirming the anteroposterior relations of the atria, and not just their left–right relations, while deciphering the anatomy of dextrocardia."
Kinetics and thermodynamics analysis of the polybenzimidazole adsorption onto carbon materials using adsorption isotherm measurements,"The surface modification of carbon materials is an effective method for enhancing the properties of carbon-based functional materials; particularly, the use of a polymer coating is advantageous owing to its intactness and simplicity. Polybenzimidazole (PBI) has been used to modify carbon surfaces, yet its adsorption behavior has not been thoroughly examined. In this study, the adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics of PBI adsorption on various types of carbon black with different surface morphologies and chemical compositions were analyzed via isotherm measurements. To determine the effects of the polymer, its adsorption behavior was compared to that of the PBI monomer (1,3-bis(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)benzene (referred to as the PBI-unit)). The surface adsorption of PBI was slower than that of the PBI-unit; however, PBI exhibited a greater adsorption capacity. The PBI adsorption is an entropy-driven process, whereas PBI-unit adsorption is enthalpy-driven. The adsorption of PBI was more thermodynamically favorable on carbon surfaces with higher crystallinity (lower oxygenation) owing to the easier detachment of solvent molecules from the carbon surface, leading to a higher adsorption constant."
Urban scaling of air pollutants in Israel,"Cities have been shown to exhibit empirical scaling behavior where numerous variables of urban performance are allometric, like greenhouse gas emissions. Polluting emissions have negative environmental and health impacts. This paper will elucidate the empirical urban scaling of atmospheric emissions for the Israeli urban system. It has been shown that cities may be environmentally efficient with CO2 emissions that seem to be sub-linear, so large cities are more “green”. However, other reports suggest a super-linear relationship with respect to population size, so the large cities are less “green”. We report here for the first time the results of the nonlinear allometric power-law properties of multiple air pollutants, expanding the analysis to include electricity consumption and atmospheric emissions of CO2, NOx, SO2, CO, NMVOC, PM10, PM2.5, Benzene and 1,3-Butadiene together in one study in the case of Israel. They show the recurring mathematical patterns of cities similar to those reported elsewhere. Electricity usage is super-linear. Pollutant emissions of these greenhouse gases tend to exhibit significant super-linear dynamics (β > 1), though NMVOC and Benzene were linear. These results were conserved when regressing against the urban vehicle fleet size. This evidence supports the hypothesis that large cities may be less “green”. Indeed, different urban characteristics such as geography, local climate and weather conditions, population density, may also affect the pollution levels of cities. Taken together these results give evidence to the effect of urban agglomerations on the environment."
Class Imbalance Problem: A Wrapper-Based Approach using Under-Sampling with Ensemble Learning,"Imbalanced data sets are a growing problem in data mining and business analytics. However, the ability of machine learning algorithms to predict the minority class deteriorates in the presence of class imbalance. Although there have been many approaches that have been studied in literature to tackle the imbalance problem, most of these approaches have been met with limited success. In this study, we propose three methods based on a wrapper approach that combine the use of under-sampling with ensemble learning to improve the performance of standard data mining algorithms. We test our ensemble methods on 10 data sets collected from the UCI repository with an imbalance ratio of at least 70%. We compare their performance with two other traditional techniques for dealing with the imbalance problem and show significant improvement in the recall, AUROC, and the average of precision and recall."
"SB-ETAS: using simulation based inference for scalable, likelihood-free inference for the ETAS model of earthquake occurrences","The rapid growth of earthquake catalogs, driven by machine learning-based phase picking and denser seismic networks, calls for the application of a broader range of models to determine whether the new data enhances earthquake forecasting capabilities. Additionally, this growth demands that existing forecasting models efficiently scale to handle the increased data volume. Approximate inference methods such as inlabru, which is based on the Integrated nested Laplace approximation, offer improved computational efficiencies and the ability to perform inference on more complex point-process models compared to traditional MCMC approaches. We present SB-ETAS: a simulation based inference procedure for the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model. This approximate Bayesian method uses sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE) to learn posterior distributions from simulations, rather than typical MCMC sampling using the likelihood. On synthetic earthquake catalogs, SB-ETAS provides better coverage of ETAS posterior distributions compared with inlabru. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using a simulation based procedure for inference improves the scalability from \(\mathcal {O}(n^2)\) to \(\mathcal {O}(n\log n)\). This makes it feasible to fit to very large earthquake catalogs, such as one for Southern California dating back to 1981. SB-ETAS can find Bayesian estimates of ETAS parameters for this catalog in less than 10 h on a standard laptop, a task that would have taken over 2 weeks using MCMC. Beyond the standard ETAS model, this simulation based framework allows earthquake modellers to define and infer parameters for much more complex models by removing the need to define a likelihood function."
Size-Dependent Analysis of Strain Energy Release Rate of Buckling Delamination Based on the Modified Couple Stress Theory,"In micro-electro-mechanical systems, interface expansion issues are commonly encountered, and due to their small size, they often exist at the micro- or nano-scale. The influence of the micro-structural effect on interface mechanics cannot be ignored. This paper focuses on studying the impact of micro-structural effect on interface crack propagation. Modified couple stress theory (MCST) is used to study the buckling delamination of ultra-thin film-substrate systems. The equivalent elastic modulus (EEM) and equivalent flexural rigidity (EFR) are derived based on MCST. Substituting EEM and EFR into the classical Kirchhoff plate theory, the governing equations of ultra-thin film-substrate system with micro-structural effect can be obtained. The finite element method (FEM) was used to calculate the critical strain energy release rate for crack extension. Differences between the three theoretical approaches of MCST, classical theory (CT), and FEM were compared. The effects of stress ratio \(\frac{\sigma }{{\sigma_{c} }}\), initial crack length, film thickness, and micro-structural effect parameters on crack extension were analyzed. The results show that the FEM calculations coincide with the CT calculations. The stress ratio \(\frac{\sigma }{{\sigma_{c} }}\), initial crack length, film thickness, and micro-structural effect parameters have significantly influence crack extension."
Evaluating the efficiency of Tehran's healthcare services in the Covid-19 pandemic with the approach of spatial justice,"A balanced spatial distribution of urban services is an essential indicator of social justice in the city. Any change in spatial justice has a direct impact on economic and social relations and income distribution in society. The present study aims to analyze the efficiency and inefficiency of the twenty-two districts of Tehran, Iran, in terms of healthcare services for COVID-19 pandemic based on spatial justice. This study is applied-developmental research and adopts a descriptive-analytical methodology. The data included 26 indexes. The data were analyzed using Shannon’s entropy, data envelopment analysis (DEA), and the cross-efficiency matrix in ArcGIS and DEA Solver. The twenty-two districts of Tehran were treated as decision-making units. The DEA used the Charnes-Cooper-Rhodes constant returns-to-scale ratio model with an output-oriented approach. Research findings show the residents of the central districts in Tehran had the best accessibility (in terms of distance) to healthcare services. The accessibility of such services reduces in districts far from the central districts. The poor healthcare services and a lack of public adherence to health protection protocols in Districts 19, 15, 3, 21, and 22 increased the rate of COVID-19 infection, while the minimum infection rate was found in Districts 11, 10, 12, 17 and 16 in light of good healthcare services. The results suggest an unfair distribution of healthcare services in Tehran. This arises from polar growth policies where all services are concentrated in one or more areas."
Managing customer waiting times in an inventory system using Conditional Value-at-Risk measure,"In today’s fast-paced world, delays or prolonged customer waiting times pose a threat to the firm’s profitability. This study utilizes the mean-CVaR metric to incorporate the risk associated with prolonged customer waiting times into the optimal trade-off decisions. For this purpose, we consider a single inventory system that faces Poisson demand and utilizes a base-stock policy to replenish its inventory, which takes a fixed amount of time. The firm implements a preorder strategy, encouraging customers to place their orders a fixed amount of time in advance of their actual needs, a period referred to as the commitment lead time. The firm rewards customers with a bonus termed the commitment cost, which increases with the length of the commitment lead time. We aim to determine the optimal control policy, including the optimal base-stock level and optimal commitment lead time, that minimizes the long-run average cost. The cost includes inventory holding, commitment, and customer waiting costs, with the latter adjusted for the firm’s degree of risk aversion. The optimal policy depends on the interdependence of the decisions, with the optimal commitment lead time following a “bang-bang” pattern, and the corresponding optimal base-stock level taking an “all-or-nothing” form. For linear commitment costs with a cost factor per time unit, we identify a threshold that increases with the firm’s risk aversion degree. Firms with greater risk aversion typically favor the buy-to-order strategy, while those with lower risk aversion may opt for either buy-to-stock or buy-to-order depending on their assessment of waiting costs."
Pluralist economics in an era of polycrisis,"Interacting crises at economic, societal, ecological, and geopolitical levels reveal the fragility of connected global systems and give momentum to pluralist economic thinking as a suitable approach to address the complexity and uncertainty of today’s economy. This special issue (SI) explores how young economists, educated in this era, study economic phenomena through pluralist lenses. Due to the structure of interdependent crises and inherent uncertainty, pluralism of values, theory and methods may benefit the academic and policy debate on solutions for today’s political, social, and scientific challenges. Applied to the crisis context, this SI shows a range of research methods and interdisciplinary approaches, reflecting a shift in economic thinking that embraces the complexity, limited predictability, and fragility of socioeconomic systems. The SI aims to promote a dialogue across schools of economic thought to enhance our understanding and contribute to robust and inclusive policy."
Enhanced photocatalytic performance of CuO nanoparticles synthesized via surfactant assisted hydrothermal method,"An effective approach to enhance the photocatalytic performance of CuO nanoparticles (NPs) is the use of hydrothermal synthesis. The CuO NPs were synthesized by hydrothermal technique in the presence of anionic surfactant. Structural, functional, morphological, chemical composition and optical properties of the synthesized NPs were characterized by using XRD, FTIR, SEM, UV-visible DRS and PL. The average crystallite size for pure, 0.05 M SHMP and 0.05 M SHMP assisted CuO samples are around 13 nm, 11 nm and 10 nm respectively. It was observed that the size of particle is affected by the nature of surfactant. Additionally, in all the samples, FTIR spectra show three identical Cu-O vibration modes that indicate the presence of crystalline CuO monoclinic structure. Thus, the spherical like CuO nanostructure can be used as an ideal material for photocatalytic performance. The synthesized NPs are then used to photo-catalytically degrade the methyl violet dye in aqueous media. Surfactant-assisted CuO NPs showed better photocatalytical activity than bare CuO NPs."
Dispensed prescription medications and short-term risk of pulmonary embolism in Norway and Sweden,"Scandinavian electronic health-care registers provide a unique setting to investigate potential unidentified side effects of drugs. We analysed the association between prescription drugs dispensed in Norway and Sweden and the short-term risk of developing pulmonary embolism. A total of 12,104 pulmonary embolism cases were identified from patient- and cause-of-death registries in Norway (2004–2014) and 36,088 in Sweden (2005–2014). A case-crossover design was used to compare individual drugs dispensed 1–30 days before the date of pulmonary embolism diagnosis with dispensation in a 61–90 day time-window, while controlling for the receipt of other drugs. A BOLASSO approach was used to select drugs that were associated with short-term risk of pulmonary embolism. Thirty-eight drugs were associated with pulmonary embolism in the combined analysis of the Norwegian and Swedish data. Drugs associated with increased risk of pulmonary embolism included certain proton-pump inhibitors, antibiotics, antithrombotics, vasodilators, furosemide, anti-varicose medications, corticosteroids, immunostimulants (pegfilgrastim), opioids, analgesics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, antiprotozoals, and drugs for cough and colds. Mineral supplements, hydrochlorothiazide and potassium-sparing agents, beta-blockers, angiotensin 2 receptor blockers, statins, and methotrexate were associated with lower risk. Most associations persisted, and several additional drugs were associated, with pulmonary embolism when using a longer time window of 90 days instead of 30 days. These results provide exploratory, pharmacopeia-wide evidence of medications that may increase or decrease the risk of pulmonary embolism. Some of these findings were expected based on the drugs' indications, while others are novel and require further study as potentially modifiable precipitants of pulmonary embolism."
Breaking Barriers and Building Opportunities: Employer Perspectives on Working with People with Psychosocial Disabilities in a Rural Setting in Kenya,"In low-resource settings where unemployment rates are already high, persons with disabilities experience even greater challenges in finding work and employment opportunities. While employers' viewpoints are critical to shaping organizational cultures and employment practices, their perspectives on the employment of people with psychosocial disabilities (PWPD) in rural settings have not been adequately examined. This study explored perspectives of rural employers in Kenya on working with and employing PWPD, so as to strengthen the practice of inclusive work and employment. We utilized a qualitative research methodology to explore the perspectives of a heterogeneous group of employers from Tana River County Kenya. A total of 12 employers participated in the study. We found that employer awareness of inclusive employment practices of PWPD is limited, with several barriers identified. Reported barriers include productivity concerns, occupational hazards, brand image, and disclosure. To improve work and employment rates for PWPD, employers highlighted workplace adjustments, holistic socioeconomic empowerment, and policy changes. Despite differing opinions, employers expressed a willingness to work with and employ PWPD. This study sheds light on the current practices, perceived barriers, and enablers for improving work and employment rates of PWPD in rural settings. While there is a lack of awareness among employers and multiple barriers, it is encouraging to note that employers are willing to work with and employ PWPD. To achieve this, a holistic approach that includes raising awareness on mental illnesses and implementing policies that promote inclusivity is needed."
A framework for best practices in clinical outcome assessment (COA) concept mapping: a case study,Mapping or matching the items in a clinical outcome assessment (COA) to concepts that define a condition is a common method for evaluating a COA’s concept coverage. The purpose of this research was to address the lack of formal guidance for conducting this task by developing a framework for best practices in COA concept mapping and applying it to a case study.
Possibility of Discovering the Super-Heavy Elements Z=119 and 120,"We reveal that inclusion of fission barrier, nuclear level densities, neutron and fission decay widths in a better way in the advanced statistical method and dinuclear system model can lead to reproduce well the measured production cross sections of the cold and hot fusion reactions in the range \(Z=102-118\). In addition, we show that the optimal beam energies, where the production cross section reaches its maximum, can also be effectively determined using quasielastic barrier distribution curves. This theoretical approach helps us to verify the cause of low production cross section measured for the super-heavy element (SHE) \(^{278}\)Nh with the reaction \(^{70}\)Zn + \(^{209}\)Bi and null results from the reaction \(^{86}\)Kr+\(^{208}\)Pb used for synthesizing the SHE Z=118. Furthermore, the same has been employed to explore the reason for the failure of many trials in synthesizing the SHEs for \(Z=119\) and 120. ER cross sections at the optimal energies for a few heavy-ion reactions in synthesizing the SHE \(Z=119\) and 120 are seen to be measurable. Thus, the synthesis of the SHEs for \(Z=\)119 and 120 is on the cards."
Methane Emissions Associated with Bald Cypress Knees Across the Mississippi River Alluvial Valley,"In freshwater forested wetlands, bald cypress knees (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.) have the potential to emit large amounts of methane (CH4), but only a few studies have examined their greenhouse gas contribution. In this study, we measured CH4 fluxes associated with cypress knees across various climate and flooding gradients of the Mississippi River Alluvial Valley in southcentral United States. Greenhouse gases were measured using a portable gas analyzer with a custom-made chamber placed over the knees. We also conducted 3D lidar scans of knees using a smartphone to estimate the surface area and volume of knees. We investigated the following: (1) What parameters influence CH4 fluxes (i.e., knee height, distance to stream, temperature, relative humidity, water level, precipitation)? and (2) Which type of knee shape measurement (i.e., cone, frustrum, or lidar scan) provides the best fit to model data while maximizing measurement efficiency? We found that knee CH4 flux rates ranged from − 0.005 to 182 mmol m− 2 d− 1. There were positive correlations between CH4 fluxes, water levels, and temperature, and a negative correlation with knee height. Sites that had been dry for longer periods of time emitted less CH4 than sites where the soil remained saturated. The frustrum shape produced a knee volume estimate that was within 12% of lidar scans, whereas cone shapes underestimate knee dimensions (-100%). Further research of emissions and fluxes in cypress knees could fill knowledge gaps within the carbon cycle and could represent a major component of wetland CH4 budgets."
Socioeconomic Inequities in Pap Test Use Among Black Women in the United States: An Intersectional Approach,"Research investigating racialized inequities in cervical cancer screening has rarely considered the influence of socioeconomic position (SEP), a key social determinant of health that intersects with race/ethnicity and racism. Thus, data on socioeconomic inequities in Pap test use within racialized groups—including Black women, who are at elevated risk of cervical cancer morbidity and mortality—are limited."
Adolescents with Elevated Psychopathic Traits are Associated with an Increased Risk for Premature Mortality,"The mortality rate among adolescents has been steadily increasing in recent years. Researchers have previously identified forms of externalizing psychopathology measured during adolescence associated with an increased risk for premature mortality, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), substance use disorders (SUDs), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder (CD). The current study investigated whether additional personality traits (i.e., adolescent psychopathic traits, assessed via the Hare Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version [PCL:YV]) were also associated with premature mortality risk among maximum-security incarcerated adolescents (N = 332). During a follow-up period ranging from 10 to 14 years, premature mortality was observed in n = 33 participants (9.94%), a mortality rate nearly ten times higher than population norms. We observed that adolescents scoring the highest on PCL:YV total scores exhibited significantly higher rates of premature mortality compared to adolescents scoring lower on PCL:YV total scores via Fisher’s exact tests. Additionally, through univariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses, PCL:YV total, Factor 2 (measuring lifestyle/behavioral and antisocial/developmental psychopathic traits), Facet 1 (measuring interpersonal psychopathic traits), and Facet 3 (measuring lifestyle/behavioral psychopathic traits) scores were associated with faster time to premature mortality. In supplemental analyses performed, we observed that adolescents meeting criteria for externalizing psychopathology (i.e., ADHD, SUDs, ODD, and CD) did not exhibit higher rates of premature mortality compared to control participants. The current study therefore identifies additional maladaptive personality traits to consider in relation to premature mortality risk (i.e., psychopathic traits) among a high-risk sample of incarcerated adolescents."
Two-year clinical performance of indirect resin composite restorations in endodontically treated teeth with different cavity preparation designs: a randomized clinical trial,"This is a randomized, controlled, superiority, double-blinded, parallel-group, two-arms trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1. This study aimed to assess whether the cavity design could affect the clinical performance of the CAD/CAM generated indirect resin composite restoration in endodontically treated teeth (ETT) evaluated using the Modified USPHS criteria after a two-year follow up."
Flux Calibration of Coronal Magnetic Field,"Romashets and Vandas (2024) derived a method for the determination of Euler potentials at a spherical surface and applied it to the geomagnetic field. Here, we apply it to find Euler potentials at the source surface. A regular mesh defined by Euler potentials divides the source surface to surface elements with the same magnetic flux. By tracing magnetic-field lines away from the source surface, Euler potentials can be extended into the heliosphere."
Elliptic deformation of the Gaiotto-Rapčák corner VOA and the associated partially symmetric polynoimals,"We construct the elliptic Miura transformation and use it to obtain the expression of the currents of elliptic corner VOA. We subsequently prove a novel combinatorial formula that is essential for deriving the quadratic relations of the currents. In addition, we give a conjecture that relates the correlation function of the currents of elliptic corner VOA to a certain family of partially symmetric polynomials. The elliptic Macdonald polynomials, constructed recently by Awata-Kanno- Mironov-Morozov-Zenkevich, and Fukuda-Ohkubo-Shiraishi, can be obtained as a particular case of this family."
Moderating Effects of Housing Tenure Change on the Longitudinal Relationship Between Housing Relocation and Life Satisfaction,"This study aimed to estimate (a) trajectories of life satisfaction before and after housing relocation and (b) how changes in housing tenure at the time of relocation affect life satisfaction trajectories. Using data from the Korea Welfare Panel Study spanning 2006 to 2021 (N = 9,369), we examined the anticipatory, immediate, and long-term impacts of housing relocation on life satisfaction. We employed individual-level fixed effects models. This study also conducted housing tenure-stratified analysis to determine whether changes in tenure at the time of relocation affect the longitudinal association between housing relocation and life satisfaction. Our study found that life satisfaction decreased in the year leading up to housing relocation but showed an immediate increase during the relocation year. However, this rebound did not result in a long-term improvement, as life satisfaction eventually returned to baseline levels. Regarding housing tenure changes, persistent owner-occupiers experienced an immediate increase in life satisfaction during the year of relocation, while persistent renters did not experience any significant changes in life satisfaction before or after relocation. Individuals transitioning from renters to owner-occupiers reported higher levels of life satisfaction both before and after relocation. In contrast, those transitioning from owner-occupiers to renters experienced a decline in life satisfaction before relocation, with no significant changes in the year of relocation or afterward. These findings highlight the varying impacts of housing relocation on life satisfaction, influenced by changes in housing tenure."
Robust IMPT and follow-up toxicity in skull base chordoma and chondrosarcoma—a single-institution clinical experience,"Chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the skull base are rare, slowly growing malignant bone neoplasms. Despite their radioresistant properties, proton therapy has been successfully used as an adjunct to resection or as a definitive treatment. Herewith, we present our experience with robustly optimized intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) and related toxicities in skull base chordoma and chondrosarcoma patients treated at HollandPTC, Delft, the Netherlands."
Effect of Biochar Addition on Biogas Production Using Konjac Waste through Mesophilic Two-Phase Anaerobic Digestion,This study aimed to investigate the influence of biochar supplementation in the mesophilic two-phase anaerobic digestion process for konjac waste.
A case study of supporting group awareness to facilitate CSCL through a minimalist approach,"Group awareness tools have garnered significant interest within the realm of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), as they foster collaborative learning behaviors. However, in the context of a CSCL environment devoid of rich technologies, supporting group awareness is challenging. Contextualized in a teacher professional development course in a large normal university in southwestern China, this study followed a minimalist approach to develop group awareness support through collaborating authoring software. An 8-week-long quasi-experiment was conducted to explore whether supporting group awareness in project-based learning (PBL) through a minimalist approach could (1) improve the quality of group project, and (2) improve students’ participation in collaborative learning. The sample consisted of 125 junior students. Students received regular instruction in stage 1 (week 1 to week 4) and instruction with group awareness support in stage 2 (week 5 to week 8). After each stage, students’ group projects and self-reported surveys were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. It was found that supporting group awareness led to significantly better group performance but did not significantly influence student participation. Group awareness support also contributed to equal involvement among group members. Furthermore, cross-group awareness encouraged students to co-construct knowledge across groups. These findings might help practitioners in economically disadvantaged and technologically underprivileged areas to design group awareness support. It might also benefit instructors who prefer a light-tech solution to support CSCL."
"Baseline renal function modified the association between total, plant or animal protein intake and the risk of developing renal composite outcome in people with type 2 diabetes: a prospective cohort study [diabetes distress and care registry at Tenri (DDCRT25)]","This study aimed to identify the longitudinal associations between protein intake, and composite renal outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes."
Exploring the interplay between kidney function and urinary metabolites in young adults: the African-PREDICT study,"The exposure to modifiable risk factors at young ages have been linked to premature fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. The use of urinary metabolomics has shown strong predictability of kidney function and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We therefore determined the associations between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary metabolites in young adults with and without CVD risk factors. Apparently healthy Black and White sexes were included (aged 20–30 years) and categorised by the presence or absence of risk factors, i.e., obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, excessive alcohol intake, masked hypertension, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and low socio-economic status, forming the CVD risk group (N = 1036), CVD risk clusters (i.e. presenting with 1 CVD risk factor (N = 344), 2 CVD risk factors (N = 360) and 3 + CVD risk factors (N = 332)) and the control group (N = 166). eGFR was calculated with CKD-EPI equations. A targeted metabolomics approach using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure amino acids and acylcarnitines. Lower cystatin C-based eGFR were indicated in the CVD risk group, 2 and 3 + CVD risk clusters compared to the control group (all P ≤ 0.033). In the CVD risk group, eGFR associated positively with histidine, lysine, asparagine, glycine, serine, glutamine, dimethylglycine, threonine, alanine, creatine, cystine, methionine, tyrosine, pyroglutamic acid, leucine/isoleucine, aspartic acid, tryptophan, glutamic acid, free carnitine, acetylcarnitine, propionylcarnitine, isovalerylcarnitine, octanoylcarnitine and decanoylcarnitine (all P ≤ 0.044), with similar results found in the CVD risk clusters, particularly the 2 CVD risk cluster. eGFR was positively associated with metabolites linked to aromatic amino acid and branched-chain amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism and oxidative stress. These findings may indicate altered reabsorption of these metabolites or altered metabolic regulation to preserve renal health in the setting of CVD risk factors at this young age without established CVD."
Epistemic logic with partial grasp,"We have to gain from recognizing a relation between epistemic agents and the parts of subject matters that play a role in their cognitive lives. I call this relation “grasping”. Namely, I zone in on one notion of having a partial grasp of a subject matter—that of agents grasping part of the subject matter that they are attending to—and characterize it. I propose that giving up the idealization that we fully grasp the subject matters we attend to allows one to more realistically characterize the epistemic life of agents. To show this, I propose an epistemic logic with partial grasp that has in mind considerations from first-order aboutness theory with the aim of avoiding certain forms of logical omniscience, and which provides an alternative to immanent closure (Yablo Aboutness, Princeton University Press, 2014)."
Brane mechanics and gapped Lie n-algebroids,"We draw a parallel between the BV/BRST formalism for higher-dimensional (≥ 2) Hamiltonian mechanics and higher notions of torsion and basic curvature tensors for generalized connections in specific Lie n-algebroids based on homotopy Poisson structures. The gauge systems we consider include Poisson sigma models in any dimension and “generalised R-flux” deformations thereof, such as models with an (n + 2)-form-twisted R-Poisson target space. Their BV/BRST action includes interaction terms among the fields, ghosts and antifields whose coefficients acquire a geometric meaning by considering twisted Koszul multibrackets that endow the target space with a structure that we call a gapped almost Lie n-algebroid. Studying covariant derivatives along n-forms, we define suitable polytorsion and basic polycurvature tensors and identify them with the interaction coefficients in the gauge theory, thus relating models for topological n-branes to differential geometry on Lie n-algebroids."
"The causal relationship model of factors influencing COVID-19 preventive behaviors during the post-pandemic era and implications for health prevention strategies: a case of Bangkok City, Thailand","Though, many countries are currently in the COVID post-pandemic era, people’s health protective behaviours are still essential to protect their health and well-being. This study aims to evaluate people’s understanding and perceptions of COVID-19 risk characteristics (i.e. threat occurrence, threat severity, perceived susceptibility and exposure), the health risk perception towards COVID-19, and health protective behaviours. The study also aims to estimate the associations among these factors by the analysis of structural equation modelling (SEM)."
A revised digital edition of Wurm & Hattori’s Language Atlas of the Pacific Area,"Wurm & Hattori’s Language Atlas of the Pacific Area describes the geographic speaker areas of the languages and language varieties spoken in the Pacific. Thanks to the efforts of the Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative, this monumental piece of work has been available in digital form for over 15 years. But lacking proper identification of language varieties, this digitized data was largely unusable for today’s research methods. We turned ECAI’s digitized artefacts of the Language Atlas into an open, reusable geo-referenced dataset of speaker area polygons for a quarter of the world’s languages. This allows for much more refined analysis methods to, for example, analyse language contact in the area of the world with the highest linguistic diversity. We also describe a number of tool applications and quality checks which may be useful for methodological development in similar digitization efforts."
Intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging in evaluating preoperative staging of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,The aim of this research is to prospectively investigate the diagnostic performance of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) using the integrated slice-specific dynamic shimming (iShim) technique in staging primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and predicting presence of lymph node metastases from ESCC.
Swallowing outcomes after tracheal resection and anastomosis: full versus mini infrahyoid laryngeal drop,"Tracheal resection anastomosis has been established as the definitive surgery for high grade postintubation subglottic stenosis. To achieve a relaxed tension-free anastomosis, various laryngeal release techniques were discussed in literature with potential effect on postoperative swallowing dysfunction. This study aims to compare the difference in swallowing outcomes following two methods of infrahyoid laryngeal release: with and without fracture of the superior thyroid horns."
Study on particle loss-induced deformation of gap-graded soils: role of particle stress,"Deformation induced by finer particle loss is an important phenomenon during suffusion of gap-graded soils. This study focuses on the role of particle stress played in the particle loss-induced volumetric deformation. Discrete element simulations are performed to generate loss of finer particles with prescribed stress contribution, i.e. the contribution of particle stress to the macroscopic stress. Variations of volumetric strain, εv, with the stress contribution, Cσe, of eroded finer particles present two distinct patterns, that is, transition pattern, i.e. εv has extremely small values at relatively small Cσe and increases rapidly as Cσe exceeds the transition point near Cσe = 0.01%, and constant pattern, i.e. εv reaches a rather large value at extremely small Cσe and varies little with the increment of Cσe. A transformation from constant to transition pattern is observed for the εv–Cσe curves with the increment of the coordination number, Zstrong, of the load-carrying skeleton. The threshold of Zstrong for the transformation is around 3.71 for a relatively small eroded fraction (≤ 10%), while it is 3.96–4.09 for a relatively large eroded fraction (≥ 30%), in which the eroded fraction is the volume percentage of the eroded finer particles within the finer fraction."
Cartographies of warfare in the Indian subcontinent: Contextualizing archaeological and historical analysis through big data approaches,"Some of the most notable human behavioral palimpsests result from warfare and its durable traces in the form of defensive architecture and strategic infrastructure. For premodern periods, this architecture is often understudied at the large scale, resulting in a lack of appreciation for the enormity of the costs and impacts of military spending over the course of human history. In this article, we compare the information gleaned from the study of the fortified cities of the Early Historic period of the Indian subcontinent (c. 3rd century BCE to 4th century CE) with the precolonial medieval era (9-17th centuries CE). Utilizing in-depth archaeological and historical studies along with local sightings and citizen-science blogs to create a comprehensive data set and map series in a “big-data” approach that makes use of heterogeneous data sets and presence-absence criteria, we discuss how the architecture of warfare shifted from an emphasis on urban defense in the Early Historic period to an emphasis on territorial offense and defense in the medieval period. Many medieval fortifications are known from only local reports and have minimal identifying information but can still be studied in the aggregate using a least-shared denominator approach to quantification and mapping."
Multi-objective application placement in fog computing using graph neural network-based reinforcement learning,"We propose a framework designed to tackle a multi-objective optimization challenge related to the placement of applications in fog computing, employing a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. Unlike other optimization techniques, such as integer linear programming or genetic algorithms, DRL models are applied in real time to solve similar problem situations after training. Our model comprises a learning process featuring a graph neural network and two actor-critics, providing a holistic perspective on the priorities concerning interconnected services that constitute an application. The learning model incorporates the relationships between services as a crucial factor in placement decisions: Services with higher dependencies take precedence in location selection. Our experimental investigation involves illustrative cases where we compare our results with baseline strategies and genetic algorithms. We observed a comparable Pareto set with negligible execution times, measured in the order of milliseconds, in contrast to the hours required by alternative approaches."
Securing the IoT ecosystem: ASIC-based hardware realization of Ascon lightweight cipher,"The Internet of Things (IoT) nodes consist of sensors that collect environmental data and then perform data exchange with surrounding nodes and gateways. Cybersecurity attacks pose a threat to the data security that is being transmitted in any IoT network. Cryptographic primitives are widely adopted to address these threats; however, the substantial computation demands limit their applicability in the IoT ecosystem. In addition, each IoT node varies with respect to the area and throughput (TP) requirements, thus demanding flexible implementation for encryption/decryption processes. To solve these issues, this work implements the NIST lightweight cryptography standard, Ascon, on a SAED 32 nm process design kit (PDK) library by employing loop folded, loop unrolled and fully unrolled architectures. The fully unrolled architecture can achieve the highest TP but at the cost of higher area utilisation. Unrolling by a lower factor results in lower area implementations, enabling the exploration of design space to tackle the trade-off between area and TP performance of the design. The implementation results show that, for loop folded architecture, Ascon-128 and Ascon-128a require 36.7k \(\upmu \textrm{m}^{2}\) and 38.5k \(\upmu \textrm{m}^{2}\) chip area, respectively compared to 277.1k \(\upmu \textrm{m}^{2}\) and 306.6k \(\upmu \textrm{m}^{2}\) required by their fully unrolled implementations. The proposed implementation strategies can adjust the number of rounds to accommodate the varied requirements of IoT ecosystems. An implementation with an open-source 45 nm PDK library is also undertaken for enhanced generalization and reproducibility of the results."
Efficient Representation of Lattice Path Matroids,"Efficient deterministic algorithms to construct representations of lattice path matroids over finite fields are presented.

Thermomechanical Modeling and Numerical Simulation of Orthogonal Turning of 42CrMo4 Steel: Case of Workpiece/Tool Studies,"Machining of mechanical parts using material removal is one of the most used manufacturing techniques in the industry. This type of machining is a highly coupled thermomechanical process. During machining, the tool/chip interface is the site of complex interactions between mechanical, thermal and metallurgical phenomena. The experimental study remains difficult and expensive because of the multitude of parameters involved in the cutting phenomenon, which makes the use of finite element (FE) simulations an essential approach. In this work, a thermomechanical 2D model of the orthogonal cutting process of 42CrMo4 steel was developed using Abaqus/Explicit. The objective of this work is to study the influence of cutting parameters (feed f and cutting speed Vc) on cutting forces, stress distribution and temperature. A particular interest is given to the temperature and constraints of the cutting tool compared to similar work, particularly for 42CrMo4 steel. Knowing these two answers makes it possible to calculate the wear and thus the service life of the cutting tool. The results show that cutting speed and feed rate have a significant influence on cutting force, stress and temperature in the cutting zone. A comparison of the simulated and experimental results was carried out in terms of cutting force, to verify the accuracy and reliability of the developed simulation model. It was found that the average error on the cutting force is 8.11%, which proves the relevance and reliability of the proposed numerical model."
Reducibility of Linear Quasi-periodic Hamiltonian Derivative Wave Equations and Half-Wave Equations Under the Brjuno Conditions,"In this paper, we prove the reducibility for some linear quasi-periodic Hamiltonian derivative wave and half-wave equations under the Brjuno–Rüssmann non-resonance conditions. This is an extension of previous results of reducibility on Hamiltonian PDEs that required stronger (Diophantine) non-resonance conditions."
Does cross-validation work in telling rankings apart?,"Although cross-validation (CV) is a standard technique in machine learning and data science, its efficacy remains largely unexplored in ranking environments. When evaluating the significance of differences, cross-validation is typically coupled with statistical testing, such as the Dietterich, Alpaydin, or Wilcoxon test. In this paper, we evaluate the power and false positive error rate of the Dietterich, Alpaydin, and Wilcoxon statistical tests combined with cross-validation each operating with folds ranging from 5 to 10, resulting in a total of 18 variants. Our testing setup utilizes a ranking framework, similar to the Sum of Ranking Differences (SRD) statistical procedure: we assume the existence of a reference ranking, and distances are measured in \(L_1\)-norm. We test the methods under artificial scenarios as well as on real data borrowed from sports and chemistry. The choice of the optimal CV test method depends on preferences related to the minimization of errors in type I and II cases, the size of the input, and anticipated patterns in the data. Among the investigated input sizes, the Wilcoxon method with eight folds proved to be the most effective, although its performance in type I situations is subpar. While the Dietterich and Alpaydin methods excel in type I situations, they perform poorly in type II scenarios. The inadequate performances of these tests raises questions about their efficacy outside of ranking environments too."
"Monitoring and predicting spatio-temporal dynamics of river bankline movements: a case study for land use risk management in the lower Ganga River, India","Changing the river course in the alluvial plain region is a common phenomenon that may have disastrous consequences. The risk of river bank erosion has increased dramatically during the last few decades. As a result, assessing the river bankline alteration is necessary. The study aims to determine the changes in the bankline in the lower Ganga River. This research presents a novel approach by using the digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS) in conjunction with geospatial data to monitor and predict long-term changes in river banks from 1965 to 2017, providing a comprehensive temporal analysis that is unprecedented in this study area. The study analyzes the bankline change along the river Ganga using DSAS using during the elapsed period. An erosion and accretion zonation was conducted based on the rate of bankline change of the river Ganga in the study area. The rate of bankline shifting was quantified using the endpoint rate (EPR) and linear regression rate (LRR) statistics computed using the DSAS model. The east bank of the Ganga in the study area experienced an average erosion of − 41.17 m/year according to the LRR model. Whereas, the west bank eroded an average of − 2.32 m/year between 1965 and 2017. 90.54% of the transect lines recorded erosion at the east bank and 53.69% of the transect lines at the west bank recorded erosion computed with LRR. For the assessment of the impact of river bankline change on the LULC of the study area, the future river banklines for 2027 and 2037 were forecasted. The result shows that by 2027 and 2037 about 133.24 and 147 km2 of agricultural land and 7.19 and 11.47 km2 of the built-up area may be affected by river bank erosion respectively. By extending the applications of DSAS and geospatial analytics to encompass predictive and impact assessment capabilities, this study significantly enriches the literature on the management of riverbank erosion and associated land use risks. This research provides important insights that improve river management and planning and enable the formulation of robust strategies to mitigate erosion risks on river banks."
"Analysis of crude wastewater from two treatment plants in South Wales for 35 new psychoactive substances and cocaine, and cannabis","This study investigates the presence of new psychoactive substances (NPS) and their metabolites in two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) situated in South Wales, UK (WWTP-1 and WWTP-2). Analysis was conducted for 35 NPS and metabolites, along with the inclusion of benzoylecgonine (main cocaine metabolite) and cannabis, the most detected illicit substances. Benzoylecgonine was identified as the predominant substance in both WWTPs. Epidemiological calculations revealed the average population consumption of cocaine to be 3.88 mg/d/1000 inhabitants around WWTP-1 and 1.97 mg/d/1000 inhabitants for WWTP-2. The removal efficiency of benzoylecgonine across both WWTPs was observed at an average of 73%. Subsequent qualitative analyses on randomly selected wastewater samples detected medicinal compounds including buprenorphine, methadone, and codeine in both WWTPs. An additional experiment employing enzymatic hydrolysis revealed the presence of morphine, an increased presence of codeine, and 11-Nor-9-Carboxy-THC (THC-COOH) post-hydrolysis. These findings underscore the significant presence of illicit substances and medicinal compounds in wastewater systems with the absence of NPS within the South Wales area, highlighting the necessity for enhanced monitoring and treatment strategies to address public health and environmental concerns."
Association between the atherogenic index of plasma and erectile dysfunction in US men: a population-based cross-sectional study,"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and involves risk factors such as atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction. Since the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) may be potentially valuable in predicting cardiovascular risk, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between AIP and ED using large-scale data, as well as exploring its potential implications for clinical and future research. We screened the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database using R software, selected datasets from two study cycles for cross-sectional analysis, enrolled covariates and performed statistical analyses using multivariate logistic regression. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses were performed and the relationship between the AIP index and ED was further assessed using generalized additive model regression and smoothed curve fitting. After an initial filter of 21,161 participants, 1503 participants were included, and the AIP level in the ED group was 0.21 ± 0.02 compared with 0.08 ± 0.01 in the group without ED, which was analyzed to show a statistically significant difference between them (P < 0.0001), and the difference was further confirmed in the sensitivity analyses. We suggest that early assessment, intervention, and individualized treatment of ED in people with high AIP levels is warranted, as it not only improves sexual function but also reduces the risk of CVD. However, it was a limitation of this study that the study population was all from the US, and more research is needed in the future to elucidate the causal relationship between AIP and ED and the association in a wider population."
Exploring Dual-Purpose Benefits of Leaf Pruning in Sugar Beet for Crop Yield and Animal Feed,"In plants, leaves are the primary source of sunlight, and the production of photosynthetic materials. Estimating the rate of yield reduction due to leaf loss plays an important role in farm management. This research aimed to achieve the highest possible crop yield and quality while also utilizing pruned leaves for animal feed. To investigate the optimal timing for leaf pruning at different weeks of vegetative growth on the morphological, and physiological characteristics of sugar beet over the years 2022, and 2023 growing seasons in Eskişehir, Türkiye. This study included treatment of ten pruning times (PT): July 20, and 27; August 3, 10, 17, 24, and 31; September 7, and 14; and October 25 (control treatment and no pruning). The results showed the pruning treatments had a significant effect on morphological, and physiological characteristics in both years. The highest root yields were observed at the later pruning times, particularly at PT10 in both the years, with yields of 104.31 tons ha−1 in 2022 and 136.74 tons ha−1 in 2023. Other notable pruning times included PT6 and PT5, which also showed substantial root yields. Sugar content was higher during the earlier pruning times. The peak sugar contents were found at PT1 in both years, with 17.17% in 2022 and 13.79% in 2023. For leaves, the dry matter content was highest at late pruning times (PT8–PT10). PT10 showed the highest dry matter contents. Crude protein and crude ash contents remained relatively constant at different pruning times, but considerable values were observed from PT1 to PT8, contributing to the overall nutritional value of the leaves. The highest NDF and DMD contents were noted at late pruning times (PT7–PT10) in both years. Combining these findings, it was concluded that PT6 to PT8 were the most favorable pruning times, balancing high root yield, medium to high sugar content, and high nutritional values of leaves."
Cochlear implants for hereditary ATTR amyloidosis: a case report of two cases,"To analyze the clinical presentation, management, and outcome of two sisters affected by hereditary transthyretin related amyloidosis (ATTRv) and bilateral severe-to-profound hearing loss treated with cochlear implant."
The role of GABA in modulation of taste signaling within the taste bud,"Taste buds contain 2 types of GABA-producing cells: sour-responsive Type III cells and glial-like Type I cells. The physiological role of GABA, released by Type III cells is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the role of GABA released from Type III cells using transgenic mice lacking the expression of GAD67 in taste bud cells (Gad67-cKO mice). Immunohistochemical experiments confirmed the absence of GAD67 in Type III cells of Gad67-cKO mice. Furthermore, no difference was observed in the expression and localization of cell type markers, ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2 (ENTPD2), gustducin, and carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4) in taste buds between wild-type (WT) and Gad67-cKO mice. Short-term lick tests demonstrated that both WT and Gad67-cKO mice exhibited normal licking behaviors to each of the five basic tastants. Gustatory nerve recordings from the chorda tympani nerve demonstrated that both WT and Gad67-cKO mice similarly responded to five basic tastants when they were applied individually. However, gustatory nerve responses to sweet–sour mixtures were significantly smaller than the sum of responses to each tastant in WT mice but not in Gad67-cKO mice. In summary, elimination of GABA signalling by sour-responsive Type III taste cells eliminates the inhibitory cell–cell interactions seen with application of sour–sweet mixtures."
Structural and optical properties of Cr3+ doped SiO2 nanophosphor,"SiO2:x% Cr3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 8) nanopowder samples were synthesized using the sol-gel method. The effect of Cr3+ doping concentration on the SiO2 nanoparticles was studied for possible application in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Structure and optical properties of undoped and Cr3+ doped SiO2 nanoparticles were investigated in detail. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirmed the amorphous phase for undoped SiO2 (A-SiO2) nanopowder. However, above 0.8% Cr3+ there were secondary peaks due rhombohedral structure of chromium (III) oxide (R-Cr2O3). Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) spectra showed a reflectance peak at around 320 nm for the undoped sample. The results showed that when the concentration of Cr3+ is increased there was an emergence of reflectance peaks at around 309, 419, and 553 nm which were attributed to the presence of the Cr2O3 lattices. The photoluminescence (PL) results revealed that with an increase in the amount of Cr3+, the maximum peaks in blue and near red emerge at around 2.82 and 1.89 eV, respectively. Those peaks may be due to defects within both SiO2 and R-Cr2O3. The emission peaks of undoped and Cr3+ doped SiO2 match well with the Uv-vis results. The international illumination  colour chromaticity showed that above 0.8% Cr3+ the colour shifts from yellow to blue with an increase in Cr3+ concentration. The investigation indicated that Cr3+ doped SiO2 have a potential application in blue and yellow LED chips for lighting."
Determinants of cough-related quality of life in interstitial lung diseases,"Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) include a wide range of diseases impacting lung parenchyma and leading to fibrosis and architectural distortion. Chronic cough and dyspnea are common symptoms which affect the quality of life (QoL) in ILD patients. The mechanisms of cough in ILD patients are still unknown. The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate histological, radiological, and physiological determinants of cough-related QoL in ILD patients who underwent transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC)."
Automated multi-scale computational pathotyping (AMSCP) of inflamed synovial tissue,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex immune-mediated inflammatory disorder in which patients suffer from inflammatory-erosive arthritis. Recent advances on histopathology heterogeneity of RA synovial tissue revealed three distinct phenotypes based on cellular composition (pauci-immune, diffuse and lymphoid), suggesting that distinct etiologies warrant specific targeted therapy which motivates a need for cost effective phenotyping tools in preclinical and clinical settings. To this end, we developed an automated multi-scale computational pathotyping (AMSCP) pipeline for both human and mouse synovial tissue with two distinct components that can be leveraged together or independently: (1) segmentation of different tissue types to characterize tissue-level changes, and (2) cell type classification within each tissue compartment that assesses change across disease states. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy, efficiency, and robustness of the AMSCP pipeline as well as the ability to discover novel phenotypes. Taken together, we find AMSCP to be a valuable cost-effective method for both pre-clinical and clinical research."
Neural populations in macaque anterior cingulate cortex encode social image identities,"The anterior cingulate cortex gyrus (ACCg) has been implicated in prosocial behaviors and reasoning about social cues. While this indicates that ACCg is involved in social behavior, it remains unclear whether ACCg neurons also encode social information during goal-directed actions without social consequences. To address this, we assessed how social information is processed by ACCg neurons in a reward localization task. Here we show that neurons in the ACCg of female rhesus monkeys differentiate the identities of conspecifics in task images, even when identity was task-irrelevant. This was in contrast to the prearcuate cortex (PAC), which has not been strongly linked to social behavior, where neurons differentiated identities in both social and nonsocial images. Many neurons in the ACCg also categorically distinguished social from nonsocial trials, but this encoding was only slightly more common in ACCg compared to the PAC. Together, our results suggest that ACCg neurons are uniquely sensitive to social information that differentiates individuals, which may underlie its role in complex social reasoning."
Peds1 deficiency in zebrafish results in myeloid cell apoptosis and exacerbated inflammation,"Plasmalogens are glycerophospholipids with a vinyl ether bond that confers unique properties. Recent identification of the gene encoding PEDS1, the desaturase generating the vinyl ether bond, enables evaluation of the role of plasmalogens in health and disease. Here, we report that Peds1-deficient zebrafish larvae display delayed development, increased basal inflammation, normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell emergence, and cell-autonomous myeloid cell apoptosis. In a sterile acute inflammation model, Peds1-deficient larvae exhibited impaired inflammation resolution and tissue regeneration, increased interleukin-1β and NF-κB expression, and elevated ROS levels at the wound site. Abnormal immune cell recruitment, neutrophil persistence, and fewer but predominantly pro-inflammatory macrophages were observed. Chronic skin inflammation worsened in Peds1-deficient larvae but was mitigated by exogenous plasmalogen, which also alleviated hyper-susceptibility to bacterial infection, as did pharmacological inhibition of caspase-3 and colony-stimulating factor 3-induced myelopoiesis. Overall, our results highlight an important role for plasmalogens in myeloid cell biology and inflammation."
Identification of candidate genes and genomic prediction of soybean fatty acid components in two soybean populations,"Soybean, a source of plant-derived lipids, contains an array of fatty acids essential for health. A comprehensive understanding of the fatty acid profiles in soybean is crucial for enhancing soybean cultivars and augmenting their qualitative attributes. Here, 180 F10 generation recombinant inbred lines (RILs), derived from the cross-breeding of the cultivated soybean variety ‘Jidou 12’ and the wild soybean ‘Y9,’ were used as primary experimental subjects. Using inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM), this study undertook a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis on five distinct fatty acid components in the RIL population from 2019 to 2021. Concurrently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted on 290 samples from a genetically diverse natural population to scrutinize the five fatty acid components during the same timeframe, thereby aiming to identify loci closely associated with fatty acid profiles. In addition, haplotype analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis were performed to predict candidate genes. The QTL analysis elucidated 23 stable QTLs intricately associated with the five fatty acid components, exhibiting phenotypic contribution rates ranging from 2.78% to 25.37%. In addition, GWAS of the natural population unveiled 102 significant loci associated with these fatty acid components. The haplotype analysis of the colocalized loci revealed that Glyma.06G221400 on chromosome 6 exhibited a significant correlation with stearic acid content, with Hap1 showing a markedly elevated stearic acid level compared with Hap2 and Hap3. Similarly, Glyma.12G075100 on chromosome 12 was significantly associated with the contents of oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids, suggesting its involvement in fatty acid biosynthesis. In the natural population, candidate genes associated with the contents of palmitic and linolenic acids were predominantly from the fatty acid metabolic pathway, indicating their potential role as pivotal genes in the critical steps of fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, genomic selection (GS) for fatty acid components was conducted using ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction based on both random single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and SNPs significantly associated with fatty acid components identified by GWAS. GS accuracy was contingent upon the SNP set used. Notably, GS efficiency was enhanced when using SNPs derived from QTL mapping analysis and GWAS compared with random SNPs, and reached a plateau when the number of SNP markers exceeded 3,000. This study thus indicates that Glyma.06G221400 and Glyma.12G075100 are genes integral to the synthesis and regulatory mechanisms of fatty acids. It provides insights into the complex biosynthesis and regulation of fatty acids, with significant implications for the directed improvement of soybean oil quality and the selection of superior soybean varieties. The SNP markers delineated in this study can be instrumental in establishing an efficacious pipeline for marker-assisted selection and GS aimed at improving soybean fatty acid components."
Ssc-miR-101-3p inhibits hypoxia-induced apoptosis and inflammatory response in alveolar type-II epithelial cells of Tibetan pigs via targeting FOXO3,"Tibetan pigs are a unique swine strain adapted to the hypoxic environment of the plateau regions in China. The unique mechanisms underlying the adaption by Tibetan pigs, however, are still elusive. Only few studies have investigated hypoxia-associated molecular regulation in the lung tissues of animals living in the plateau region of China. Our previous study reported that ssc-miR-101-3p expression significantly differed in the lung tissues of Tibetan pigs at different altitudes, suggesting that ssc-miR-101-3p plays an important role in the adaptation of Tibetan pigs to high altitude. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism, in this study, the target genes of ssc-miR-101-3p and their functions were analyzed via various methods including qRT-PCR and GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. The action of ssc-miR-101-3p was investigated by culturing alveolar type-II epithelial cells (ATII) of Tibetan pigs under hypoxic conditions and transfecting ATII cells with vectors overexpressing or inhibiting ssc-miR-101-3p. Overexpression of ssc-miR-101-3p significantly increased the proliferation of ATII cells and decreased the expression of inflammatory and apoptotic factors. The target genes of ssc-miR-101-3p were significantly enriched in FOXO and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways required to mitigate lung injury. Further, FOXO3 was identified as a direct target of ssc-miR-101-3p. Interestingly, ssc-miR-101-3p overexpression reversed the damaging effect of FOXO3 in the ATII cells. In conclusion, ssc-miR-101-3p targeting FOXO3 could inhibit hypoxia-induced apoptosis and inflammatory response in ATII cells of Tibetan pigs. These results provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms elucidating the response of lung tissues of Tibetan pigs to hypoxic stress."

Preferences for Neurodevelopmental Follow-Up Care for Children: A Discrete Choice Experiment,"Identifying and addressing neurodevelopmental delays in children can be challenging for families and the healthcare system. Delays in accessing services and early interventions are common. The design and delivery of these services, and associated outcomes for children, may be improved if service provision aligns with families’ needs and preferences for receiving care. The aim of this study is to identify families’ preferences for neurodevelopmental follow-up care for children using an established methodology."
Rutin of Moringa oleifera as a potential inhibitor to Agaricus bisporus tyrosinase as revealed from the molecular dynamics of inhibition,"Tyrosinase is a binuclear copper-containing enzyme that catalyzes the conversation of monophenols to diphenols via o-hydroxylation and then the oxidation of o-diphenols to o-quinones which is profoundly linked to eukaryotic melanin synthesis and fruits browning. The hyperpigmentation due to unusual tyrosinase activity has gained growing health concern. Plants and their metabolites are considered promising and effective sources for potent antityrosinase enzymes. Hence, searching for potent, specific tyrosinase inhibitor from different plant extracts is an alternative approach in regulating overproduction of tyrosinase. Among the tested extracts, the hydro-alcoholic extract of Moringa oleifera L. leaves displayed the potent anti-tyrosinase activity (IC50 = 98.93 µg/ml) in a dose-dependent manner using L-DOPA as substrate; however, the kojic acid showed IC50 of 88.92 µg/ml. The tyrosinase-diphenolase (TYR-Di) kinetic analysis revealed mixed inhibition type for the Ocimum basilicum L. and Artemisia annua L. extracts, while the Coriandrum sativum L. extract displayed a non-competitive type of inhibition. Interestingly, the extract of Moringa oleifera L. leaves exhibited a competitive inhibition, low inhibition constant of free enzyme (\({\text{K}}_{\text{ii}}^{\text{app}}\)) value and no Pan-Assay Interfering Substances, hinting the presence of strong potent inhibitors. The major putative antityrosinase compound in the extract was resolved, and chemically identified as rutin based on various spectroscopic analyses using UV–Vis, FTIR, mass spectrometry, and 1H NMR. The in silico computational molecular docking has been performed using rutin and A. bisporus tyrosinase (PDB code: 2Y9X). The binding energy of the predicted interaction between tropolone native ligand, kojic acid, and rutin against 2Y9X was respectively − 5.28, − 4.69, and − 7.75 kcal/mol. The docking simulation results revealed the reliable binding of rutin to the amino acid residues (ASN260, HIS259, SER282) in the tyrosinase catalytic site. Based on the developed results, rutin extracted from M. oleifera L. leaves has the capability to be powerful anti-pigment agent with a potential application in cosmeceutical area. In vivo studies are required to unravel the safety and efficiency of rutin as antityrosinase compound."
Tropical Pacific trends explain the discrepancy between observed and modelled rainfall change over the Americas,"Understanding the causes for discrepancies between modelled and observed regional climate trends is important for improving present-day climate simulation and reducing uncertainties in future climate projections. Here, we analyse the performance of coupled climate models in reproducing regional precipitation trends during the satellite era. We find statistically significant observed drying in southwestern North America and wetting in the Amazon during the period 1979–2014. Historical climate model simulations do not capture these observed precipitation trends. We trace this discrepancy to the inability of coupled simulations to capture the observed Pacific trade wind intensification over this period. A linear adjustment of free running historical simulations, based on the observed strengthening of the Pacific trade winds and modeled ENSO teleconnections, explains the discrepancy in precipitation trends. Furthermore, both the Pacific trade wind trends and regional precipitation trends are reproduced in climate simulations with prescribed observed sea surface temperatures (SST), underscoring the role of the tropical Pacific SST patterns."
Stability for a System of the 2D Incompressible MHD Equations with Fractional Dissipation,"Several fundamental problems on the 2D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations with only magnetic diffusion (no velocity dissipation) remain open, especialy in the case when the spatial domain is the whole space \({\mathbb {R}}^2\). This paper establishes that, near a background magnetic field, any fractional dissipation in one direction in the velocity equation would allow us to establish the global existence and stability for perturbations near the background. The magnetic diffusion here is not required to be given by the standard Laplacian operator but any general fractional Laplacian with positive power."
Quantifying the jet energy loss in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC,"In this work, we give a method to study the energy loss of jets in the medium using a variety of jet energy loss observables such as nuclear modification factor and transverse momentum asymmetry in dijets and \(\gamma \)-jets in heavy ion collisions. The energy loss of jets in the medium depends mainly on the size and the properties of medium viz. temperature and is a function of energy of the jets as predicted by various models. A Monte Carlo (MC) method is employed to generate the transverse momentum and path-lengths of the initial jets that undergo energy loss. Using different scenarios of energy loss, the transverse momentum and system size dependence of nuclear modification factors and different measures of dijet momentum imbalance at energies \(\sqrt{s_{\textrm{NN}}}\) = 2.76 TeV and 5.02 TeV and \(\gamma \)-jet asymmetry at \(\sqrt{s_{\textrm{NN}}}\) =2.76 TeV in Pb+Pb collisions are simulated. The results are compared with the measurements by ATLAS and CMS experiments as a function of transverse momentum and centrality. The study demonstrates how the system size and energy dependence of jet energy loss can be quantified using various experimental observables."

Identification of variables and development of a prediction model for DIBH eligibility in left-sided breast cancer radiotherapy: a prospective cohort study with temporal validation,To identify variables associated with a patients’ ability to reproducibly hold their breath for deep-inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) radiotherapy (RT) and to develop a predictive model for DIBH eligibility.
An intronic copy number variation in Syntaxin 17 determines speed of greying and melanoma incidence in Grey horses,"The Greying with age phenotype in horses involves loss of hair pigmentation whereas skin pigmentation is not reduced, and a predisposition to melanoma. The causal mutation was initially reported as a duplication of a 4.6 kb intronic sequence in Syntaxin 17. The speed of greying varies considerably among Grey horses. Here we demonstrate the presence of two different Grey alleles, G2 carrying two tandem copies of the duplicated sequence and G3 carrying three. The latter is by far the most common allele, probably due to strong selection for the striking white phenotype. Our results reveal a remarkable dosage effect where the G3 allele is associated with fast greying and high incidence of melanoma whereas G2 is associated with slow greying and low incidence of melanoma. The copy number expansion transforms a weak enhancer to a strong melanocyte-specific enhancer that underlies hair greying (G2 and G3) and a drastically elevated risk of melanoma (G3 only). Our direct pedigree-based observation of the origin of a G2 allele from a G3 allele by copy number contraction demonstrates the dynamic evolution of this locus and provides the ultimate evidence for causality of the copy number variation of the 4.6 kb intronic sequence."
The ancestral environment of teosinte populations shapes their root microbiome,"The composition of the root microbiome affects the host’s growth, with variation in the host genome associated with microbiome variation. However, it is not known whether this intra-specific variation of root microbiomes is a consequence of plants performing targeted manipulations of them to adapt to their local environment or varying passively with other traits. To explore the relationship between the genome, environment and microbiome, we sampled seeds from teosinte populations across its native range in Mexico. We then grew teosinte accessions alongside two modern maize lines in a common garden experiment. Metabarcoding was performed using universal bacterial and fungal primers to profile their root microbiomes."
Ubiquitination of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 contributes to the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension mediated by neural precursor cell–expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 4-Like,"In this study, we investigated whether neural precursor cell–expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 4-like (NEDD4L) is the E3 enzyme of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and whether NEDD4L degrades ACE2 via ubiquitination, leading to the progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)."

Gender and age classification using ASMNet based facial fiducial detection and Jordan neural network,"A capacity to instantly determine someone's age and gender merely by looking at their face has made facial recognition technology essential. Among the difficulties faced by researchers in computer vision and also psychophysics are the observation of human faces and modeling of their characteristic traits. Due to inadequate face fiducial point detection and poor image quality, many of the methods that have been designed in existing models based on facial features for age and gender categorization still face some challenges. Hence, the Active Shape Model (ASMNET) based Jordan neural network was developed for facial fiducial detection. In this designed model, the facial images are considered as input. These images are pre-processed using cropping, center surrounds device normalization, optimized Gabor filter and logarithmic transformation. Based on the preprocessed data, facial fiducial points and distinct features are detected using ASMNet combined with Convolutional Neural Network. Using this primary facial detected landmarks such as eye, mouth, nose tip and lips are extracted for features using EfficientNetB7 and classified based on the Jordan neural network to categorize age and gender. Performance metrics for this designed model include Accuracy, Positive predictive value, Hit rate, Selectivity and Negative Predictive Value. The proposed models achieved performance metrics values are 93%, 87%, 89%, 94.82% and 92.32%. Gender and Age Classification using ASMNet based Facial Fiducial Detection and Jordan Neural Network is better than the existing model along with that using this prediction technique the possibility of error rate gets reduced and timely detection can be achieved."
The role of GABA in modulation of taste signaling within the taste bud,"Taste buds contain 2 types of GABA-producing cells: sour-responsive Type III cells and glial-like Type I cells. The physiological role of GABA, released by Type III cells is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the role of GABA released from Type III cells using transgenic mice lacking the expression of GAD67 in taste bud cells (Gad67-cKO mice). Immunohistochemical experiments confirmed the absence of GAD67 in Type III cells of Gad67-cKO mice. Furthermore, no difference was observed in the expression and localization of cell type markers, ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2 (ENTPD2), gustducin, and carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4) in taste buds between wild-type (WT) and Gad67-cKO mice. Short-term lick tests demonstrated that both WT and Gad67-cKO mice exhibited normal licking behaviors to each of the five basic tastants. Gustatory nerve recordings from the chorda tympani nerve demonstrated that both WT and Gad67-cKO mice similarly responded to five basic tastants when they were applied individually. However, gustatory nerve responses to sweet–sour mixtures were significantly smaller than the sum of responses to each tastant in WT mice but not in Gad67-cKO mice. In summary, elimination of GABA signalling by sour-responsive Type III taste cells eliminates the inhibitory cell–cell interactions seen with application of sour–sweet mixtures."
Structural and optical properties of Cr3+ doped SiO2 nanophosphor,"SiO2:x% Cr3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 8) nanopowder samples were synthesized using the sol-gel method. The effect of Cr3+ doping concentration on the SiO2 nanoparticles was studied for possible application in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Structure and optical properties of undoped and Cr3+ doped SiO2 nanoparticles were investigated in detail. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirmed the amorphous phase for undoped SiO2 (A-SiO2) nanopowder. However, above 0.8% Cr3+ there were secondary peaks due rhombohedral structure of chromium (III) oxide (R-Cr2O3). Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) spectra showed a reflectance peak at around 320 nm for the undoped sample. The results showed that when the concentration of Cr3+ is increased there was an emergence of reflectance peaks at around 309, 419, and 553 nm which were attributed to the presence of the Cr2O3 lattices. The photoluminescence (PL) results revealed that with an increase in the amount of Cr3+, the maximum peaks in blue and near red emerge at around 2.82 and 1.89 eV, respectively. Those peaks may be due to defects within both SiO2 and R-Cr2O3. The emission peaks of undoped and Cr3+ doped SiO2 match well with the Uv-vis results. The international illumination  colour chromaticity showed that above 0.8% Cr3+ the colour shifts from yellow to blue with an increase in Cr3+ concentration. The investigation indicated that Cr3+ doped SiO2 have a potential application in blue and yellow LED chips for lighting."
Cracking in compacted expansive soils under unidirectional wet-dry cycles: insights from X-ray computed tomography,"Cracking of compacted clays during cyclic wetting–drying poses significant challenges to the stability of channel slopes. This study performed a series of unidirectional wet-dry tests to evaluate the cracking behavior of expansive soils collected from a channel slope in northern Xinjiang, China. Using computed tomography scanning and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction, the internal crack characteristics of expansive soils were quantitatively described. The results indicate that the penetration depth of the cracks was stabilized after five cycles, reaching 31.4% of the initial specimen height. The morphologies of internal cracks revealed a transition in the cracking mode, form shallow and scattered cracks in the initial stage to deeper and more clustered cracks in the final stage. Centralized cracks were prominent in the first three wet-dry cycles, followed by a shift to crack deflection from the vertical plane in subsequent cycles. Four indices (i.e., slice crack ratio, crack length, branching number, and dead-end point) provided a satisfactory quantitative depiction of the evolution of the spatial distribution and connectivity of the cracks over the number of cycles. Additionally, the crack volume fraction and fractal dimension effectively evaluated the 3D cracking behavior of soil crack networks."
Eocene maar sediments record warming of up to 3.5 °C during a hyperthermal event 47.2 million years ago,"Eocene hyperthermal events reflect profound perturbations of the global carbon cycle. Most of our knowledge about their onset, timing, and rates originates from marine records. Hence, the pacing and magnitude of hyperthermal continental warming remains largely unaccounted for due to a lack of high-resolution climate records. Here we use terrestrial biomarkers and carbon isotopes retrieved from varved lake deposits of the UNESCO World Heritage site ‘Messel Fossil Pit’ (Germany) to quantify sub-millennial to millennial-scale temperature and carbon isotope changes across hyperthermal event C21n-H1 (47.2 million years ago). Our results show maximum warming of ca. 3.5 °C during C21n-H1. We propose that two components are responsible for the warming pattern across the hyperthermal: (1) the massive release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere-ocean system and (2) half-precession orbital forcing indicated by ~12.000-year temperature cycles. The carbon isotope record of bulk organic matter indicates a sharp, 7‰ decrease at the peak of the hyperthermal, corresponding to increased organic carbon content and a shift in the lake algal community. Collectively, our proxy data reveal the structure of continental temperature response during the hyperthermal event that is characterized by overall warming with a superimposed pattern of sub-orbital scale temperature fluctuations."
Tropical Pacific trends explain the discrepancy between observed and modelled rainfall change over the Americas,"Understanding the causes for discrepancies between modelled and observed regional climate trends is important for improving present-day climate simulation and reducing uncertainties in future climate projections. Here, we analyse the performance of coupled climate models in reproducing regional precipitation trends during the satellite era. We find statistically significant observed drying in southwestern North America and wetting in the Amazon during the period 1979–2014. Historical climate model simulations do not capture these observed precipitation trends. We trace this discrepancy to the inability of coupled simulations to capture the observed Pacific trade wind intensification over this period. A linear adjustment of free running historical simulations, based on the observed strengthening of the Pacific trade winds and modeled ENSO teleconnections, explains the discrepancy in precipitation trends. Furthermore, both the Pacific trade wind trends and regional precipitation trends are reproduced in climate simulations with prescribed observed sea surface temperatures (SST), underscoring the role of the tropical Pacific SST patterns."

Preferences for Neurodevelopmental Follow-Up Care for Children: A Discrete Choice Experiment,"Identifying and addressing neurodevelopmental delays in children can be challenging for families and the healthcare system. Delays in accessing services and early interventions are common. The design and delivery of these services, and associated outcomes for children, may be improved if service provision aligns with families’ needs and preferences for receiving care. The aim of this study is to identify families’ preferences for neurodevelopmental follow-up care for children using an established methodology."

Performance and Life Cycle Cost Analysis of Recycled Concrete Utilising Waste Clay Brick,"The increase of solid construction waste in the world is a serious problem affecting the environment. Many scholars have studied and developed methods for recycling construction waste, one of which is to use it as a substitute for natural aggregate in concrete materials. The goal of this research is to study the feasibility of using waste clay brick as recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) to prepare concrete and to evaluate the life cycle cost of using this recycled concrete. Four series of concrete samples with different substitution rates (0, 50, 70 and 100%) of natural coarse aggregate by RCA made from waste clay bricks were manufactured for this study. The workability, mechanical properties and thermal properties of the concrete samples were studied. Results showed that the strength of concrete prepared with recycled aggregates decreased, but it can basically meet the strength requirements of ordinary concrete. According to the results of strength and thermal performance, 70% is the optimal dosage for recycled aggregates. The life cycle cost of recycled concrete with recycled aggregate was then analysed based on production cost, transport cost and environmental cost. The findings indicated that the use of this recycled concrete material in concrete structures led to save transportation and environmental costs. It revealed that recycled concrete with a high replacement rate of recycled aggregate has more advantages in energy consumption and pollution gas emission. The study showed that it is feasible in technology and environment to produce sustainable recycled concrete using waste clay bricks."

Stability for a System of the 2D Incompressible MHD Equations with Fractional Dissipation,"Several fundamental problems on the 2D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations with only magnetic diffusion (no velocity dissipation) remain open, especialy in the case when the spatial domain is the whole space \({\mathbb {R}}^2\). This paper establishes that, near a background magnetic field, any fractional dissipation in one direction in the velocity equation would allow us to establish the global existence and stability for perturbations near the background. The magnetic diffusion here is not required to be given by the standard Laplacian operator but any general fractional Laplacian with positive power."

This study investigates the influence of socio-economic status (SES) on psychological well-being, with a particular focus on Anxiety Sensitivity (AS) and Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) among first-year medical students. Understanding the psychological dimensions affecting medical students is crucial for fostering a future medical workforce that is both capable and mentally healthy."
Antilisterial and antioxidant exopolysaccharide from Enterococcus faecium PCH.25 isolated from cow butter: characterization and probiotic potential,"Exopolysaccharides produced by lactic acid bacteria have gained attention for their potential health benefits and applications in functional foods. This study explores the isolation and characterization of a novel exopolysaccharide-producing strain from dairy products. The aim was to evaluate its probiotic potential and investigate the properties of the produced exopolysaccharide. A strain identified as Enterococcus faecium PCH.25, isolated from cow butter, demonstrated exopolysaccharide production. The study’s novelty lies in the comprehensive characterization of this strain and its exopolysaccharide, revealing unique properties with potential applications in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. The E. faecium PCH.25 strain exhibited strong acid tolerance, with a 92.24% viability rate at pH 2 after 2 h of incubation. It also demonstrated notable auto-aggregation (85.27% after 24 h) and co-aggregation abilities, antibiotic sensitivity, and absence of hemolytic activity, suggesting its probiotic potential. The exopolysaccharide produced by this strain showed bactericidal activity (MIC and MBC = 1.8 mg/ml) against Listeria monocytogenes and antioxidant properties (22.8%). Chemical analysis revealed a heteropolysaccharide composed of glucose and fructose monomers, with various functional groups contributing to its bioactivities. Physical characterization of the exopolysaccharide indicated thermal stability up to 270 °C, a negative zeta-potential (-27 mV), and an average particle size of 235 nm. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis revealed a smooth, nonporous structure primarily composed of carbon and oxygen, with an amorphous nature. These findings suggest that the exopolysaccharide from E. faecium PCH.25 has potential as a natural antibacterial and antioxidant polymer for use in functional foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals."
Building on and contributing to sustainability transitions research with qualitative system dynamics,"This paper explores the novel connection between qualitative system dynamics and sustainability transitions research. As the urgency for sustainable solutions intensifies, this interdisciplinary combination offers a promising avenue for addressing complex sustainability challenges. We reflect on recent research projects to establish the value of combining the two fields. We delve into the methodological and theoretical synergies, using examples to illustrate how the two fields can mutually benefit from each other. We find that qualitative system dynamics complements other sustainability transitions research approaches by encouraging (a) more inductive research that results in a broader system boundary than traditional sustainability transitions research frameworks and (b) higher endogeneity, which leads to a better appreciation of the feedback mechanisms that determine whether transitions succeed or not. This leads to an explicit reflection on assumptions that otherwise might remain hidden, and more explicit conceptualizations of the feedback mechanisms driving and hindering sustainability transitions and recommendations on navigating seemingly opposing interests that diminish when seeing the whole system. We also propose how future research can contribute to further cross-fertilization between the two fields, including the need for explicit positioning in terms of starting points, considering different philosophical paradigms, exploring combinations with other analytical approaches to foster change, and increasing reflection on the part of researchers, particularly in participative modes. We argue that the fusion of qualitative system dynamics with sustainability transitions research can significantly enhance our understanding and ability to manage complex sustainability issues, substantially contributing to both academic discourse and practical applications in sustainability transitions."
Quantifying the jet energy loss in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC,"In this work, we give a method to study the energy loss of jets in the medium using a variety of jet energy loss observables such as nuclear modification factor and transverse momentum asymmetry in dijets and \(\gamma \)-jets in heavy ion collisions. The energy loss of jets in the medium depends mainly on the size and the properties of medium viz. temperature and is a function of energy of the jets as predicted by various models.

The results are compared with the measurements by ATLAS and CMS experiments as a function of transverse momentum and centrality. The study demonstrates how the system size and energy dependence of jet energy loss can be quantified using various experimental observables."

"Sex-specific differences in the growth and population characteristics of Sand crab Ovalipes punctatus (De Haan, 1833) in coastal waters of Korea","The sex-specific differences in the growth and population characteristics of the high-commercial-value sand crab Ovalipes punctatus were investigated in Korea. The estimated allometric growth between the sexes showed significant differences in all morphometric measurements. In the classification of growth types, carapace width-chela length exhibited positive and negative allometric growth in males and females, respectively. Carapace width-abdominal width showed positive relative growth in both sexes, and orbital spine width exhibited negative relative growth in both sexes. Consequently, sexual dimorphism was evident in all measured traits. Growth parameters estimated using the ELEFAN function of the FiSAT II program indicated higher values in males compared to females. Asymptotic length (CW∞) for males was estimated at 139.2 mm, whereas for females it was 116.6 mm. Additionally, the growth coefficient (K) was higher in males (0.65) than in females (0.54), suggesting faster growth in males. The winter point (WP) was 1 for males and 0.7 for females, indicating slower growth in males during the colder December and slower growth in females during the spawning period in August. The modified von Bertalanffy growth curves indicated asymptotic growth in all sexes, and the growth performance index (φ') showed higher values in males (4.10) compared to females (3.87), reflecting differences in growth curves. The steady increase in recruitment rates from July to September was associated with the appearance of larvae and their subsequent growth into juveniles, leading to their recruitment into the population during this period. Therefore, O. punctatus exhibited sex-specific differences in growth parameters, suggesting distinct growth strategies between the sexes."
Orbital modulation of subtropical versus subantarctic moisture sources in the southeast Pacific mid-latitudes,"Reconstructing rainfall variability and moisture sources is a critical aspect to understand past and future hydroclimate dynamics. Here, we use changes in the deuterium content of land-plant leaf waxes from two marine sediment cores located off Chile to reconstruct changes in rainfall amount and variation in moisture sources over the last ~50 ka. The records indicate increased moisture in central Chile during precession maxima, but an obliquity modulation is evident in southern Chile. While the southern westerly winds are the dominant factor of precipitation in southern Chile by bringing moisture and perturbations from the extratropics, the subtropics represent an additional moisture source during precession maxima due to a stronger subtropical jet increasing moisture transport from the tropics to the mid-latitudes. These findings imply that a combination of orbital modulation of moisture sources and rainfall amount explains the last glacial moisture maximum and early Holocene moisture minimum in south-central Chile."
Structural basis for mouse LAG3 interactions with the MHC class II molecule I-Ab,"The immune checkpoint protein, Lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG3), binds Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II (MHC-II) and suppresses T cell activation. Despite the recent FDA approval of a LAG3 inhibitor for the treatment of melanoma, how LAG3 engages MHC-II on the cell surface remains poorly understood. Here, we determine the 3.84 Å-resolution structure of mouse LAG3 bound to the MHC-II molecule I-Ab, revealing that domain 1 (D1) of LAG3 binds a conserved, membrane-proximal region of MHC-II spanning both the α2 and β2 subdomains. LAG3 dimerization restricts the intermolecular spacing of MHC-II molecules, which may attenuate T cell activation by enforcing suboptimal signaling geometry. The LAG3-MHC-II interface overlaps with the MHC-II-binding site of the T cell coreceptor CD4, implicating disruption of CD4-MHC-II interactions as a mechanism for LAG3 immunosuppressive function. Lastly, antibody epitope analysis indicates that multiple LAG3 inhibitors do not recognize the MHC-II-binding interface of LAG3, suggesting a role for functionally distinct mechanisms of LAG3 antagonism in therapeutic development."
Effective weight optimization strategy for precise deep learning forecasting models using EvoLearn approach,"Time series analysis and prediction have attained significant attention from the research community in the past few decades. However, the prediction accuracy of the models highly depends on the models’ learning process. In order to optimize resource usage, a better learning methodology, in terms of accuracy and learning time, is needed. In this context, the current research work proposes EvoLearn, a novel method to improve and optimize the learning process of neural-based models. The presented technique integrates the genetic algorithm with back-propagation to train model weights during the learning process. The fundamental idea behind the proposed work is to select the best components from multiple models during the training process to obtain an adequate model. To demonstrate the applicability of EvoLearn, the method is tested on the state-of-the-art neural models (namely MLP, DNN, CNN, RNN, and GRU), and performances are compared. Furthermore, the presented study aims to forecast two types of time series, i.e. air pollution and energy consumption time series, using the developed framework. In addition, the considered neural models are tested on two datasets of each time series type. From the performance comparison and evaluation of EvoLearn using a one-tailed paired T-test against the conventional back-propagation-based learning approach, it was found that the proposed method significantly improves the prediction accuracy."
Biochar carbon nanodots for catalytic acetalization of biodiesel by-product crude glycerol to solketal: process optimization by RSM and life cycle cost analysis,"Carbon-based nanodots have garnered recent interest for their simple synthesis and versatile utility, ranging from biomedical to (opto) electronic applications, evolving into a tunable and biocompatible material. Here, for the first time, a biochar (lotus leaf) derived carbon nanodots was synthesized through hydrothermal carbonization. The synthesized hollow spherical biochar was engineered via functionalization by grafting –SO3H active sites. The attained catalyst was broadly analyzed by XRD, FTIR, TGA, BET, SEM–EDX, TEM, and XPS analysis after which it was applied for the acetalization reaction of crude glycerol (a biodiesel by-product) to form solketal, a potential fuel additive to valorize the large waste stream generated from biodiesel industry. Employing the RSM-CCD methodology, the experimental matrix was executed, and subsequent data were scrutinized through multiple regressions to model a quadratic equation. Under specific reaction parameters—a reaction duration of 14 min, a molar ratio of 7.5:1, and a catalyst loading of 5.7 wt.%, maximum solketal yield (95.7%) was attained through the ultrasonication method. Finally, to conclude, life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) for solketal production was studied here which determined the overall cost of solketal production per kilogram to be 0.719 USD ($), indicating high commercial applicability."

Automatic attack detection in IOT environment using relational auto encoder with enhanced ANFIS,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently become an important innovation in building smart environments. With any technology that relies on the Internet of Things model, security and privacy are seen as key issues. Many privacy and security concerns arise due to the various possibilities of intruders to attack the system. Due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of IoT devices and networks, we propose a novel approach for attack detection in IoT environments by combining two modifications based on the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). For the efficient extraction of features from input datasets, we use a Relational Auto Encoder (RAE) Network, followed by an enhanced version of the ANFIS model. ANFIS parameters have been optimized to use Gaussian kernel membership functions and the Enhanced Osprey optimization algorithm (EOOA) has been used to optimize initial ANFIS parameters. As part of the experimental analysis, two sets of datasets are used; these are NSL-KDD 99 and UNSW-NB15 datasets, which contain different kinds of attack labels such as DoS, probing, U2R, and R2L attacks. Performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure are used to assess the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. As a result of this approach, we have demonstrated promising results in identifying attackers for IoT security applications, while also offering robustness and scalability."
Developing a security enhancement for healthcare applications using blockchain-based firefly-optimized elliptic curve digital signature algorithm,"Presently the growing digitalization of healthcare systems implies appropriate safety measures that are necessary to protect sensitive patient data and the accuracy of medical records. During this paper, an individual blockchain-based security upgrade plan customized for healthcare applications is proposed. The blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that is secure and distributed. Initially, we gathered the healthcare dataset from standardization was used to create effective data partitioning and for image de-noising and quality improvement, blur-removal is first accomplished in raw samples using standardization. To suggest an encryption scheme that relies on blockchain technology to improve data transmission security, this study demonstrates the fundamentals of contemporary cryptography by introducing a revolutionary technique that enhances the integration of the Firefly optimized Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (FOECDSA) with lightweight advanced decryption. FOECDSA improves digital signature efficiency by optimizing elliptic curve parameters using the firefly method. Its use in healthcare systems enhances security and computational efficiency, guaranteeing strong protection of sensitive patient data in blockchain-based environments. In this study, Microsoft’s SQL server is used to manage and store structured data. The simulated results demonstrated that the suggested method’s enhanced identification outcomes, as measured by Encryption Time (22.27), decryption Time (22.76), Execution time (47.35), and Security Level (99) metrics, are compared to the existing methods. The enhanced encryption methodology is assessed and tested using particular standard parameters, and the suggested approach is contrasted with the current procedures."
Does parental involvement affect student academic motivation? A meta-analysis,"The impact of parents on academic achievement has been discussed for many years; however, less interest has been shown in whether their involvement in education influences students’ academic motivation. This study attempted to determine the overall impact of parental involvement on the academic motivation of students. The analysis was conducted by using data from 256 correlational values drawn from 37 studies involving 45,428 students. A meta-analysis was performed through the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Program. In the analysis process, the standardized mean difference, based on the random effect model, was employed as a measure of the mean effect size, and the Q statistic was used to assess the significance of the moderator variables. This study demonstrated that parental involvement exerted a small but significant overall impact on students’ academic motivation. Additionally the gender of the parents, country, school level and year of analyzed studies were identified as significant moderators in this relationship."
Facile engineering of interactive double network hydrogels for heart valve regeneration,"Regenerative heart valve prostheses are essential for treating valvular heart disease, which requested interactive materials that can adapt to the tissue remodeling process. Such materials typically involves intricate designs with multiple active components, limiting their translational potential. This study introduces a facile method to engineer interactive materials for heart valve regeneration using 1,1’-thiocarbonyldiimidazole (TCDI) chemistry. TCDI crosslinking forms cleavable thiourea and thiocarbamate linkages which could gradually release H2S during degradation, therefore regulates the immune microenvironment and accelerates tissue remodeling. By employing this approach, a double network hydrogel was formed on decellularized heart valves (DHVs), showcasing robust anti-calcification and anti-thrombosis properties post fatigue testing. Post-implantation, the DHVs could adaptively degrade during recellularization, releasing H2S to further support tissue regeneration. Therefore, the comprehensive endothelial cell coverage and notable extracellular matrix remodeling could be clearly observed. This accessible and integrated strategy effectively overcomes various limitations of bioprosthetic valves, showing promise as an attractive approach for immune modulation of biomaterials."
Hydrogen sulfide coordinates glucose metabolism switch through destabilizing tetrameric pyruvate kinase M2,"Most cancer cells reprogram their glucose metabolic pathway from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis for energy production. By reducing enzyme activity of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), cancer cells attain a greater fraction of glycolytic metabolites for macromolecule synthesis needed for rapid proliferation. Here we demonstrate that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) destabilizes the PKM2 tetramer into monomer/dimer through sulfhydration at cysteines, notably at C326, leading to reduced PKM2 enzyme activity and increased PKM2-mediated transcriptional activation. Blocking PKM2 sulfhydration at C326 through amino acid mutation stabilizes the PKM2 tetramer and crystal structure further revealing the tetramer organization of PKM2-C326S. The PKM2-C326S mutant in cancer cells rewires glucose metabolism to mitochondrial respiration, significantly inhibiting tumor growth. In this work, we demonstrate that PKM2 sulfhydration by H2S inactivates PKM2 activity to promote tumorigenesis and inhibiting this process could be a potential therapeutic approach for targeting cancer metabolism."
Identifying students with dyslexia: exploration of current assessment methods,"Early identification plays a crucial role in providing timely support to students with learning disabilities, such as dyslexia, in order to overcome their reading difficulties. However, there is significant variability in the methods used for identifying dyslexia. This study aimed to explore and understand the practices of dyslexia identification in the UK. A survey was conducted among 274 dyslexia professionals, including educational psychologists and dyslexia specialists, to investigate the types of assessments they employ, their approach to utilizing assessment data, their decision-making processes, and their conceptualization of dyslexia. Additionally, the study examined whether these professionals held any misconceptions or myths associated with dyslexia. Analysis of the survey data revealed substantial variability in how professionals conceptualize dyslexia, as well as variations in assessment methods. Furthermore, a significant proportion of the survey respondents subscribed to one or more misconceptions regarding dyslexia; the most common misconception identified among professionals was the belief that children with dyslexia read letters in reverse order. The findings highlight the need for standardized approaches to dyslexia identification and debunking prevailing misconceptions. The implications of these findings are discussed, emphasizing the importance of informed policy and practice in supporting students with dyslexia. Recommendations are provided to enhance consistency and accuracy in dyslexia identification, with the aim of facilitating early intervention and support for affected students."
The effect of social anxiety on student interactions in asynchronous online discussion forums as mediated by social presence and moderated by anonymity,"Pervasive internet use in higher education has rendered social anxiety a lesser problem in circumventing interactions. However, the attenuation of vitality in interactions still remains a contentious issue, especially in asynchronous online discussions. This study aims to elucidate how anonymity and social presence affect the relationship between avoidance of interaction and peer and content interaction in online discussions. In the true experimental study, we recruited 123 first-year university students, of which 62 were randomly assigned to the anonymous group, and 61 to the identified group. This paper adopts a moderated mediation model, in which anonymity and social presence are included as moderator and mediator, respectively. We revealed that the “straightforward” relationship between avoidance of interaction and peer and content interaction is actually highly complex. The results substantiate a full mediation of social presence and moderation of anonymity in favor of disclosed identity. This study accentuates the critical role of social presence in fostering interactions. The results also suggest that disclosing discussants’ identities might be useful during asynchronous interactions in online discussions for increasing social presence only if their avoidance of interaction is low; in the case of a high avoidance of interaction, anonymity should be preferred."
Effect of a Novel Somatic Avatar Training on Distress Tolerance Among Unhoused Men Recovering from Substance use Disorders: A Pilot Study,"Unhoused individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) and in recovery, who face environment-specific stress and challenges in tolerating negative affect, will likely benefit from brief, accessible interventions that target somatic awareness of emotions. This pilot study aimed to test the feasibility of somatic avatar (SA), a novel, movement-based interoceptive training, in improving distress tolerance among unhoused individuals with SUDs. Twenty-four males residing in a substance treatment facility were assigned to two conditions: SA (n = 12) and education control (EC; n = 12). The SA condition consisted of 1) two-hour emotion-focused yoga training, 2) each participant creating an avatar that visually represented their bodily/emotional states, which was then animated with their pre-recorded yoga movements, and 3) participants watching the animated avatar video. EC participants viewed emotion regulation educational videos of equivalent duration. Participants’ responses to the Distress Tolerance Scale and embodiment questions were collected at baseline and post-intervention. A mixed-model ANCOVA controlling for age, primary drug of choice, and negative feelings in the past week revealed a significant effect of SA in improving overall distress tolerance compared to EC, F(1,18) = 6.87, p = 0.017, partial \({\eta }^{2}\) = 0.28, with more improvements in the lower alexithymia subgroup. Exploratory analyses suggested avatar embodiment as a potential mechanism of SA. The current study provided preliminary evidence for the effect of SA in improving distress tolerance among individuals recovering from SUDs. Future studies with a larger, more diverse sample and more follow-ups are needed to extend the current findings."
Observing fish behavior in towed fishing gear—is there an influence of artificial light?,"Fish behavior is important to consider when developing selective fishing gear. In studies designed to investigate the size selective properties of towed fishing gears such as trawls, fish behavior is mainly documented by underwater video recordings. Because fishing gear can be operated at great depths or in other low light environments, artificial light is often required for underwater recordings. However, artificial light can influence fish behavior, which casts doubt on the validity of behavioral observations obtained in the presence of artificial light. However, removing artificial light disables video recordings and the possibility to study fish behavior in relation to selectivity devices towed fishing gears in low light environments. To date, little is known about the extent to which artificial light used for video observations affects fish behavior with respect to fishing gear. Therefore, we conducted fishing trials in the Barents Sea demersal trawl fishery to assess the effect of light sources on fish behavior by using size selectivity results in towed fishing gears. We found that the behavior of cod (Gadus morhua) was unaffected by the light sources, whereas the behavior of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), saithe (Pollachius virens) and redfish (Sebastes spp.) significantly changed when red light and white light were employed. Our results also demonstrated significant differences in fish behavior between white and red light."
Early biological markers of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"To understand the roles of acute-phase viral dynamics and host immune responses in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), we enrolled 136 participants within 5 days of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR test. Participants self-collected up to 21 nasal specimens within the first 28 days post-symptom onset; interviewer-administered questionnaires and blood samples were collected at enrollment, days 9, 14, 21, 28, and month 4 and 8 post-symptom onset. Defining PASC as the presence of any COVID-associated symptom at their 4-month visit, we compared viral markers (quantity and duration of nasal viral RNA load, infectious viral load, and plasma N-antigen level) and host immune markers (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-γ, MCP, IP-10, and Spike IgG) over the acute period. Compared to those who fully recovered, those reporting PASC demonstrated significantly higher maximum levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and N-antigen, burden of RNA and infectious viral shedding, and lower Spike-specific IgG levels within 9 days post-illness onset. No significant differences were identified among a panel of host immune markers. Our results suggest early viral dynamics and the associated host immune responses play a role in the pathogenesis of PASC, highlighting the importance of understanding early biological markers in the natural history of PASC."

Non-linear associations between night shifts and adverse events in nursing staff: a restricted cubic spline analysis,"Existing studies suggest that the number of night shifts may impact the occurrence of adverse events. However, while this relationship is well-documented, previous research has not thoroughly examined the non-linear associations between night shifts and adverse events among nursing staff, which remains a gap in our understanding."
Macrophage energy metabolism in cardiometabolic disease,"In a rapidly expanding body of literature, the major role of energy metabolism in determining the response and polarization status of macrophages has been examined, and it is currently a very active area of research. The metabolic flux through different metabolic pathways in the macrophage is interconnected and complex and could influence the polarization of macrophages. Earlier studies suggested glucose flux through cytosolic glycolysis is a prerequisite to trigger the pro-inflammatory phenotypes of macrophages while proposing that fatty acid oxidation is essential to support anti-inflammatory responses by macrophages. However, recent studies have shown that this understanding is oversimplified and that the metabolic control of macrophage polarization is highly complex and not fully defined yet. In this review, we systematically reviewed and summarized the literature regarding the role of energy metabolism in controlling macrophage activity and how that might be altered in cardiometabolic diseases, namely heart failure, obesity, and diabetes. We critically appraised the experimental studies and methodologies in the published studies. We also highlighted the challenging concepts in macrophage metabolism and identified several research questions yet to be addressed in future investigations."
F3DNN-Net: behaviours violence detection via fine-tuned fused feature based deep neural network from surveillance video,"Detecting violence in images has emerged as an important area of research and application as digital imaging and computer vision advance. Detecting and assessing violent content automatically in visual data holds great promise for enhancing public safety, security, and content moderation. Violent incidents are difficult to detect because of disruptions in optical flow, complications caused by camera aperture variations, and difficulties with illumination and feature tracking. In this work, a novel F3DNN-Net has been proposed for violence detection in images. The input videos from the surveillance camera are initially converted into frame sequences and pre-processed. The Yolov8 (You Only Look Once) algorithm is employed to detect objects within pre-processed frames. Simultaneously, the ego algorithm is applied to the pre-processed images for motion estimation, ensuring comprehensive coverage of information. Afterwards, the features are extracted using the fined feature extraction phase as independent component analysis (ICA), and the selected features are selected using the Dingo algorithm. Then, the fine-tuned fused (FF) features are implemented in the deep neural network (DNN) approach for the categorization of violent and non-violent cases. According to the findings, the proposed F3DNN-Net detects violence in images with an accuracy rate of 99.33%. The proposed DNN enhances an overall F1-score of 10.46%, 6.91%, and 4.44%, better than Alex Net, ResNet, and Dense Net. The proposed F3DNN-Net enhances the overall accuracy by 6%, 0.3%, and 29.33% better than Inception-Resnet-V2, CNN, LSTM, and ResNet50, respectively."
Photobiomodulation with near-infrared laser for tinnitus management: preliminary animal experiments and randomized clinical trials,"This study investigates the effectiveness of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) in treating chronic high-frequency tinnitus with the TINI device, a near-infrared (830 nm) laser. The study includes preliminary animal experiments with 28 mice and a randomized controlled trial with 56 participants to examine the functional and molecular changes in the auditory system that PBMT may cause. The animal model used sodium salicylate to induce tinnitus, followed by PBMT, which showed promising reductions in the behavioral evidence of tinnitus and a reversal of tinnitus-associated upregulation of vesicular glutamate transporters 2 expression in the ipsilateral dorsal cochlear nucleus (p < 0.05). In the clinical trial, participants with chronic high-frequency tinnitus received trans-tympanic application of the TINI device. The results did not show a significant difference in tinnitus score at the final time point when compared to the sham group. However, questionnaires revealed significant improvements in tinnitus symptoms and psychological outcomes following treatment with the TINI device compared to before treatment (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that while PBMT has potential benefits, its clinical effectiveness may be unclear due to its complex nature and interaction with other conditions. Further research is required to optimize treatment parameters and gain a complete understanding of the therapeutic potential of PBMT in managing tinnitus."

Chemical shift assignments of the α-actinin C-terminal EF-hand domain bound to a cytosolic C0 domain of GluN1 (residues 841–865) from the NMDA receptor,"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) consist of glycine-binding GluN1 and glutamate-binding GluN2 subunits that form tetrameric ion channels. NMDARs in the brain are important for controlling neuronal excitability to promote synaptic plasticity. The cytoskeletal protein, α-actinin-1 (100 kDa, called ACTN1) binds to the cytosolic C0 domain of GluN1 (residues 841–865) that may play a role in the Ca2+-dependent desensitization of NMDAR channels. Mutations that disrupt NMDAR channel function are linked to Alzheimer’s disease, depression, stroke, epilepsy, and schizophrenia. NMR chemical shift assignments are reported here for the C-terminal EF-hand domain of ACTN1 (residues 824–892, called ACTN_EF34) and ACTN_EF34 bound to the GluN1 C0 domain (BMRB numbers 52385 and 52386, respectively)."
"The Jinchang deposit, Ailaoshan Belt: overprint of Miocene orogenic gold mineralization on Triassic hydrothermal nickel sulfide mineralization","The Jinchang deposit, Ailaoshan Belt, is a hydrothermal gold-nickel deposit in which nickel mineralization formed during Triassic accretionary orogeny and gold mineralization during Miocene collisional orogeny. Although the nickel and gold orebodies largely overlap in an ophiolite melange at the contacts between ultramafic and metasedimentary sequences, nickel and gold concentrations have only a weak correlation in orebodies intersected in drill cores. The hydrothermal nickel sulfide ores are mainly concentrated at ultramafic-metasedimentary rock contacts. Broad alteration zones surround the contacts, with proximal quartz + clinochlore + magnesite in both rocks through quartz + fuchsite to distal muscovite + quartz assemblages in metasedimentary rocks. An apatite U–Pb age of 235.8 ± 1.8 Ma and a pyrite Re-Os age of 254 ± 21 Ma from the nickel mineralization indicate that it formed before the closure of the Ailaoshan Ocean. The As- and S-rich fluids during oceanic subduction leached Ni from the ultramafic rocks in the ophiolite melange forming the hydrothermal nickel sulfide ores. Orogenic gold mineralization comprises auriferous veins that host gold, Au- and Ag-rich sulfosalt. The veins cut the sulfides associated with nickel mineralization. The auriferous fluids reacted with nickel ore-stage pyrite forming porous or sieve-textures and patchy zoning in BSE images with native gold in pores. Geological and paleomagnetic evidence indicates that Miocene gold mineralization occurred in highly deformed Devonian metasedimentary rocks after the Oligocene–Miocene Ailaoshan sinistral shearing (~ 30 to 20 Ma). The auriferous fluids are most likely sourced from the metasomatized mantle lithosphere if Jinchang has a similar source to other orogenic gold deposits in the Ailaoshan Belt."
Fabrication of PMMA nanocomposite biomaterials reinforced by cellulose nanocrystals extracted from rice husk for dental applications,"The primary objective of global studies is to develop the properties and durability of polymers for various applications. When it comes to dental disability, denture base materials must have sufficient mechanical and tribological performance in order to withstand the forces experienced in the mouth. This work aims to investigate the effects of the addition of low content of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) on the mechanical and tribological performance of the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) nanocomposites. Different weight percent of CNC (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 wt%) were added to the PMMA matrix followed by ball milling to evenly distribute the nanoparticles reinforced phase in the matrix phase. The findings emphasize the significant impact of CNC integration on the performance of PMMA nanocomposites. By increasing the content of the CNC nanoparticles, the mechanical properties of PMMA were improved. In addition, the tribological outcomes demonstrated a significant reduction in the friction coefficient besides an enhancement in the wear resistance as the weight percentage of nanoparticles increased. The surface of the worn samples was investigated by utilizing SEM to identify the wear mechanisms corresponding to the different compositions. In addition, a finite elment model (FEM) was developed to ascertain the thickness of the worn layer and the generated stressed on the surfaces of the nanocomposite throughout the friction process."

Graph Fourier transform for spatial omics representation and analyses of complex organs,"Spatial omics technologies decipher functional components of complex organs at cellular and subcellular resolutions. We introduce Spatial Graph Fourier Transform (SpaGFT) and apply graph signal processing to a wide range of spatial omics profiling platforms to generate their interpretable representations. This representation supports spatially variable gene identification and improves gene expression imputation, outperforming existing tools in analyzing human and mouse spatial transcriptomics data. SpaGFT can identify immunological regions for B cell maturation in human lymph nodes Visium data and characterize variations in secondary follicles using in-house human tonsil CODEX data. Furthermore, it can be integrated seamlessly into other machine learning frameworks, enhancing accuracy in spatial domain identification, cell type annotation, and subcellular feature inference by up to 40%. Notably, SpaGFT detects rare subcellular organelles, such as Cajal bodies and Set1/COMPASS complexes, in high-resolution spatial proteomics data. This approach provides an explainable graph representation method for exploring tissue biology and function."
An integrated dataset of near-surface Eulerian fields and Lagrangian trajectories from an ocean model,"A dataset consisting of numerically simulated oceanic velocities and sea surface height changes, provided conjointly from Eulerian and Lagrangian points of view, is made available as cloud-optimized archives on a cloud storage platform for unrestricted access. The Eulerian component of the dataset comprises oceanic velocity components at 0 m and 15 m depth, as well as total and steric sea surface height changes, obtained at hourly time steps for one year, with an approximate horizontal resolution of 1/25 degree on an irregular global geographical spatial grid, from the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model. The Lagrangian component of the dataset comprises the trajectories of particles advected in the Eulerian velocity field of the model. The particles were advected forward and backward for 30 days from a regular 1/4 degree grid in order to achieve 60-day long trajectories at 0 m and 15 m depths, with start times separated by 30 days, in 11 releases. This integrated dataset may help to link Eulerian and Lagrangian observational perspectives."

A model-based assessment of social isolation practices for COVID-19 outbreak response in residential care facilities,"Residential aged-care facilities (RACFs, also called long-term care facilities, aged care homes, or nursing homes) have elevated risks of respiratory infection outbreaks and associated disease burden. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation policies were commonly used in these facilities to prevent and mitigate outbreaks. We refer specifically to general isolation policies that were intended to reduce contact between residents, without regard to confirmed infection status. Such policies are controversial because of their association with adverse mental and physical health indicators and there is a lack of modelling that assesses their effectiveness."
Quality assurance using quality indicators for prevention and early detection of cervical cancer in certified gynaecological dysplasia units and consultancies,Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. A successful screening concept for cervical cancer reduces the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer.

"Funding sources, colonial legacy, and new firms’ creation in Africa","This study examines the determinants of new firm creation in Africa, focusing on external and internal funding sources and their interactions. It also explores the influence of colonial history by separately analyzing former British and French colonies. The primary goal is to help fill crucial gaps in African literature on the determinants of entrepreneurship. Given Africa's widespread poverty and underdevelopment, understanding what drives entrepreneurship is essential for job creation and economic growth. The study reveals three key findings. First, at the full sample level, remittances are the only external financing source positively associated with new firm creation, while foreign aid and foreign direct investment obstacle it. Internal sources, like savings and credit, do not show significant effects. Second, the subsample analysis reveals heterogeneous results: former British colonies' funding sources align with the overall findings, while in former French colonies, only savings support entrepreneurship. Third, considering control variables, the subsample analysis indicates two distinct entrepreneurship models: opportunity-based in former British colonies and necessity-based in former French colonies. These findings are noteworthy and provide significant policy implications at both national and international levels. Crucially, the positive role of remittances in financing new business initiatives, confirms that migration serves as a mutually beneficial arrangement for both sending African countries and the host countries."
Carbon Leakage from Fuel Taxes: Evidence from a Natural Experiment,"We exploit a fuel tax increase in Portugal to identify its effect on cross-border fuel sales and associated carbon leakage in the Spanish border regions. Using a difference-in-difference strategy, we find that while gasoline sales remained unaffected, diesel sales in Spanish border regions increased by 6–9%. Synthetic control methods confirm these estimates and attribute this differential effect by fuel type to routes frequented by heavy-duty vehicles, with large diesel tanks. We estimate a carbon leakage equivalent to 14–20% of Portugal’s annual mitigation commitment for road transport emissions. Our findings imply that heavy goods vehicles’ strategic behavior undermines the potential mitigation effects and revenue gains of transport climate policy, underscoring the need for coordinated policies in similar federal or quasi-federal contexts."
Implementation of a novel adaptive coding using VLSI architecture for data compression in image processing,"Image Compression is one of the emerging techniques of a Digital System for storing and retrieving of digital information. The main challenge in implementing Image Compression is to maintain the accuracy of the retrieved data. As the encoding techniques used for data compression are computationally intensive, new hardware architectures are required so that the processing of image consumes less space with increase in computation speed, reduction in area and power consumption. In this paper we address this problem and developed a Dynamic Adaptive coding technique based on probability of occurrence,where the variable and fixed length code are fused to generate a code word for eliminating the extra bit encountered at the entropy coder. Here the Entropy code has a maximum search overhead of 6 match per 4-bit pattern. Wherein a maximum of 5-bit search is observed in proposed approach. This reduces a search overhead of (N⨉m)-1 iterations. Here N is the number of unique patterns and m is the block size. The proposed architecture is developed using Very high speed integrated circuit Hardware Descriptive Language (VHDL) and implemented using Xilinx Aldec’s Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The adaptive coding approach attains a compression of 35% more as compared to the entropy coding. The implementation on to a targeted Xilinx FPGA results in power minimization and area coverage reduction. The speed of operation is observed to be improved by 135 MHz. The validation of proposed approach is made on image data to observe the coding accuracy. The mean square error of the output image is reduced by 35% with an increase in the signal to noise ratio of the output image."
Assessment of river ecological status in the French West Indies based on diatom flora,"The Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires member states to routinely assess the river ecological status using community-based indices. However, there is still a lack of published WFD-compliant methods for the French West Indies, especially using diatom-based indices. Martinique and Guadeloupe exhibit diverse landscapes shaped by their complex geological history and tropical climatic conditions. These strong particularities make the existing indices developed for the European mainland unusable. Based on diatom sampling from to 2013 (607 samples) and through multivariate analyses, we developed the Indice Diatomique des Antilles (IDA). We first identified the key abiotic factors influencing diatom communities on both islands, and then characterized taxon sensitivity by considering their presence probability along a pressure gradient.. The index was based on the presence and relative abundance of these taxa in each sample. The last step consisted of using new data from the 2014–2022 sampling surveys (457 samples) as a validation dataset to verify IDA accuracy. Our results suggest that the IDA methodology is well designed to assess the ecological status of rivers in the West Indies."
"Tracking the burden, distribution, and impact of Post-COVID conditions in diverse populations for children, adolescents, and adults (Track PCC): passive and active surveillance protocols","Track PCC includes five geographic surveillance sites to conduct standardized population-based surveillance to estimate and track Post-COVID Conditions (PCC) by age, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, severity of initial infection, and risk factors among persons with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (based on the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologist [CSTE] case definitions for confirmed cases or laboratory-confirmed evidence of infection)."
A seismic source characterization model of multi-station based on graph neural network,"Seismic source characterization is a crucial part of earthquake early warning. With the increasing seismic stations and collected data, some deep learning methods are gradually introduced and perform well in earthquake magnitude evaluation and localization. However, how to handle the sparse and non-European multi-stations is still a problem in earthquake multi-station models. This paper designs a multi-station model based on a graph neural network to accomplish seismic source characterization. The model applies the methods of graph theory to represent earthquake data as graph structure and innovatively adds the earthquake phase picks into the edges of the graph. This method mines the potential information among multi-stations effectively. The proposed methods improve the predicting precision and perform better in real-time performance than the compared models."
Synergistic Antifungal Activity of Green Synthesized Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles and Fungicide Against Rhizoctonia solani Causing Rice Sheath Blight Disease,"The biosynthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles using leaf extract of medicinal plants is a promising substitute for the traditional chemical method. This work aimed to synthesize zinc oxide nanoparticles using a green approach from local “Dholkolmi” (Ipomoea carnea) leaf extract which is a medicinal plant growing outside the roads of different regions of Bangladesh. The biosynthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) were characterized using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, particle size analyzer, zeta-potential, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The results of UV-visible spectrophotometers observed an absorption peak at 373 nm wavelength, which confirmed the synthesis of ZnONPs in the solution. ZnONP sizes determined by XRD, DLS, and TEM are approximately ~37 nm, 105.61 nm, and 19.66 nm, respectively. ZnONPs were present because of the strong oxygen and zinc signals in the EDX profile. Additionally, this research assessed the antifungal activity of the biosynthesized ZnONPs and as well as folicur-incorporated ZnONPs against Rhizoctonia solani by the poison bait technique. According to the result of this study, ZnONPs synthesized from Ipomoea carnea leaf extract showed no promising result against Rhizoctonia solani mycelial growth reduction. But folicur-incorporated ZnONPs revealed a significant finding with a maximum 100% inhibition of mycelial growth at 1:1 and 3:1 ratio of ZnONPs with folicur fungicide under in vitro conditions. In the net house experiment, folicur-incorporated ZnONPs at a 1:1 ratio of ZnONPs with folicur showed considerable disease inhibition (26.96% RLH) as compared to disease control (52.83% RLH). In the case of rainfed transplanted Aus (March–June), the highest percentage of RLH was recorded in disease control (64.61%), and the lowest RLH was found in folicur (24.79%) followed by a 1:1 ratio of ZnONPs with folicur (32.10%) in field condition. On the other hand, the highest percentage of RLH was recorded in disease control (65.31%) and the lowest RLH was found in folicur (18.14%) followed by a 1:1 ratio of ZnONPs with folicur (21.39%) in rainfed transplanted Aman (July–November) season. The findings of the in vitro and in vivo studies provided evidence that ZnONPs and folicur had a strong synergistic antifungal impact and may be employed as a possible rice sheath blight disease management agent."
Source leaves are regulated by sink strengths through non-coding RNAs and alternative polyadenylation in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.),"The yield of major crops is generally limited by sink capacity and source strength. Cucumber is a typical raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs)–transporting crop. Non-coding RNAs and alternative polyadenylation (APA) play important roles in the regulation of growth process in plants. However, their roles on the sink‒source regulation have not been demonstrated in RFOs–translocating species."
Genotypic variation in blueberry flower morphology and nectar reward content affects pollinator attraction in a diverse breeding population,"Pollination is crucial to obtaining optimal blueberry yield and fruit quality. Despite substantial investments in seasonal beekeeping services, blueberry producers consistently report suboptimal pollinator visitation and fruit set in some cultivars. Flower morphology and floral rewards are among the key factors that have shown to contribute to pollinator attraction, however little is known about their relative importance for improving yield in the context of plant breeding. Clarifying the relationships between flower morphology, nectar reward content, pollinator recruitment, and pollination outcomes, as well as their genetic components, can inform breeding priorities for enhancing blueberry production. In the present study, we measured ten flower and nectar traits and indices of successful pollination, including fruit set, seed count, and fruit weight in 38 southern highbush blueberry genotypes. Additionally, we assessed pollinator visitation frequency and foraging behavior over two growing seasons. Several statistical models were tested to optimize the prediction of pollinator visitation and pollination success, including partial least squares, BayesB, ridge-regression, and random forest."
Valley polarization of electrons in a graphene under modulations of the electrostatic potential barrier and the magnetic field,"The valley polarization is a fundamental concept in valleytronic applications. However, the combined effects of the electrostatic potential barrier and the magnetic field as well as strains on the valley polarization in a graphene have been rarely reported. Therefore, in this paper, we use the transfer-matrix method to illustrate effects of the height and width of the electrostatic barrier and the strength of the applied magnetic field on the valley polarization of electrons in a graphene, and we find that the valley polarization strongly depends on the strength and width of the electrostatic barrier. We also find that the 100% valley polarization can be achieved continuously and smoothly over a wide range of Fermi energy region by controlling the strength of the applied magnetic field. This point makes it easier to design novel valleytronic devices based on graphene with the presence of the magnetic field and the electrostatic potential barrier as well as strains."
"MiR-122, miR-133a, and miR-206 as potential biomarkers for post-mortem interval estimation",Accurate estimation of post-mortem interval (PMI) is crucial in forensic investigations. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that remain relatively stable within the cell nucleus despite post-mortem changes.
Investigation of microstructural and electrochemical behavior of chromized-doped layers with variant magnesium concentrations,"This study provides an innovative approach about chromized-doped layers by discovering the optimal proportion of Mg (1 wt.%, 2 wt.%, and 3 wt.%) used as doping elements in order to enhance diffusion and stabilize the formed chromium oxide during the diffusion process. Our main objective is to evaluate the effect of Mg doping on the microstructural and the electrochemical behavior of the doped layer, systematically evaluating the impact of simultaneous variation of NH4Cl activator. The chromized-doped layers were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with EDX analysis. The doped layers were tested in 3.5% NaCl solution, and then were characterized by electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA). The results revealed that doping contributed to the improvement of chromium diffusion for all the layers (≥ 96% Cr), stabilizing chromium oxide by forming a more stable oxide (MgCr2O4). However, Cr-Mg/1 wt.% showed the most homogenous crystalline structure and topography compared to the other layers, with the most insignificant defects. The Cr-Mg/1 wt.% presented an excellent corrosion resistance in the 3.5% NaCl solution, where its surface did not suffer any type of corrosion or damages. In addition, the balanced value of the activator (NH4Cl) relative to the other doped layers may play a significant role. As a result, the Cr-Mg/1 wt.% (using 4 wt.% NH4Cl) could be a robust and innovative surface, paving the way for new possibilities in the field of chromizing coatings."
The developmental course of adolescent paranoia: a longitudinal analysis of the interacting role of mistrust and general psychopathology,"Paranoia is the erroneous idea that people are targeting you for harm, and the cognitive model suggests that symptoms increase with emotional and relational distress. A factor potentially associated with paranoia is mistrust, a milder form of suspiciousness. This study investigated the longitudinal course of non-clinical paranoia in a sample of 739 students (age range 10–12 at baseline assessment, 12–14 at second assessment) using data from the Social Mistrust Scale (SMS) and the paranoia subscale of the Specific Psychotic Experiences Questionnaire (SPEQ). Prevalence of mistrustful and high paranoia children was 14.6 and 15% respectively. Independently, baseline internalizing symptoms (b = 0.241, p < 0.001) and mistrust (b = 0.240, p < 0.001) longitudinally predict paranoia after controlling for confounders. The interaction of mistrust and internalizing symptoms at T1 increases the possibility of the onset of paranoia at T2. Therefore, the effect of mistrust on paranoia is more marked when internalizing symptoms are higher. Our results confirm the role of mistrust as a factor involved in the developmental trajectory of paranoia in adolescence, enhanced by the presence of internalizing symptoms. The implications of these results are both theoretical and clinical, as they add developmental information to the cognitive model of paranoia and suggests the assessment and clinical management of mistrust and internalizing symptoms in youth may be useful with the aim of reducing the risk of psychotic experiences."
Anti-RGS8 paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia is preferentially associated with a particular subtype of Hodgkin’s lymphoma,"Ataxia with anti-regulator of G-protein signaling 8 autoantibodies (RGS8-Abs) is an autoimmune disease recently described in four patients. The present study aimed to identify other patients with RGS8-Abs, describe their clinical features, including the link between RGS8-related autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (ACA) and cancer. Patients with RGS8-Abs were identified retrospectively in the biological collections of the French Reference Center for Paraneoplastic Neurological Syndrome and the University of California San Francisco Center for Encephalitis and Meningitis. Clinical data were collected, and cerebrospinal fluid, serum, and tumor pathological samples were retrieved to characterize the autoantibodies and the associated malignancies. Only three patients with RGS8-Abs were identified. All of them presented with a pure cerebellar ataxia of mild to severe course, unresponsive to current immunotherapy regimens for ACA. Two patients presented with a Hodgkin lymphoma of the rare specific subtype called nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, with very mild extension. Autoantibodies detected in all patients enriched the same epitope on the RGS8 protein, which is an intracellular protein physiologically expressed in Purkinje cells but also ectopically expressed specifically in lymphoma cells of patients with RGS8-related ACA. The present results and those of the four cases previously described suggest that RGS8-Abs define a new paraneoplastic neurological syndrome of extreme rarity found mostly in middle-aged males that associates pure cerebellar ataxia and a particular lymphoma specifically expressing the RGS8 antigen. As in other paraneoplastic ACA with intracellular antigen, the disease course is severe, and patients tend to exhibit a poor response to immune therapy."
Flux Filling Rate Effect on Weld Bead Deposition of Recycled Titanium Chip Tubular Wire,"TiC-reinforced composite coatings were fabricated in situ on carbon steel plates using flux-cored arc welding with tubular wire. The flux was composed of titanium powder recycled from chips generated during the machining process. The microstructure of the welded deposits was formed using various metal strip thicknesses to fabricate the wires, resulting in different flux fill values. During welding, titanium chips melted and reacted with carbon to form TiC. The complex in situ-formed phases were beneficial for improving the coating properties. Results indicated that the microhardness of the composite coatings using a greater quantity of flux was enhanced to over four times that of the substrate. More TiC resulted in better hardness values with increased amounts of flux. However, using thick metal strips reduces the flux supply, thereby diminishing the formation of a wear-resistant microstructure."
Biogeochemical evidence of the Oligocene and late Miocene–Pleistocene climatic variability from two deep sediment cores of the South China Sea,"Organic geochemical and stable isotope records of Oligocene and late Miocene–Pliocene sediments from IODP hole U1501C and Pliocene–Pleistocene sediments from U1499A of South China Sea (SCS) were studied to investigate clock sources of organic matter and carbonates and their spatiotemporal variations with East Asian climatic variability.  Geochemical data was constrained using shipboard information. CaCO3 and total organic carbon contents (wt%) varied between 1.32 to 56.52 and 0.12 to 1.13, respectively. δ13Ccarb, δ18Ocarb and δ13Corg ranged from −4.89 to 1.98‰, −5.54 to 1.96‰, and −24.66 to −28.13‰, respectively. Contributions from mixed sources of carbon were observed in the Oligocene, while the late Miocene–Pleistocene exhibited terrestrial dominance. Early Oligocene carbonate, low and higher TOC are attributed to the opening of SCS, increased terrigenous input, and prevalence of cooler climate. Stable isotopes suggest the expansion of the marine environment and the probable dawning of the East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) during the Oligocene. The late Oligocene marked a transition to a warmer climate. The strengthening of EAWM since the late Miocene is indicated by moderate organic carbon and high carbonates with enriched isotopes. Glacial low sea levels and higher terrestrial inputs increased TOC, while dissolution affected late Plio–early Pleistocene carbonates. Higher carbonates and productivity since the mid-Pleistocene were influenced by alternate weakening and strengthening of EAWM."
Preclinical characterization of [18F]D2-LW223: an improved metabolically stable PET tracer for imaging the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) in neuroinflammatory rodent models and non-human primates,"Positron emission tomography (PET) targeting translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) can be used for the noninvasive detection of neuroinflammation. Improved in vivo stability of a TSPO tracer is beneficial for minimizing the potential confounding effects of radiometabolites. Deuteration represents an important strategy for improving the pharmacokinetics and stability of existing drug molecules in the plasma. This study developed a novel tracer via the deuteration of [18F]LW223 and evaluated its in vivo stability and specific binding in neuroinflammatory rodent models and nonhuman primate (NHP) brains. Compared with LW223, D2-LW223 exhibited improved binding affinity to TSPO. Compared with [18F]LW223, [18F]D2-LW223 has superior physicochemical properties and favorable brain kinetics, with enhanced metabolic stability and reduced defluorination. Preclinical investigations in rodent models of LPS-induced neuroinflammation and cerebral ischemia revealed specific [18F]D2-LW223 binding to TSPO in regions affected by neuroinflammation. Two-tissue compartment model analyses provided excellent model fits and allowed the quantitative mapping of TSPO across the NHP brain. These results indicate that [18F]D2-LW223 holds significant promise for the precise quantification of TSPO expression in neuroinflammatory pathologies of the brain."
Vision Transformer Based Effective Model for Early Detection and Classification of Lung Cancer,"This study explores the worldwide effects of lung cancer and its early detection and diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models are quite popular among researchers in this field for early detection of lung cancer. Histopathology images are one of the popular means for diagnosis and detection of lung cancer. The present work encompasses the Vision Transformer (ViT) based model to classify lung cancer based on histopathological images. The proposed ViT-based model has been shown to have a promising impact in deciphering complex spatial relationships within image data. The proposed model has been validated by a publically available database, namely the LC25000 dataset, which contains lung and colon cancer histopathology images with variations in tissue types. The primary intuition behind using this ViT is to freeze the pre-trained ViT layers as a feature extractor and perform classification tasks by adding a new classification head. The model has been tested with various patch sizes during the model training. The proposed method achieved the best accuracy of 98.84% when the patch size was set to 16 × 16. Furthermore, the efficiency of the proposed work has been tabulated and compared work with existing work."
Care-experienced young people’s views and experiences of accessing general practice and dental services and attending health reviews in England: a qualitative study,Children in care and care leavers have worse health outcomes than their peers without care experience. This study addresses an evidence gap in exploring care-experienced young people’s views and experiences of accessing general practice and dental services and attending health reviews in England.
CT-based radiomics for predicting breast cancer radiotherapy side effects,"Skin inflammation with the potential sequel of moist epitheliolysis and edema constitute the most frequent breast radiotherapy (RT) acute side effects. The aim of this study was to compare the predictive value of tissue-derived radiomics features to the total breast volume (TBV) for the moist cells epitheliolysis as a surrogate for skin inflammation, and edema. Radiomics features were extracted from computed tomography (CT) scans of 252 breast cancer patients from two volumes of interest: TBV and glandular tissue (GT). Machine learning classifiers were trained on radiomics and clinical features, which were evaluated for both side effects. The best radiomics model was a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) classifier, using TBV features, predicting moist cells epitheliolysis, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.74. This was comparable to TBV breast volume (AUROC of 0.75). Combined models of radiomics and clinical features did not improve performance. Exclusion of volume-correlated features slightly reduced the predictive performance (AUROC 0.71). We could demonstrate the general propensity of planning CT-based radiomics models to predict breast RT-dependent side effects. Mammary tissue was more predictive than glandular tissue. The radiomics features performance was influenced by their high correlation to TBV volume."
NOD alleles at Idd1 and Idd2 loci drive exocrine pancreatic inflammation,"Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously develop autoimmune diabetes and have enabled the identification of several loci associated with diabetes susceptibility, termed insulin-dependent diabetes (Idd). The generation of congenic mice has allowed the characterization of the impact of several loci on disease susceptibility. For instance, NOD.B6-Idd1 and B6.NOD-Idd1 congenic mice were instrumental in demonstrating that susceptibility alleles at the MHC locus (known as Idd1) are necessary but not sufficient for autoimmune diabetes progression. We previously showed that diabetes resistance alleles at the Idd2 locus provide significant protection from autoimmune diabetes onset, second to Idd1. In search of the minimal genetic factors required for T1D onset, we generated B6.Idd1.Idd2 double-congenic mice. Although the combination of Idd1 and Idd2 is not sufficient to induce diabetes onset, we observed immune infiltration in the exocrine pancreas of B6.Idd2 mice, as well as an increase in neutrophils and pancreatic tissue fibrosis. In addition, we observed phenotypic differences in T-cell subsets from B6.Idd1.Idd2 mice relative to single-congenic mice, suggesting epistatic interaction between Idd1 and Idd2 in modulating T-cell function. Altogether, these data show that Idd1 and Idd2 susceptibility alleles are not sufficient for autoimmune diabetes but contribute to inflammation and immune infiltration in the pancreas."
Characteristics of 3D coupled map lattice and its application in pseudo-random number generator,"Coupled map lattice (CML), as a classical model of the higher-dimensional chaotic system, possesses outstanding chaotic dynamic behavior both at time and space. Compared with one-dimensional CML and two-dimensional CML, three-dimensional (3D) CML has more complicated chaotic behavior, and it is pretty suitable for designing chaos-based cryptographic schemes. In this paper, foremost, theoretical mathematical expressions of Lyapunov exponent (LE) and synchronization stability in the 3D CML model are deeply and comprehensively obtained, which guide the parameters setting to keep the model in the fully chaotic state and avoid synchronization state. Also, other chaotic behaviors such as bifurcation, ergodicity, and probability density distribution are analyzed, and all of those demonstrate the 3D CML model has complex chaotic performance. Furthermore, according to the 3D CML model and theoretical results, a novel pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) has been proposed with safety assurance via the simple interception operation. Finally, large amounts of simulations verify the theoretical results are correct and our proposed PRNG scheme possesses outstanding performance. Finally, the 3D CML model is extended into the ND CML one, LE expression is also derived. Above all, our research can provide some theoretical guidance for using the CML model (i.e. 3D CML and ND CML) as a core component to construct chaos-based cryptographic schemes, and it owns well potential application."
On the Non-identity Causal Theory of Spacetime from Causal Set Theory,"The aim to provide a causal theory of spacetime is not new. The overall program, however, was largely deemed unsuccessful, chiefly due to criticism voiced by Smart (Monist 53:385–395, 1969), Nerlich (Br J Philos Sci 33(4):361–388, 1982) and Earman (Synthese 24:74–86, 1972). Recently, Baron and Le Bihan (Noûs 58:202–224, 2023) have argued that developments in contemporary physics should make us reconsider this verdict. More precisely, they argue the emergence of spacetime from causal set theory (CST), where “the metric structure of spacetime can be recovered from its causal structure” (Baron and Le Bihan 2023, 2), “suggests a very natural way to reformulate the causal theory of spacetime” (ibid., 9)—an account which they end up dubbing the non-identity causal theory. This paper questions the success of Baron and Le Bihan’s non-identity theory. It is shown that (1) the specific grounding Baron and Le Bihan propose for timelike and spacelike relations is not plausible even when charitably reconstructed; and (2) that a causal theory of spacetime based on general relativity is just as successful for establishing a non-identity theory as a theory based on CST. In short then, we argue that the causal theory of spacetime proposed by Baron and Le Bihan is supported just as well (or badly) by the physics that already took centre stage in the original discussions of the causal theory of spacetime."
Circ_0008315 promotes tumorigenesis and cisplatin resistance and acts as a nanotherapeutic target in gastric cancer,"Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is one of the fundamental therapeutic modalities for gastric cancer (GC). Chemoresistance to cisplatin is a great clinical challenge, and its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in the pathophysiology of multiple human malignancies."
Towards an ecological transition from below: insights from a workers' mobilization in the automotive sector,"This article aims to shed light on the processes and conditions that enable workers to maintain employment stability and wage security while reorganizing production to effectively address the ongoing climate crisis. By thoroughly analysing a case of workers' mobilization within the automotive sector at the GKN plant in Campi Bisenzio (Florence—Italy), we underline the conditions under which workers may support a transformative ecological transition. Their campaign has rapidly become emblematic of a national movement that integrates social and environmental concerns. Through qualitative analysis of social media content, self-produced documents, and in-depth interviews, we illustrate how these workers, by stepping into a gap left by both the state and the market, have advocated for a credible and radical bottom-up transition plan. This plan challenges the power imbalances within the production system and positions workers and the local community as key stakeholders in plant management, as well as guardians of the local territory and its environment. Their organizational model and identity, strategic alliances, and the specific territorial context in which they operate are conducive to this endeavour."
Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-15 regulates adipogenesis in human SGBS cells,"Adipogenesis involves intricate molecular mechanisms regulated by various transcription factors and signaling pathways. In this study, we aimed to identify factors specifically induced during adipogenesis in the human preadipocyte cell line, SGBS, but not in the mouse preadipocyte cell line, 3T3-L1. Microarray analysis revealed distinct gene expression profiles, with 1460 genes induced in SGBS cells and 1297 genes induced in 3T3-L1 cells during adipogenesis, with only 297 genes commonly induced. Among the genes uniquely induced in SGBS cells, we focused on GALNT15, which encodes polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-15. Its expression increased transiently during adipogenesis in SGBS cells but remained low in 3T3-L1 cells. Overexpression of GALNT15 increased mRNA levels of CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBPα) and leptin but had no significant impact on adipogenesis in SGBS cells. Conversely, knockdown of GALNT15 suppressed mRNA expression of adipocyte marker genes, reduced lipid accumulation, and decreased the percentage of cells with oil droplets. The induction of C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ during adipogenesis was promoted or suppressed in SGBS cells subjected to overexpression or knockdown of GALNT15, respectively. These data suggest that polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-15 is a novel regulatory molecule that enhances adipogenesis in SGBS cells."
B4GALT5 a sialylation-related genes associated with patient prognosis and immune microenvironment in ovarian cancer and pan-cancer,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is the predominant primary tumor in the human reproductive system. Abnormal sialylation has a significant impact on tumor development, metastasis, immune evasion, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. B4GALT5, a gene associated with sialylation, plays a crucial role in ovarian cancer, and may potentially affect clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis."
Dynamic change of acetabular component position in total hip arthroplasty based on the spinopelvic classification: a prospective radiographic study,Recent studies have proposed optimizing the position of the acetabular component based on spinal deformity and stiffness classification to avoid mechanical complication after total hip arthroplasty (THA). The aim of this study was to characterize the dynamic changes in cup alignment post-THA based on the spinopelvic classification and to evaluate the efficacy of cup placement of preventing dislocation.
"From rule-based models to deep learning transformers architectures for natural language processing and sign language translation systems: survey, taxonomy and performance evaluation","With the growing Deaf and Hard of Hearing population worldwide and the persistent shortage of certified sign language interpreters, there is a pressing need for an efficient, signs-driven, integrated end-to-end translation system, from sign to gloss to text and vice-versa. There has been a wealth of research on machine translations and related reviews. However, there are few works on sign language machine translation considering the particularity of the language being continuous and dynamic. This paper aims to address this void, providing a retrospective analysis of the temporal evolution of sign language machine translation algorithms and a taxonomy of the Transformers architectures, the most used approach in language translation. We also present the requirements of a real-time Quality-of-Service sign language machine translation system underpinned by accurate deep learning algorithms. We propose future research directions for sign language translation systems."
Application of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) passive samplers for monitoring PAHs in groundwater,"Equilibrium passive sampling continues to find increasing use for performing in situ assessments and monitoring of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs). Although this method has been successfully used in several field studies including open surface waters and sediments, comparatively, their use in groundwater has been very limited. In this study, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) passive samplers were deployed for 80 days in three groundwater wells contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Prior to deployment, LDPE was loaded with performance reference compounds (PRCs) consisting of deuterated PAHs and their release used to ascertain system equilibrium. Within the 80-day deployment period, LDPE-groundwater equilibrium was confirmed for PAHs with molecular weights (MWs) in the range of 178 to 228 (i.e. anthracene, chrysene). Measured freely dissolved concentrations (Cw) were between one to three orders of magnitude lower than the total filtered concentrations (Ctotal) in the studied wells. The sum of PAHs (ΣPAHs) measured based on Cw and Ctotal were 2.05, 0.07 and 29.2 μg L−1 and 197, 59.7 and 1010 μg L−1, at wells 1, 2 and 3, respectively. A separate dataset, comprising long-term (2010 to 2022) concentrations of PAHs in total (i.e., unfiltered) groundwater, is also presented to provide insight into PAH contamination levels at the assessed groundwater wells based on conventional measurement. Estimated in situ LDPE daily clearance volumes (2.34 to 27.56 Ld−1) for the target analytes were far less than the daily turnover of ground water (144 to 348 Ld−1) encountered in the wells eliminating the possibility of depletive sampling of the groundwater by the passive samplers. These results represent the first published study on the practical application of equilibrium passive sampling using LDPE for monitoring and quantitatively assessing PAHs in groundwater. Also, this work demonstrates that LDPEs are a useful tool for measuring the Cw of PAHs in groundwater, a critical contaminant in many ecological and human health risk assessments."
Policy spillovers from climate actions to energy poverty: international evidence,"Policies to address climate change have been implemented worldwide in recent years. The core of these policies is to control greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which primarily stem from the consumption of fossil fuels. Consequently, the implementation of climate policies can affect other energy-related issues, such as energy poverty, a critical element of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper uses cross-country data from 2000 to 2020 to study the possible policy spillovers from climate actions to energy poverty. We show that a spillover effect does exist. In other words, a higher number of climate policies is associated with a lower level of energy poverty. The spillover is realized through improvements in energy efficiency, the promotion of renewable energy, and support for innovations. In addition, legislative policies are found to have stronger spillover effects. While the overall policy effects are positive for executive policies, regulations tend to have negative impacts on energy development. There is also evidence demonstrating heterogeneous effects between long-term and short-term policies, and between developed and developing countries. Discovering this spillover effect gives extra motivation for countries to adopt climate policies and actively seek synergies in achieving broader sustainable goals."
Fabrication of highly efficient flame-retardant and biocompatible ramie fabrics through covalent bonding and layer-by-layer assembly methods,"Ramie fibers have poor flame-retardant properties, which limits their application. To improve the flame-retardant properties of ramie fabric (RF), a durable flame-retardant coating was successfully realized on RF by combining covalent bonding and electrostatic adsorption. Si/P/N flame-retardant coatings were constructed on RF using cationic polyethyleneimine (PEI) and anionic sodium hexametaphosphate (PSP) via the layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly approach with the introduction of 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) as an organic cross-linker. Compared with the untreated RF samples, the fabrics treated with the flame-retardant coating PEI/PSP via the LBL method presented reductions of 51.06%, 48.30%, and 40.05% in the fire growth rate, peak heat release rate, and total heat release, respectively, in the cone calorimeter test. In addition, at a weight gain of 31.57%, the fabric self-extinguished in the UL-94 test within 10 s after leaving the ignition source, resulting in a damaged length of 6.13 cm. G-3 retained the limiting oxygen index (LOI) of 26.40% after 6 laundering cycles (LCs). The TG results revealed that the char residue of G-3 at 800 °C reached 30.34 wt%. The surface of the flame-retardant coating of GPTMS-PEI/PSP had good char formation. This study provides a feasible method for realizing durable flame-retardant RFs."
"Singularities of the hyperbolic elastic flow: convergence, quantization and blow-ups","We study the elastic flow of closed curves and of open curves with clamped boundary conditions in the hyperbolic plane. While global existence and convergence toward critical points for initial data with sufficiently small energy is already known, this study pioneers an investigation into the flow’s singular behavior. We prove a convergence theorem without assuming smallness of the initial energy, coupled with a quantification of potential singularities: Each singularity carries an energy cost of at least 8. Moreover, the blow-ups of the singularities are explicitly classified. A further contribution is an explicit understanding of the singular limit of the elastic flow of \(\lambda \)-figure-eights, a class of curves that previously served in showing sharpness of the energy threshold 16 for the smooth convergence of the elastic flow of closed curves."
Analytical solution to the simultaneous Michaelis-Menten and second-order kinetics problem,An analytic solution is presented for the simultaneous substrate elimination problem that combines Michaelis-Menten (MM) consumption with an irreversible homo-dimerization process. The implicit solution involves logarithm and inverse tangent functions and perfectly agrees with the numerical solution of the differential equation. A solution is also presented for the generalized dynamical problem that simultaneously combines MM kinetics with first and second-order processes. The exact expressions for the half-life and the area under the curve are also presented for these problems.
"Biosynthesis of ZrO2 from Phyllanthus niruri extracts and its PVA composite: mechanical, wear, dielectric, water absorption, and thermal conductivity properties","This study introduces a sustainable method for synthesizing zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) nanoparticles using Phyllanthus niruri extracts. These nanoparticles were then incorporated into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix to create a composite material. The mechanical, wear, and dielectric properties of this ZrO2-PVA composite were characterized as per ASTM standards. Results revealed that the composition PV2 shows improved mechanical properties of 56.34 MPa tensile strength along with a 2.08 GPa tensile modulus and a tear strength of 28.4 N/mm, respectively. But PV4 exhibits a higher shore-D hardness of 39. However, wear resistance is substantially improved in the ZrO2-PVA composite; thus, PV4 exhibits 0.26 coefficient of friction (COF) and a 0.008 mm3/Nm sp. wear rate, making it ideal for applications where wear reduction is critical. Additionally, the composite displayed enhanced dielectric properties influenced by ZrO2 nanoparticle concentration, delivering high dielectric properties in the PV4 composite designation, creating opportunities for electronic and insulating applications. Additionally, PV4 stands out with a water contact angle of 63° and a thermal conductivity of 0.7 W/mK, highlighting its superior surface hydrophobicity and thermal insulating properties. In summary, this study offers a green synthesis route for ZrO2 nanoparticles and demonstrates their value in reinforcing PVA matrices. The resulting composite exhibits enhanced mechanical strength, wear resistance, and adjustable dielectric properties, making it a promising material for various applications."
Rapid online detection of dissolved acetylene in transformer oil by photoacoustic spectroscopy and membrane degassing,"Acetylene is one of the main fault gases for oil transformers. The rapid and highly sensitive detection of dissolved acetylene in the insulating oil plays an extremely important role in the diagnosis of transformer faults, as it is produced by the decomposition of hydrocarbons due to discharge and overheating. This work describes a rapid real-time online monitoring system for dissolved acetylene in oil, which integrates a highly efficient Teflon-AF2400/ceramic composite degassing module and a high-sensitive laser photoacoustic detector. Real-time online monitoring is feasible as the detection period of the device is as short as 1.5 min, and the equilibrium concentration of acetylene in the oil can be accurately determined from test data at a degassing time of 15 min. When the concentration of acetylene in the oil changes suddenly, the device can report more than 90% of the change within 30 min. The detection accuracy is improved from 0.9 to 0.3 μL L−1 after corrections are made to account for the influence of temperature on the oil–gas separation membrane."
Bending strength degradation of a cantilever plate with surface energy due to partial debonding at the clamped boundary,"This paper investigates the bending fracture problem of a micro/nanoscale cantilever thin plate with surface energy, where the clamped boundary is partially debonded along the thickness direction. Some fundamental mechanical equations for the bending problem of micro/nanoscale plates are given by the Kirchhoff theory of thin plates, incorporating the Gurtin-Murdoch surface elasticity theory. For two typical cases of constant bending moment and uniform shear force in the debonded segment, the associated problems are reduced to two mixed boundary value problems. By solving the resulting mixed boundary value problems using the Fourier integral transform, a new type of singular integral equation with two Cauchy kernels is obtained for each case, and the exact solutions in terms of the fundamental functions are determined using the Poincare-Bertrand formula. Asymptotic elastic fields near the debonded tips including the bending moment, effective shear force, and bulk stress components exhibit the oscillatory singularity. The dependence relations among the singular fields, the material constants, and the plate’s thickness are analyzed for partially debonded cantilever micro-plates. If surface energy is neglected, these results reduce the bending fracture of a macroscale partially debonded cantilever plate, which has not been previously reported."
Experimental investigation on rock breaking by the TBM cutter assisted with the laser-induced groove,"Tunnel boring machines (TBMs) have been increasingly applied in extreme regions such as ""Three highs"" (high confining pressure, high rock hardness and high quartz content), researchers have introduced laser technology to the TBM field to improve cutting efficiency. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of laser power, laser moving speed, blade width, distance between the cutter and laser-induced groove (DCLG), and edge angle on rock breakage after coupling the laser with TBM cutter-head, and obtain the optimal combination of these parameters. Two sets of indentation tests were conducted: one with the assistance of laser-induced grooves (LG) based on a L18(37) orthogonal design table; the other was a controlled trial without the laser. The corrected indentation hardness index (CIHI), specific energy (SE) and penetration force were utilized as performance indicators to comprehensively evaluate the experimental results. Additionally, a new method proposed in this paper allowed for accurate measurement of the volume of rock debris, avoiding the difficulties associated with the traditional weighing method, which requires collecting rock fragments caused by rock bursts. Finally, variance analysis, range analysis, and comprehensive evaluation analysis were performed on the three performance indicators. Results show that LG can greatly reduce the penetration force of the cutter and improve cutting efficiency. The primary and secondary factors affecting the rock breaking performance of a laser-assisted cutter are: blade width, DCLG, laser moving speed, laser power and edge angle, and the optimal combination of rock-breaking parameters: The blade width is equal to 3 mm, the DCLG is equal to 5 mm, the laser moving speed is equal to 2 mm/s, the laser power is equal to 20 W, and the edge angle is equal to 12°."
Mechanical properties of natural fiber reinforced natural and ceramic fillers for various engineering applications,"The use of natural fibers as reinforcement in composite materials for technological applications has been the subject of research over the last ten years. Natural fibers are derived from plant structural features. They can be used as a component of composite materials, the characteristics of which are determined by the direction of the fibers. The effort aims to explore and create composite materials for a variety of technical applications by integrating waste fibers from natural sources as filler (rice husk, or RH) and reinforcement (coconut coir, or CC) composed of ceramic (silicon carbide, or SiC) as a component in an epoxy matrix. Using a hand lay-up process, various fiber weight composite samples are developed. Tensile, flexural, impact, and hardness tests were conducted in accordance with ASTM recommendations to observe the mechanical features. The outcomes of the composite samples demonstrated that the qualities of the samples’ tensile (81 MPa), flexural (95 MPa), hardness (98), and impact (2.3 J) had been enhanced by the ceramic fillers. There are several applications for these composites in the automotive, building, and commercial sectors."
Unique content of breastmilk: neurotrophic growth factors in breastmilk at 2 years and beyond,"The aim of our study was to show the presence of neurotrophic factors in breast milk that have a significant impact on neurocognitive development of children aged two years and beyond. Mothers expressed at least 5 mL of breast milk into sterile containers when their children 18, 24, and ≥ 25 months of age, and then specimens were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and stored at -20 °C. One day before the analysis, specimens were kept at +4 °C and then thawed at room temperature to prepare them for analysis. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and S100B neurotrophic growth factor levels were analyzed using the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) principles. Sixty-two mothers with children aged 18 months were included in the study. The mean age of the mothers was 33.4 (± 0.71) years. Due to the detection limits of the commercial kits, BDNF and S100B analyses could not be conducted. Therefore, only GDNF was analyzed. The presence of GDNF was found in the breast milk samples taken at 18, 24, and ≥ 25 months, and the median (min max) values were 315,505 ng/mL (193,067 750,718), 316,721 ng/mL (161,278 l-752,252), and 564,577 ng/mL (238,528-781,104) respectively. There were no significant differences between GDNF levels of breast milk samples collected from the same mother at the three different time points (18, 24, and ≥ 25 months) (p = 0.278)."
Numerical modelling using fuzzy multi-objective optimisation for environmental sustainability in green supply chain manufacturing,"The urgency of taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is increasing all the time. Due to the considerable contribution of emissions from storing and manufacturing to global warming, business leaders must devise a sustainable green supply chain. The suggested work will find out the quantity required for manufacturing and backordering to fulfil the optimisation of profits while minimising the ecological cost of industrial emissions and waste management. The inventory cost function includes the costs of initial setup, inventory, and shortfall. It has also taken into account several goals concerning the production system’s per-cycle waste and the overall penalty cost. Defects in the manufacturing process and shortages are also considered. Due to uncertainty in real life situations, we have taken into account the use of triangular fuzzy numbers to describe information connected with modelling decision factors. Different techniques of defuzzification are used to transform the fuzzy parameters into their discrete counterparts. The resulted multi-objective crisp problem is reduced to a single objective optimisation problem with the help of fuzzy technique by taking into account linear degrees of membership functions. The resulted model will help to decide the quantity of products for per production cycle to maintain sustainability (economic as well as environmental). The generated model is demonstrated by means of the numerical example and results are compared for various defuzzification techniques."
Using the andersen healthcare utilization model to assess willingness to screen for prep in pharmacy-based settings among cisgender sexually minoritized men: results from the 2020 american men’s internet survey,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV is severely underutilized among sexually minoritized men (SMM). Inequitable access to PrEP-prescribing facilities and providers is a critical barrier to PrEP uptake among SMM. Integrating HIV prevention services, such as PrEP screening, into pharmacy-based settings is a viable solution to addressing HIV inequities in the US. We aimed to examine willingness to obtain PrEP screening in a pharmacy and its associated correlates, leveraging Andersen’s Healthcare Utilization Model (AHUM), among a national sample of SMM in the U.S."
Evaluating the effectiveness of rotten rice to bioremediate formaldehyde with power generation through a microbial fuel cell,"One of the current challenges confronting the microbial fuel cell (MFC) is the unstable organic substrate for microbial species, which results in poor electron generation. This work utilized the rotten rice as an organic substrate in the MFC to promote microbial species activity, eliminate the organic pollutant formaldehyde, and increase power generation capacity. Only a few research used rice waste as an organic substrate in MFC, and they were solely applicable to hazardous metal removal. The study was conducted in a single-chambered MFC over a 30-day period. The voltage generation of the MFC was monitored daily, while formaldehyde removal was monitored at regular intervals. After the operation, the electrodes were biologically examined to determine the influence of the microbial species. The bioremediation efficiency of formaldehyde was 71% which was achieved in 30 operational days. The maximum voltage from the system was recorded on day 20 and was found to be 394 mV. This study presented the reaction process of rotten rice oxidation in the cell. Furthermore, the formaldehyde removal and electron generation degradation mechanisms are detailed. The study suggests that the rotten rice is a suitable organic substrate for the microbial species in MFC."
MPES-R: Multi-Parameter Evidence Synthesis in R for Survival Extrapolation—A Tutorial,"Survival extrapolation often plays an important role in health technology assessment (HTA), and there are a range of different approaches available. Approaches that can leverage external evidence (i.e. data or information collected outside the main data source of interest) may be helpful, given the extent of uncertainty often present when determining a suitable survival extrapolation. One of these methods is the multi-parameter evidence synthesis (MPES) approach, first proposed for use in HTA by Guyot et al., and more recently by Jackson. While MPES has potential benefits over conventional extrapolation approaches (such as simple or flexible parametric models), it is more computationally complex and requires use of specialist software. This tutorial presents an introduction to MPES for HTA, alongside a user-friendly, publicly available operationalisation of Guyot’s original MPES that can be executed using the statistical software package R. Through two case studies, both Guyot’s and Jackson’s MPES approaches are explored, along with sensitivity analyses relevant to HTA. Finally, the discussion section of the tutorial details important considerations for analysts considering use of an MPES approach, along with potential further developments. MPES has not been used often in HTA, and so there are limited examples of how it has been used and perceived. However, this tutorial may aid future research efforts exploring the use of MPES further."
A closer look at single object tracking under variable haze,"The task of monitoring the object's path as it travels within a scene has consistently been challenging. When a specific level of haze is introduced to the environment, the endeavor becomes more difficult. The most recent tracking algorithms claim to be capable of accurately monitoring objects in typical visual conditions. However, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive analysis of their functionality in hazy conditions, as haze is a meteorological adversity that is frequently encountered and has the potential to result in severe consequences. The primary objective of this investigation is to evaluate the efficacy of prominent tracking algorithms in the presence or absence of haze. Additionally, the performance was assessed by examining it in a variety of hazy conditions that were generated using the monocular depth information of the original image. The comparison between the authentic hazy photographs and the artificially created hazy photos has also been demonstrated. Furthermore, several novel relative parameters have been developed for object tracking under obscured vision conditions. These parameters can be employed to maintain the relative tracking performances under both normal and varying hazy conditions.To emphasize the effects of haze, the results have been obtained by using the help of state-of-the-art tracking algorithms."
Acute elevated dietary fat alone is not sufficient to decrease AgRP projections in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus in mice,"Within the brain, the connections between neurons are constantly changing in response to environmental stimuli. A prime environmental regulator of neuronal activity is diet, and previous work has highlighted changes in hypothalamic connections in response to diets high in dietary fat and elevated sucrose. We sought to determine if the change in hypothalamic neuronal connections was driven primarily by an elevation in dietary fat alone. Analysis was performed in both male and female animals. We measured Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neuropeptide and Synaptophysin markers in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) in response to an acute 48 h high fat diet challenge. Using two image analysis methods described in previous studies, an effect of a high fat diet on AgRP neuronal projections in the PVH of male or female mice was not identified. These results suggest that it may not be dietary fat alone that is responsible for the previously published alterations in hypothalamic connections. Future work should focus on deciphering the role of individual macronutrients on neuroanatomical and functional changes."
U-shaped prognostic value of left ventricular-arterial coupling in septic patients: a prospective study,Ventricular-arterial coupling (VAC) has garnered increasing interest in critical care. The prognostic significance of left ventricular-arterial coupling (LVAC) in this context remains a topic of debate.
Study on the effective elastic performance of composites containing decagonal symmetric two-dimensional quasicrystal coatings,"On account of the Mori-Tanaka approach, the effective elastic performance of composites containing decagonal symmetric two-dimensional (2D) quasicrystal (QC) coatings is studied. Explicit expressions for the effective elastic constants of rare-earth QC reinforced magnesium-based composites are provided. Detailed discussion is presented on the effects of the volume fraction of the inclusions, the aspect ratio of the inclusions, the coating thickness, and the coating material parameters on the effective elastic constants of the composites. The results indicate that considering the coating increases the effective elastic constants of the composites to some extent."
Regression of Chiari malformation type 2 following early postnatal meningomyelocele repair—a retrospective observation from an institutional series of patients,"Spontaneous regression of Chiari malformation type 2 (CM2) is observed rarely, as CM2 is associated with meningomyelocele (MMC) that is surgically repaired either pre- or early postnatally. While the radiological regression of CM2 occurs frequently following prenatal repair of MMC, it has been reported in only a few studies after postnatal repair."
Policy Brief – Survivorship is cancer survivorship the poor cousin of cancer control within the EBCP?,"There is an increasing number of cancer survivors, including children, adolescents, young adults, individuals of working age, and the elderly, within the Belgian and European population. Yet, survivorship care and rehabilitation are often treated as an afterthought in care organisation. This not only directly affects the quality of life of survivors and carers, but also puts the sustainability of the healthcare and social security systems at risk."
Graph Fourier transform for spatial omics representation and analyses of complex organs,"Spatial omics technologies decipher functional components of complex organs at cellular and subcellular resolutions. We introduce Spatial Graph Fourier Transform (SpaGFT) and apply graph signal processing to a wide range of spatial omics profiling platforms to generate their interpretable representations. This representation supports spatially variable gene identification and improves gene expression imputation, outperforming existing tools in analyzing human and mouse spatial transcriptomics data. SpaGFT can identify immunological regions for B cell maturation in human lymph nodes Visium data and characterize variations in secondary follicles using in-house human tonsil CODEX data. Furthermore, it can be integrated seamlessly into other machine learning frameworks, enhancing accuracy in spatial domain identification, cell type annotation, and subcellular feature inference by up to 40%. Notably, SpaGFT detects rare subcellular organelles, such as Cajal bodies and Set1/COMPASS complexes, in high-resolution spatial proteomics data. This approach provides an explainable graph representation method for exploring tissue biology and function."
High-Accuracy Numerical Methods and Convergence Analysis for Schrödinger Equation with Incommensurate Potentials,"Numerical solving the Schrödinger equation with incommensurate potentials presents a great challenge since its solutions could be space-filling quasiperiodic structures without translational symmetry nor decay. In this paper, we propose two high-accuracy numerical methods to solve the time-dependent quasiperiodic Schrödinger equation. Concretely, we discretize the spatial variables by the quasiperiodic spectral method and the projection method, and the time variable by the second-order operator splitting method. The corresponding convergence analysis is also presented and shows that the proposed methods both have spectral convergence rates in space and second order accuracy in time, respectively. Meanwhile, we analyse the computational complexity of these numerical algorithms. One- and two-dimensional numerical results verify these convergence conclusions, and demonstrate that the projection method is more efficient."
Bending strength degradation of a cantilever plate with surface energy due to partial debonding at the clamped boundary,"This paper investigates the bending fracture problem of a micro/nanoscale cantilever thin plate with surface energy, where the clamped boundary is partially debonded along the thickness direction. Some fundamental mechanical equations for the bending problem of micro/nanoscale plates are given by the Kirchhoff theory of thin plates, incorporating the Gurtin-Murdoch surface elasticity theory. For two typical cases of constant bending moment and uniform shear force in the debonded segment, the associated problems are reduced to two mixed boundary value problems. By solving the resulting mixed boundary value problems using the Fourier integral transform, a new type of singular integral equation with two Cauchy kernels is obtained for each case, and the exact solutions in terms of the fundamental functions are determined using the Poincare-Bertrand formula. Asymptotic elastic fields near the debonded tips including the bending moment, effective shear force, and bulk stress components exhibit the oscillatory singularity. The dependence relations among the singular fields, the material constants, and the plate’s thickness are analyzed for partially debonded cantilever micro-plates. If surface energy is neglected, these results reduce the bending fracture of a macroscale partially debonded cantilever plate, which has not been previously reported."
Policy spillovers from climate actions to energy poverty: international evidence,"Policies to address climate change have been implemented worldwide in recent years. The core of these policies is to control greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which primarily stem from the consumption of fossil fuels. Consequently, the implementation of climate policies can affect other energy-related issues, such as energy poverty, a critical element of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper uses cross-country data from 2000 to 2020 to study the possible policy spillovers from climate actions to energy poverty. We show that a spillover effect does exist. In other words, a higher number of climate policies is associated with a lower level of energy poverty. The spillover is realized through improvements in energy efficiency, the promotion of renewable energy, and support for innovations. In addition, legislative policies are found to have stronger spillover effects. While the overall policy effects are positive for executive policies, regulations tend to have negative impacts on energy development. There is also evidence demonstrating heterogeneous effects between long-term and short-term policies, and between developed and developing countries. Discovering this spillover effect gives extra motivation for countries to adopt climate policies and actively seek synergies in achieving broader sustainable goals."
Fabrication of highly efficient flame-retardant and biocompatible ramie fabrics through covalent bonding and layer-by-layer assembly methods,"Ramie fibers have poor flame-retardant properties, which limits their application. To improve the flame-retardant properties of ramie fabric (RF), a durable flame-retardant coating was successfully realized on RF by combining covalent bonding and electrostatic adsorption. Si/P/N flame-retardant coatings were constructed on RF using cationic polyethyleneimine (PEI) and anionic sodium hexametaphosphate (PSP) via the layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly approach with the introduction of 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) as an organic cross-linker. Compared with the untreated RF samples, the fabrics treated with the flame-retardant coating PEI/PSP via the LBL method presented reductions of 51.06%, 48.30%, and 40.05% in the fire growth rate, peak heat release rate, and total heat release, respectively, in the cone calorimeter test. In addition, at a weight gain of 31.57%, the fabric self-extinguished in the UL-94 test within 10 s after leaving the ignition source, resulting in a damaged length of 6.13 cm. G-3 retained the limiting oxygen index (LOI) of 26.40% after 6 laundering cycles (LCs). The TG results revealed that the char residue of G-3 at 800 °C reached 30.34 wt%. The surface of the flame-retardant coating of GPTMS-PEI/PSP had good char formation. This study provides a feasible method for realizing durable flame-retardant RFs."
Quality assurance using quality indicators for prevention and early detection of cervical cancer in certified gynaecological dysplasia units and consultancies,Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. A successful screening concept for cervical cancer reduces the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer. Quality indicators (QIs) derived from the screening guidelines for cervical cancer and used by the certified dysplasia units and dysplasia consultancies are evaluated in this paper. The aim of this paper is to present the current data from the annual reports of these units and consultancies.
Analysis of the epidemic characteristics of common respiratory pathogens infection in children in a 3A special hospital,"To analyze the epidemic characteristics of common respiratory tract infection pathogens in children with respiratory tract infection, and provide scientific basis for the prevention and control of respiratory tract infection."
Experimental investigation on rock breaking by the TBM cutter assisted with the laser-induced groove,"Tunnel boring machines (TBMs) have been increasingly applied in extreme regions such as ""Three highs"" (high confining pressure, high rock hardness and high quartz content), researchers have introduced laser technology to the TBM field to improve cutting efficiency. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of laser power, laser moving speed, blade width, distance between the cutter and laser-induced groove (DCLG), and edge angle on rock breakage after coupling the laser with TBM cutter-head, and obtain the optimal combination of these parameters. Two sets of indentation tests were conducted: one with the assistance of laser-induced grooves (LG) based on a L18(37) orthogonal design table; the other was a controlled trial without the laser. The corrected indentation hardness index (CIHI), specific energy (SE) and penetration force were utilized as performance indicators to comprehensively evaluate the experimental results. Additionally, a new method proposed in this paper allowed for accurate measurement of the volume of rock debris, avoiding the difficulties associated with the traditional weighing method, which requires collecting rock fragments caused by rock bursts. Finally, variance analysis, range analysis, and comprehensive evaluation analysis were performed on the three performance indicators. Results show that LG can greatly reduce the penetration force of the cutter and improve cutting efficiency. The primary and secondary factors affecting the rock breaking performance of a laser-assisted cutter are: blade width, DCLG, laser moving speed, laser power and edge angle, and the optimal combination of rock-breaking parameters: The blade width is equal to 3 mm, the DCLG is equal to 5 mm, the laser moving speed is equal to 2 mm/s, the laser power is equal to 20 W, and the edge angle is equal to 12°."
Synergistic Antifungal Activity of Green Synthesized Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles and Fungicide Against Rhizoctonia solani Causing Rice Sheath Blight Disease,"The biosynthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles using leaf extract of medicinal plants is a promising substitute for the traditional chemical method. This work aimed to synthesize zinc oxide nanoparticles using a green approach from local “Dholkolmi” (Ipomoea carnea) leaf extract which is a medicinal plant growing outside the roads of different regions of Bangladesh. The biosynthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) were characterized using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, particle size analyzer, zeta-potential, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The results of UV-visible spectrophotometers observed an absorption peak at 373 nm wavelength, which confirmed the synthesis of ZnONPs in the solution. ZnONP sizes determined by XRD, DLS, and TEM are approximately ~37 nm, 105.61 nm, and 19.66 nm, respectively. ZnONPs were present because of the strong oxygen and zinc signals in the EDX profile. Additionally, this research assessed the antifungal activity of the biosynthesized ZnONPs and as well as folicur-incorporated ZnONPs against Rhizoctonia solani by the poison bait technique. According to the result of this study, ZnONPs synthesized from Ipomoea carnea leaf extract showed no promising result against Rhizoctonia solani mycelial growth reduction. But folicur-incorporated ZnONPs revealed a significant finding with a maximum 100% inhibition of mycelial growth at 1:1 and 3:1 ratio of ZnONPs with folicur fungicide under in vitro conditions. In the net house experiment, folicur-incorporated ZnONPs at a 1:1 ratio of ZnONPs with folicur showed considerable disease inhibition (26.96% RLH) as compared to disease control (52.83% RLH). In the case of rainfed transplanted Aus (March–June), the highest percentage of RLH was recorded in disease control (64.61%), and the lowest RLH was found in folicur (24.79%) followed by a 1:1 ratio of ZnONPs with folicur (32.10%) in field condition. On the other hand, the highest percentage of RLH was recorded in disease control (65.31%) and the lowest RLH was found in folicur (18.14%) followed by a 1:1 ratio of ZnONPs with folicur (21.39%) in rainfed transplanted Aman (July–November) season. The findings of the in vitro and in vivo studies provided evidence that ZnONPs and folicur had a strong synergistic antifungal impact and may be employed as a possible rice sheath blight disease management agent."
Genotypic variation in blueberry flower morphology and nectar reward content affects pollinator attraction in a diverse breeding population,"Pollination is crucial to obtaining optimal blueberry yield and fruit quality. Despite substantial investments in seasonal beekeeping services, blueberry producers consistently report suboptimal pollinator visitation and fruit set in some cultivars. Flower morphology and floral rewards are among the key factors that have shown to contribute to pollinator attraction, however little is known about their relative importance for improving yield in the context of plant breeding. Clarifying the relationships between flower morphology, nectar reward content, pollinator recruitment, and pollination outcomes, as well as their genetic components, can inform breeding priorities for enhancing blueberry production. In the present study, we measured ten flower and nectar traits and indices of successful pollination, including fruit set, seed count, and fruit weight in 38 southern highbush blueberry genotypes. Additionally, we assessed pollinator visitation frequency and foraging behavior over two growing seasons. Several statistical models were tested to optimize the prediction of pollinator visitation and pollination success, including partial least squares, BayesB, ridge-regression, and random forest."
Valley polarization of electrons in a graphene under modulations of the electrostatic potential barrier and the magnetic field,"The valley polarization is a fundamental concept in valleytronic applications. However, the combined effects of the electrostatic potential barrier and the magnetic field as well as strains on the valley polarization in a graphene have been rarely reported. Therefore, in this paper, we use the transfer-matrix method to illustrate effects of the height and width of the electrostatic barrier and the strength of the applied magnetic field on the valley polarization of electrons in a graphene, and we find that the valley polarization strongly depends on the strength and width of the electrostatic barrier. We also find that the 100% valley polarization can be achieved continuously and smoothly over a wide range of Fermi energy region by controlling the strength of the applied magnetic field. This point makes it easier to design novel valleytronic devices based on graphene with the presence of the magnetic field and the electrostatic potential barrier as well as strains."
Mechanical properties of natural fiber reinforced natural and ceramic fillers for various engineering applications,"The use of natural fibers as reinforcement in composite materials for technological applications has been the subject of research over the last ten years. Natural fibers are derived from plant structural features. They can be used as a component of composite materials, the characteristics of which are determined by the direction of the fibers. The effort aims to explore and create composite materials for a variety of technical applications by integrating waste fibers from natural sources as filler (rice husk, or RH) and reinforcement (coconut coir, or CC) composed of ceramic (silicon carbide, or SiC) as a component in an epoxy matrix. Using a hand lay-up process, various fiber weight composite samples are developed. Tensile, flexural, impact, and hardness tests were conducted in accordance with ASTM recommendations to observe the mechanical features. The outcomes of the composite samples demonstrated that the qualities of the samples’ tensile (81 MPa), flexural (95 MPa), hardness (98), and impact (2.3 J) had been enhanced by the ceramic fillers. There are several applications for these composites in the automotive, building, and commercial sectors."
Unique content of breastmilk: neurotrophic growth factors in breastmilk at 2 years and beyond,"The aim of our study was to show the presence of neurotrophic factors in breast milk that have a significant impact on neurocognitive development of children aged two years and beyond. Mothers expressed at least 5 mL of breast milk into sterile containers when their children 18, 24, and ≥ 25 months of age, and then specimens were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and stored at -20 °C. One day before the analysis, specimens were kept at +4 °C and then thawed at room temperature to prepare them for analysis. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and S100B neurotrophic growth factor levels were analyzed using the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) principles. Sixty-two mothers with children aged 18 months were included in the study. The mean age of the mothers was 33.4 (± 0.71) years. Due to the detection limits of the commercial kits, BDNF and S100B analyses could not be conducted. Therefore, only GDNF was analyzed. The presence of GDNF was found in the breast milk samples taken at 18, 24, and ≥ 25 months, and the median (min max) values were 315,505 ng/mL (193,067 750,718), 316,721 ng/mL (161,278 l-752,252), and 564,577 ng/mL (238,528-781,104) respectively. There were no significant differences between GDNF levels of breast milk samples collected from the same mother at the three different time points (18, 24, and ≥ 25 months) (p = 0.278)."
"Singularities of the hyperbolic elastic flow: convergence, quantization and blow-ups","We study the elastic flow of closed curves and of open curves with clamped boundary conditions in the hyperbolic plane. While global existence and convergence toward critical points for initial data with sufficiently small energy is already known, this study pioneers an investigation into the flow’s singular behavior. We prove a convergence theorem without assuming smallness of the initial energy, coupled with a quantification of potential singularities: Each singularity carries an energy cost of at least 8. Moreover, the blow-ups of the singularities are explicitly classified. A further contribution is an explicit understanding of the singular limit of the elastic flow of \(\lambda \)-figure-eights, a class of curves that previously served in showing sharpness of the energy threshold 16 for the smooth convergence of the elastic flow of closed curves."
"From rule-based models to deep learning transformers architectures for natural language processing and sign language translation systems: survey, taxonomy and performance evaluation","With the growing Deaf and Hard of Hearing population worldwide and the persistent shortage of certified sign language interpreters, there is a pressing need for an efficient, signs-driven, integrated end-to-end translation system, from sign to gloss to text and vice-versa. There has been a wealth of research on machine translations and related reviews. However, there are few works on sign language machine translation considering the particularity of the language being continuous and dynamic. This paper aims to address this void, providing a retrospective analysis of the temporal evolution of sign language machine translation algorithms and a taxonomy of the Transformers architectures, the most used approach in language translation. We also present the requirements of a real-time Quality-of-Service sign language machine translation system underpinned by accurate deep learning algorithms. We propose future research directions for sign language translation systems."
Analytical solution to the simultaneous Michaelis-Menten and second-order kinetics problem,An analytic solution is presented for the simultaneous substrate elimination problem that combines Michaelis-Menten (MM) consumption with an irreversible homo-dimerization process. The implicit solution involves logarithm and inverse tangent functions and perfectly agrees with the numerical solution of the differential equation. A solution is also presented for the generalized dynamical problem that simultaneously combines MM kinetics with first and second-order processes. The exact expressions for the half-life and the area under the curve are also presented for these problems.
"Biosynthesis of ZrO2 from Phyllanthus niruri extracts and its PVA composite: mechanical, wear, dielectric, water absorption, and thermal conductivity properties","This study introduces a sustainable method for synthesizing zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) nanoparticles using Phyllanthus niruri extracts. These nanoparticles were then incorporated into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix to create a composite material. The mechanical, wear, and dielectric properties of this ZrO2-PVA composite were characterized as per ASTM standards. Results revealed that the composition PV2 shows improved mechanical properties of 56.34 MPa tensile strength along with a 2.08 GPa tensile modulus and a tear strength of 28.4 N/mm, respectively. But PV4 exhibits a higher shore-D hardness of 39. However, wear resistance is substantially improved in the ZrO2-PVA composite; thus, PV4 exhibits 0.26 coefficient of friction (COF) and a 0.008 mm3/Nm sp. wear rate, making it ideal for applications where wear reduction is critical. Additionally, the composite displayed enhanced dielectric properties influenced by ZrO2 nanoparticle concentration, delivering high dielectric properties in the PV4 composite designation, creating opportunities for electronic and insulating applications. Additionally, PV4 stands out with a water contact angle of 63° and a thermal conductivity of 0.7 W/mK, highlighting its superior surface hydrophobicity and thermal insulating properties. In summary, this study offers a green synthesis route for ZrO2 nanoparticles and demonstrates their value in reinforcing PVA matrices. The resulting composite exhibits enhanced mechanical strength, wear resistance, and adjustable dielectric properties, making it a promising material for various applications."
Using the andersen healthcare utilization model to assess willingness to screen for prep in pharmacy-based settings among cisgender sexually minoritized men: results from the 2020 american men’s internet survey,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV is severely underutilized among sexually minoritized men (SMM). Inequitable access to PrEP-prescribing facilities and providers is a critical barrier to PrEP uptake among SMM. Integrating HIV prevention services, such as PrEP screening, into pharmacy-based settings is a viable solution to addressing HIV inequities in the US. We aimed to examine willingness to obtain PrEP screening in a pharmacy and its associated correlates, leveraging Andersen’s Healthcare Utilization Model (AHUM), among a national sample of SMM in the U.S."
CT-based radiomics for predicting breast cancer radiotherapy side effects,"Skin inflammation with the potential sequel of moist epitheliolysis and edema constitute the most frequent breast radiotherapy (RT) acute side effects. The aim of this study was to compare the predictive value of tissue-derived radiomics features to the total breast volume (TBV) for the moist cells epitheliolysis as a surrogate for skin inflammation, and edema. Radiomics features were extracted from computed tomography (CT) scans of 252 breast cancer patients from two volumes of interest: TBV and glandular tissue (GT). Machine learning classifiers were trained on radiomics and clinical features, which were evaluated for both side effects. The best radiomics model was a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) classifier, using TBV features, predicting moist cells epitheliolysis, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.74. This was comparable to TBV breast volume (AUROC of 0.75). Combined models of radiomics and clinical features did not improve performance. Exclusion of volume-correlated features slightly reduced the predictive performance (AUROC 0.71). We could demonstrate the general propensity of planning CT-based radiomics models to predict breast RT-dependent side effects. Mammary tissue was more predictive than glandular tissue. The radiomics features performance was influenced by their high correlation to TBV volume."
NOD alleles at Idd1 and Idd2 loci drive exocrine pancreatic inflammation,"Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously develop autoimmune diabetes and have enabled the identification of several loci associated with diabetes susceptibility, termed insulin-dependent diabetes (Idd). The generation of congenic mice has allowed the characterization of the impact of several loci on disease susceptibility. For instance, NOD.B6-Idd1 and B6.NOD-Idd1 congenic mice were instrumental in demonstrating that susceptibility alleles at the MHC locus (known as Idd1) are necessary but not sufficient for autoimmune diabetes progression. We previously showed that diabetes resistance alleles at the Idd2 locus provide significant protection from autoimmune diabetes onset, second to Idd1. In search of the minimal genetic factors required for T1D onset, we generated B6.Idd1.Idd2 double-congenic mice. Although the combination of Idd1 and Idd2 is not sufficient to induce diabetes onset, we observed immune infiltration in the exocrine pancreas of B6.Idd2 mice, as well as an increase in neutrophils and pancreatic tissue fibrosis. In addition, we observed phenotypic differences in T-cell subsets from B6.Idd1.Idd2 mice relative to single-congenic mice, suggesting epistatic interaction between Idd1 and Idd2 in modulating T-cell function. Altogether, these data show that Idd1 and Idd2 susceptibility alleles are not sufficient for autoimmune diabetes but contribute to inflammation and immune infiltration in the pancreas."
"Immunohistochemical expression of GATA3, CK5/6 and CK20 in molecular subtypes of bladder carcinoma: correlation with clinicopathological features","Bladder urothelial carcinoma, is considered the 7th most common cancer in males. It is classified into luminal and basal subtypes depending on molecular markers, influencing prognosis and treatment. Identifying reliable biomarkers like GATA3, CK20, and CK5/6 through immunohistochemical methods can aid in early detection, risk stratification, and personalized treatment strategies. This study aims for evaluation prognostic role of these mentioned markers in correlation with clinicopathological parameters in urothelial carcinomas."
Rapid online detection of dissolved acetylene in transformer oil by photoacoustic spectroscopy and membrane degassing,"Acetylene is one of the main fault gases for oil transformers. The rapid and highly sensitive detection of dissolved acetylene in the insulating oil plays an extremely important role in the diagnosis of transformer faults, as it is produced by the decomposition of hydrocarbons due to discharge and overheating. This work describes a rapid real-time online monitoring system for dissolved acetylene in oil, which integrates a highly efficient Teflon-AF2400/ceramic composite degassing module and a high-sensitive laser photoacoustic detector. Real-time online monitoring is feasible as the detection period of the device is as short as 1.5 min, and the equilibrium concentration of acetylene in the oil can be accurately determined from test data at a degassing time of 15 min. When the concentration of acetylene in the oil changes suddenly, the device can report more than 90% of the change within 30 min. The detection accuracy is improved from 0.9 to 0.3 μL L−1 after corrections are made to account for the influence of temperature on the oil–gas separation membrane."
Efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors-related antidepressants in Alzheimer’s disease: a meta-analysis,"To study the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on cognitive functions, mental improvements, and adverse effects in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD)."
Nonlinear dynamics of wave structures for the Davey–Stewartson system: a truncated Painlevé approach,"The Davey–Stewartson system is a mathematical model that captures the behavior of two-dimensional waves, encompassing key factors like dispersion, nonlinearity, and wave-wave interactions. This work investigates the (2+1) dimensional integrable Davey–Stewartson system by employing the truncated Painlevé analysis. The results are derived using random functions, which are then applied to provide different localized solutions, including rogue waves, dromion-pair, and dromions. Selecting appropriate beginning values for the arbitrary functions also results in the generation, analysis, and visual display of the collisional behavior of these solutions. We find that while rogue waves happen to be unstable in nature, dromions undergo inelastic collisions that exchange both their energy and phase. These findings enhance our understanding of complex wave dynamics and have intriguing applications in fluid dynamics, oceanography, nonlinear optics, and the investigation of nonlinear phenomena in diverse physical systems. It is significant to mention that Maple software is utilized to generate and validate the reliability and precision of all calculations and depictions. All things considered, this work contributes to our understanding of complex nonlinear systems and the role starting conditions play in determining their behavior."
Understanding the role of negative charge in the scaffold of an artificial enzyme for CO2 hydrogenation on catalysis,"We have approached the construction of an artificial enzyme by employing a robust protein scaffold, lactococcal multidrug resistance regulator, LmrR, providing a structured secondary and outer coordination spheres around a molecular rhodium complex, [RhI(PEt2NglyPEt2)2]−. Previously, we demonstrated a 2–3 fold increase in activity for one Rh-LmrR construct by introducing positive charge in the secondary coordination sphere. In this study, a series of variants was made through site-directed mutagenesis where the negative charge is located in the secondary sphere or outer coordination sphere, with additional variants made with increasingly negative charge in the outer coordination sphere while keeping a positive charge in the secondary sphere. Placing a negative charge in the secondary or outer coordination sphere demonstrates decreased activity by a factor of two compared to the wild-type Rh-LmrR. Interestingly, addition of positive charge in the secondary sphere, with the negatively charged outer coordination sphere restores activity. Vibrational and NMR spectroscopy suggest minimal changes to the electronic density at the rhodium center, regardless of inclusion of a negative or positive charge in the secondary sphere, suggesting another mechanism is impacting catalytic activity, explored in the discussion."
Fast no-reference deep image dehazing,"This paper presents a deep learning method for image dehazing and clarification. The main advantages of the method are high computational speed and using unpaired image data for training. The method adapts the Zero-DCE approach (Li et al. in IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell 44(8):4225–4238, 2021) for the image dehazing problem and uses high-order curves to adjust the dynamic range of images and achieve dehazing. Training the proposed dehazing neural network does not require paired hazy and clear datasets but instead utilizes a set of loss functions, assessing the quality of dehazed images to drive the training process. Experiments on a large number of real-world hazy images demonstrate that our proposed network effectively removes haze while preserving details and enhancing brightness. Furthermore, on an affordable GPU-equipped laptop, the processing speed can reach 1000 FPS for images with 2K resolution, making it highly suitable for real-time dehazing applications."
Radiative heat transfer analysis of a concave porous fin under the local thermal non-equilibrium condition: application of the clique polynomial method and physics-informed neural networks,"The heat transfer through a concave permeable fin is analyzed by the local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) model. The governing dimensional temperature equations for the solid and fluid phases of the porous extended surface are modeled, and then are nondimensionalized by suitable dimensionless terms. Further, the obtained non-dimensional equations are solved by the clique polynomial method (CPM). The effects of several dimensionless parameters on the fin’s thermal profiles are shown by graphical illustrations. Additionally, the current study implements deep neural structures to solve physics-governed coupled equations, and the best-suited hyperparameters are attained by comparison with various network combinations. The results of the CPM and physics-informed neural network (PINN) exhibit good agreement, signifying that both methods effectively solve the thermal modeling problem."
Source leaves are regulated by sink strengths through non-coding RNAs and alternative polyadenylation in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.),"The yield of major crops is generally limited by sink capacity and source strength. Cucumber is a typical raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs)–transporting crop. Non-coding RNAs and alternative polyadenylation (APA) play important roles in the regulation of growth process in plants. However, their roles on the sink‒source regulation have not been demonstrated in RFOs–translocating species."
Numerical modelling using fuzzy multi-objective optimisation for environmental sustainability in green supply chain manufacturing,"The urgency of taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is increasing all the time. Due to the considerable contribution of emissions from storing and manufacturing to global warming, business leaders must devise a sustainable green supply chain. The suggested work will find out the quantity required for manufacturing and backordering to fulfil the optimisation of profits while minimising the ecological cost of industrial emissions and waste management. The inventory cost function includes the costs of initial setup, inventory, and shortfall. It has also taken into account several goals concerning the production system’s per-cycle waste and the overall penalty cost. Defects in the manufacturing process and shortages are also considered. Due to uncertainty in real life situations, we have taken into account the use of triangular fuzzy numbers to describe information connected with modelling decision factors. Different techniques of defuzzification are used to transform the fuzzy parameters into their discrete counterparts. The resulted multi-objective crisp problem is reduced to a single objective optimisation problem with the help of fuzzy technique by taking into account linear degrees of membership functions. The resulted model will help to decide the quantity of products for per production cycle to maintain sustainability (economic as well as environmental). The generated model is demonstrated by means of the numerical example and results are compared for various defuzzification techniques."
B4GALT5 a sialylation-related genes associated with patient prognosis and immune microenvironment in ovarian cancer and pan-cancer,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is the predominant primary tumor in the human reproductive system. Abnormal sialylation has a significant impact on tumor development, metastasis, immune evasion, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. B4GALT5, a gene associated with sialylation, plays a crucial role in ovarian cancer, and may potentially affect clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis."
Characteristics of 3D coupled map lattice and its application in pseudo-random number generator,"Coupled map lattice (CML), as a classical model of the higher-dimensional chaotic system, possesses outstanding chaotic dynamic behavior both at time and space. Compared with one-dimensional CML and two-dimensional CML, three-dimensional (3D) CML has more complicated chaotic behavior, and it is pretty suitable for designing chaos-based cryptographic schemes. In this paper, foremost, theoretical mathematical expressions of Lyapunov exponent (LE) and synchronization stability in the 3D CML model are deeply and comprehensively obtained, which guide the parameters setting to keep the model in the fully chaotic state and avoid synchronization state. Also, other chaotic behaviors such as bifurcation, ergodicity, and probability density distribution are analyzed, and all of those demonstrate the 3D CML model has complex chaotic performance. Furthermore, according to the 3D CML model and theoretical results, a novel pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) has been proposed with safety assurance via the simple interception operation. Finally, large amounts of simulations verify the theoretical results are correct and our proposed PRNG scheme possesses outstanding performance. Finally, the 3D CML model is extended into the ND CML one, LE expression is also derived. Above all, our research can provide some theoretical guidance for using the CML model (i.e. 3D CML and ND CML) as a core component to construct chaos-based cryptographic schemes, and it owns well potential application."
On the Non-identity Causal Theory of Spacetime from Causal Set Theory,"The aim to provide a causal theory of spacetime is not new. The overall program, however, was largely deemed unsuccessful, chiefly due to criticism voiced by Smart (Monist 53:385–395, 1969), Nerlich (Br J Philos Sci 33(4):361–388, 1982) and Earman (Synthese 24:74–86, 1972). Recently, Baron and Le Bihan (Noûs 58:202–224, 2023) have argued that developments in contemporary physics should make us reconsider this verdict. More precisely, they argue the emergence of spacetime from causal set theory (CST), where “the metric structure of spacetime can be recovered from its causal structure” (Baron and Le Bihan 2023, 2), “suggests a very natural way to reformulate the causal theory of spacetime” (ibid., 9)—an account which they end up dubbing the non-identity causal theory. This paper questions the success of Baron and Le Bihan’s non-identity theory. It is shown that (1) the specific grounding Baron and Le Bihan propose for timelike and spacelike relations is not plausible even when charitably reconstructed; and (2) that a causal theory of spacetime based on general relativity is just as successful for establishing a non-identity theory as a theory based on CST. In short then, we argue that the causal theory of spacetime proposed by Baron and Le Bihan is supported just as well (or badly) by the physics that already took centre stage in the original discussions of the causal theory of spacetime."
Circ_0008315 promotes tumorigenesis and cisplatin resistance and acts as a nanotherapeutic target in gastric cancer,"Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is one of the fundamental therapeutic modalities for gastric cancer (GC). Chemoresistance to cisplatin is a great clinical challenge, and its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in the pathophysiology of multiple human malignancies."
Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-15 regulates adipogenesis in human SGBS cells,"Adipogenesis involves intricate molecular mechanisms regulated by various transcription factors and signaling pathways. In this study, we aimed to identify factors specifically induced during adipogenesis in the human preadipocyte cell line, SGBS, but not in the mouse preadipocyte cell line, 3T3-L1. Microarray analysis revealed distinct gene expression profiles, with 1460 genes induced in SGBS cells and 1297 genes induced in 3T3-L1 cells during adipogenesis, with only 297 genes commonly induced. Among the genes uniquely induced in SGBS cells, we focused on GALNT15, which encodes polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-15. Its expression increased transiently during adipogenesis in SGBS cells but remained low in 3T3-L1 cells. Overexpression of GALNT15 increased mRNA levels of CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBPα) and leptin but had no significant impact on adipogenesis in SGBS cells. Conversely, knockdown of GALNT15 suppressed mRNA expression of adipocyte marker genes, reduced lipid accumulation, and decreased the percentage of cells with oil droplets. The induction of C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ during adipogenesis was promoted or suppressed in SGBS cells subjected to overexpression or knockdown of GALNT15, respectively. These data suggest that polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-15 is a novel regulatory molecule that enhances adipogenesis in SGBS cells."
