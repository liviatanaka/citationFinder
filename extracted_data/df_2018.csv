The Association Between Adiposity and Inpatient Hospital Costs in the UK Biobank Cohort,"High adiposity is associated with higher risks for a variety of adverse health outcomes, including higher rates of age-adjusted mortality and increased morbidity. This has important implications for the management of healthcare systems, since the endocrinal, cardiometabolic and other changes associated with increased adiposity may be associated with substantial healthcare costs."
Searching for the finance–growth nexus in Libya,"This paper investigates the causal relationship between financial development and economic growth in Libya during the period 1970–2016, providing new insights from a resource-dependent economy. The empirical results vary with estimation methodology and model specification, but indicate no long-run relationship between financial intermediation and nonhydrocarbon output growth. The OLS estimation shows that financial development has a statistically significant negative effect on real nonhydrocarbon GDP per capita growth. However, both the VAR- and ARDL-based estimations present statistically insignificant results, albeit still attaching a negative coefficient to financial intermediation. It appears that nonhydrocarbon economic activity depends largely on government spending, which is in turn determined by the country’s hydrocarbon earnings."
DeepM6ASeq: prediction and characterization of m6A-containing sequences using deep learning,"N6-methyladensine (m6A) is a common and abundant RNA methylation modification found in various species. As a type of post-transcriptional methylation, m6A plays an important role in diverse RNA activities such as alternative splicing, an interplay with microRNAs and translation efficiency. Although existing tools can predict m6A at single-base resolution, it is still challenging to extract the biological information surrounding m6A sites."
In silico design of MHC class I high binding affinity peptides through motifs activation map,"Finding peptides with high binding affinity to Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) attracts intensive research, and it serves a crucial part of developing a better vaccine for precision medicine. Traditional methods cost highly for designing such peptides. The advancement of computational approaches reduces the cost of new drug discovery dramatically. Compared with flourishing computational drug discovery area, the immunology area lacks tools focused on in silico design for the peptides with high binding affinity. Attributed to the ever-expanding amount of MHC-peptides binding data, it enables the tremendous influx of deep learning techniques for modeling MHC-peptides binding. To leverage the availability of these data, it is of great significance to find MHC-peptides binding specificities. The binding motifs are one of the key components to decide the MHC-peptides combination, which generally refer to a combination of some certain amino acids at certain sites which highly contribute to the binding affinity."
Predicting adverse drug reactions of combined medication from heterogeneous pharmacologic databases,"Early and accurate identification of potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for combined medication is vital for public health. Existing methods either rely on expensive wet-lab experiments or detecting existing associations from related records. Thus, they inevitably suffer under-reporting, delays in reporting, and inability to detect ADRs for new and rare drugs. The current application of machine learning methods is severely impeded by the lack of proper drug representation and credible negative samples. Therefore, a method to represent drugs properly and to select credible negative samples becomes vital in applying machine learning methods to this problem."
Single-cell gene expression analysis reveals β-cell dysfunction and deficit mechanisms in type 2 diabetes,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the most common chronic diseases. Studies on T2D are mainly built upon bulk-cell data analysis, which measures the average gene expression levels for a population of cells and cannot capture the inter-cell heterogeneity. The single-cell RNA-sequencing technology can provide additional information about the molecular mechanisms of T2D at single-cell level."
A latent allocation model for the analysis of microbial composition and disease,"Establishing the relationship between microbiota and specific diseases is important but requires appropriate statistical methodology. A specialized feature of microbiome count data is the presence of a large number of zeros, which makes it difficult to analyze in case-control studies. Most existing approaches either add a small number called a pseudo-count or use probability models such as the multinomial and Dirichlet-multinomial distributions to explain the excess zero counts, which may produce unnecessary biases and impose a correlation structure taht is unsuitable for microbiome data."
A benchmark study of sequence alignment methods for protein clustering,"Protein sequence alignment analyses have become a crucial step for many bioinformatics studies during the past decades. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and pair-wise sequence alignment (PSA) are two major approaches in sequence alignment. Former benchmark studies revealed drawbacks of MSA methods on nucleotide sequence alignments. To test whether similar drawbacks also influence protein sequence alignment analyses, we propose a new benchmark framework for protein clustering based on cluster validity. This new framework directly reflects the biological ground truth of the application scenarios that adopt sequence alignments, and evaluates the alignment quality according to the achievement of the biological goal, rather than the comparison on sequence level only, which averts the biases introduced by alignment scores or manual alignment templates. Compared with former studies, we calculate the cluster validity score based on sequence distances instead of clustering results. This strategy could avoid the influence brought by different clustering methods thus make results more dependable."
Vaginal microbiome variances in sample groups categorized by clinical criteria of bacterial vaginosis,"One of the most common and recurrent vaginal infections is bacterial vaginosis (BV). The diagnosis is based on changes to the “normal” vaginal microbiome; however, the normal microbiome appears to differ according to reproductive status and ethnicity, and even among individuals within these groups. The Amsel criteria and Nugent score test are widely used for diagnosing BV; however, these tests are based on different criteria, and so may indicate distinct changes in the vaginal microbial community. Nevertheless, few studies have compared the results of these test against metagenomics analysis."
Genotype- and tissue-specific miRNA profiles and their targets in three alfalfa (Medicago sativa L) genotypes,"Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is a forage legume with significant agricultural value worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key components of post-transcriptional gene regulation and essentially regulate many aspects of plant growth and development. Although miRNAs were reported in alfalfa, their expression profiles in different tissues and the discovery of novel miRNAs as well as their targets have not been described in this plant species."
A partially function-to-topic model for protein function prediction,"Proteins are a kind of macromolecules and the main component of a cell, and thus it is the most essential and versatile material of life. The research of protein functions is of great significance in decoding the secret of life. In recent years, researchers have introduced multi-label supervised topic model such as Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Labeled-LDA) into protein function prediction, which can obtain more accurate and explanatory prediction. However, the topic-label corresponding way of Labeled-LDA is associating each label (GO term) with a corresponding topic directly, which makes the latent topics to be completely degenerated, and ignores the differences between labels and latent topics."
Gut microbiome changes in overweight male adults following bowel preparation,"Human gut microbiome has an essential role in human health and disease. Although the major dominant microbiota within individuals have been reported, the change of gut microbiome caused by external factors, such as antibiotic use and bowel cleansing, remains unclear. We conducted this study to investigate the change of gut microbiome in overweight male adults after bowel preparation, where none of the participants had been diagnosed with any systemic diseases."
Revealing transcription factor and histone modification co-localization and dynamics across cell lines by integrating ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data,Interactions among transcription factors (TFs) and histone modifications (HMs) play an important role in the precise regulation of gene expression. The context specificity of those interactions and further its dynamics in normal and disease remains largely unknown. Recent development in genomics technology enables transcription profiling by RNA-seq and protein’s binding profiling by ChIP-seq. Integrative analysis of the two types of data allows us to investigate TFs and HMs interactions both from the genome co-localization and downstream target gene expression.
Poly-victimization among Secondary High School Students in Saudi Arabia,"Poly-victimization can occur during childhood resulting in adverse events on health and well–being. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of past year as well as lifetime prevalence of poly-victimization among adolescents in Saudi Arabia (SA). A cross-sectional study was conducted in the five main provinces of SA. Boys and girls (n = 16,010) from public and private secondary high schools were selected to participate in the study. Nearly three-quarters (72%) experienced poly-victimizations during their lives and two third (66%) during the past year. Participants living with extended family, and living with a biologic and step-parent were 1.3 and 1.9 times respectively more likely to be poly-victimized during their lives and were 1.2 and 1.7 times respectively during the past year. Public policy should be established that encourages social workers and child protection services to screen for poly-victimization in cases of suspected adolescent maltreatment."
Direct evidence of non-disk optical continuum emission around an active black hole,"Accretion onto black holes is key to their growth over cosmic time1, especially during the active galactic nuclei phase when the inflowing material forms a radiatively efficient accretion disk2. To probe the disk, indirect imaging methods such as reverberation mapping3,4,5,6 and microlensing7,8 are required. Recent findings suggest that the disk may be larger than theoretical predictions by a factor of a few4,6,9, thus casting doubt on our understanding of accretion in the general astrophysical context. Whether new physics is implied10,11,12 or poorly understood biases are in effect5,6,13,14 is a longstanding question. Here, we report new reverberation data based on a unique narrowband-imaging design15, and argue that time delays between adjacent optical bands are primarily associated with the reprocessing of light by a farther away under-appreciated non-disk component. This component is associated with high-density photoionized material that is uplifted from the outer accretion disk, probably by radiation-pressure force on dust, and thus may represent the long-sought origin of the broad-line region16. Our findings suggest that the optical phenomenology of some active galactic nuclei may be substantially affected by non-disk continuum emission with implications for measuring the fundamental properties of black holes and their active environs over cosmic time."
Chemotherapy elicits pro-metastatic extracellular vesicles in breast cancer models,"Cytotoxic chemotherapy is an effective treatment for invasive breast cancer. However, experimental studies in mice also suggest that chemotherapy has pro-metastatic effects. Primary tumours release extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, that can facilitate the seeding and growth of metastatic cancer cells in distant organs, but the effects of chemotherapy on tumour-derived EVs remain unclear. Here we show that two classes of cytotoxic drugs broadly employed in pre-operative (neoadjuvant) breast cancer therapy, taxanes and anthracyclines, elicit tumour-derived EVs with enhanced pro-metastatic capacity. Chemotherapy-elicited EVs are enriched in annexin A6 (ANXA6), a Ca2+-dependent protein that promotes NF-κB-dependent endothelial cell activation, Ccl2 induction and Ly6C+CCR2+ monocyte expansion in the pulmonary pre-metastatic niche to facilitate the establishment of lung metastasis. Genetic inactivation of Anxa6 in cancer cells or Ccr2 in host cells blunts the pro-metastatic effects of chemotherapy-elicited EVs. ANXA6 is detected, and potentially enriched, in the circulating EVs of breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy."
Income Elasticity Decomposition Models and Determinants of U.S. Pharmaceutical Expenditures,"Prescription drugs are the third largest component of U.S. healthcare spending, and quickly growing. This novel study provides greater information on consumer behavior in the market for prescription drugs, and how that behavior may vary due to fluctuating economic conditions, using an annual panel dataset. Specifically, the research presented applied the income elasticity decomposition methodology to prescription drug expenditures, deriving both its quality and quantity components. Per capita gross domestic product and median home values were used interchangeably to test whether alternative income concepts affect income elasticity estimates. The system generalized method of moments three-stage least squares estimation results revealed that the: (a) 0.647 short-run income elasticity comprises 0.453 and 0.194 in quantity and quality components; (b) long-run income elasticity estimate of 0.167 has 0.027 and 0.140 quantity and quality components. Pharmaceuticals were found to behave as a necessity and normal good with significant tendencies for long-run consumption shifts towards quality. Further illustrated are supply and demand-side impacts, with policy implications for Medicare and Medicaid programs, among others."
Observation of higher-order topological acoustic states protected by generalized chiral symmetry,"Topological systems are inherently robust to disorder and continuous perturbations, resulting in dissipation-free edge transport of electrons in quantum solids, or reflectionless guiding of photons and phonons in classical wave systems characterized by topological invariants. Recently, a new class of topological materials characterized by bulk polarization has been introduced, and was shown to host higher-order topological corner states. Here, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that 3D-printed two-dimensional acoustic meta-structures can possess nontrivial bulk topological polarization and host one-dimensional edge and Wannier-type second-order zero-dimensional corner states with unique acoustic properties. We observe second-order topological states protected by a generalized chiral symmetry of the meta-structure, which are localized at the corners and are pinned to ‘zero energy’. Interestingly, unlike the ‘zero energy’ states protected by conventional chiral symmetry, the generalized chiral symmetry of our three-atom sublattice enables their spectral overlap with the continuum of bulk states without leakage. Our findings offer possibilities for advanced control of the propagation and manipulation of sound, including within the radiative continuum."
Multiferroic quantum criticality,"The zero-temperature limit of a continuous phase transition is marked by a quantum critical point, which can generate physical effects that extend to elevated temperatures. Magnetic quantum criticality is now well established, and has been explored in systems ranging from heavy fermion metals to quantum Ising materials. Ferroelectric quantum critical behaviour has also been recently demonstrated, motivating a flurry of research investigating its consequences. Here, we introduce the concept of multiferroic quantum criticality, in which both magnetic and ferroelectric quantum criticality occur in the same system. We develop the phenomenology of multiferroic quantum criticality and describe the associated experimental signatures, such as phase stability and modified scaling relations of observables. We propose several material systems that could be tuned to multiferroic quantum criticality utilizing alloying and strain as control parameters. We hope that these results stimulate exploration of the interplay between different kinds of quantum critical behaviours."
Three-dimensional femtosecond laser nanolithography of crystals,"So far, nanostructuring of hard optical crystals has been exclusively limited to their surface, as stress-induced crack formation and propagation render high-precision volume processes ineffective1,2. Here, we show that the rate of nanopore chemical etching in the popular laser crystals yttrium aluminium garnet and sapphire can be enhanced by more than five orders of magnitude (from <0.6 nm h−1 to ~100 µm h−1) by the use of direct laser writing, before etching. The process makes it possible to produce arbitrary three-dimensional nanostructures with 100 nm feature sizes inside centimetre-scale laser crystals without brittle fracture. To showcase the potential of the technique we fabricate subwavelength diffraction gratings and nanostructured optical waveguides in yttrium aluminium garnet and millimetre-long nanopores in sapphire. The approach offers a pathway for transferring concepts from nanophotonics to the fields of solid-state lasers and crystal optics."
Multi-CSAR: a multiple reference-based contig scaffolder using algebraic rearrangements,"One of the important steps in the process of assembling a genome sequence from short reads is scaffolding, in which the contigs in a draft genome are ordered and oriented into scaffolds. Currently, several scaffolding tools based on a single reference genome have been developed. However, a single reference genome may not be sufficient alone for a scaffolder to generate correct scaffolds of a target draft genome, especially when the evolutionary relationship between the target and reference genomes is distant or some rearrangements occur between them. This motivates the need to develop scaffolding tools that can order and orient the contigs of the target genome using multiple reference genomes."
Condition-specific gene co-expression network mining identifies key pathways and regulators in the brain tissue of Alzheimer’s disease patients,"Gene co-expression network (GCN) mining is a systematic approach to efficiently identify novel disease pathways, predict novel gene functions and search for potential disease biomarkers. However, few studies have systematically identified GCNs in multiple brain transcriptomic data of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and looked for their specific functions."
Novel link prediction for large-scale miRNA-lncRNA interaction network in a bipartite graph,"Current knowledge and data on miRNA-lncRNA interactions is still limited and little effort has been made to predict target lncRNAs of miRNAs. Accumulating evidences suggest that the interaction patterns between lncRNAs and miRNAs are closely related to relative expression level, forming a titration mechanism. It could provide an effective approach for characteristic feature extraction. In addition, using the coding non-coding co-expression network and sequence data could also help to measure the similarities among miRNAs and lncRNAs. By mathematically analyzing these types of similarities, we come up with two findings that (i) lncRNAs/miRNAs tend to collaboratively interact with miRNAs/lncRNAs of similar expression profiles, and vice versa, and (ii) those miRNAs interacting with a cluster of common target genes tend to jointly target at the common lncRNAs."
A unified solution for different scenarios of predicting drug-target interactions via triple matrix factorization,"During the identification of potential candidates, computational prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is important to subsequent expensive validation in wet-lab. DTI screening considers four scenarios, depending on whether the drug is an existing or a new drug and whether the target is an existing or a new target. However, existing approaches have the following limitations. First, only a few of them can address the most difficult scenario (i.e., predicting interactions between new drugs and new targets). More importantly, none of the existing approaches could provide the explicit information for understanding the mechanism of forming interactions, such as the drug-target feature pairs contributing to the interactions."
Analysis of significant protein abundance from multiple reaction-monitoring data,"Discovering reliable protein biomarkers is one of the most important issues in biomedical research. The ELISA is a traditional technique for accurate quantitation of well-known proteins. Recently, the multiple reaction-monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry has been proposed for quantifying newly discovered protein and has become a popular alternative to ELISA. For the MRM data analysis, linear mixed modeling (LMM) has been used to analyze MRM data. MSstats is one of the most widely used tools for MRM data analysis that is based on the LMMs. However, LMMs often provide various significance results, depending on model specification. Sometimes it would be difficult to specify a correct LMM method for the analysis of MRM data. Here, we propose a new logistic regression-based method for Significance Analysis of Multiple Reaction Monitoring (LR-SAM)."
Laplacian normalization and bi-random walks on heterogeneous networks for predicting lncRNA-disease associations,Evidences have increasingly indicated that lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) are deeply involved in important biological regulation processes leading to various human complex diseases. Experimental investigations of these disease associated lncRNAs are slow with high costs. Computational methods to infer potential associations between lncRNAs and diseases have become an effective prior-pinpointing approach to the experimental verification.
rPCMP: robust p-value combination by multiple partitions with applications to ATAC-seq data,"Evaluating the significance for a group of genes or proteins in a pathway or biological process for a disease could help researchers understand the mechanism of the disease. For example, identifying related pathways or gene functions for chromatin states of tumor-specific T cells will help determine whether T cells could reprogram or not, and further help design the cancer treatment strategy. Some existing p-value combination methods can be used in this scenario. However, these methods suffer from different disadvantages, and thus it is still challenging to design more powerful and robust statistical method."
Hot spot prediction in protein-protein interactions by an ensemble system,"Hot spot residues are functional sites in protein interaction interfaces. The identification of hot spot residues is time-consuming and laborious using experimental methods. In order to address the issue, many computational methods have been developed to predict hot spot residues. Moreover, most prediction methods are based on structural features, sequence characteristics, and/or other protein features."
Improvement of cancer subtype prediction by incorporating transcriptome expression data and heterogeneous biological networks,"Identification of cancer subtypes is of great importance to facilitate cancer diagnosis and therapy. A number of methods have been proposed to integrate multi-sources data to identify cancer subtypes in recent years. However, few of them consider the regulatory associations between genome features and the contribution weights of different data-views in data integration. It is widely accepted that the regulatory associations between features play important roles in cancer subtype studies. In addition, different data-views may have different contributions in data integration for cancer subtype prediction."
CRlncRNA: a manually curated database of cancer-related long non-coding RNAs with experimental proof of functions on clinicopathological and molecular features,"Recent studies demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) could be intricately implicated in cancer-related molecular networks, and related to cancer occurrence, development and prognosis. However, clinicopathological and molecular features for these cancer-related lncRNAs, which are very important in bridging lncRNA basic research with clinical research, fail to well settle to integration."

The Association Between Adiposity and Inpatient Hospital Costs in the UK Biobank Cohort,"High adiposity is associated with higher risks for a variety of adverse health outcomes, including higher rates of age-adjusted mortality and increased morbidity. This has important implications for the management of healthcare systems, since the endocrinal, cardiometabolic and other changes associated with increased adiposity may be associated with substantial healthcare costs."
Assessment of unsteady Brinkman’s model for flow in karst aquifers,"The Brinkman’s equation simplifies the numerical modeling of karst aquifers by allowing the use of a single transport equation to model the flow of fluids in both the free-flow and porous regions, in effect reducing the error arising from improper modeling of the interface between the two regions. Most equations available to model flow within karst aquifers deal with steady flow conditions. This may not be accurate in aquifers where unsteady conditions exist. We considered the effects of unsteady flow conditions in karst aquifers by assessing the addition of an unsteady flow term to the Brinkman’s equation. We solved the coupled mass conservation-transport equations that models unsteady fluid transport in karst aquifers and studied the effects of unsteady flow conditions on tracer transport in two different sample aquifers and compared to the results obtained from the steady flow Brinkman’s equation. The solution method adopted is sequential and it involves solving the unsteady Brinkman’s model first, followed by the advection-diffusion-adsorption equation using the cell-centered finite volume approach. The first example presented here is a simple aquifer model consisting of a single conduit surrounded by porous regions. The second example is a complicated structure consisting of complex geometrical caves embedded in a highly heterogeneous porous media. The results show that, inside the caves, the unsteady Brinkman’s model yielded lower tracer concentrations at early times when compared to the steady flow model. At longer times, both models produced almost similar results. In particular, the results obtained from the simplified example case (Example 1) indicate that the velocity profiles for unsteady flow within open conduits do not instantly yield a parabolic shape expected from the Brinkman’s equation, but gradually develops into one starting from a linear profile. Results obtained also show that the addition of unsteady flow term to the Brinkman’s model does not affect the flow of tracer within porous media in any significantly observable manner."
Farmacotherapie bij patiënten met een verminderde nierfunctie,"De geschatte glomerulaire filtratiesnelheid (eGFR) is een belangrijk onderdeel van medicamenteus therapiemanagement bij patiënten met een verminderde nierfunctie. Als de patiënt met een verminderde nierfunctie een geneesmiddel nodig heeft, kan een niet-renaal uitgescheiden middel een effectief en veiliger alternatief vormen voor een renaal uitgescheiden geneesmiddel. Wanneer toch een renaal uitgescheiden geneesmiddel nodig is, zult u eerst moeten nagaan of de eGFR een realistische weergave is van de nierfunctie. Daarna bepaalt u de dosering van het geneesmiddel in relatie tot: 1) het therapeutisch venster van het geneesmiddel, 2) de snelheid waarmee het doel van de farmacotherapie bereikt dient te worden en 3) de mogelijkheid tot het monitoren van bijwerkingen en de effectiviteit. Deze overwegingen zijn ook van belang bij chronische farmacotherapie, waarbij u de dosering in de loop van de tijd gradueel moet aanpassen aan de afname van de nierfunctie. Bij geneesmiddelen met een smalle therapeutische breedte moet u bij voorkeur een lagere dosering voorschrijven als de indicatie dat toelaat."
Modelling of non-premixed turbulent combustion with Conditional Moment Closure (CMC)⋆,"Conditional Moment Closure (CMC), an advanced turbulent reacting flow method, has been applied to the challenging cases with a varying degree of turbulence-chemistry interactions. The CMC approach may be used either in the RAMS or LES context, this is reviewed in the first part of this paper, while the second part is dedicated to applications on Sandia piloted jet flames D and F and lifted hydrogen jet flame. In case of the Sandia piloted jet flame D, the RANS-CMC simulation results are in agreement with the experimental data. On the other hand, when one comes to the results for the Sandia flame F, extinction is not captured. These discrepancies are attributed to the use of RANS in combination with the boundary conditions set in CMC. However, in case of turbulent lifted jet flame in vitiated co-flow, the LES-CMC model is able to capture the axial and radial profiles of mixture fraction, temperature and major species. The lift-off height is found to be very sensitive to the co-flow temperature as well as the co-flow velocity. The LES-CMC results highlight the potential of the technique to simulate the problems which involve complex turbulence-chemistry interactions."

Modeling of the Heat-Affected and Thermomechanically Affected Zones in a Ti-6Al-4V Inertia Friction Weld,"Inertia friction welding has been used across the aerospace, automotive, and power-generation industries for the fabrication of complex axisymmetric components for over forty years. The process involves one axisymmetric piece being held stationary and another piece being brought into contact set to rotate about its axis of symmetry by a flywheel with the system under an applied load across the joint. Plasticization at the joint interface through the frictional heating sees the two pieces bond together. The titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V has been widely studied for inertia welding applications. A successful selection of processing parameters (flywheel energy and mass, applied load) allows an inertia welding process which produces a very high-integrity weld, with a minimal heat-affected zone (HAZ) and thermomechanically affected zone (TMAZ), formed as a narrow band at the interface and extending further into the material. The width of this narrow band of heated material is dependent upon the process parameters used. A series of experimental inertia friction welds were performed using Ti-6Al-4V, and a finite element (FE) modeling framework was developed using the FE code Deform in order to predict the widths of the HAZ and TMAZ at the weld interface. The experimentally observed HAZ boundaries were correlated with the thermal fields from the FE model, while TMAZ boundaries were correlated with the Von Mises plastic strain fields."

Recent findings suggest that the disk may be larger than theoretical predictions by a factor of a few4,6,9, thus casting doubt on our understanding of accretion in the general astrophysical context. Whether new physics is implied10,11,12 or poorly understood biases are in effect5,6,13,14 is a longstanding question. Here, we report new reverberation data based on a unique narrowband-imaging design15, and argue that time delays between adjacent optical bands are primarily associated with the reprocessing of light by a farther away under-appreciated non-disk component. This component is associated with high-density photoionized material that is uplifted from the outer accretion disk, probably by radiation-pressure force on dust, and thus may represent the long-sought origin of the broad-line region16. Our findings suggest that the optical phenomenology of some active galactic nuclei may be substantially affected by non-disk continuum emission with implications for measuring the fundamental properties of black holes and their active environs over cosmic time."
Chemotherapy elicits pro-metastatic extracellular vesicles in breast cancer models,"Cytotoxic chemotherapy is an effective treatment for invasive breast cancer. However, experimental studies in mice also suggest that chemotherapy has pro-metastatic effects. Primary tumours release extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, that can facilitate the seeding and growth of metastatic cancer cells in distant organs, but the effects of chemotherapy on tumour-derived EVs remain unclear. Here we show that two classes of cytotoxic drugs broadly employed in pre-operative (neoadjuvant) breast cancer therapy, taxanes and anthracyclines, elicit tumour-derived EVs with enhanced pro-metastatic capacity. Chemotherapy-elicited EVs are enriched in annexin A6 (ANXA6), a Ca2+-dependent protein that promotes NF-κB-dependent endothelial cell activation, Ccl2 induction and Ly6C+CCR2+ monocyte expansion in the pulmonary pre-metastatic niche to facilitate the establishment of lung metastasis. Genetic inactivation of Anxa6 in cancer cells or Ccr2 in host cells blunts the pro-metastatic effects of chemotherapy-elicited EVs. ANXA6 is detected, and potentially enriched, in the circulating EVs of breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy."
A warped disk around an infant protostar,"Recent exoplanet studies have revealed that the orbital planes of planets are not always aligned with one another or with the equatorial plane of the central star. The misalignment has been ascribed to gravitational scattering by giant planets and/or companion stars1,2,3 or to fly-bys in stellar cluster environments4. Alternatively, the misalignment could be natal: that is, such planets were born in a warped protostellar disk5,6. Warped disk structures have been reported in some transition disks and protoplanetary disks7,8, but not in the earlier stages of protostar evolution, although such a possibility is suggested by outflow morphology9,10. Here we report millimetre-wavelength dust continuum observations of the young embedded protostar IRAS 04368+2557 in the protostellar core L1527 at a distance11 of 137 parsecs; the protostar’s disk is almost edge-on12,13,14,15,16. The inner and outer parts of the disk have slightly different orbital planes, connected at 40 to 60 astronomical units from the star, but the disk has point symmetry with respect to the position of the protostar. We interpret it as a warped disk that is rotationally supported. Because there is no evidence for a companion source17,18, the warped structure must be due to either anisotropic accretion of gas with different rotational axes, or misalignment of the rotation axis of the disk with the magnetic field direction."
Structure of the post-translational protein translocation machinery of the ER membrane,"Many proteins must translocate through the protein-conducting Sec61 channel in the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum membrane or the SecY channel in the prokaryotic plasma membrane1,2. Proteins with highly hydrophobic signal sequences are first recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP)3,4 and then moved co-translationally through the Sec61 or SecY channel by the associated translating ribosome. Substrates with less hydrophobic signal sequences bypass the SRP and are moved through the channel post-translationally5,6. In eukaryotic cells, post-translational translocation is mediated by the association of the Sec61 channel with another membrane protein complex, the Sec62–Sec63 complex7,8,9, and substrates are moved through the channel by the luminal BiP ATPase9. How the Sec62–Sec63 complex activates the Sec61 channel for post-translational translocation is not known. Here we report the electron cryo-microscopy structure of the Sec complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, consisting of the Sec61 channel and the Sec62, Sec63, Sec71 and Sec72 proteins. Sec63 causes wide opening of the lateral gate of the Sec61 channel, priming it for the passage of low-hydrophobicity signal sequences into the lipid phase, without displacing the channel’s plug domain. Lateral channel opening is triggered by Sec63 interacting both with cytosolic loops in the C-terminal half of Sec61 and transmembrane segments in the N-terminal half of the Sec61 channel. The cytosolic Brl domain of Sec63 blocks ribosome binding to the channel and recruits Sec71 and Sec72, positioning them for the capture of polypeptides associated with cytosolic Hsp7010. Our structure shows how the Sec61 channel is activated for post-translational protein translocation."
Noncanonical CTD kinases regulate RNA polymerase II in a gene-class-specific manner,"Phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) governs stage-specific interactions with different cellular machines. The CTD consists of Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 heptad repeats and sequential phosphorylations of Ser7, Ser5 and Ser2 occur universally at Pol II-transcribed genes. Phosphorylation of Thr4, however, appears to selectively modulate transcription of specific classes of genes. Here, we identify ten new Thr4 kinases from different kinase structural groups. Irreversible chemical inhibition of the most active Thr4 kinase, Hrr25, reveals a novel role for this kinase in transcription termination of specific class of noncoding snoRNA genes. Genome-wide profiles of Hrr25 reveal a selective enrichment at 3ʹ regions of noncoding genes that display termination defects. Importantly, phospho-Thr4 marks placed by Hrr25 are recognized by Rtt103, a key component of the termination machinery. Our results suggest that these uncommon CTD kinases place phospho-Thr4 marks to regulate expression of targeted genes."
Protein markers and risk of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes: a targeted proteomics approach in the KORA F4/FF4 study,"The objective of the present study was to identify proteins that contribute to pathophysiology and allow prediction of incident type 2 diabetes or incident prediabetes. We quantified 14 candidate proteins using targeted mass spectrometry in plasma samples of the prospective, population-based German KORA F4/FF4 study (6.5-year follow-up). 892 participants aged 42–81 years were selected using a case-cohort design, including 123 persons with incident type 2 diabetes and 255 persons with incident WHO-defined prediabetes. Prospective associations between protein levels and diabetes, prediabetes as well as continuous fasting and 2 h glucose, fasting insulin and insulin resistance were investigated using regression models adjusted for established risk factors. The best predictive panel of proteins on top of a non-invasive risk factor model or on top of HbA1c, age, and sex was selected. Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase (MASP) levels were positively associated with both incident type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. Adiponectin was inversely associated with incident type 2 diabetes. MASP, adiponectin, apolipoprotein A-IV, apolipoprotein C-II, C-reactive protein, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase D1 were associated with individual continuous outcomes. The combination of MASP, apolipoprotein E (apoE) and adiponectin improved diabetes prediction on top of both reference models, while prediabetes prediction was improved by MASP plus CRP on top of the HbA1c model. In conclusion, our mass spectrometric approach revealed a novel association of MASP with incident type 2 diabetes and incident prediabetes. In combination, MASP, adiponectin and apoE improved type 2 diabetes prediction beyond non-invasive risk factors or HbA1c, age and sex."
Transcription-dependent regulation of replication dynamics modulates genome stability,"Common fragile sites (CFSs) are loci that are hypersensitive to replication stress and hotspots for chromosomal rearrangements in cancers. CFSs replicate late in S phase, are cell-type specific and nest in large genes. The relative impact of transcription–replication conflicts versus a low density in initiation events on fragility is currently debated. Here we addressed the relationships between transcription, replication, and instability by manipulating the transcription of endogenous large genes in chicken and human cells. We found that inducing low transcription with a weak promoter destabilized large genes, whereas stimulating their transcription with strong promoters alleviated instability. Notably, strong promoters triggered a switch to an earlier replication timing, supporting a model in which high transcription levels give cells more time to complete replication before mitosis. Transcription could therefore contribute to maintaining genome integrity, challenging the dominant view that it is exclusively a threat."
Structure of yeast cytochrome c oxidase in a supercomplex with cytochrome bc1,"Cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV, CIV) is known in mammals to exist independently or in association with other respiratory proteins to form supercomplexes (SCs). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CIV is found solely in an SC with cytochrome bc1 (complex III, CIII). Here, we present the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of S. cerevisiae CIV in a III2IV2 SC at 3.3 Å resolution. While overall similarity to mammalian homologs is high, we found notable differences in the supernumerary subunits Cox26 and Cox13; the latter exhibits a unique arrangement that precludes CIV dimerization as seen in bovine. A conformational shift in the matrix domain of Cox5A—involved in allosteric inhibition by ATP—may arise from its association with CIII. The CIII–CIV arrangement highlights a conserved interaction interface of CIII, albeit one occupied by complex I in mammalian respirasomes. We discuss our findings in the context of the potential impact of SC formation on CIV regulation."
On Time Series Analysis for Repeated Surveys,"Governments and other agencies repeated many important surveys at regular time intervals, but the population mean is estimated mainly using the latest survey. Time series estimators for the population mean using repeated surveys are superior to those obtained from the last survey. This superiority may be affected by several factors such as the sampling variance, the number of surveys, and the Auto Regressive Moving Average ARMA model coefficients and orders among others. The main objective of the paper is to compare the time series estimator for repeated surveys developed by Scott et al. (A.J. Scott, T.M.F. Smith, R.G. Jones, Int. Stat. Rev. 45 (1977), 13–28.) and the last survey estimator using extensive simulation studies. Furthermore, the impact of the factors that may affect the efficiency of the time series estimator is also investigated."
Estimation of a Finite Population Proportion in Light of Randomized Reporting,"In large scale surveys, it is customary to accept unaltered the responses provided by the respondents, leaving no provision for investigators to pass on any circumstantial judgment on the responses. This restrictive practice sometimes vitiates the estimation of a parameter. Here we consider a real life scenario in which the data gathering process is compounded by possible interventions by investigators/supervisors who may provide thoughtful judgments on the quality/category of the response given by a respondent. In this modified scenario, we address the problem of estimating the unknown population proportion P. In the context of an illustrative example, we develop a possible randomization theory and computational formulas to estimate P under intervention effects."
An Estimation of the Burden of Sports Injuries among African Adolescents,"The extent to which sports injuries contribute to the burden of injury among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is unknown. The goal of this study was to estimate the incidence of sports injuries among adolescents in Africa. Data from the World Health Organization Global School-Based Student Health surveys were used to estimate the annual number of African adolescents sustaining sports injuries. Gender-stratified injury rates were calculated and applied to every African country’s adolescent population to estimate country-specific and continent-wide injury totals. A total of 21,858 males and 24,691 females from 14 countries were included in the analysis. Country-specific annual sports injury rates ranged from 13.5% to 38.1% in males and 5.2% to 20.2% in females. Weighted average sports injury rates for males and females were 23.7% (95% CI 23.1%–24.2%) and 12.5% (95% CI 12.1%–12.9%), respectively. When these rates were extrapolated to the adolescent populations of the African continent, an estimated 15,477,798 (95% CI 15,085,955–15,804,333) males and 7,943,625 (95% CI 7,689,429–8,197,821) females sustained sports injuries. Our findings suggest that over 23 million African adolescents sustained sports injuries annually. Further work will help to more precisely define the burden of sports injuries in LMICs and the role that surgery can play in mitigating this burden."
"The Predictive Value of Personality Traits for Psychological Problems (Stress, Anxiety and Depression): Results from a Large Population Based Study","The current study aimed to determine the prognostic values of personality traits for common psychological problems in a large sample of Iranian adult. In a large sample of healthy people (n = 4763) who lived in Isfahan province; the NEO-FFI was used to assess the personality traits; depression and anxiety were assessed using the “Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)” also stress was measured through Persian validated version of General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (ROC) analysis was used as main statistical method for data analysis. ROC analysis showed neuroticism was the best predictor for all psychological problems with highest area under the curve (AUC) (95% confdence interval) for stress, 0.837 (0.837–0.851), anxiety 0.861 (0.847–0.876) and depression 0.833 (0.820–0.846) (p < .001) and the corresponding cut-off points (sensitivity, specificity), were 21.5 (77%, 66%), 22.5 (81%, 77%) and 20.5 (77%, 74%), respectively. Other personality traits were significant protective factors for being affected with psychological problems (p < .001). Similar findings were observed separately in women and men. The present study showed that the neuroticism is significant risk factor for being affected with three psychological problems while other traits are significant protective factors. Personality traits are useful indices for screening psychological problems and an effective pathway toward prevention in general population."
Armed Conflict in Central America and Immigrant Food Insecurity in the United States,"Central American immigrants to the United States are a growing population with rates of food insecurity that exceed national averages. We analyzed multiple years of data from the Center for System Peace and the Current Population Survey, Food Security Survey Module, from 1998 to 2015. We used ordered probit and probit regressions to quantify associations between premigration residence in a country exposed to armed conflict in Central America and the food insecurity of immigrants in the United States. The study sample included 5682 females and 5801 males between the ages of 19 and 69 years who were born in Central America and migrated to the United States. The mean age of individuals included in the study sample was 38.2 years for females (standard deviation, 11.0) and 36.8 years for males (standard deviation, 10.6). Premigration armed conflict was associated with a 10.7% point increase in postmigration food insecurity among females (95% confidence interval, 6.8–14.5), and a 9.5% point increase among males (95% confidence interval, 5.0–14.0)."
Epidemiology of Meningitis in Oman—Implications for Future Surveillance,This study aimed to understand the epidemiology of meningitis cases admitted to hospitals in Oman and to identify any changing microbial patterns from the introduction of the new vaccines.
The Rise of Noncommunicable Diseases in Kenya: An Examination of the Time Trends and Contribution of the Changes in Diet and Physical Inactivity,"This study examined correlations of historical changes in diet and physical inactivity with the rise of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in Kenya. Historical data on diet, wage jobs by industry, urbanization, gross domestic product (GDP), and morbidity due to NCDs were extracted from Kenya Statistical Abstracts, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAOSTAT), and the World Bank online database. These data were plotted and correlations between these factors and the incidence of different NCDs over time were evaluated. There was a rapid rise in the incidence of circulatory disease starting in 2001, and of hypertension and diabetes starting in 2008. Te rise of these NCDs, especially hypertension and diabetes, was accompanied over the same period by a rise in per capita GDP and physical inactivity (as measured by increased urbanization and declining proportion of agricultural and forestry wage jobs); a rise in per capita supply of rice, wheat and its products, and cooking oils; and a decline in the per capita supply of maize and sugar. In conclusion, the positive correlations between indicators of dietary consumption and physical inactivity and rates of hypertension, circulatory disease, and diabetes suggest that the rapid rise of NCDs in Kenya may be, in part, due to changes in these modifable factors."
An Exposure Appraisal of Outdoor Air Pollution on the Respiratory Well-being of a Developing City Population,"Zaria is the educational hub of northern Nigeria. It is a developing city with a pollution level high enough to be ranked amongst the World Health Organization’s (WHO) most polluted cities. The study appraised the influence of outdoor air pollution on the respiratory well-being of a population in a limited resource environment. With the approved ethics, the techniques utilized were: portable pollutant monitors, respiratory health records, WHO AirQ+ software, and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) questionnaire. They were utilized to acquire day-time weighted outdoor pollution levels, health respiratory cases, assumed baseline incidence (BI), and exposure respiratory symptoms among selected study participants respectively. The study revealed an average respiratory illness incidence rate of 607 per 100,000 cases. Findings showed that an average of 2648 cases could have been avoided if the theoretical WHO threshold limit for the particulate matter with diameter of <2.5/10 micron (PM2.5/PM10) were adhered to. Using the questionnaire survey, phlegm was identified as the predominant respiratory symptom. A regression analysis showed that the criteria pollutant PM2.5, was the most predominant cause of respiratory symptoms among interviewed respondents. The study logistics revealed that outdoor pollution is significantly associated with respiratory well-being of the study population in Zaria, Nigeria."
On the Lindley Record Values and Associated Inference,"In this paper, we discuss the record values arising from the Lindley distribution. We compute the means, variances and covariances of the record values. These values are used to compute the best linear unbiased estimators (BLUEs) and the best linear invariant estimators (BLIEs) of the location and scale parameters. By using the BLUEs and BLIEs, we construct confidence intervals for the location and scale parameters through Monte Carlo simulations. Prediction for the future records is also discussed."
On Properties and Applications of a Two-Parameter Xgamma Distribution,"An existing one-parameter probability distribution can be very well generalized by adding an extra parameter in it and, in turn, the two-parameter family of distributions, thus obtained, provides added flexibility in modeling real life data. In this article, we propose and study a two-parameter generalization of xgamma distribution [1] and utilize it in modeling time-to-event data sets. Along with the different structural and distributional properties of the proposed two-parameter xgamma distribution, we concentrate in studying useful survival and reliability properties, such as hazard rate, reversed hazard rate, stress-strength reliability etc. Two methods of estimation, viz. maximum likelihood and method of moments, are been suggested for estimating unknown parameters. Distributions of order statistics, stochastic order relationships are investigated for the proposed model. A Monte-Carlo simulation study is carried out to observe the trends in estimation process. Two real life time-to-event data sets are analyzed and the proposed model is compared with some other two-parameter lifetime models in the literature."
"Bayesian Premium Estimators for Mixture of Two Gamma Distributions Under Squared Error, Entropy and Linex Loss Functions: With Informative and Non Informative Priors","In this paper, we consider the Zeghdoudi distribution as the conditional distribution of Xn |  θ, we focus on estimation of the Bayesian premium under three loss functions (squared error which is symmetric, Linex and entropy, which are asymmetric), using non-informative and informative priors (the extension of Jeffreys and Gamma priors) respectively. Because of its difficulty and non linearity, we use a numerical approximation for computing the Bayesian premium."
Efficient Estimator of Parameters of a Multivariate Geometric Distribution,The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) for the parameters of a multivariate geometric distribution (MGD) have been derived. A modification of the MLE estimator (modified MLE) has been derived in which case the bias is reduced. The mean square error (MSE) of the modified MLE is less than the MSE of the MLE. Variances of the parameters and the corresponding generalized variance (GV) has been obtained. It has been shown that the MLE and modified MLE are consistent estimators. A comparison of the GVs of modified MLE and UMVUE has shown that the modified MLE is more efficient than the UMVUE. In the final section its application has been discussed with an example of actual data.
Recurrent unintended pregnancies among young unmarried women serving in the Israeli military,"Unintended pregnancy is a major public health problem with known risk factors, however, little is known about the prevalence of variables associated with recurrent unintended pregnancy (RUP) among young, unmarried women."
Collodion baby treated at a tertiary hospital in Tanzania: a case report,"The term “collodion baby” is used to describe a newborn covered with a translucent, parchment-like skin sheet. It is an extremely rare condition with an estimated incidence of 1 in 300,000 live births. Clinically, the baby will present with a collodion membrane with fissures, ectropium, eclabium, and hypoplastic digits. Shedding of the membrane increases risk of dehydration and infection."
Carbohydrate composition of mucus from scleractinian corals from the central Red Sea,"Coral mucus is continuously released by most corals and acts as an important protective barrier and as a substrate for host-associated microbial communities due to its complex composition of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. On a reef scale, coral mucus functions as a particle trap, thereby retaining nutrients and energy in the ecosystem. Given the distinct environmental conditions in the Red Sea (high temperature, high salinity, high total alkalinity), we sought to investigate the carbohydrate composition of mucus from five corals from the central Red Sea. Our aim was to assess whether mucus from Red Sea corals is different from what is known from other corals and whether those differences could be aligned to putative beneficial functions with regard to the prevailing environment. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, we detected nine sugars as the main prevalent carbohydrates. Although we detected significant differences between species with regard to the relative abundance of given carbohydrates, the identified sugars resembled those found in mucus from corals elsewhere, and we could corroborate high abundance of arabinose in acroporid corals. Taken together, our results suggest the presence of a common set of carbohydrates across a broad range of coral species from geographically diverse environments, highlighting the important role of mucus with regard to coral and reef ecosystem function."
Single-Trial Recognition of Imagined Forces and Speeds of Hand Clenching Based on Brain Topography and Brain Network,"To provide optional force and speed control parameters for brain–computer interfaces (BCIs), an effective feature extraction method of imagined force and speed of hand clenching based on electroencephalography (EEG) was explored. Twenty subjects were recruited to participate in the experiment. They were instructed to perform three different actual/imagined hand clenching force tasks (4 kg, 10 kg, and 16 kg) and three different hand clenching speed tasks (0.5 Hz, 1 Hz, and 2 Hz). Topographical maps parameters and brain network parameters of EEG were calculated as new features of imagined force and speed of hand clenching, which were classified by three classifiers: linear discrimination analysis, extreme learning machines and support vector machines. Topographical maps parameters were better for recognition of the hand clenching force task, while brain network parameters were better for recognition of the hand clenching speed task. After a combination of five types of features (energy, power spectrum of the autoregressive model, wavelet packet coefficients, topographical maps parameters and brain network parameters), the recognition rate of the hand clenching force task was 97%, and that of the hand clenching speed task was as high as 100%. The brain topographical and the brain network parameters are expected to improve the accuracy of decoding the EEG signal of imagined force and speed of hand clenching. A more efficient brain network may facilitate the recognition of force/speed of hand clenching. Combined features could significantly improve the single-trial recognition rate of imagined forces and speeds of hand clenching. The current study provides a new idea for the imagined force and speed of hand clenching that offers more control intention instructions for BCIs."
New automated method for extracting river information using optimized spectral threshold water index,"The accurate extraction of mountain river information is highly significant in water resource investigation and ecological environment protection. However, there are some problems in the existing methods of river information extraction, which are mainly the interference from shadows and buildings. Such interference leads to erroneous and redundant extraction of river information, which leads to inaccuracy or incompleteness. In this study, a precise extraction method of mountain river information is established using Landsat8 image and digital elevation model. The main steps of the river extraction method are as follows: (1) we propose the optimized spectral threshold water index to extract river information; (2) based on digital elevation model data, we simulate the mountain shadows of the study area to remove interference from them; (3) we establish the buffer zone of the river network using digital elevation model data to solve the problem of redundant extraction of river information; (4) we separately calculate and then standardize land surface temperature, albedo, and normalized different building index. The effects of buildings near the river are removed. Results show a relative accuracy of 97.52%. The new method decreases the interference of mountain shadows and buildings."
Milde tot matige nierschade,"Inleiding Leven met chronische nierschade vraagt zelfmanagement en dus kennis over de aandoening, maar veel patiënten hebben vermoedelijk onvoldoende kennis. De onderzoekers gingen na welke kennis, gedachten en ervaringen patiënten met nierschade hebben, en hoe zij de informatievoorziening over chronische nierschade beleven."
Study on the enhancement of photocatalytic environment purification through ubiquitous-red-clay loading,"Tungsten oxide (WO3) is regarded as a promising visible-light-sensitive photocatalyst, but its activity is not high. Further enhancement of its activity has been anticipated using techniques such as loading of a cocatalyst to apply the oxide to indoor environmental remediation; Pt has been reported as a good cocatalyst for WO3 photocatalysis. However, Pt is precious and expensive metal. Thus, in this study, we sought to find a ubiquitous cocatalyst and suitable photocatalyst system. As a result, this study revealed that loading a ubiquitous material of red-clay enhanced WO3 photocatalytic activity remarkably. As photocatalyst samples, mixtures consisting of the clay and WO3 with different weight ratios were prepared using a simple kneading method. Their photocatalytic activity was evaluated from decomposition of harmful organic contaminant, 2-propanol into CO2 under visible-light irradiation. The WO3 with 10% of the clay loading showed the highest activity among the samples and much higher activity than pure WO3. This higher activity might derive from the clay’s promotion of H2O2 decomposition and charge separation (holes and electrons). The H2O2 was generated from photocatalytic O2 reduction. This formation and accumulation on the pure WO3 surface led to decreased activity."
Convolutional neural network based on SMILES representation of compounds for detecting chemical motif,"Previous studies have suggested deep learning to be a highly effective approach for screening lead compounds for new drugs. Several deep learning models have been developed by addressing the use of various kinds of fingerprints and graph convolution architectures. However, these methods are either advantageous or disadvantageous depending on whether they (1) can distinguish structural differences including chirality of compounds, and (2) can automatically discover effective features."
Classifying early and late mild cognitive impairment stages of Alzheimer’s disease by fusing default mode networks extracted with multiple seeds,"The default mode network (DMN) in resting state has been increasingly used in disease diagnosis since it was found in 2001. Prior work has mainly focused on extracting a single DMN with various techniques. However, by using seeding-based analysis with more than one desirable seed, we can obtain multiple DMNs, which are likely to have complementary information, and thus are more promising for disease diagnosis. In the study, we used 18 early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) participants and 18 late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) participants of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). First, we used seeding-based analysis with four seeds to extract four DMNs for each subject. Then, we conducted fusion analysis for all different combinations of the four DMNs. Finally, we carried out nonlinear support vector machine classification based on the mixing coefficients from the fusion analysis."
Estimating heterogeneous treatment effect by balancing heterogeneity and fitness,"Estimating heterogeneous treatment effect is a fundamental problem in biological and medical applications. Recently, several recursive partitioning methods have been proposed to identify the subgroups that respond differently towards a treatment, and they rely on a fitness criterion to minimize the error between the estimated treatment effects and the unobservable ground truths."
On the Non-trivial Origin of Atomic-Scale Patterns in Friction Force Microscopy,"Friction between two surfaces is due to nano- and micro-asperities at the interface that establish true contact and are responsible for the energy dissipation. To understand the friction mechanism, often single-asperity model experiments are conducted in atomic-force microscopes. Here, we show that the conventional interpretation of the typical results of such experiments, based on a simple mass-spring model, hides a fundamental contradiction. Via an estimate of the order of magnitude of the dissipative forces required to produce atomic-scale patterns in the stick-slip motion of a frictional nano-contact, we find that the energy dissipation must be dominated by a very small, highly dynamic mass at the very end of the asperity. Our conclusion casts new light on the behavior of sliding surfaces and invites us to speculate about new ways to control friction by manipulation of the contact geometry."
Thyroid stunning in radioiodine-131 therapy of benign thyroid diseases,"Existence and cause of thyroid stunning was controversially discussed for decades but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Numerous studies describe thyroid stunning in radioiodine-131 therapy (RIT) of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. However, there are no studies evaluating thyroid stunning in benign thyroid diseases caused by the radioiodine uptake test (RIUT). Therefore, the influence of pre-therapeutic tracer radiation dose on therapeutic iodine-131 uptake was evaluated retrospectively."
The Effect of a Regimen of Antifungal Cream Use on Episodes of Acute Adenolymphangitis (ADL) among Lymphedema Patients: An Application Using Marginal Structural Models,"Episodes of adenolymphangitis (ADL) are a recurrent clinical aspect of lymphatic filariasis (LF) and a risk factor for progression of lymphedema. Inter-digital entry lesions, often found on the web spaces between the toes of those suffering from lymphedema, have been shown to contribute to the occurrence of ADL episodes. Use of antifungal cream on lesions is often promoted as a critical component of lymphedema management. Our objective was to estimate the observed effect of antifungal cream use on ADL episodes according to treatment regimen among a cohort of lymphedema patients enrolled in a morbidity management program. We estimated this effect using marginal structural models for time varying confounding. In this longitudinal study, we estimate that for every one-unit increase in the number of times one was compliant to cream use through 12 months, there was a 23% (RR = 0.77 (0.62, 0.96)) decrease in the number of ADL episodes at 18 months, however the RR’s were not statistically significant at other study time points. Traditionally adjusted models produced a non-significant RR closer to the null at all time points. This is the first study to estimate the effect of a regimen of antifungal cream on the frequency of ADL episodes. This study also highlights the importance of the consideration and proper handling of time-varying confounders in longitudinal observational studies."
"Prescribing Patterns for Acute Respiratory Infections in Children in Primary Health Care Centers, Makkah Al Mukarramah, Saudi Arabia","Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are a major public health problem and one of the commonest reasons for visiting primary health care centers (PHC). In developing countries, seventy-five percent of the cases are treated with antibiotics, although the majority are caused by viral infection. Our aim was to observe the pattern of physician practices with respect to ARI, in comparison to WHO protocols and to provide recommendations for health promotion enhancement. The study was conducted in Makkah PHC centers, for 2 months. A total 14 PHC centers were randomly selected. And 908 prescriptions were obtained randomly from general practitioners (GP) and analyzed. We found that males were 522 and females were and 386. Weights were not recorded in 224 (24.7%) cases. In 87 cases (9.6%) no diagnosis was recorded. In 515 (62.34%) of cases, antibiotics were prescribed; most of these cases were of simple common cold, with antibiotics not recommended. To conclude, many physicians in Makkah are not following the WHO guidelines for Acute Respiratory Infection. Educational health programs should be conducted to sensitize the physicians regarding the appropriate method of diagnosis and rational use of antibiotics."
Clinical Decision-making among Emergency Physicians: Experiential or Rational?,"It has been postulated that everyone has an affinity for one of two cognitive approaches: experiential (intuitive) or rational (conscious). The aim of this study was to analyze the thinking processes of Saudi emergency physicians at nine hospitals in Riyadh. This was a cross-sectional study, which was undertaken in Riyadh using a psychometric tool called the Rational–Experiential Inventory-40. The survey, sent by e-mail to 202 emergency physicians, had a 53% response rate. Most respondents were male (86%). The total surveyed participants included consultants (36%), associate consultants (19%), registrars, fellow or staff physicians (7%), and residents (38%). The results found a mean (standard deviation) score of 3.73 (0.51) for rational approaches to decision-making and 3.09 (0.45) for experiential approaches among the emergency physicians surveyed. The difference of 0.46 between the two scores was not statistically significant (p = 0.23). Female emergency physicians tended toward slower logical thinking (rational). Consultant emergency physicians had a higher score for fast intuitive automatic thinking (experiential) than nonconsultant physicians. This was statistically significant, t105 = 2.1, p = 0.4. Our results suggest that although both thinking styles are used in clinical decision-making, consultant emergency physicians prefer rational approaches to decision-making."
Pattern of Antidepressant Utilization and Cost in Iran from 2006 to 2013 in Comparison with Other Countries,"Antidepressant prescribing patterns have changed globally over the past few years, with conventional drugs including tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors being replaced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and novel antidepressants. The objective of this study was to assess antidepressant utilization in Iran from 2006 to 2013 and to show Iran’s situation in antidepressant consumption compared with other countries. A cross-sectional study was undertaken using prescription claims data from Iranian insurance agencies. In addition, total antidepressant sales data were obtained from the databank of the national regulatory authority. Medicines were classified according to the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC-2012 edition) System. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data were used to compare national results from Iran with other countries. Antidepressant sales were four-fold higher than those of prescribed antidepressants [24 defined daily doses (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/day were sold whereas 6 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day were prescribed in 2013]. The trend in antidepressant prescriptions and consumption showed increasing use of SSRIs (N06AB). Nortriptyline, fluoxetine, and citalopram accounted for more than 60% of all prescriptions each year. The type of adverse reactions with new expensive antidepressants may seem convincing for the growing tendency toward using these medicines, but considering their high costs, health policymakers have to be aware of the risk of overprescription of newer antidepressant. Drivers of over-the-counter purchase of antidepressants need to be explored."
Unravelling the link between global rubber price and tropical deforestation in Cambodia,"Tropical forests continue to undergo a rapid transformation. The expansion of rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations has been reported as a major driver of forest loss, linked to a boom in market demand. Distant commodity markets have spurred a surge of large-scale economic land concessions granted throughout tropical Southeast Asia. Using satellite imagery, we show the impact of rubber tree plantations on Cambodian forest cover and analyse how annual forest-to-rubber conversion rates relate to global rubber prices from 2001 to 2015. We found that 23.5 ± 1.8% of national forest cover was cleared in this period, with 23.2 ± 3.6% of cleared forest converted to rubber plantations. Annual forest-to-rubber conversion rates closely correlated with global rubber prices, with a time lag of 8–9 months (Pearson’s r = 0.93). Our results reveal a strong link between global commodity markets and tropical forest loss, particularly in countries with land policies geared towards rapid development."
Sunflower pan-genome analysis shows that hybridization altered gene content and disease resistance,"Domesticated plants and animals often display dramatic responses to selection, but the origins of the genetic diversity underlying these responses remain poorly understood. Despite domestication and improvement bottlenecks, the cultivated sunflower remains highly variable genetically, possibly due to hybridization with wild relatives. To characterize genetic diversity in the sunflower and to quantify contributions from wild relatives, we sequenced 287 cultivated lines, 17 Native American landraces and 189 wild accessions representing 11 compatible wild species. Cultivar sequences failing to map to the sunflower reference were assembled de novo for each genotype to determine the gene repertoire, or ‘pan-genome’, of the cultivated sunflower. Assembled genes were then compared to the wild species to estimate origins. Results indicate that the cultivated sunflower pan-genome comprises 61,205 genes, of which 27% vary across genotypes. Approximately 10% of the cultivated sunflower pan-genome is derived through introgression from wild sunflower species, and 1.5% of genes originated solely through introgression. Gene ontology functional analyses further indicate that genes associated with biotic resistance are over-represented among introgressed regions, an observation consistent with breeding records. Analyses of allelic variation associated with downy mildew resistance provide an example in which such introgressions have contributed to resistance to a globally challenging disease."
Algal photoprotection is regulated by the E3 ligase CUL4–DDB1DET1,"Light is essential for photosynthesis, but the amounts of light that exceed an organism’s assimilation capacity can cause serious damage1. Photosynthetic organisms minimize such potential harm through protection mechanisms collectively referred to as non-photochemical quenching2. One mechanism of non-photochemical quenching called energy-dependent quenching (qE quenching) is readily activated under high-light conditions and dissipates excess energy as heat. LIGHT-HARVESTING COMPLEX STRESS-RELATED PROTEINS 1 and 3 (LHCSR1 and LHCSR3) have been proposed to mediate qE quenching in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii when grown under high-light conditions3. LHCSR3 induction requires a blue-light photoreceptor, PHOTOTROPIN (PHOT)4, although the signal transduction pathway between PHOT and LHCSR3 is not yet clear. Here, we identify two phot suppressor loci involved in qE quenching: de-etiolated 1 (det1)5 and damaged DNA-binding 1 (ddb1)6. Using a yeast two-hybrid analysis and an inhibitor assay, we determined that these two genetic elements are part of a protein complex containing CULLIN 4 (CUL4). These findings suggest a photoprotective role for the putative E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL4–DDB1DET1 in unicellular photosynthetic organisms that may mediate blue-light signals to LHCSR1 and LHCSR3 gene expression."
Interstellar turbulence spectrum from in situ observations of Voyager 1,"Interstellar scintillation of radio waves from pulsars reveals that the interstellar turbulence spectrum of electron density approximates the Kolmogorov power law from wavenumber \(q = 10^{ - 18}\,{\rm{m}}^{ - 1}\) to \(10^{ - 6.5}\,{\mathrm{m}}^{ - 1}\) (refs. 1,2,3,4,5). Here we obtain the interstellar turbulence spectrum of electron density from in situ observations of Voyager 1. The observed spectrum extends from \(\lambda = 15\,{\mathrm{au}} \approx {\mathrm{2}}{\mathrm{.25}} \times {\mathrm{10}}^{12}\,{\mathrm{m}}\) (\(q = 4.4 \times 10^{ - 13}\,{\mathrm{m}}^{ - 1}\)) to \(\lambda = q^{ - 1}\) = 50 m (\(q = {\mathrm{2}} \times {\mathrm{10}}^{ - 2}\,{\mathrm{m}}^{ - 1}\)), close to the Debye length. The measured spectrum covers part (\(q = 4.4 \times 10^{ - 13}\,{\mathrm{m}}^{ - 1}\,{\mathrm{to}}\,1 \times 10^{ - 6}\,{\mathrm{m}}^{ - 1}\)) of the Kolmogorov inertial range, as well as ion and electron kinetic scales (\(q = 10^{ - 6}\,{\mathrm{m}}^{ - 1} \,{\mathrm{to }}\, {\mathrm{2}} \times {\mathrm{10}}^{ - 2}\,{\mathrm{m}}^{ - 1}\)). The observed Kolmogorov inertial range shows good agreement with earlier studies by Lee and Jokipii2 and Armstrong et al.3,4. Around the kinetic scales, a bulge of spectral intensity higher than the Kolmogorov spectrum is found."
Effectiveness of an academic detailing intervention in primary care on the prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,"The objective of this study was to examine the impact of an academic detailing programme in primary care in Norway on the prescribing rate of diclofenac, naproxen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in total."
Polarization switching and electrical control of interlayer excitons in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures,"The long-lived interlayer excitons in van der Waals heterostructures based on transition-metal dichalcogenides, together with unique spin–valley physics, make them promising for next-generation photonic and valleytronic devices. Although the emission characteristics of interlayer excitons have been studied, efficient manipulation of their valley states, a necessary requirement for information encoding, is still lacking. Here, we demonstrate comprehensive electrical control of interlayer excitons in a MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure. Encapsulation of our well-aligned stack with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) allows us to resolve two separate narrow interlayer transitions with opposite helicities under circularly polarized excitation, either preserving or reversing the polarization of incoming light. By electrically controlling their relative intensities, we realize a polarization switch with tunable emission intensity and wavelength. Finally, we observe large g-factors of these two transitions on application of an external magnetic field. These results are interpreted within the picture of moiré-induced brightening of forbidden optical transitions. The ability to control the polarization of interlayer excitons is a step towards the manipulation of the valley degree of freedom in realistic device applications."
Deep Learning for Musculoskeletal Force Prediction,"Musculoskeletal models permit the determination of internal forces acting during dynamic movement, which is clinically useful, but traditional methods may suffer from slowness and a need for extensive input data. Recently, there has been interest in the use of supervised learning to build approximate models for computationally demanding processes, with benefits in speed and flexibility. Here, we use a deep neural network to learn the mapping from movement space to muscle space. Trained on a set of kinematic, kinetic and electromyographic measurements from 156 subjects during gait, the network’s predictions of internal force magnitudes show good concordance with those derived by musculoskeletal modelling. In a separate set of experiments, training on data from the most widely known benchmarks of modelling performance, the international Grand Challenge competitions, generates predictions that better those of the winning submissions in four of the six competitions. Computational speedup facilitates incorporation into a lab-based system permitting real-time estimation of forces, and interrogation of the trained neural networks provides novel insights into population-level relationships between kinematic and kinetic factors."
Experimental and theoretical investigations on temperature and voltage dependence of an Au/AZO thin-film Schottky diode,"In this work, aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) thin films were deposited by DC sputtering on a glass substrate at a typical sputtering power. It was observed that the AZO structure changes on the ZnO crystalline structure. The measurement of the transparency spectrum on the AZO films shows an optical bandgap about 4.3 eV, which the Al doping into ZnO structure pronounced width localized states by Urbach energy that was 0.42 eV. Moreover, the experimental results on the electrical properties of AZO/Au thin film were evaluated at different temperatures by four-point probe. Also, a simulation analysis on the electrical parameters of the Schottky Au/AZO junction has been done. Our calculation is based on the thermionic emission theory, in which by fitting the numerical results with the experimental current–voltage measurements, the barrier height, ideality factor and saturation current have been obtained. Our result confirmed excellent rectifying characteristics. The extracted result may be useful in designing nanoelectronic devices."
Classifying early and late mild cognitive impairment stages of Alzheimer’s disease by fusing default mode networks extracted with multiple seeds,"The default mode network (DMN) in resting state has been increasingly used in disease diagnosis since it was found in 2001. Prior work has mainly focused on extracting a single DMN with various techniques. However, by using seeding-based analysis with more than one desirable seed, we can obtain multiple DMNs, which are likely to have complementary information, and thus are more promising for disease diagnosis. In the study, we used 18 early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) participants and 18 late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) participants of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). First, we used seeding-based analysis with four seeds to extract four DMNs for each subject. Then, we conducted fusion analysis for all different combinations of the four DMNs. Finally, we carried out nonlinear support vector machine classification based on the mixing coefficients from the fusion analysis."
Estimating heterogeneous treatment effect by balancing heterogeneity and fitness,"Estimating heterogeneous treatment effect is a fundamental problem in biological and medical applications. Recently, several recursive partitioning methods have been proposed to identify the subgroups that respond differently towards a treatment, and they rely on a fitness criterion to minimize the error between the estimated treatment effects and the unobservable ground truths."
Convolutional neural network based on SMILES representation of compounds for detecting chemical motif,"Previous studies have suggested deep learning to be a highly effective approach for screening lead compounds for new drugs. Several deep learning models have been developed by addressing the use of various kinds of fingerprints and graph convolution architectures. However, these methods are either advantageous or disadvantageous depending on whether they (1) can distinguish structural differences including chirality of compounds, and (2) can automatically discover effective features."
Study on the enhancement of photocatalytic environment purification through ubiquitous-red-clay loading,"Tungsten oxide (WO3) is regarded as a promising visible-light-sensitive photocatalyst, but its activity is not high. Further enhancement of its activity has been anticipated using techniques such as loading of a cocatalyst to apply the oxide to indoor environmental remediation; Pt has been reported as a good cocatalyst for WO3 photocatalysis. However, Pt is precious and expensive metal. Thus, in this study, we sought to find a ubiquitous cocatalyst and suitable photocatalyst system. As a result, this study revealed that loading a ubiquitous material of red-clay enhanced WO3 photocatalytic activity remarkably. As photocatalyst samples, mixtures consisting of the clay and WO3 with different weight ratios were prepared using a simple kneading method. Their photocatalytic activity was evaluated from decomposition of harmful organic contaminant, 2-propanol into CO2 under visible-light irradiation. The WO3 with 10% of the clay loading showed the highest activity among the samples and much higher activity than pure WO3. This higher activity might derive from the clay’s promotion of H2O2 decomposition and charge separation (holes and electrons). The H2O2 was generated from photocatalytic O2 reduction. This formation and accumulation on the pure WO3 surface led to decreased activity."
Transcription shapes DNA replication initiation and termination in human cells,"Although DNA replication is a fundamental aspect of biology, it is not known what determines where DNA replication starts and stops in the human genome. We directly identified and quantitatively compared sites of replication initiation and termination in untransformed human cells. We found that replication preferentially initiates at the transcription start site of genes occupied by high levels of RNA polymerase II, and terminates at their polyadenylation sites, thereby ensuring global co-directionality of transcription and replication, particularly at gene 5′ ends. During replication stress, replication initiation is stimulated downstream of genes and termination is redistributed to gene bodies; this globally reorients replication relative to transcription around gene 3′ ends. These data suggest that replication initiation and termination are coupled to transcription in human cells, and propose a model for the impact of replication stress on genome integrity."
The Noncommutative Residue about Witten Deformation,"In this paper, we compute lower dimensional volumes \({\rm{Vol}}_4^{(1,1)}\;\rm{and}\;{\rm{Vol}}_6^{(2,2)}\) about Witten deformation for 4, 6-dimensional spin manifolds with boundary respectively, and get assosiated Kastler–Kalau–Walze type theorems. We also give theoritic explaination of the gravitational action for 4, 6 dimensional manifolds with boundary by these noncommutative residues."
Do time trade-off values fully capture attitudes that are relevant to health-related choices?,"Previous research has shown that demographics, beliefs, and self-reported own health influence TTO values. Our hypothesis is that attitudes towards length and quality of life influence TTO values, but should no longer affect a set of related choices that are based on respondents’ own TTO scores. A representative sample of 1339 respondents was asked their level of agreement to four statements relating to the importance of quality and length of life. Respondents then went on to value 4 EQ-5D 5L states using an online interactive survey and a related set of 6 pairwise health-related choice questions, set up, so that respondents should be indifferent between choice options. We explored the impact of attitudes using regression analysis for TTO values and a logit model for choices. TTO values were correlated with the attitudes and were found to have a residual impact on the choices. In particular, those respondents who preferred quality of life over length of life gave less weight to the differences in years and more weight to differences in quality of life in these choice. We conclude that although the TTO responses reflect attitudes, these attitudes continue to affect health-related choices."
New automated method for extracting river information using optimized spectral threshold water index,"The accurate extraction of mountain river information is highly significant in water resource investigation and ecological environment protection. However, there are some problems in the existing methods of river information extraction, which are mainly the interference from shadows and buildings. Such interference leads to erroneous and redundant extraction of river information, which leads to inaccuracy or incompleteness. In this study, a precise extraction method of mountain river information is established using Landsat8 image and digital elevation model. The main steps of the river extraction method are as follows: (1) we propose the optimized spectral threshold water index to extract river information; (2) based on digital elevation model data, we simulate the mountain shadows of the study area to remove interference from them; (3) we establish the buffer zone of the river network using digital elevation model data to solve the problem of redundant extraction of river information; (4) we separately calculate and then standardize land surface temperature, albedo, and normalized different building index. The effects of buildings near the river are removed. Results show a relative accuracy of 97.52%. The new method decreases the interference of mountain shadows and buildings."
Milde tot matige nierschade,"Inleiding Leven met chronische nierschade vraagt zelfmanagement en dus kennis over de aandoening, maar veel patiënten hebben vermoedelijk onvoldoende kennis. De onderzoekers gingen na welke kennis, gedachten en ervaringen patiënten met nierschade hebben, en hoe zij de informatievoorziening over chronische nierschade beleven."
Energy harvesting near room temperature using a thermomagnetic generator with a pretzel-like magnetic flux topology,"To date, there are very few technologies available for the conversion of low-temperature waste heat into electricity. Thermomagnetic generators are one approach proposed more than a century ago. Such devices are based on a cyclic change of magnetization with temperature. This switches a magnetic flux and, according to Faraday’s law, induces a voltage. Here we demonstrate that guiding the magnetic flux with an appropriate topology of the magnetic circuit improves the performance of thermomagnetic generators by orders of magnitude. Through a combination of experiments and simulations, we show that a pretzel-like topology results in a sign reversal of the magnetic flux. This avoids the drawbacks of previous designs, namely, magnetic stray fields, hysteresis and complex geometries of the thermomagnetic material. Our demonstrator, which is based on magnetocaloric plates, illustrates that this solid-state energy conversion technology presents a key step towards becoming competitive with thermoelectrics for energy harvesting near room temperature."
Developing a Discriminant Index to Determine Critical Service Attributes of Continuous Performance Improvement,"A performance evaluation matrix (PEM) presents the overall performance of an organization and provide reference for improvement strategies. PEMs are widely applied in the assessment of service performance in various organizations. Customer ratings of importance and satisfaction are used to calculate point estimates which are then plotted in PEMs. Their locations in the PEM show whether performance is good. Researchers have replaced these point estimates with the joint confidence interval of two indices to reduce the uncertainties caused by sampling errors and prevent misjudgment. However, this approach is quite complicated for practice application. For this reason, we defined a discriminant index based on PEM concepts. Our index uses the difference between the importance and satisfaction indices to solve the aforementioned issues in performance evaluation and help managers determine performance quality more easily. The joint confidence interval of the two indices serves as the feasible region, and we used linear programming to solve the upper confidence limit of the discriminant index, then performed statistical hypothesis testing using this upper confidence limit to determine whether a service item falls within the “needs improvement” zone. Finally, we present a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model by assessing a computer-assisted language learning (CALL) system."
What Are the Determinants of Public Spending? An Overview of the Literature,"The purpose of this paper is to present and assess the literature about the determinants of public spending. Its originality is the adoption of a methodological perspective. Does econometrics allow economists to discover universal constants for public spending or is it only another way of writing the history of public finance? The economic theory of the size of government includes 23 explanations and 78 explanatory variables. The size of government reflects the preferences of citizens (demand model), the power of politicians and bureaucrats to impose their interests against citizens’ interests (supply model) and the constitutional design that governments face in raising revenue. Nonetheless, the great instability of econometric tests shows, all the difficulties of the science of public finance in finding a constant and discovering real causality between these variables. The analytical consequence of this result is the great futility of the search for a general law of the dynamic of public spending. This futility can be interpreted as a consequence of the complexity of political exchange. The size of the state is a multi-causal phenomenon. The prescriptive consequence is that it is not possible to use quantitative analysis to defend a form of “causal manipulationism” and predict the timing of state reforms and a political strategy to reduce the share of public spending in production. Econometrics is only one way of reporting the history of public finances."
"The Impact of Personal Income Tax Structure on Income Inequality for Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Lithuania, and Poland: A Comparison of Flat and Graduated Income Tax Structures","The level of income inequality in a country is usually a contentious and politically divisive issue. How the tax structure affects this inequality is of crucial concern to policymakers. In this paper, we examine the income tax experiences of five European Union countries: Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Lithuania, and Poland. This paper focuses on the comparison between flat and graduated personal income tax rate structures. Various methods were used to measure the progressivity of income taxes across these countries such as the average tax rate, cumulative shares of income, and the Gini and other indices. The findings show that the graduated rate income tax structure of Germany and Belgium are the most effective at reducing inequality. On the other hand, Lithuania’s proportional income tax structure is much more effective at reducing income inequality when compared to the graduated rate structure of Poland. Also, an appropriately-sized income tax threshold can transform a flat structure to a redistributive one that compares favorably with some graduated rate structures. In the case of Bulgaria, introducing an income tax threshold that is roughly the size of average income would reduce inequality by about 4 %."
High-resolution mapping of infraslow cortical brain activity enabled by graphene microtransistors,"Recording infraslow brain signals (<0.1 Hz) with microelectrodes is severely hampered by current microelectrode materials, primarily due to limitations resulting from voltage drift and high electrode impedance. Hence, most recording systems include high-pass filters that solve saturation issues but come hand in hand with loss of physiological and pathological information. In this work, we use flexible epicortical and intracortical arrays of graphene solution-gated field-effect transistors (gSGFETs) to map cortical spreading depression in rats and demonstrate that gSGFETs are able to record, with high fidelity, infraslow signals together with signals in the typical local field potential bandwidth. The wide recording bandwidth results from the direct field-effect coupling of the active transistor, in contrast to standard passive electrodes, as well as from the electrochemical inertness of graphene. Taking advantage of such functionality, we envision broad applications of gSGFET technology for monitoring infraslow brain activity both in research and in the clinic."
Ecological networks reveal resilience of agro-ecosystems to changes in farming management,"Sustainable management of ecosystems and growth in agricultural productivity is at the heart of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. New management regimes could revolutionize agricultural production, but require an evaluation of the risks and opportunities. Replacing existing conventional weed management with genetically modified, herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops, for example, might reduce herbicide applications and increase crop yields, but remains controversial owing to concerns about potential impacts on biodiversity. Until now, such new regimes have been assessed at the species or assemblage level, whereas higher-level ecological network effects remain largely unconsidered. Here, we conduct a large-scale network analysis of invertebrate communities across 502 UK farm sites to GMHT management in different crop types. We find that network-level properties were overwhelmingly shaped by crop type, whereas network structure and robustness were apparently unaltered by GMHT management. This suggests that taxon-specific effects reported previously did not escalate into higher-level systemic structural change in the wider agricultural ecosystem. Our study highlights current limitations of autecological assessments of effect in agriculture in which species interactions and potential compensatory effects are overlooked. We advocate adopting the more holistic system-level evaluations that we explore here, which complement existing assessments for meeting our future agricultural needs."
Study of physico-chemical properties and in vitro antimicrobial activity of hydroxyapatites obtained from bone calcination,"Hydroxyapatite was obtained by bone calcinations. To study the calcination process, bovine and porcine bones were first autoclaved to remove fat and other non-bone tissues. They were then heated in an alumina pan in an oxidizing atmosphere of air, where simultaneous thermal analysis curves were recorded. To prepare the hydroxyapatites, bone samples were calcined at 850 °C and 1000 °C using a muffle furnace for 1 h. The obtained materials were powdered using mortar and pestle, and sifted in a sieve (60 mesh) without any additional purification or chemical treatment. The materials obtained were characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The antimicrobial properties of these materials were determined through direct contact tests against Staphylococcus aureus. The natural hydroxyapatites obtained by bone calcination inhibited S. aureus growth, with the material obtained by calcination of bovine bones at 1000 °C, showing the best antimicrobial activity. These results indicated that bone wastes can be used to obtain hydroxyapatites with antimicrobial activity."
A Deficiency-Based Approach to Parametrizing Positive Equilibria of Biochemical Reaction Systems,"We present conditions which guarantee a parametrization of the set of positive equilibria of a generalized mass-action system. Our main results state that (1) if the underlying generalized chemical reaction network has an effective deficiency of zero, then the set of positive equilibria coincides with the parametrized set of complex-balanced equilibria and (2) if the network is weakly reversible and has a kinetic deficiency of zero, then the equilibrium set is nonempty and has a positive, typically rational, parametrization. Via the method of network translation, we apply our results to classical mass-action systems studied in the biochemical literature, including the EnvZ–OmpR and shuttled WNT signaling pathways. A parametrization of the set of positive equilibria of a (generalized) mass-action system is often a prerequisite for the study of multistationarity and allows an easy check for the occurrence of absolute concentration robustness, as we demonstrate for the EnvZ–OmpR pathway."
"Pedestrian smartphone overuse and inattentional blindness: an observational study in Taipei, Taiwan",Smartphone addiction has become a crucial social issue. Past studies have indicated that phone use such as talking or texting while walking constitutes a dual task that may cause pedestrians inattentional blindness and impair their awareness of surroundings.
Identification of active signaling pathways by integrating gene expression and protein interaction data,"Signaling pathways are the key biological mechanisms that transduce extracellular signals to affect transcription factor mediated gene regulation within cells. A number of computational methods have been developed to identify the topological structure of a specific signaling pathway using protein-protein interaction data, but they are not designed for identifying active signaling pathways in an unbiased manner. On the other hand, there are statistical methods based on gene sets or pathway data that can prioritize likely active signaling pathways, but they do not make full use of active pathway structure that link receptor, kinases and downstream transcription factors."
Integrating node embeddings and biological annotations for genes to predict disease-gene associations,"Predicting disease causative genes (or simply, disease genes) has played critical roles in understanding the genetic basis of human diseases and further providing disease treatment guidelines. While various computational methods have been proposed for disease gene prediction, with the recent increasing availability of biological information for genes, it is highly motivated to leverage these valuable data sources and extract useful information for accurately predicting disease genes."
Discovering functional impacts of miRNAs in cancers using a causal deep learning model,"Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) play a significant role in regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions such as cancers. However, it remains a challenging problem to discover the target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of a miRNA in a data driven fashion. On one hand, sequence-based methods for predicting miRNA targets tend to make too many false positive calls. On the other hand, analyzing expression correlation between miRNAs and mRNAs cannot establish whether relationship between a pair of correlated miRNA and mRNA is causal."
Network-based logistic regression integration method for biomarker identification,"Many mathematical and statistical models and algorithms have been proposed to do biomarker identification in recent years. However, the biomarkers inferred from different datasets suffer a lack of reproducibilities due to the heterogeneity of the data generated from different platforms or laboratories. This motivates us to develop robust biomarker identification methods by integrating multiple datasets."
Identification of cancer subtypes from single-cell RNA-seq data using a consensus clustering method,"Human cancers are complex ecosystems composed of cells with distinct molecular signatures. Such intratumoral heterogeneity poses a major challenge to cancer diagnosis and treatment. Recent advancements of single-cell techniques such as scRNA-seq have brought unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity. Subsequently, a challenging computational problem is to cluster high dimensional noisy datasets with substantially fewer cells than the number of genes."
On the Non-trivial Origin of Atomic-Scale Patterns in Friction Force Microscopy,"Friction between two surfaces is due to nano- and micro-asperities at the interface that establish true contact and are responsible for the energy dissipation. To understand the friction mechanism, often single-asperity model experiments are conducted in atomic-force microscopes. Here, we show that the conventional interpretation of the typical results of such experiments, based on a simple mass-spring model, hides a fundamental contradiction. Via an estimate of the order of magnitude of the dissipative forces required to produce atomic-scale patterns in the stick-slip motion of a frictional nano-contact, we find that the energy dissipation must be dominated by a very small, highly dynamic mass at the very end of the asperity. Our conclusion casts new light on the behavior of sliding surfaces and invites us to speculate about new ways to control friction by manipulation of the contact geometry."
Single-Trial Recognition of Imagined Forces and Speeds of Hand Clenching Based on Brain Topography and Brain Network,"To provide optional force and speed control parameters for brain–computer interfaces (BCIs), an effective feature extraction method of imagined force and speed of hand clenching based on electroencephalography (EEG) was explored. Twenty subjects were recruited to participate in the experiment. They were instructed to perform three different actual/imagined hand clenching force tasks (4 kg, 10 kg, and 16 kg) and three different hand clenching speed tasks (0.5 Hz, 1 Hz, and 2 Hz). Topographical maps parameters and brain network parameters of EEG were calculated as new features of imagined force and speed of hand clenching, which were classified by three classifiers: linear discrimination analysis, extreme learning machines and support vector machines. Topographical maps parameters were better for recognition of the hand clenching force task, while brain network parameters were better for recognition of the hand clenching speed task. After a combination of five types of features (energy, power spectrum of the autoregressive model, wavelet packet coefficients, topographical maps parameters and brain network parameters), the recognition rate of the hand clenching force task was 97%, and that of the hand clenching speed task was as high as 100%. The brain topographical and the brain network parameters are expected to improve the accuracy of decoding the EEG signal of imagined force and speed of hand clenching. A more efficient brain network may facilitate the recognition of force/speed of hand clenching. Combined features could significantly improve the single-trial recognition rate of imagined forces and speeds of hand clenching. The current study provides a new idea for the imagined force and speed of hand clenching that offers more control intention instructions for BCIs."
Carbohydrate composition of mucus from scleractinian corals from the central Red Sea,"Coral mucus is continuously released by most corals and acts as an important protective barrier and as a substrate for host-associated microbial communities due to its complex composition of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. On a reef scale, coral mucus functions as a particle trap, thereby retaining nutrients and energy in the ecosystem. Given the distinct environmental conditions in the Red Sea (high temperature, high salinity, high total alkalinity), we sought to investigate the carbohydrate composition of mucus from five corals from the central Red Sea. Our aim was to assess whether mucus from Red Sea corals is different from what is known from other corals and whether those differences could be aligned to putative beneficial functions with regard to the prevailing environment. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, we detected nine sugars as the main prevalent carbohydrates. Although we detected significant differences between species with regard to the relative abundance of given carbohydrates, the identified sugars resembled those found in mucus from corals elsewhere, and we could corroborate high abundance of arabinose in acroporid corals. Taken together, our results suggest the presence of a common set of carbohydrates across a broad range of coral species from geographically diverse environments, highlighting the important role of mucus with regard to coral and reef ecosystem function."
Development of extracellular matrix supported 3D culture of renal cancer cells and renal cancer stem cells,"Novel experimental conditions of cancer cell line culture have evolved throughout the recent years, with significantly growing interest in xeno-free, serum-free and three-dimensional culture variants. The choice of proper culture media may enable to mimic tumor microenvironment and promotion of cancer stem cells proliferation. To assess whether stem-like phenotype inducing media may be applied in renal cancer stem cell research, we performed a widespread screening of 13 cell culture media dedicated for mesenchymal cells, stem cells as well as mesenchymal stem cells. We have also screened extracellular matrix compounds and selected optimal RCC 3D—ECM supported culture model. Our results revealed that 786-O as well as HKCSCs cell line cultures in xeno-free media (NutriStem/StemXvivo) and laminin coated plates provide a useful tool in RCC cancer biology research and at the same time enable effective drug toxicity screening. We propose bio-mimic 3D RCC cell culture model with specific low-serum and xeno-free media that promote RCC cell viability and stem-like phenotype according to the tested genes encoding stemness factors including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, HIF1, HIF2, VEGF, SOX2, PAX2 and NESTIN."
Panoptic imaging of transparent mice reveals whole-body neuronal projections and skull–meninges connections,"Analysis of entire transparent rodent bodies after clearing could provide holistic biological information in health and disease, but reliable imaging and quantification of fluorescent protein signals deep inside the tissues has remained a challenge. Here, we developed vDISCO, a pressure-driven, nanobody-based whole-body immunolabeling technology to enhance the signal of fluorescent proteins by up to two orders of magnitude. This allowed us to image and quantify subcellular details through bones, skin and highly autofluorescent tissues of intact transparent mice. For the first time, we visualized whole-body neuronal projections in adult mice. We assessed CNS trauma effects in the whole body and found degeneration of peripheral nerve terminals in the torso. Furthermore, vDISCO revealed short vascular connections between skull marrow and brain meninges, which were filled with immune cells upon stroke. Thus, our new approach enables unbiased comprehensive studies of the interactions between the nervous system and the rest of the body."
Targeted delivery of nitric oxide via a ‘bump-and-hole’-based enzyme–prodrug pair,"The spatiotemporal generation of nitric oxide (NO), a versatile endogenous messenger, is precisely controlled. Despite its therapeutic potential for a wide range of diseases, NO-based therapies are limited clinically due to a lack of effective strategies for precisely delivering NO to a specific site. In the present study, we developed a novel NO delivery system via modification of an enzyme–prodrug pair of galactosidase–galactosyl-NONOate using a ‘bump-and-hole’ strategy. Precise delivery to targeted tissues was clearly demonstrated by an in vivo near-infrared imaging assay. The therapeutic potential was evaluated in both rat hindlimb ischemia and mouse acute kidney injury models. Targeted delivery of NO clearly enhanced its therapeutic efficacy in tissue repair and function recovery and abolished side effects due to the systemic release of NO. The developed protocol holds broad applicability in the targeted delivery of important gaseous signaling molecules and offers a potent tool for the investigation of relevant molecular mechanisms."
An atlas of genetic influences on osteoporosis in humans and mice,"Osteoporosis is a common aging-related disease diagnosed primarily using bone mineral density (BMD). We assessed genetic determinants of BMD as estimated by heel quantitative ultrasound in 426,824 individuals, identifying 518 genome-wide significant loci (301 novel), explaining 20% of its variance. We identified 13 bone fracture loci, all associated with estimated BMD (eBMD), in ~1.2 million individuals. We then identified target genes enriched for genes known to influence bone density and strength (maximum odds ratio (OR) = 58, P = 1 × 10−75) from cell-specific features, including chromatin conformation and accessible chromatin sites. We next performed rapid-throughput skeletal phenotyping of 126 knockout mice with disruptions in predicted target genes and found an increased abnormal skeletal phenotype frequency compared to 526 unselected lines (P < 0.0001). In-depth analysis of one gene, DAAM2, showed a disproportionate decrease in bone strength relative to mineralization. This genetic atlas provides evidence linking associated SNPs to causal genes, offers new insight into osteoporosis pathophysiology, and highlights opportunities for drug development."
Structural basis of Notch recognition by human γ-secretase,"Aberrant cleavage of Notch by γ-secretase leads to several types of cancer, but how γ-secretase recognizes its substrate remains unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human γ-secretase in complex with a Notch fragment at a resolution of 2.7 Å. The transmembrane helix of Notch is surrounded by three transmembrane domains of PS1, and the carboxyl-terminal β-strand of the Notch fragment forms a β-sheet with two substrate-induced β-strands of PS1 on the intracellular side. Formation of the hybrid β-sheet is essential for substrate cleavage, which occurs at the carboxyl-terminal end of the Notch transmembrane helix. PS1 undergoes pronounced conformational rearrangement upon substrate binding. These features reveal the structural basis of Notch recognition and have implications for the recruitment of the amyloid precursor protein by γ-secretase."
"Romantic Relationships in Young Adulthood: Parental Divorce, Parent-child Relationships during Adolescence, and Gender","The current study aimed to examine the role of parent-child relationships during adolescence as a mediator between earlier parental divorce and children's romantic relationships in emerging adulthood. In addition, the study aimed to examine how this proposed mediation model would work differently among the four dyads of parent-child based on their gender (e.g., father-daughter vs. mother-son). The data for this study came from a 22-year 9-wave investigated longitudinal study, which began when the participants were in the sixth grade. The study was designed to investigate transitions during adolescence and young adulthood. Analyses for the current study were based on waves 6 and 8. At Wave 6, participants were in 12th grade and at Wave 8, participants were approximately 24 years old. The sample for the current study was 520 (female = 311 and male = 209) from 'always-married' and 154 (female = 107 and male = 47) from 'divorced' families. In order to examine the mediation model for each female and male adolescents, multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) was tested using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) - LISREL Version 8.80. The results showed that there was no overall direct mediation model; however, the mediation model worked differently for the four dyads of parent-child. For example, it was found that there was an indirect effect of parental divorce through relationships with fathers on daughters' romantic relationships but not for sons. Implications, limitations, and future research recommendations are discussed."
Comparative chloroplast genomes of Paris Sect. Marmorata: insights into repeat regions and evolutionary implications,"Species of Paris Sect. Marmorata are valuable medicinal plants to synthesize steroidal saponins with effective pharmacological therapy. However, the wild resources of the species are threatened by plundering exploitation before the molecular genetics studies uncover the genomes and evolutionary significance. Thus, the availability of complete chloroplast genome sequences of Sect. Marmorata is necessary and crucial to the understanding the plastome evolution of this section and facilitating future population genetics studies. Here, we determined chloroplast genomes of Sect. Marmorata, and conducted the whole chloroplast genome comparison."
Mining statistically-solid k-mers for accurate NGS error correction,"NGS data contains many machine-induced errors. The most advanced methods for the error correction heavily depend on the selection of solid k-mers. A solid k-mer is a k-mer frequently occurring in NGS reads. The other k-mers are called weak k-mers. A solid k-mer does not likely contain errors, while a weak k-mer most likely contains errors. An intensively investigated problem is to find a good frequency cutoff f0 to balance the numbers of solid and weak k-mers. Once the cutoff is determined, a more challenging but less-studied problem is to: (i) remove a small subset of solid k-mers that are likely to contain errors, and (ii) add a small subset of weak k-mers, that are likely to contain no errors, into the remaining set of solid k-mers. Identification of these two subsets of k-mers can improve the correction performance."
Reveal cell type-specific regulatory elements and their characterized histone code classes via a hidden Markov model,"With the maturity of next generation sequencing technology, a huge amount of epigenomic data have been generated by several large consortia in the last decade.

Comparative transcriptome and translatome analysis in contrasting rice genotypes reveals differential mRNA translation in salt-tolerant Pokkali under salt stress,"Soil salinity is one of the primary causes of yield decline in rice. Pokkali (Pok) is a highly salt-tolerant landrace, whereas IR29 is a salt-sensitive but widely cultivated genotype. Comparative analysis of these genotypes may offer a better understanding of the salinity tolerance mechanisms in rice. Although most stress-responsive genes are regulated at the transcriptional level, in many cases, changes at the transcriptional level are not always accompanied with the changes in protein abundance, which suggests that the transcriptome needs to be studied in conjunction with the proteome to link the phenotype of stress tolerance or sensitivity. Published reports have largely underscored the importance of transcriptional regulation during salt stress in these genotypes, but the regulation at the translational level has been rarely studied. Using RNA-Seq, we simultaneously analyzed the transcriptome and translatome from control and salt-exposed Pok and IR29 seedlings to unravel molecular insights into gene regulatory mechanisms that differ between these genotypes."
Deep learning for DNase I hypersensitive sites identification,"The DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are associated with the cis-regulatory DNA elements.

Identifying sequence features that drive ribosomal association for lncRNA,"With the increasing number of annotated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) from the genome, researchers are continually updating their understanding of lncRNAs.

Thyroid stunning in radioiodine-131 therapy of benign thyroid diseases,"Existence and cause of thyroid stunning was controversially discussed for decades but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Numerous studies describe thyroid stunning in radioiodine-131 therapy (RIT) of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. However, there are no studies evaluating thyroid stunning in benign thyroid diseases caused by the radioiodine uptake test (RIUT). Therefore, the influence of pre-therapeutic tracer radiation dose on therapeutic iodine-131 uptake was evaluated retrospectively."
The effects of air pollution on cultural heritage: The case study of Santa Maria delle Grazie al Naviglio Grande (Milan)⋆,"Atmospheric pollution causes monuments surface degradation in urban environments. Among the degradation processes the formation of black crusts (BCs) is one of the most dangerous phenomenon. During this process, aerosol particulate matter (PM) can be embedded into gypsum, one of the main crusts constituents, providing the characteristic black colour. EC (elemental carbon) and OC (organic carbon) are the responsible for the yellowing and blackening processes occurring on the surfaces and their quantification in the crusts can provide information on the contribution of atmospheric pollution sources to the degradation products formation. This research study is focused on the characterization of BCs collected from the Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie al Naviglio Grande in Milan, from the point of view of the effects of atmospheric pollution on cultural heritage. The analysed samples consist of mortars and bricks partially degraded and covered with black crusts. Appling different analytical techniques, such as FT-IR/ATR, CHN, TGA and IC, the crusts composition has been investigated focusing on the quantification of the carbonaceous fraction. This integrated approach has allowed to identify the sources of pollution responsible for the decay of the different building materials of the church."
Investigation of the 6Li + 40Ca elastic scattering using different folding models,"In the present study we investigate the 6Li + 40Ca elastic scattering through the energy range 26-240MeV in the framework of the optical model and \( \alpha\) -cluster structure of the colliding nuclei. The double folding (DF) calculations for the real central part of the nuclear optical potential are performed by folding the \( \alpha\) -\( \alpha\) and \( \alpha\) -n effective interactions over the density distributions of \( \alpha\) -clusters in the target ( 40Ca  nucleus and considering the \( \alpha\) -d structure of the projectile ( 6Li  nucleus. The imaginary part of the optical potential is expressed in the phenomenological Woods-Saxon form. The measured angular distributions of the elastic scattering differential cross section have been successfully reproduced using the derived semi-microscopic potentials for nine sets of data all over the measured angular range. However, it is found that introducing a real renormalization factor smaller than unity is essential in order to obtain a successful description of the data at bombarding energies larger than 10MeV/nucleon. The obtained results confirm the validity of the \( \alpha\) -cluster structure to generate a realistic representation of nucleus-nucleus optical potentials. For the sake of comparison, the same considered sets of data are reanalyzed using microscopic DF optical potentials based upon the São Paulo potential. The energy dependence of the corresponding reaction cross sections and real and imaginary volume integrals of the considered reaction are also investigated."
The role of constituent quark exchange on the NLO structure function and the EMC ratios of the 4He nucleus,"As in our recent work for the 6Li nucleus, we intend to reformulate the valence quark exchange formalism (VQEF) for the \( {A}=4\) iso-scalar system and apply it to extract the u -d constituent quark distribution functions of the 4He nucleus. The constituent quark model (CQM) is used to evaluate the point-like parton distribution functions (PDF), the structure functions (SF), and the EMC ratio of this light nucleus, at the leading order (LO) and the next-to-leading-order (NLO) levels. Subsequently, the results are compared with our previous corresponding works and available experimental data. It is shown that the present framework provides the desirable results. It can be asserted that the common simplified VQEF, in which quark exchanges are considered between only two nucleons, plus the CQM, i.e. the constituents of the quark exchange model (CQEM), may be a reliable approximation to elicit the proper parton distributions of the light nuclei. However this argument should be tested at least for a few \( A\le 16\) nuclei. Finally, as we pointed out in our prior report for the 6Li nucleus, it can also be concluded that the LO approximation may be enough to calculate the EMC ratio of the bound nuclei."
Measuring Positive Emotions: an Examination of the Reliability and Structural Validity of Scores on the Seven Dispositional Positive Emotions Scales,"The Dispositional Positive Emotions Scales (DPES) are seven separate research scales that measure joy, awe, amusement, pride, contentment, compassion, and love. Despite widespread use of these scales, no comprehensive examination of the psychometric properties of DPES scores has been conducted. In this paper, we examined the internal consistency and structural validity of DPES scores in four independent American samples. In Study 1, exploratory factor analyses indicated that scores on the seven scales had a 1-factor structure, and these scores were found to be internally consistent. In Study 2, confirmatory factor analyses provided evidence that DPES scores were structurally valid (although evidence was mixed on the Love scale) and that the seven scales were distinct constructs. In addition, DPES scores were found to be internally consistent. Finally, evidence of convergent validity and discriminant validity was also found via comparing DPES scores with those on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Short Form."
Orexin type-2 receptor blockade prevents the nicotine-induced excitation of nucleus accumbens core neurons in rats: An electrophysiological perspective,"The nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) expresses both orexin and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Orexin is among important neurotransmitters, which regulates addictive properties of drugs of abuse including nicotine. The role of orexin-2 receptor (OX2R) in the regulation of NAcc neural activity in response to nicotine has not yet been studied. Hence, in this study, we examined whether the OX2R antagonist (TCS-OX2-29) can adjust the effects of nicotine on electrical activity of NAcc neurons, in urethane-anesthetized rats, using the single unit recording."
Demarcating the membrane damage for the extraction of functional mitochondria,"Defective mitochondria have been linked to several critical human diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, cancers and cardiovascular disease. However, the detailed characterization of mitochondria has remained relatively unexplored, largely due to the lack of effective extraction methods that may sufficiently retain the functionality of mitochondria, particularly when limited amount of sample is considered. In this study, we explore the possibility of modulating hydrodynamic stress through a cross-junction geometry at microscale to selectively disrupt the cellular membrane while mitochondrial membrane is secured. The operational conditions are empirically optimized to effectively shred the cell membranes while keeping mitochondria intact for the model mammalian cell lines, namely human embryonic kidney cells, mouse muscle cells and neuroblastoma cells. Unsurprisingly, the disruption of cell membranes with higher elastic moduli (neuroblastoma) requires elevated stress. This study also presents a comparative analysis of total protein yield and concentrations of extracted functional mitochondria with two commercially available mitochondria extraction approaches, the Dounce Homogenizer and the Qproteome® Mitochondria Isolation Kit, in a range of cell concentrations. Our findings show that the proposed “microscale cell shredder” yields at least 40% more functional mitochondria than the two other approaches and is able to preserve the morphological integrity of extracted mitochondria, particularly at low cell concentrations (5–20 × 104 cells/mL). Characterized by its capability of rapidly processing a limited quantity of samples (200 μL), demarcating the membrane damage through the proposed microscale cell shredder represents a novel strategy to extract subcellular organelles from clinical samples."

Wat de huisarts moet weten over de HPV-vaccinatie,"Al bijna tien jaar krijgen twaalfjarige meisjes in Nederland de HPV-vaccinatie aangeboden ter preventie van het cervixcarcinoom. De vaccinatiegraad voor HPV is nog steeds aanzienlijk lager vergeleken met de andere vaccinaties in het rijksvaccinatieprogramma. Zijn er goede redenen voor de terughoudendheid onder ouders en meisjes? De huidige HPV-vaccinaties zijn immers veilige en effectieve vaccins tegen de meest voorkomende hoogrisico-HPV-subtypes die een rol spelen bij het ontstaan van diverse HPV-gerelateerde carcinomen van de huid en slijmvliezen. De HPV-vaccinatie laat een blijvende immuniteit zien na acht tot negen jaar, die nog niet afneemt. Er is tevens sprake van kruisbescherming tegen enkele andere hoogrisicosubtypes. Bij een hogere vaccinatiegraad is er bovendien sprake van een collectieve immuniteit voor de verschillende subtypes van HPV. De vaccinatie is kosteneffectiever als iemand nog niet seksueel actief is geweest, maar heeft ook in de seksueel actieve groep een beschermende werking."

Development of the Gothenburg Well-Being Scale in Late Adolescence: The Grow Up 1990 Gothenburg Study,"The objective was to update the factor structure of the Gothenburg Well-Being scale (GWB) for use in older adolescents. A cross-sectional population of final-year high school students (17–20 years; N = 5395) completed three questionnaires with classroom administration as part of a larger investigation into health and lifestyle. Students completed the GWB, which is composed of 43 polar-opposite adjective VAS scales, the RS-11 resilience questionnaire and an 8-item Body Image scale. Model fit to the previously data-derived six-factor model (GWB Child) was tested. The data were then randomly divided into training and test datasets and a theoretically hypothesised model was tested and revised. Model 1 did not have adequate model fit. The theoretically hypothesised Model 2 had better fit; however, a modified model (Model 3 GWB Adolescent), using nine questions loading on factors of Mood, Stress Balance and Activation with one general factor of Well-being, was found to meet all model fit criteria (GFI .978; TLI .970, CFI .980; RMSEA .059). Measurement invariance was attested across datasets and gender. Internal reliability was satisfactory (Cronbach’s alpha 0.59). Convergent validity was demonstrated by correlation with resilience (r = .42) and body image (r = .35). Discriminant known-groups analysis gave results in the predicted direction for gender. The findings contribute to the validity of the GWB Adolescent, which explores relevant elements of well-being in late adolescence and can be used for group comparisons. Further testing is required to identify relationships with independent aspects of late adolescent life and clinical variables."
Antimicrobial activity of zinc oxide nanoparticles synthesized from Aloe vera peel extract,"This study was aimed to synthesize zinc oxide nanoparticles from the aqueous peel extract of Aloe vera and assess their antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria and fungi.
 The nanoparticles were characterized by UV–Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). UV–Vis spectroscopic analysis confirmed the synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) depicted functional groups associated with the formation of zinc oxide nanoparticles, whereas XRD showed their crystalline nature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that nanoparticles were rough in appearance with agglomeration. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the size of nanoparticles from 50 to 220 nm with hexagonal shape. The antimicrobial activity of zinc oxide nanoparticles was assessed against pathogenic bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis (MTCC-3382), S. epidermidis (MTCC-3382), Klebsiella pneumoniae (MTCC-3384), Escherichia coli (MTCC-41) and fungi, Aspergillus niger (MTCC-404) and Aspergillus oryzae (MTCC-3107). The results showed the effectiveness of zinc oxide nanoparticles against E. coli (MTCC-41) and A. niger (MTCC-404). However, in combination with antibiotic, there was a decrease in the antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi as compared to antibiotics. Hence, a molecular research is needed to check the effect of zinc oxide nanoparticles on antibiotics."
Interval-Valued Uncertainty Based on Entropy and Dempster-Shafer Theory,"This paper presents a new structure as a simple method at two uncertainties (i.e., aleatory and epistemic) that result from variabilities inherent in nature and a lack of knowledge. Aleatory and epistemic uncertainties use the concept of the entropy and Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory, respectively. Accordingly, we propose the generalized Shannon entropy in the D-S theory as a measure of uncertainty. This theory has been originated in the work of Dempster on the use of probabilities with upper and lower bounds. We describe the framework of our approach to assess upper and lower uncertainty bounds for each state of a system. In this process, the uncertainty bound is calculated with the generalized Shannon entropy in the D-S theory in different states of these systems. The probabilities of each state are interval values. In the current study, the effect of epistemic uncertainty is considered between events with respect to the non-probabilistic method (e.g., D-S theory) and the aleatory uncertainty is evaluated by using an entropy index over probability distributions through interval-valued bounds. Therefore, identification of total uncertainties shows the efficiency of uncertainty quantification."
Weibull-Normal Distribution and its Applications,"In this paper, a Weibull-normal distribution, based on the standard quantile function of log-logistic distribution, is defined and studied. Some properties of the probability distribution are discussed. The Weibull-normal distribution is found to be unimodal or bimodal. The distribution can be right skewed or left skewed. The method of maximum likelihood estimation is suggested to estimate the parameters of the distribution. Three numerical data sets are used to illustrate the applications of the Weibull-normal distribution."
A Generalized Class of Estimators for Estimating Population Mean in the Presence of Non-Response,"Koyuncu and Kadilar proposed an estimator based on single auxiliary variable with complete response in stratified random sampling. In this paper, we extended Koyuncu and Kadilar’s estimator to a more generalized class of estimators using two-auxiliary variables in stratified random sampling for the situation of non-response and further introduced its another improved generalized class of estimators. The mathematical conditions under which proposed class of estimators are efficient as compare to Hansen and Hurwtiz estimator, and ratio estimators modified for stratified sampling have been derived. An empirical study has also been carried out to examine the performance of the suggested estimators."
A Comprehensive Study on Power of Tests for Normality,"Many statistical procedures assume that the underling distribution is normal. In this paper, we consider the popular and powerful tests for normality and investigate the power values of these tests to detect deviations from normality. The family of four-parameter generalized lambda distributions (FMKL) for its high flexibility is considered as alternative distributions. We then compare the power values of normality tests against these alternatives and for different sample sizes. The considered tests are Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, Kuiper, Jarque-Bera, Cramer von Mises, Shapiro-Wilk and Vasicek. These tests are popular tests which are commonly used in practice and statistical software. The tests are described and then power values of the tests are compared against FMKL family by Monte Carlo simulation. The results are discussed and interpreted. Finally, we apply some real data examples to show the behavior of the tests in practice."
FKL-Spa-LapRLS: an accurate method for identifying human microRNA-disease association,"In the process of post-transcription, microRNAs (miRNAs) are closely related to various complex human diseases. Traditional verification methods for miRNA-disease associations take a lot of time and expense, so it is especially important to design computational methods for detecting potential associations. Considering the restrictions of previous computational methods for predicting potential miRNAs-disease associations, we develop the model of FKL-Spa-LapRLS (Fast Kernel Learning Sparse kernel Laplacian Regularized Least Squares) to break through the limitations."
Constructing tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory networks via a Markov random field,"Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled parallel assays of chromatin accessibility and gene expression for major human cell lines.

A context-free encoding scheme of protein sequences for predicting antigenicity of diverse influenza A viruses,"The evolution of influenza A viruses leads to the antigenic changes.

Computational prediction of the antigenic relationship between emerging and old strains of influenza viruses using viral sequences can facilitate large-scale antigenic characterization, especially for those viruses requiring high biosafety facilities, such as H5 and H7 influenza A viruses. However, most computational models require carefully designed subtype-specific features, thereby being restricted to only one subtype."

"Rare radiative decays of vector and axial-vector Bc mesons to (Ds, D*s, Ds1) final states","In this work, we use the QCD sum rule method to study the radiative decays of the vector and axial-vector \( B_c\) mesons to each of the three charmed strange mesons, \( D_s\) , \( D^{\ast}_s\) and \( D_{s1}\) , through their dominant weak annihilation channels. We calculate all relevant transition form factors, which are used to estimate the branching fractions at different channels. The order of branching ratios are obtained to be in the order of \( 10^{-6}\) - \( 10^{-5}\) , which may be checked via different experiments."
Enhancing the convergence speed of numerical solution using the flow rate control in a novel lattice Boltzmann method,"In this paper, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is modified using a flow rate control code to enhance the convergence speed and decrease the solution time. The mass flow rate is checked at each cross section for the modified lattice Boltzmann method, while for the regular lattice Boltzmann method, the mass flow rate only is checked at the outlet section of the channel. The results obtained by the modified lattice Boltzmann method are compared with the regular lattice Boltzmann one and finite volume methods for different types of channel flow including simple channel, blocked channel with one and two obstacles, channel with two branching outlets, and curved channel with 90-degree bend. The effects of Reynolds number, under relaxation factor, and mesh number on the iteration number and solution time are studied. The results showed that the solution time of a simple channel decreases about 87%, 77%, and 63% for mesh numbers \( 40\times 400\) , \( 60 \times 600\) , and \( 80 \times 800\) , respectively using the modified LBM as compared with the regular one at under relaxation factor of 0.4 and \( {\rm Re}=100\) . For a blocked channel with one obstacle, the iteration number decreases about 10 times by using the modified LBM as compared with the regular one for a mesh size of \( 40\times 400\) . Finally, the modified LBM enhances the speed of the solution about 57%, 40%, and 73% for the channel with 90-degree bend, the channel with two branching outlets, and blocked channel with two obstacles, respectively, as compared with the regular LBM."
Determination of the uranium enrichment without calibration standards using a 2 × 2 inch LaBr3(Ce) room temperature detector and Monte Carlo sampling approach for uncertainty assessment,"In recent years room temperature medium resolution scintillation devices, such as LaBr3(Ce), have attracted much interest as possible alternatives to traditional spectrometers based on HPGe and NaI detectors, for the determination of the uranium enrichment in safeguards applications. This paper focuses on the investigation of possibilities and limits of a net peak area based methodology used for the determination of the uranium enrichment without use of calibration standards and introduces the isotopic code MCSIGMA for LaBr3(Ce) scintillators. Tests are conducted with a room temperature, medium resolution spectrometer based on a 2×2 inch LaBr3(Ce) scintillator using which spectra of different statistical quality are obtained from certified uranium standards. Gamma peaks in the 143-1001keV energy range are used as uranium gamma-ray signatures. Results indicate a promising performance of the applied methodology with a room temperature medium resolution scintillator of the LaBr3(Ce) type, however at a cost of significantly higher uncertainty budget on the derived enrichment compared to HPGe, especially for natural and depleted uranium samples. This uncertainty budget is primarily influenced by the statistical quality of the measured spectra. Implemented algorithms and analysis routines are described in detail and presented."
Self-excited and hidden attractors in a novel chaotic system with complicated multistability,"In this paper, a new 3D chaotic system with trigonometric function term as a nonlinear controller is proposed. Depending on the nonlinear controller and the value of the parameters, the proposed system exhibits self-excited attractor with an unstable equilibrium, and hidden attractor with no equilibrium or a stable equilibrium. In addition, the unusual and striking dynamic behavior of the coexistence of self-excited chaotic with periodic attractors, two self-excited chaotic attractors with periodic attractor, three periodic attractors, hidden chaotic with point attractors, two hidden chaotic attractors, and four hidden chaotic attractors are explored by selecting appropriate initial values. Consequently, the proposed system has high sensitivity to its initial values and parameters, hence it can be applied in chaos-based cryptographic applications. Thus, the non-periodicity of coexisting attractors of the system is investigated through Lyapunov exponents and Sample Entropy. To demonstrate the performance of the system in real applications, we construct a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) based on the hidden attractor case. The randomness test results show that the generated PRNG pass all the statistical tests."
"Studies of the Giant Dipole Resonance in 27Al , 40Ca , 56Fe , 58Ni and 208Pb with high energy-resolution inelastic proton scattering under 0°","A survey of the fine structure of the Isovector Giant Dipole Resonance (IVGDR) was performed, using the recently commissioned Zero-degree Facility of the K600 magnetic spectrometer at iThemba LABS. Inelastic proton scattering at an incident energy of 200MeV was measured on 27Al , 40Ca , 56Fe , 58Ni and 208Pb . A high energy-resolution ( \( \Delta E\simeq 40\) keV FWHM) could be achieved after utilising faint-beam and dispersion-matching techniques. A considerable fine structure is observed in the energy region of the IVGDR and characteristic energy scales are extracted from the experimental data by means of a wavelet analysis. The comparison with Quasiparticle-Phonon Model (QPM) calculations provides insight into the relevance of different giant resonance decay mechanisms. Photoabsorption cross sections derived from the data assuming a dominance of relativistic Coulomb excitation are in fair agreement with previous work using real photons."
Structures of TRPV2 in distinct conformations provide insight into role of the pore turret,"Cation channels of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family serve important physiological roles by opening in response to diverse intra- and extracellular stimuli that regulate their lower or upper gates. Despite extensive studies, the mechanism coupling these gates has remained obscure. Previous structures have failed to resolve extracellular loops, known in the TRPV subfamily as ‘pore turrets’, which are proximal to the upper gates. We established the importance of the pore turret through activity assays and by solving structures of rat TRPV2, both with and without an intact turret at resolutions of 4.0 Å and 3.6 Å, respectively. These structures resolve the full-length pore turret and reveal fully open and partially open states of TRPV2, both with unoccupied vanilloid pockets. Our results suggest a mechanism by which physiological signals, such as lipid binding, can regulate the lower gate and couple to the upper gate through a pore-turret-facilitated mechanism."
Cryo-EM structure of the yeast respiratory supercomplex,"Respiratory chain complexes execute energy conversion by connecting electron transport with proton translocation over the inner mitochondrial membrane to fuel ATP synthesis. Notably, these complexes form multi-enzyme assemblies known as respiratory supercomplexes. Here we used single-particle cryo-EM to determine the structures of the yeast mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes III2IV and III2IV2, at 3.2-Å and 3.5-Å resolutions, respectively. We revealed the overall architecture of the supercomplex, which deviates from the previously determined assemblies in mammals; obtained a near-atomic structure of the yeast complex IV; and identified the protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions implicated in supercomplex formation. Take together, our results demonstrate convergent evolution of supercomplexes in mitochondria that, while building similar assemblies, results in substantially different arrangements and structural solutions to support energy conversion."
An isomiR expression panel based novel breast cancer classification approach using improved mutual information,"Gene expression-based profiling has been used to identify biomarkers for different breast cancer subtypes. However, this technique has many limitations. IsomiRs are isoforms of miRNAs that have critical roles in many biological processes and have been successfully used to distinguish various cancer types. Biomarker isomiRs for identifying different breast cancer subtypes has not been investigated. For the first time, we aim to show that isomiRs are better performing biomarkers and use them to explain molecular differences between breast cancer subtypes."
Novel disease syndromes unveiled by integrative multiscale network analysis of diseases sharing molecular effectors and comorbidities,"Forty-two percent of patients experience disease comorbidity, contributing substantially to mortality rates and increased healthcare costs. Yet, the possibility of underlying shared mechanisms for diseases remains not well established, and few studies have confirmed their molecular predictions with clinical datasets."
CRlncRC: a machine learning-based method for cancer-related long noncoding RNA identification using integrated features,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are widely involved in the initiation and development of cancer. Although some computational methods have been proposed to identify cancer-related lncRNAs, there is still a demanding to improve the prediction accuracy and efficiency. In addition, the quick-update data of cancer, as well as the discovery of new mechanism, also underlay the possibility of improvement of cancer-related lncRNA prediction algorithm. In this study, we introduced CRlncRC, a novel Cancer-Related lncRNA Classifier by integrating manifold features with five machine-learning techniques."
Computational drug repositioning using meta-path-based semantic network analysis,"Drug repositioning is a promising and efficient way to discover new indications for existing drugs, which holds the great potential for precision medicine in the post-genomic era. Many network-based approaches have been proposed for drug repositioning based on similarity networks, which integrate multiple sources of drugs and diseases. However, these methods may simply view nodes as the same-typed and neglect the semantic meanings of different meta-paths in the heterogeneous network. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a rational method to infer new indications for approved drugs."
Optimizing gene set annotations combining GO structure and gene expression data,"With the rapid accumulation of genomic data, it has become a challenge issue to annotate and interpret these data. As a representative, Gene set enrichment analysis has been widely used to interpret large molecular datasets generated by biological experiments. The result of gene set enrichment analysis heavily relies on the quality and integrity of gene set annotations. Although several methods were developed to annotate gene sets, there is still a lack of high quality annotation methods. Here, we propose a novel method to improve the annotation accuracy through combining the GO structure and gene expression data."
Introducing a Model of Urban Taxi Driver’s Offenses,"The aim of this study is to investigate the unsafe behavior of taxi drivers as a large group of professional drivers and the factors affecting driving violations occurring in Tehran. For this goal, the data regarding driving offenses of urban taxi drivers in 22 districts of Tehran from 2015 to 2016 has been collected from traffic police and used in statistical analysis and multiple regression modeling. According to the results, the probability of a red light violation during working days is more than non-working days. In addition, taxi drivers older than 70 are more likely to commit red light violation compared to the drivers younger than 30. Moreover, prohibited entry is more probable to occur during working days being about 2.5 times more than that of non-working days. Besides, drivers with newer and more expensive cars commit less driving offenses compared to the drivers with older and cheaper cars. Finally, it was found that by increasing the engine power of the vehicles, the rate of driving offenses by taxi drivers is decreased, such that in cars with 1600 cc engine power or less, the probability of not paying attention to the police regulations is six times more than the cars with 1800 cc engine power and more."
Tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells promote melanoma–immune equilibrium in skin,"The immune system can suppress tumour development both by eliminating malignant cells and by preventing the outgrowth and spread of cancer cells that resist eradication1. Clinical and experimental data suggest that the latter mode of control—termed cancer–immune equilibrium1—can be maintained for prolonged periods of time, possibly up to several decades2,3,4. Although cancers most frequently originate in epithelial layers, the nature and spatiotemporal dynamics of immune responses that maintain cancer–immune equilibrium in these tissue compartments remain unclear. Here, using a mouse model of transplantable cutaneous melanoma5, we show that tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells (TRM cells) promote a durable melanoma–immune equilibrium that is confined to the epidermal layer of the skin. A proportion of mice (~40%) transplanted with melanoma cells remained free of macroscopic skin lesions long after epicutaneous inoculation, and generation of tumour-specific epidermal CD69+ CD103+ TRM cells correlated with this spontaneous disease control. By contrast, mice deficient in TRM formation were more susceptible to tumour development. Despite being tumour-free at the macroscopic level, mice frequently harboured melanoma cells in the epidermal layer of the skin long after inoculation, and intravital imaging revealed that these cells were dynamically surveyed by TRM cells. Consistent with their role in melanoma surveillance, tumour-specific TRM cells that were generated before melanoma inoculation conferred profound protection from tumour development independently of recirculating T cells. Finally, depletion of TRM cells triggered tumour outgrowth in a proportion (~20%) of mice with occult melanomas, demonstrating that TRM cells can actively suppress cancer progression. Our results show that TRM cells have a fundamental role in the surveillance of subclinical melanomas in the skin by maintaining cancer–immune equilibrium. As such, they provide strong impetus for exploring these cells as targets of future anticancer immunotherapies."
Acoustic higher-order topological insulator on a kagome lattice,"Higher-order topological insulators1,2,3,4,5 are a family of recently predicted topological phases of matter that obey an extended topological bulk–boundary correspondence principle. For example, a two-dimensional (2D) second-order topological insulator does not exhibit gapless one-dimensional (1D) topological edge states, like a standard 2D topological insulator, but instead has topologically protected zero-dimensional (0D) corner states. The first prediction of a second-order topological insulator1, based on quantized quadrupole polarization, was demonstrated in classical mechanical6 and electromagnetic7,8 metamaterials. Here we experimentally realize a second-order topological insulator in an acoustic metamaterial, based on a ‘breathing’ kagome lattice9 that has zero quadrupole polarization but a non-trivial bulk topology characterized by quantized Wannier centres2,9,10. Unlike previous higher-order topological insulator realizations, the corner states depend not only on the bulk topology but also on the corner shape; we show experimentally that they exist at acute-angled corners of the kagome lattice, but not at obtuse-angled corners. This shape dependence allows corner states to act as topologically protected but reconfigurable local resonances."
Kernel and Range Approach to Analytic Network Learning,"A novel learning approach for a composite function that can be written in the form of a matrix system of linear equations is introduced in this paper. This learning approach, which is gradient-free, is grounded upon the observation that solving the system of linear equations by manipulating the kernel and the range projection spaces using the Moore-Penrose inversion boils down to an approximation in the least squares error sense. In view of the heavy dependence on computation of the pseudoinverse, a simplification method is proposed. The learning approach is applied to learn a multilayer feedforward neural network with full weight connections. The numerical experiments on learning both synthetic and benchmark data sets not only validate the feasibility but also depict the performance of the proposed formulation."
Blacklist Creation for Detecting Fake Accounts on Twitter,"Social networking sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Weibo, etc. are extremely mainstream today. Also, the greater part of the malicious users utilize these sites to persuade legitimate users for different purposes, for example, to promote their products item, to enter their spam links, to stigmatize other persons, etc. An ever increasing number of users utilize these social networking sites and fake accounts on these destinations are turned into a major issue. In this paper, fake accounts are detected using blacklist instead of traditional spam words list. Blacklist is created using topic modeling approach and keyword extraction approach. We evaluate our blacklist based approach on 1KS-10KN dataset and Social Honeypot dataset and compared the accuracy with the traditional spam words list based approach. Diverse ensemble creation by oppositional relabeling of artificial training examples, a meta-learner classifier is applied for classifying fake accounts on Twitter from legitimate accounts. Our approach achieves 95.4% accuracy and true positive rate is 0.95."
Modified Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm for Multiple-vehicle Traveling Salesman Problems,"In this work, we extended the original Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to cover not only the case of multiple vehicles but also to constrain the minimum and maximum numbers of cities each vehicle can visit. Our algorithm is a modified Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm which has the ability to avoid local optima; our algorithm can be applied to transportation problem that covers either a single vehicle or multiple vehicles. To the original ACO, we added a new reproduction method, a new pheromone updating strategy, and four improved local search strategies. We tested our algorithm on several standard datasets in the TSP library. Its single-vehicle performance was compared to that of ant system (AS) and elitist ant system (EAS) algorithms. Its multiple-vehicle performance was evaluated against that of ant colony system variants reported in the literature. The experiments show that our proposed ACO’s single-vehicle performance was superior to that of AS and EAS on every tested dataset and its multiple-vehicle performance was excellent."
A Comprehensive Study on Power of Tests for Normality,"Many statistical procedures assume that the underling distribution is normal. In this paper, we consider the popular and powerful tests for normality and investigate the power values of these tests to detect deviations from normality. The family of four-parameter generalized lambda distributions (FMKL) for its high flexibility is considered as alternative distributions. We then compare the power values of normality tests against these alternatives and for different sample sizes. The considered tests are Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, Kuiper, Jarque-Bera, Cramer von Mises, Shapiro-Wilk and Vasicek. These tests are popular tests which are commonly used in practice and statistical software. The tests are described and then power values of the tests are compared against FMKL family by Monte Carlo simulation. The results are discussed and interpreted. Finally, we apply some real data examples to show the behavior of the tests in practice."
A Generalized Class of Estimators for Estimating Population Mean in the Presence of Non-Response,"Koyuncu and Kadilar proposed an estimator based on single auxiliary variable with complete response in stratified random sampling. In this paper, we extended Koyuncu and Kadilar’s estimator to a more generalized class of estimators using two-auxiliary variables in stratified random sampling for the situation of non-response and further introduced its another improved generalized class of estimators. The mathematical conditions under which proposed class of estimators are efficient as compare to Hansen and Hurwtiz estimator, and ratio estimators modified for stratified sampling have been derived. An empirical study has also been carried out to examine the performance of the suggested estimators."
Interval-Valued Uncertainty Based on Entropy and Dempster-Shafer Theory,"This paper presents a new structure as a simple method at two uncertainties (i.e., aleatory and epistemic) that result from variabilities inherent in nature and a lack of knowledge. Aleatory and epistemic uncertainties use the concept of the entropy and Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory, respectively. Accordingly, we propose the generalized Shannon entropy in the D-S theory as a measure of uncertainty. This theory has been originated in the work of Dempster on the use of probabilities with upper and lower bounds. We describe the framework of our approach to assess upper and lower uncertainty bounds for each state of a system. In this process, the uncertainty bound is calculated with the generalized Shannon entropy in the D-S theory in different states of these systems. The probabilities of each state are interval values. In the current study, the effect of epistemic uncertainty is considered between events with respect to the non-probabilistic method (e.g., D-S theory) and the aleatory uncertainty is evaluated by using an entropy index over probability distributions through interval-valued bounds. Therefore, identification of total uncertainties shows the efficiency of uncertainty quantification."
Weibull-Normal Distribution and its Applications,"In this paper, a Weibull-normal distribution, based on the standard quantile function of log-logistic distribution, is defined and studied. Some properties of the probability distribution are discussed. The Weibull-normal distribution is found to be unimodal or bimodal. The distribution can be right skewed or left skewed. The method of maximum likelihood estimation is suggested to estimate the parameters of the distribution. Three numerical data sets are used to illustrate the applications of the Weibull-normal distribution."
"Hepatitis A and E Outbreak Surveillance during 2015–2017 in Kashmir, India: Is the Water to Blame?","Waterborne diseases, such as Hepatitis A and E, are major public health concerns in most of the developing nations, indicating the need for proper outbreak prevention, surveillance, and timely management. This study presents data regarding the prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of hepatitis A and E outbreaks as well as water quality in Kashmir, India, during 2015–2017. Hepatitis outbreaks were initially investigated by rapid response teams, under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme. Suspected cases were further evaluated by blood sampling to confrm the disease along with water sampling evaluation. Between 2015 and 2017, 23 disease outbreaks were recorded; among these, four outbreaks occurred in 2015, 12 in 2016, and seven in 2017. Specifcally, 12 of the total outbreaks were concerned with hepatitis A infection, 10 concerned hepatitis E infection, and one involved eight cases of jaundice with neither hepatitis A virus nor hepatitis A virus detected in blood sampling. Overall, during the aforementioned period, 393 cases of hepatitis A or E were detected. Regarding water quality, which was evaluated using the most probable number method for counting coliform, 38 of 50 water samples were found to be unft for human consumption and one source was found to be suspicious. This study of prevalence and epidemiology of hepatitis A and E along with its relationship with water quality and socioeconomic factors, such as poor hygiene and lack of access to safe water, aids towards the implementation of effective preventive sanitary measures and public health actions."
Prevalence and Genetic Analysis of α- and β-Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Anemia in Southwest Iran,"This prospective study assessed the prevalence and genetic analysis of α- and β-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia (SCA) in Southwest Iran. Hematological indices were measured in 17,581 couples living in Khuzestan Province, Southwest Iran. Individuals with mean corpuscular volume <80, mean corpuscular hemoglobin <27, hemoglobin A2 ≥3/5 were considered as β-thalassemia traits. Prevalence of minor β-thalassemia, α-thalassemia, SCA, iron deficiency anemia, and silent thalassemia were respectively identified in 995 (5.6%), 1169 (6.65%), 1240 (7.05%), 911 (5.18%), and 1134 (6.45%) individuals using a multiplex amplification refractory mutation system, and direct DNA sequencing of globin genes. Three codons IVS-II-1 (G → A; 26%; n = 13), IVS-I-1 (G → T; 16%; n = 8), and IVS-I-110 (G → A; 14%; n = 7) were the most frequent mutants and IVS-II-1 was the most common β-thalassemia mutation. Also, based on a gap-polymerase chain reaction assay, genotype frequencies of α -globin mutations were –α 3.7 kb (50%; n = 25), Med/αα thal (12%; n = 6), and –α 4.2/αα (10%; n = 5), which were the most frequent deletion mutants (72% in total). The most common deletion (50%) was –αα 3.7 kb. Our data suggest that the population of Southwest Iran is at high risk of α- and β-thalassemia caused by these deletion mutants and SCA. Our findings will be useful for developing an efficient control program and genetic counseling."
"Burden of Breast Cancer in the Arab World: Findings from Global Burden of Disease, 2016","Epidemiology of breast cancer in the Arab region is understudied as compared with Western countries. We aimed to examine breast cancer epidemiology in Arab countries from 1990 to 2016. We analyzed the Global Burden of Disease, 2016 data for breast cancer among women in 22 Arab countries. Epidemiological measures including incidence, mortality, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were analyzed for breast cancer in women from 1990 to 2016. We also measured the burden of breast cancer stratified by the sociodemographic index (SDI). Our analysis indicates that the incidence of breast cancer in Arab women has risen over the past 26 years, but is still lower than global averages. In 2016, there were 45,980 new cases (28/100,000) and 20,063 deaths (11/100,000) in the region. The burden of breast cancer as estimated by DALYs was also lower than the global rates and tended to increase with increasing SDI. Although some studies have reported that Arab women present with breast cancer at a younger age, our analysis of age-specific rates, indicates that this is not statistically significant. Our findings indicate that a comprehensive plan to improve public awareness, screening, diagnosis, and treatment is required to reduce the growing burden of breast cancer in the Arab world."
Lifestyle Habits in Relation to Overweight and Obesity among Saudi Women Attending Health Science Colleges,"The study examined the associations between lifestyle habits and overweight/obesity among Saudi females attending health science colleges. A total of 454 female students were randomly recruited from five health science colleges at King Saud University, using a multistage stratified cluster sampling technique. Body weight and height were measured, and body mass index was calculated. All participants answered a validated questionnaire to assess physical activity (PA), sedentary behaviors (SB), sleep duration, and dietary habits. Results showed that the prevalence of overweight (21.4%) plus obesity (8.1%) among female participants was 29.5%. There was no significant difference between overweight/obese and nonoverweight/nonobese females in PA, screen time, sleep duration, or dietary habits. Overall, 50.4% of the participants were physically inactive (activity energy expenditure was <600 metabolic equivalent minutes per week). Active females showed significantly (p < 0.01) higher intakes of vegetables and fruits, lower chocolate/candy consumption (p = 0.05), and higher proportion of sufficient sleeping duration (>8 hours per night) (p < 0.001). It was concluded that half of the Saudi females in this study were physically inactive. Although PA positively impacted some of the lifestyle habits of college females, overweight/obesity was not associated with PA, SB, sleeping time, or dietary habits among the participants. Future research should attempt to elucidate the key factors involved in such relationship."
"Development of an Arabic Version of the Hiroshima University-Dental Behavioral Inventory: Cross-cultural Adaptation, Reliability, and Validity","The Hiroshima University-Dental Behavioral Inventory (HU-DBI) has not been adequately translated to the Arabic language. The aim of this study is the translation and cultural adaption of the English HU-DBI into standard Arabic. The English HU-DBI was translated into Arabic by three bilingual dental academics. A nonmedical professional performed backward translation into English. The three bilinguals compared both English versions and accordingly modified the Arabic version. English and Arabic versions were answered by 58 bilingual participants. Focus groups and cognitive interviews were conducted to pretest the working version, after which the final Arabic version was tested for test–retest validity on 58 dental students. Bilingual validity and test—retest validity were assessed using the kappa statistic. Responses were similar in the English and Arabic versions for bilingual individuals and on both tests in the test–retest sample. Kappa values ranged from 0.85 to 1.00 for bilingual validity and between 0.82 and 1.00 for test–retest reliability. In conclusion, the Arabic HU-DBI will enable the assessment of knowledge and attitudes toward oral diseases and their prevention in Arab countries and will allow meaningful comparisons between different countries in the region."
Service System of Easypaisa and MobiCash: Funds Transfer System via Telecommunication Companies in Context of Service Dominant Logic,"Because of emergence of new logic which is Service Dominant Logic focused on intangible resources, the co-creation of value, and relationships Service dominant logic assumed a major category of economic activity in developed countries around the world, reason is that service is an interactive process of “doing something for someone” that is valued. There is a need to understand each service sector under this logic. Many researchers are working on Service dominant logic and its impact on different aspects. And for this purpose, we have chosen Easypaisa and MobiCash to understand the fund transfer system of both service systems under this service dominant logic and studied different aspects of this service exchange to better understand how value and experience are evaluated. In this Study, the Service system of Easypaisa and the service system of MobiCash are compared under the concepts of Service system. We have conducted interview with respective person of each service system and collected information and data on each concept of service. We have used Interview Guide given by Lyons and Tracy (2013) to collect data on service system concepts. We find out that Service system of Easy paisa is covering almost all concepts of Service system but comparatively MobiCash is far behind from Easypaisa. Our analysis showed that Easypaisa is much better than MobiCash because Easypaisa rapidly built a high performing national footprint, relying exclusively on the GSM channel."
The dynamics of adaptive genetic diversity during the early stages of clonal evolution,"The dynamics of genetic diversity in large clonally evolving cell populations are poorly understood, despite having implications for the treatment of cancer and microbial infections. Here, we combine barcode lineage tracking, sequencing of adaptive clones and mathematical modelling of mutational dynamics to understand adaptive diversity changes during experimental evolution of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under nitrogen and carbon limitation. We find that, despite differences in beneficial mutational mechanisms and fitness effects, early adaptive genetic diversity increases predictably, driven by the expansion of many single-mutant lineages. However, a crash in adaptive diversity follows, caused by highly fit double-mutant ‘jackpot’ clones that are fed from exponentially growing single mutants, a process closely related to the classic Luria–Delbrück experiment. The diversity crash is likely to be a general feature of asexual evolution with clonal interference; however, both its timing and magnitude are stochastic and depend on the population size, the distribution of beneficial fitness effects and patterns of epistasis."
"How Social Security’s Earning Test, Age and Education Affect Female Labor Supply","This paper investigates the impact of a major Social Security policy change on the labor force participation rates of elderly females, both married and single, and of various races and ethnicities. Historically, social security benefits were reduced if labor income exceeded a certain level. The employment tax ranged from a $1 reduction for each $1 earned to a $1 reduction for each $3 earned. Prior to 2000, the age at which this reduction was no longer applied, varied between 70 and 75. However, in 2000 the age was lowered to what the Social Security Administration calls the normal retirement age which ranges between 65 and 67 depending on the date the person was born. Such a major change provided fertile ground for economic research. Studies have proliferated on the impact of the regime change on the labor force participation rates of elderly males. However, little work has been conducted regarding the impact of this policy change on female labor force participation rates. This study shows that after the employment tax was eliminated for those reaching their normal retirement age, the labor-force participation rates of single, divorced, separated and widowed women in the targeted age range usually increased. The estimates indicate the labor-force participation rates of married women in the affected age range fell with the elimination of the employment tax."

Self-healing of electrical damage in polymers using superparamagnetic nanoparticles,"High-voltage power transmission in electrical grids requires reliable and durable dielectric polymers for wire insulation1,2. Electrical treeing caused by high, local electric fields is a damaging process that leads to structure degradation and electrical conduction of dielectric materials, and ultimately, to catastrophic failure of the devices3,4,5. Here, we demonstrate that the addition of less than 0.1 volume per cent of superparamagnetic nanoparticles into a thermoplastic polymer enables the repair of regions damaged by electrical treeing and the restoration of the insulating properties. Under the application of an oscillating magnetic field, the embedded nanoparticles migrate to the electrical trees and generate a higher local temperature, which heals the electrical tree channels in the polymer. Our method allows us to regenerate the dielectric strength and electrical resistivity over multiple cycles of tree formation and healing, which could be used to increase the lifespan and sustainability of power cables for electronics and energy applications."
Coherent control of a hybrid superconducting circuit made with graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures,"Quantum coherence and control is foundational to the science and engineering of quantum systems1,2. In van der Waals materials, the collective coherent behaviour of carriers has been probed successfully by transport measurements3,4,5,6. However, temporal coherence and control, as exemplified by manipulating a single quantum degree of freedom, remains to be verified. Here we demonstrate such coherence and control of a superconducting circuit incorporating graphene-based Josephson junctions. Furthermore, we show that this device can be operated as a voltage-tunable transmon qubit7,8,9, whose spectrum reflects the electronic properties of massless Dirac fermions travelling ballistically4,5. In addition to the potential for advancing extensible quantum computing technology, our results represent a new approach to studying van der Waals materials using microwave photons in coherent quantum circuits."
Ultrasoft electronics to monitor dynamically pulsing cardiomyocytes,"In biointegrated electronics, the facile control of mechanical properties such as softness and stretchability in electronic devices is necessary to minimize the perturbation of motions inherent in biological systems1,2,3,4,5. For in vitro studies, multielectrode-embedded dishes6,7,8 and other rigid devices9,10,11,12 have been widely used. Soft or flexible electronics on plastic or elastomeric substrates13,14,15 offer promising new advantages such as decreasing physical stress16,17,18 and/or applying mechanical stimuli19,20. Recently, owing to the introduction of macroporous plastic substrates with nanofibre scaffolds21,22, three-dimensional electrophysiological mapping of cardiomyocytes has been demonstrated. However, quantitatively monitoring cells that exhibit significant dynamical motions via electric probes over a long period without affecting their natural motion remains a challenge. Here, we present ultrasoft electronics with nanomeshes that monitor the field potential of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes on a hydrogel, while enabling them to move dynamically without interference. Owing to the extraordinary softness of the nanomeshes, nanomesh-attached cardiomyocytes exhibit contraction and relaxation motions comparable to that of cardiomyocytes without attached nanomeshes. Our multilayered nanomesh devices maintain reliable operations in a liquid environment, enabling the recording of field potentials of the cardiomyocytes over a period of 96 h without significant degradation of the nanomesh devices or damage of the cardiomyocytes."

Activation of silent biosynthetic gene clusters using transcription factor decoys,"Here we report a transcription factor decoy strategy for targeted activation of eight large silent polyketide synthase and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters, ranging from 50 to 134 kilobases (kb) in multiple streptomycetes, and characterization of a novel oxazole family compound produced by a 98-kb biosynthetic gene cluster. Owing to its simplicity and ease of use, this strategy can be scaled up readily for discovery of natural products in streptomycetes."
Identification of pre-microRNAs by characterizing their sequence order evolution information and secondary structure graphs,"Distinction between pre-microRNAs (precursor microRNAs) and length-similar pseudo pre-microRNAs can reveal more about the regulatory mechanism of RNA biological processes. Machine learning techniques have been widely applied to deal with this challenging problem. However, most of them mainly focus on secondary structure information of pre-microRNAs, while ignoring sequence-order information and sequence evolution information."
PDRLGB: precise DNA-binding residue prediction using a light gradient boosting machine,"Identifying specific residues for protein-DNA interactions are of considerable importance to better recognize the binding mechanism of protein-DNA complexes. Despite the fact that many computational DNA-binding residue prediction approaches have been developed, there is still significant room for improvement concerning overall performance and availability."
"miRBaseConverter: an R/Bioconductor package for converting and retrieving miRNA name, accession, sequence and family information in different versions of miRBase","miRBase is the primary repository for published miRNA sequence and annotation data, and serves as the “go-to” place for miRNA research. However, the definition and annotation of miRNAs have been changed significantly across different versions of miRBase. The changes cause inconsistency in miRNA related data between different databases and articles published at different times. Several tools have been developed for different purposes of querying and converting the information of miRNAs between different miRBase versions, but none of them individually can provide the comprehensive information about miRNAs in miRBase and users will need to use a number of different tools in their analyses."
Constructing a database for the relations between CNV and human genetic diseases via systematic text mining,"The detection and interpretation of CNVs are of clinical importance in genetic testing. Several databases and web services are already being used by clinical geneticists to interpret the medical relevance of identified CNVs in patients. However, geneticists or physicians would like to obtain the original literature context for more detailed information, especially for rare CNVs that were not included in databases."
Computational prediction of plasma protein binding of cyclic peptides from small molecule experimental data using sparse modeling techniques,"Cyclic peptide-based drug discovery is attracting increasing interest owing to its potential to avoid target protein depletion. In drug discovery, it is important to maintain the biostability of a drug within the proper range. Plasma protein binding (PPB) is the most important index of biostability, and developing a computational method to predict PPB of drug candidate compounds contributes to the acceleration of drug discovery research. PPB prediction of small molecule drug compounds using machine learning has been conducted thus far; however, no study has investigated cyclic peptides because experimental information of cyclic peptides is scarce."
DWNN-RLS: regularized least squares method for predicting circRNA-disease associations,"Many evidences have demonstrated that circRNAs (circular RNA) play important roles in controlling gene expression of human, mouse and nematode. More importantly, circRNAs are also involved in many diseases through fine tuning of post-transcriptional gene expression by sequestering the miRNAs which associate with diseases. Therefore, identifying the circRNA-disease associations is very appealing to comprehensively understand the mechanism, treatment and diagnose of diseases, yet challenging. As the complex mechanism between circRNAs and diseases, wet-lab experiments are expensive and time-consuming to discover novel circRNA-disease associations. Therefore, it is of dire need to employ the computational methods to discover novel circRNA-disease associations."
Predicting protein-protein interactions using high-quality non-interacting pairs,"Identifying protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is of paramount importance for understanding cellular processes. Machine learning-based approaches have been developed to predict PPIs, but the effectiveness of these approaches is unsatisfactory. One major reason is that they randomly choose non-interacting protein pairs (negative samples) or heuristically select non-interacting pairs with low quality."
The highly surprising behaviour of diphosphine ligands in iron-catalysed Negishi cross-coupling,"Iron-catalysed cross-coupling is undergoing explosive development, but mechanistic understanding lags far behind synthetic methodology. Here, we find that the activity of iron–diphosphine pre-catalysts in the Negishi coupling of benzyl halides is strongly dependent on the diphosphine, but the ligand does not appear to be coordinated to the iron during turnover. This was determined using time-resolved in operando X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy employing a custom-made flow cell and confirmed by 31P NMR spectroscopy. While the diphosphine ligands tested are all able to coordinate to iron(ii), in the presence of excess zinc(ii)—as in the catalytic reaction—they coordinate predominantly to the zinc. Furthermore, combined synthetic and kinetic investigations implicate the formation of a putative mixed Fe–Zn(dpbz) species before the rate-limiting step of catalysis. These unexpected findings may not only impact the field of iron-catalysed Negishi cross-coupling, but potentially beyond to reactions catalysed by other transition metal/diphosphine complexes."
Introducing a Model of Urban Taxi Driver’s Offenses,"The aim of this study is to investigate the unsafe behavior of taxi drivers as a large group of professional drivers and the factors affecting driving violations occurring in Tehran. For this goal, the data regarding driving offenses of urban taxi drivers in 22 districts of Tehran from 2015 to 2016 has been collected from traffic police and used in statistical analysis and multiple regression modeling. According to the results, the probability of a red light violation during working days is more than non-working days. In addition, taxi drivers older than 70 are more likely to commit red light violation compared to the drivers younger than 30. Moreover, prohibited entry is more probable to occur during working days being about 2.5 times more than that of non-working days. Besides, drivers with newer and more expensive cars commit less driving offenses compared to the drivers with older and cheaper cars. Finally, it was found that by increasing the engine power of the vehicles, the rate of driving offenses by taxi drivers is decreased, such that in cars with 1600 cc engine power or less, the probability of not paying attention to the police regulations is six times more than the cars with 1800 cc engine power and more."
Computational drug repositioning using meta-path-based semantic network analysis,"Drug repositioning is a promising and efficient way to discover new indications for existing drugs, which holds the great potential for precision medicine in the post-genomic era. Many network-based approaches have been proposed for drug repositioning based on similarity networks, which integrate multiple sources of drugs and diseases. However, these methods may simply view nodes as the same-typed and neglect the semantic meanings of different meta-paths in the heterogeneous network. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a rational method to infer new indications for approved drugs."
Optimizing gene set annotations combining GO structure and gene expression data,"With the rapid accumulation of genomic data, it has become a challenge issue to annotate and interpret these data. As a representative, Gene set enrichment analysis has been widely used to interpret large molecular datasets generated by biological experiments. The result of gene set enrichment analysis heavily relies on the quality and integrity of gene set annotations. Although several methods were developed to annotate gene sets, there is still a lack of high quality annotation methods. Here, we propose a novel method to improve the annotation accuracy through combining the GO structure and gene expression data."
Wat de huisarts moet weten over de HPV-vaccinatie,"Al bijna tien jaar krijgen twaalfjarige meisjes in Nederland de HPV-vaccinatie aangeboden ter preventie van het cervixcarcinoom. De vaccinatiegraad voor HPV is nog steeds aanzienlijk lager vergeleken met de andere vaccinaties in het rijksvaccinatieprogramma. Zijn er goede redenen voor de terughoudendheid onder ouders en meisjes? De huidige HPV-vaccinaties zijn immers veilige en effectieve vaccins tegen de meest voorkomende hoogrisico-HPV-subtypes die een rol spelen bij het ontstaan van diverse HPV-gerelateerde carcinomen van de huid en slijmvliezen. De HPV-vaccinatie laat een blijvende immuniteit zien na acht tot negen jaar, die nog niet afneemt. Er is tevens sprake van kruisbescherming tegen enkele andere hoogrisicosubtypes. Bij een hogere vaccinatiegraad is er bovendien sprake van een collectieve immuniteit voor de verschillende subtypes van HPV. De vaccinatie is kosteneffectiever als iemand nog niet seksueel actief is geweest, maar heeft ook in de seksueel actieve groep een beschermende werking."
Kosteneffectiviteit van diagnose van urineweginfecties bij vrouwen,Inleiding Urineweginfecties (UWI’s) komen vaak voor in de huisartsenpraktijk. De onderzoekers bekeken de kosteneffectiviteit van verschillende strategieën om de diagnose urineweginfectie te stellen.
Dubio in speculo,"Het advies om specula altijd te steriliseren is terecht, maar het advies specula steriel te verpakken is niet wetenschappelijk onderbouwd en zorgt voor praktische problemen in de huisartsenpraktijk. Zolang men maar een methode toepast waardoor duidelijk is dat een speculum gesteriliseerd is, is verpakken niet nodig."
Induction of superovulation in mature mice and rats using serum of spayed female dogs,"The following experiments were designed to examine the effect of serum of spayed dogs on superovulation response in mice and rats. In Experiment 1, female mice at diestrus (n=30) were divided into three equal groups and superovulated with either administration of 5 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) or recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (rFSH) (reducing dose from 2.5 to 0.5 IU) and 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administered 48h later. Serum of spayed dogs was administered intraperitoneally at a reduced dose from 0.1 to 0.025 mL in a 48 h period. In Experiment 2, female rats (n=30) at diestrus stage were divided into three equal groups. Superovulation was induced using either 30 IU PMSG, or a dose reduced from 5 to 1 IU rFSH and 25 IU hCG administered 48h later. Serum of spayed dogs was administered in a reduced dose from 0.6 to 0.1 mL in a 48 hour period. Female mice and rats were mated 24 h following hCG administration. On day 14 after mating, animals were euthanized and ovarian sections were fixed for histopathological evaluation and corpus luteum (CL) counting. No significant difference observed in mean (±SEM) number of CLs between the PMSG group and the mice that received serum of spayed dog (10.4±1.3 vs 9.2±1.0). Mean (±SEM) number of CLs tended to be lower in rats that received serum of spayed dog than those of rats which received either PMSG or rFSH (15.1±1.9 vs 23.6±3.1 and 23.1±2.9, P=0.06, respectively). In conclusion, serum of spayed dogs is able to induce a superovulatory response in mice and rats."
[18F]FET PET is a useful tool for treatment evaluation and prognosis prediction of anti-angiogenic drug in an orthotopic glioblastoma mouse model,"O-2-18F-fluoroethyl-l-tyrosine ([18F]FET) has been widely used for glioblastomas (GBM) in clinical practice, although evaluation of its applicability in non-clinical research is still lacking. The objective of this study was to examine the value of [18F]FET for treatment evaluation and prognosis prediction of anti-angiogenic drug in an orthotopic mouse model of GBM. Human U87MG cells were implanted into nude mice and then bevacizumab, a representative anti-angiogenic drug, was administered. We monitored the effect of anti-angiogenic agents using multiple imaging modalities, including bioluminescence imaging (BLI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT). Among these imaging methods analyzed, only [18F]FET uptake showed a statistically significant decrease in the treatment group compared to the control group (P=0.02 and P=0.03 at 5 and 20 mg/kg, respectively). This indicates that [18F]FET PET is a sensitive method to monitor the response of GBM bearing mice to anti-angiogenic drug. Moreover, [18F]FET uptake was confirmed to be a significant parameter for predicting the prognosis of anti-angiogenic drug (P=0.041 and P=0.007, on Days 7 and 12, respectively, on Pearson’s correlation; P=0.048 and P=0.030, on Days 7 and 12, respectively, on Cox regression analysis). However, results of BLI or MRI were not significantly associated with survival time. In conclusion, this study suggests that [18F]FET PET imaging is a pertinent imaging modality for sensitive monitoring and accurate prediction of treatment response to anti-angiogenic agents in an orthotopic model of GBM."
"Comparison of the anesthetic effects of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol on ICR mice derived from three different sources","This study was conducted to compare the anesthetic effects of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (TBE, Avertin®) in ICR mice obtained from three different sources. TBE (2.5%) was intraperitoneally injected at three doses: high-dose group (500 mg/kg), intermediate-dose group (250 mg/kg), and low-dose group (125 mg/kg). Anesthesia time, recovery time, end-tidal peak CO2 (ETCO2), mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), body temperature, pH, PCO2, and PO2 of the arterial blood were measured. Stable anesthesia was induced by all doses of TBE and the anesthesia time was maintained exhibited dose dependency. No significant differences in anesthetic duration were found among the three different strains. However, the anesthesia time was longer in female than in male mice, and the duration of anesthesia was significantly longer in female than in male mice in the high-dose group. The recovery time was significantly longer for female than male mice in the intermediate- and high-dose groups. In the ICR strains tested, there were no significant differences in the mean arterial blood pressure, SPO2, arterial blood PCO2, and PO2, which decreased after TBE anesthesia, or in heart rate and ETCO2, which increased after TBE anesthesia. In addition, body temperature, blood biochemical markers, and histopathological changes of the liver, kidney, and lung were not significantly changed by TBE anesthesia. These results suggested that ICR mice from different sources exhibited similar overall responses to a single exposure to TBE anesthesia. In conclusion, TBE is a useful drug that can induce similar anesthetic effects in three different strains of ICR mice."
A comparison of metabolomic changes in type-1 diabetic C57BL/6N mice originating from different sources,"Animal models have been used to elucidate the pathophysiology of varying diseases and to provide insight into potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Although alternatives to animal testing have been proposed to help overcome potential drawbacks related to animal experiments and avoid ethical issues, their use remains vital for the testing of new drug candidates and to identify the most effective strategies for therapeutic intervention. Particularly, the study of metabolic diseases requires the use of animal models to monitor whole-body physiology. In line with this, the National Institute of Food and Drug Safety Evaluation (NIFDS) in Korea has established their own animal strains to help evaluate both efficacy and safety during new drug development. The objective of this study was to characterize the response of C57BL/6NKorl mice from the NIFDS compared with that of other mice originating from the USA and Japan in a chemical-induced diabetic condition. Multiple low-dose treatments with streptozotocin were used to generate a type-1 diabetic animal model which is closely linked to the known clinical pathology of this disease. There were no significantly different responses observed between the varying streptozotocin-induced type-1 diabetic models tested in this study. When comparing control and diabetic mice, increases in liver weight and disturbances in serum amino acids levels of diabetic mice were most remarkable. Although the relationship between type-1 diabetes and BCAA has not been elucidated in this study, the results, which reveal a characteristic increase in diabetic mice of all origins are considered worthy of further study."
Inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress in high-fat-diet-induced obese C57BL/6 mice: Efficacy of a novel extract from mulberry (Morus alba) leaves fermented with Cordyceps militaris,"A few clues about correlation between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mulberry (Morus alba) leaves were investigated in only the experimental autoimmune myocarditis and streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To investigate whether a novel extract of mulberry leaves fermented with Cordyceps militaris (EMfC) could suppress ER in fatty liver, alterations in the key parameters for ER stress response were measured in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese C57L/6 mice treated with EMfC for 12 weeks. The area of adipocytes in the liver section were significantly decreased in the HFD+EMfC treated group as compared to the HFD+Vehicle treated group, while their level was higher in HFD+Vehicle treated group than No treated group. The level of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 beta (IRE1α) phosphorylation and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) expression were remarkably enhanced in the HFD+Vehicle treated group. However, their levels were restored in the HFD+EMfC treated group, although some differences were detected in the decrease rate. Similar recovery was observed on the ER stress-induced apoptosis. The level of Caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bax were decreased in the HFD+EMfC and HFD+orlistat (OT) treated group compared to the HFD+Vehicle treated group. The results of the present study therefore provide first evidence that EMfC with the antiobesity effects can be suppressed ER stress and ER stress-induced apoptosis in the hepatic steatosis of HFD-induced obesity model."
"Genetic and morphometric characteristics of Korean wild mice (KWM/Hym) captured at Chuncheon, South Korea","Laboratory inbred mice are used widely and commonly in biomedical research, but inbred mice do not have a big enough gene pool for the research. In this study, genetic and morphometric analyses were performed to obtain data on the characteristics of a newly developing inbred strain (KWM/Hym) captured from Chuncheon, Korea. All of five Korean wild male mice have the zinc-finger Y (ZfY) gene. Also, all of 19 Korean wild mice used in this analysis have the AKV-type murine leukemia virus gene, indicating that Korean wild mice might be Mus musculus musculus. To identify the genetic polymorphism in KWM/Hym, SNP analysis was performed. In a comparison with 28 SNP markers, there was a considerable difference between KWM/Hym and several inbred strains. The homogeneity between KWM/Hym and the inbred strains was as follows: C57BL/6J (39.3%), BALB/c AJic (42.9%), and DBA/2J (50%). KWM/Hym is most similar to the PWK/PhJ inbred strain (96.4%) derived from wild mice (Czech Republic). To identify the morphometric characteristics of KWM/Hym, the external morphology was measured. The tail ratio of male and female was 79.60±3.09 and 73.55±6.14%, respectively. KWM/Hym has short and agouti-colored hairs and its belly is white with golden hair. Taking these results together, KWM/Hym, a newly developing inbred mouse originated from wild mouse, might be use as new genetic resources to overcome the limitations of the current laboratory mice."
Protective effects of cultured and fermented ginseng extracts against scopolamine-induced memory loss in a mouse model,"This study was performed to investigate the effect of a concentrate of fermented wild ginseng root culture (HLJC0701) on memory improvement in the scopolamine (SPL)-induced memory-deficient mouse model. Eight-week-old male ICR mice were used to evaluate the protective effect of HLJC0701 against the SPL-induced memory loss animal model. The Morris water maze test, which measures hippocampus-dependent learning ability, and the Y-maze test, a short-term memory assessment test, were performed and related markers were analyzed. HLJG0701-treated groups displayed significantly reduced acetylcholinesterase activity and increased acetylcholine level compared with the SPL-administered group (SPL-G) (P<0.05). In the Y-maze test, the spontaneous alternation in al HLJC0711-treated groups was significantly increased compared with that in SPL-G (P<0.05). In the Morris water maze test, the escape latency and time spent in the target quadrant in all HLJC0701-treated groups were significantly decreased and increased, respectively, compared with those in SPL-G (P<0.05). In addition, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor level in groups treated with HLJC0701 300 and 600 mg/kg body weight was significantly increased compared with that in SPL-G (P<0.05). These results suggest that the HLJC0701 may protect against memory loss by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity and preventing acetylcholine deficiency."
Decrease in glucose transporter 1 levels and translocation of glucose transporter 3 in the dentate gyrus of C57BL/6 mice and gerbils with aging,"In the present study, we compared the cell-specific expression and changes protein levels in the glucose transporters (GLUTs) 1 and 3, the major GLUTs in the mouse and gerbil brains using immuno-histochemistry and Western blot analysis. In both mouse and gerbils, GLUT1 immunoreactivity was mainly found in the blood vessels in the dentate gyrus, while GLUT3 immunoreactivity was detected in the subgranular zone and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. GLUT1-immunoreactivity in blood vessels and GLUT1 protein levels were significantly decreased with age in the mice and gerbils, respectively. In addition, few GLUT3-immunoreactive cells were found in the subgranular zone in aged mice and gerbils, but GLUT3-immunoreactivity was abundantly found in the polymorphic layer of dentate gyrus in mice and gerbils with a dot-like pattern. Based on the double immunofluorescence study, GLUT3-immunoreactive structures in gerbils were localized in the glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive astrocytes in the dentate gyrus. Western blot analysis showed that GLUT3 expression in the hippocampal homogenates was slightly, although not significantly, decreased with age in mice and gerbils, respectively. These results indicate that the reduction in GLUT1 in the blood vessels of dentate gyrus and GLUT3 in the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus may be associated with the decrease in uptake of glucose into brain and neuroblasts in the dentate gyrus. In addition, the expression of GLUT3 in the astrocytes in polymorphic layer of dentate gyrus may be associated with metabolic changes in glucose in aged hippocampus."
Protective effect of water extract of guibi-tang against pulmonary inflammation induced by cigarette smoke and lipopolysaccharide,"Water extract of guibi-tang (GB), a traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean herbal medicine, is used to treat memory impairment, insomnia, and peptic ulcers. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of GB on pulmonary inflammation induced by cigarette smoke (CS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). C57BL/6 mice were used to develop a pulmonary inflammation model by exposing them to CS for 1 h per day for 7 days. LPS was intranasally administered to mice under mild anesthesia on day 5. GB was administered 1 h before CS exposure at doses of 50 or 100 mg/kg for 7 days. Our results showed that GB suppressed the CS and LPS induced elevation in inflammatory cell counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), with significant reductions in protein, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-6 levels. Histological studies revealed that GB decreased the inflammatory cell infiltration into lung tissue caused by CS- and LPS-exposure. GB also significantly decreased the CS and LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the lung tissue. Taken together, GB effectively attenuated airway inflammation caused by CS and LPS. These results indicate that GB is a potential therapeutic herbal formula for pulmonary inflammatory disease."
In vitro and in vivo inhibition of Helicobacter pylori by Lactobacilllus paracasei HP7,"The efficacy of standard therapeutic strategies for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is decreasing over time due to the emergence of drug-resistant strains. As an alternative, the present study investigated the capacity of Lactobacilllus paracasei (L. paracasei) HP7, isolated from kimchi, to inhibit H. pylori growth. The effects of L. paracasei HP7 on H. pylori adhesion and H. pylori-induced inflammation were examined in ACS human gastric adenocarcinoma epithelial cells and a mouse model of H. pylori SS1 infection. L. paracasei HP7 reduced H. pylori adhesion to ACS cells and suppressed the inflammatory response in infected cells by downregulating interleukin-8. H. pylori colonization in the stomach of C57BL/6 mice was demonstrated by rapid urease test, and results showed significant decrease in mice post-treated with L. paracasei HP7. Additionally, L. paracasei HP7 decreased gastric inflammation and epithelial lesions in the stomach of H. pylori-infected mice. These results demonstrate that L. paracasei HP7 treatment can inhibit H. pylori growth and is thus a promising treatment for patients with gastric symptoms such as gastritis that are caused by H. pylori infection."
"Inhibitory effects of Pycnogenol®, a pine bark extract, in a rat model of testosterone propionate-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia","Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) is a male reproductive disease that has gained increasing importance in recent years. The present study investigated whether Pycnogenol® (PYC), a standardized French maritime pine bark extract, could prevent BPH induced by testosterone propionate (TP) in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups of six rats. One group was used as a normal control rats and the other groups received subcutaneous injections of TP for 4 weeks to induce BPH. In the two treatment groups, PYC (20 or 40 mg/kg) was administered daily for 4 weeks by oral gavage concurrently with the induction of TP. All rats were sacrificed at the scheduled termination time, the prostates were weighed, and histopathologic examinations were conducted. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels in serum and the prostate were measured, and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67 proteins was investigated. BPH-treated animals showed increases in the relative weight of the prostate, higher concentrations of DHT in serum and the prostate, and higher expression of PCNA and Ki-67 in the prostate; in contrast, PYC-treated animals had significant reductions in these factors compared with the BPH animals. These findings indicated that PYC inhibited the development of BPH and that this was closely associated with a reduction in DHT concentration."
The Application of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Mri) to the Examination of Plant Tissues and Water Barriers,"The aim of the present study is to extend the applicability of MRI measurements similar to those used in human diagnostics to the examination of water barriers in living plants, thus broadening their use in natural sciences. The cucumber, Cucumis sativus, and Phillyrea angustifolia, or false olive, were chosen as test plants. The MRI measurements were carried out on three samples of each plant in the same position vis-a-vis the MRI apparatus using a Siemens Avanto MRI scanner. Two different relaxation times were employed, T1 capable of histological mapping, and T2, used for the examination of water content. In the course of the analysis, it was found that certain histological formations and branching cause modifications to the intensity detected with relaxation time T2. Furthermore, these positions can also be found in T1 measurements. A. monotonie correlation (cucumber: p = 0.829; false olive: p = -0.84) was observed between the T1 and T2 measurements. In the course of the statistical analysis of the signal intensities of the xylems it was concluded that they cannot be regarded as independent in a statistical sense; these changes rather depend on the anatomie structure of the plant, as the intensity profile is modified by nodes, leaves and branches. This serves as a demonstration of the applicability of MRI to the measurement of well know plant physiological processes. The special parametrization required for this equipment, which is usually used in human diagnostics, is also documented in the present study."
Biochemical Changes in Ears of Wheat Genotypes Subjected to Fusarium spp. Attack,"In wheat, Fusarium fungus promotes the appearance of destructive disease named as Fusarium head blight (FHB) that can cause grain yield reduction and mycotoxin accumulation. The focus of this research was to verify the influence of Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum on wheat genotypes with different susceptibility to FHB: “Super Žitarka” (susceptible), “Lucija” (moderately resistant) and “Apache” (resistant). The experiment was performed under field conditions by artificial spore inoculation of ears at the flowering stage. The effectiveness of antioxidative enzymes, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were observed at several sampling points after Fusarium inoculation (3, 15 and 24 hours). “Lucija” responded to pathogen by increase of guaiacol peroxidase (POD) activity, high H2O2 and MDA content in the early post-inoculation times (3 and 15 hours), compared to control. “Super Žitarka” displayed inhibition of catalase (CAT) activity throughout the whole time course of the experiment. Infected plants of “Apache” showed notable decline in MDA content over time. Moreover, in “Apache” increased H2O2 accumulation was observed immediately after Fusarium exposure (3 and 15 hours), compared to 24 hours. Rapid overproduction of H2O2 under Fusarium stress marked “Apache” as FHB-resistant."
Sodiumnitroprusside Stimulated Production of Tropane Alkaloids and Antioxidant Enzymes Activity in Hairy Root Culture of Hyoscyamus Reticulatus L.,"Hyoscyamus reticulatus L. is a herbaceous biennial belonging to the solanaceae family. Hyoscyamine and scopolamine as main tropane alkaloids accumulated in henbane are widely used in medicine to treat diseases such as parkinson’s or to calm schizoid patients. Hairy roots media manipulation which uses elicitors to activate defense mechanisms is one of the main strategies for inducing secondary metabolism as well as increasing the production of valuable metabolites. Cotyledon-derived hairy root cultures were transformed by Agrobacterium rhizogenes. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a nitric oxide donor), was used in various concentrations (0, 50, 100, 200 and 300 uM) and exposure times (24 and 48 h). Treatment with SNP led to a significant reduction in fresh and dry weight of hairy roots, compared to control cultures. ANOVA results showed that elicitation of hairy root cultures with SNP at different concentrations and exposure times significantly affected the activity of as antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), per-oxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). The highest hyoscyamine and scopolamine production (about 1.2-fold and 1.5-fold increases over the control) was observed at 50 and 100 uM SNP at 48 and 24 hours of exposure time, respectively. This is the first report of SNP elicitation effects on the production of tropane alkaloids in hairy root cultures."
In vitro Pharmacological Effects of Astragalus eremophilus and Melilotus parviflora,"Traditional medicines are composed of herbal formulations and their active ingredients and constituents which play a crucial role in the treatment of various human ailments. Astragalus eremophilus and Melilotus indicus (L.) All. (syn. Melilotusparviflora Desf.) are used traditionally as antiperspirant, tonic, diuretic, laxative and narcotic agents. The current study was designed to investigate the Astragalus eremophilus and Melilotus indicus (L.) All. (syn. Melilotus parviflora Desf.) methanol extracts for their anti-oxidant, antibacterial and antifungal activities. Fine powder of A. eremophilus and M. parviflora was extracted with 70% methanol to get crude methanol extract. Extract was characterized for antioxidant, antibacterial and antifungal activities. Antioxidant activity of various concentrations (3 mg/ml, 1.5 mg/ ml, 0.75 mg/ml, and 0.38 mg/ml) of both plant extracts was analyzed using 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical. Salmonella typhemorium, Klebsiellapneumoniae (gram-negatie)andStaphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis (gram-positive) bacterial strains were used for assessment of antibacterial activities. Antifungal activities of 7.5 mg/ml, 5.0 mg/ml, 2.5 mg/ml (A. eremophilus and M. parviflora) were conducted using Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicons. At high concentration (3 mg/ml), all the tested fractions of A. eremophilus and M. parviflora methanol extracts showed potent antioxidant activities, ranging between 83.8 and 63.33%. Antibacterial activities revealed that A. eremophilus showed a maximum zone of inhibition (8.1 ±0.1) on Salmonella typheno-rium foliowed by Enterococcus faecalis (7.2 ± 0.1), Klebsellesa pneumonia (6.1 ± 0.6), and Staphylococcus aureus (5.1 ±0.4), and at highest concentration (7.5 mg/ml), however, maximum zone of inhibition of Melilotus parviflora was at 7.5 mg/ml foliowed by 5.0 mg/ml and 2.5 mg/ml against Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhemorium and Enterococcus faecalis. Antifungal assessment of both plant extracts showed that the higher concentration (7.5 mg/ml) has significant inhibitory effect as compared to control. The results can lead to the conclusion that A. eremophilus and M. parviflora methanol extracts are indeed sources of potential therapeutic compounds against antibacterial, antifungal and free radical associated disorders."
Transcriptional Profiling of Catalase Genes in Juglone-Treated Seeds of Maize (Zea Mays L.) and Wheat (Triticum Aestivum L.),"The major aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of juglone (JU; 5-hydroxy-l,4-naph-thoquinone) treatments on the expression level of Catl, Cat2 and Cat3 genes, encoding the respective catalase isozymes in maize (Zeamays L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seeds. In parallel, germination efficiency, catalase (CAT) activity and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content in juglone-exposed cereal seeds were assessed. Juglone applications significantly stimulated abundance of three target catalase transcripts as well as induced CAT activity and generation of H2O2 in both maize and wheat kernels. Furthermore, germination process of juglone-affected maize seeds was more severe suppressed than in case of wheat kernels. The role of juglone in triggering the oxidative stress as well as antioxidative responses in seeds of the studied model cereal species are discussed."
Distributional pattern of Sardinian orchids under a climate change scenario,"The Mediterranean is one of the major biodiversity hotspots of the world. It has been identified as the “core” of the speciation process for many groups of organisms. It hosts an impressive number of species, many of which are classified as endangered taxa. Climate change in such a diverse context could heavily influence community composition, reducing ecosystems resistance and resilience. This study aims at depicting the distribution of nine orchid species in the island of Sardinia (Italy), and at forecasting their future distribution in consequence of climate change. The models were produced by following an “ensemble” approach. We analysed present and future (2070) niche for the nine species, using Land Use and Soil Type, as well as 8 bioclimatic variables as predictors, selected because of their influence on the fitness of these orchids. Climate change in the next years, at Mediterranean latitudes, is predicted to results mainly in an increase of temperature and a decrease of precipitation. In 2070, the general trend for almost all modelled taxa is the widening of the suitable areas. However, not always the newly gained areas have high probability of presence. A correct interpretation of environmental changes is needed for developing effective conservation strategies."
Möbius Regular Maps of Order pq,"Möbius regular maps are surface embeddings of graphs with doubled edges such that (i) the automorphism group of the embedding acts regularly on flags and (ii) each doubled edge is a center of a Möbius band on the surface. In this paper, we classify Möbius regular maps of order pq for any two primes p and q, where p ≠ q."
On Tubular Tilting Objects in the Stable Category of Vector Bundles,The present paper focuses on the study of the stable category of vector bundles for the weighted projective lines of weight triple. We find some important triangles in this category and use them to construct tilting objects with tubular endomorphism algebras for the case of genus one via cluster tilting theory.
"Plumage polymorphism and variation in the melanocortin-1 receptor gene in the Fuscous Flycatcher, Cnemotriccus fuscatus (Wied, 1831)","We investigated the possible mechanisms behind the variation plumage color of the Fuscous Flycatcher, Cnemotriccus fuscatus, by sequencing the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene, which has been associated with the variation in plumage coloration in birds. C. fuscatus is widely distributed in South America and includes seven subspecies, which differ in their plumage coloration. Here we tested the hypothesis that the variation in the MC1R gene explains the plumage polymorphism found in C. fuscatus. We sequenced the MC1R gene in six subspecies, representing two groups: group 1 (yellow morph), with three subspecies, C. f. duidae, C. f. fumosus, and C. f. fuscatus, and group 2 (white morph), with the remaining subspecies, C. f. bimaculatus, C. f. beniensis, and C. f. fuscatior. The only variation we found among the C. fuscatus sequences were six non-synonymous substitutions from 22 variable sites, none of which were associated systematically with either plumage morph. The result of the neutrality test indicated that the polymorphism of the MC1R gene is not suggestive of significant selection pressure. We conclude that variation in plumage coloration in C. fuscatus does not appear to be determined by the MC1R gene, and that it may be related to other loci or under the influence of environmental factors."
Demography of the Neotropical austral migrant Elaenia albiceps chilensis (Tyrannidae) on its breeding grounds: climate and food offer effects,"The White-crested Elaenia (Elaenia albiceps chilensis) is a Neotropical austral migrant that breeds in Patagonian forests and overwinter in South America tropics. We investigated White-crested Elaenia demography and the environmental conditions the specie is subjected at the northwest of Patagonia as a first attempt to elucidate its population dynamic. We studied the species abundance, individuals’ body condition, survival, productivity of young and site fidelity according to changes in rainfall patterns and food supply, during three breeding seasons (2009 to 2012). We color banded 361 adult and juvenile White-crested Elaenias. During the first studied season, precipitations were remarkably above the mean and ripe fruit supply was lower than in the other seasons, whereas the abundance of arthropods remained similar along the study. The species abundance decreased 50% across the study, while adult apparent survival rate, the number of breeding females, young productivity and site fidelity were 50% lower in the first season in comparison to the following seasons. Females presented lower body condition at arrival in the first two studied periods. Site fidelity diminished after unfavorable breeding season (i.e. low young productivity and fruit supply), especially for males, although they were more faithful than females and had a slightly higher apparent survival rate. Our results suggest that White-crested Elaenia demography is affected by changes in its main food resource supply (fleshy fruits) during the breeding season, indicating that this part of the annual cycle could be fundamental for its population dynamic."
The Historic Urban Landscape and the Metropolis,"The Historic Urban Landscape (HUL) recommendation adopted by UNESCO in 2011 provides a holistic approach based on landscape planning principles. It is in line with the International Guidelines for Urban and Territorial Planning adopted by UN-Habitat in 2015 (UN-Habitat 2015). HUL concerns the integration of culture in territorial planning processes and the historical urban centre inside their urban or city context. Large cities are becoming the dominant pattern of the human settlements worldwide. They are the main engine of economic development, attracting people for jobs, creating the highest values and are the main support for the globalisation process. The 21st century is the era of the metropolis, with a large increase of cities of more than 500,000 inhabitants. The heritage of the 21st century will be building through the metropolis. We can consider the metropolis as an artefact of the humankind. It produces large urban–rural systems supported by large infrastructures, iconic buildings and specific facilities. The upgrading of the main characteristics of the metropolis adds value in cities for the quality of life, creating new heritage at a scale greater than the existing world heritage categories. HUL could be extended as a relevant approach to be applied on the metropolitan scale."
Public Perceptions of Earthquake Risk and the Impact on Land Pricing: The Case of the Uemachi Fault Line in Japan,"In this paper, we explore how land pricing reflects public perceptions of earthquake risk using officially appraised prices of land situated along the Uemachi fault, which lies on a north–south axis in the east of Japan’s Osaka Prefecture. We reveal that land pricing along this fault has only incorporated fault-driven earthquake risk since residents and policy-makers first realized its potential following damage to the southern part of Hyogo Prefecture in a January 1995 earthquake along the Rokko—Awaji fault (an event now known as the Hanshin—Awaji earthquake). We find evidence of a discount of 20% in nonresidential land prices for every kilometre closer to the Uemachi fault line since the Hanshin—Awaji earthquake."
Macroeconomic Interdependence Between a Stagnant and a Fully Employed Country,"This paper presents a two-country two-commodity dynamic model where one country achieves full employment and the other suffers from secular stagnation of aggregate demand. Own and spillover effects of changes in preference, productivity and policy parameters are examined. Parameter changes that improve the stagnant country’s current account, such as a reduction in government purchases, a decrease in foreign aid and an improvement in productivity, raise the relative price of the home commodity. Consequently, home employment shrinks, deflation worsens and consumption decreases. The terms of trade for the full-employment country deteriorate. Thus, income and consumption decrease in both countries."
Do karst woody plants control xylem tension to avoid substantial xylem cavitation in the wet season?,Plants have been hypothesized to maintain strong control over xylem tension by closing stomata and to operate at a water potential above or near the critical potential at which cavitation commences. An alternative hypothesis holds that cavitation temporarily relieves water stress and stomatal closure is insufficient to prevent short term “run-away” cavitation.
An Improved Light Dark Box Test by Using Areal-Time Video Tracking System,"In the behavioral science field, many of the oldest tests have still most frequently been used almost in the same way for decades. The subjective influence of human observer and the large inter-observer and inter-lab differences are substantial among these tests. This necessitates the possibility of using technological innovations for behavioral science to obtain new parameters, results and insights as well. The light-dark box (LDB) test is a characteristic tooi used to assess anxiety in rodents. A. complete behavioral analysis (including both anxiety and locomotion parameters) is not possible by performing traditional LDB test protocol, as it lacks the usage of a real-time video recording of the test. In the current report, we describe an improved approach to conduct LDB test using a real-time video tracking system."
"Inhibition of the Formation of Amyloid-Like Fibrils with Spices, Especially Cloves","During the study of inhibition of amyloid fibril formation, a-chymotrypsin protein was developed in 55% ethanol at pH 7.0. We investigated the inhibitory effect of different spices on amyloid fibril formation using turbidity measurements and Congo red binding assays. We found that all spices except the black pepper and caraway seed prevented fibril formation. The highest inhibition was measured with the clove, which reduced the amount of aggregates by 90%. We studied the inhibitory effect of the cloves at different concentrations on aggregation, it was found that the inhibitory activity of clove is dependent on concentration. We have measured the total phenolic content of the spice extracts too. Based on all these findings we have come to the following conclusion: Our results indicate that spices can contain other compounds too — not only phenolic compounds — which influence the formation of amyloid fibrils, and the effectiveness of various phenolic compounds are different."
"The effect of light, soil pH and stand heterogeneity on understory species composition of dry oak forests in the North Hungarian Mountains","Dry oak forests have one of the richest understory vegetation in Europe, but the environmental drivers of this community have been scarcely revealed. In this study, we assessed whether the amount of light, soil pH or stand heterogeneity affect primarily the species composition of this community. We investigaed 332 sampling plots in 40–165 year old managed and abandoned Quercus cerris and Q. petraea dominated forests in North Hungary. Presence-absence data of herbaceous species and seedlings of woody species were recorded in 28 subplots within each sampling plot. Stand structure, canopy openness and soil pH were also measured in each plot. The relationships between stand characteristics and the species assemblage were explored by redundancy analysis, while the individual responses of species and species groups were studied by generalized linear mixed models. Multivariate methods and individual species response analyses provided similar results, the amount of light and soil pH were equally important variables (both of them explained 2.8% of species variance), while stand heterogeneity had a bit lower, albeit still significant role in determining understory species composition (1.9% of species variance explained). Seedlings of woody species preferred shaded (half-shaded) conditions, while many herbaceous species were positively related to light. The effect of the three explanatory variables was hard to separate, since they influenced each other as well. Sessile oak seedlings and herbs typical of dry forests, forest edges, grasslands and acidic soil habitats preferred light rich habitats with homogeneous stand structure and low soil pH. Mesic forest herbs and seedlings of other woody species were related to relatively high soil pH, heterogeneous stand structure and closed canopy. These two understory types were clearly separated regarding composition. This study emphasizes the importance of heterogenous light conditions and mosaic, diverse forest structure (presence of homogeneous and heterogeneous forest patches) during forest management for the maintenance of understory biodiversity."
"Myxomycete communities occurring in fragmented forest patches in two municipalities of Laguna, Philippines","In spite of the increasing number of myxomycete studies in the tropical Southeast Asia over the last decades, many forest patches are still left unexplored for the region, in particular in the Philippine archipelago. Thus, an assessment of myxomycete diversity, occurrence, and composition was carried out in forest fragments from two municipalities of the province of Laguna, Philippines. From the 12 established 5 m × 5 m plots, a total of 240 moist chamber cultures were prepared for this study and yielded 42 myxomycete species belonging to 14 genera. Rarefaction curves and several heterogeneity indices revealed higher species diversity in Los Baños than in Calauan. Moreover, the taxonomic diversity index also showed that the taxonomic diversity of myxomycete in Los Baños is more intuitively diverse than in Calauan. In terms of community analysis between the two municipalities, it showed that myxomycete communities clustered between different microhabitats. High values of coefficient of community and percentage similarity indices possibly implicates that spore dispersal in forest fragments in closer proximities may cause high number of shared species (60%). With an addition of Cribraria lepida as a new record for the country, this study now updates the myxomycete profile for Laguna, Philippines."
Bias in estimates of the classic and incidence-based Jaccard similarity indices: insights from assemblage simulation,"Similarity indices are often used for measuring b-diversity and as the starting point of multivariate analysis. In this study, I used simulation to examine the direction and amount of bias in estimates of two similarity indices, Jaccard Coefficient (J) and incidence-based J (J). I design a novel simulation to generate three sets of assemblages that vary in species richness, species-occurrence distributions, and b-diversity. I characterized assemblage differences with the ratio of [proportion of rare species in all shared species / proportion of rare species in all unshared species] (i.e., PRss/PRus) and the Pearson’s correlation in the probabilities of shared species between two assemblages (i.e., share-species correlation). I found that J was subject to strong positive or negative bias, depending on PRss/PRus. J was mainly subject to negative bias, which varied with share-species correlation. In both indices, bias varied substantially from one pair of assemblages to another and among datasets. The high variation in the bias across different comparisons of assemblages may compromise b-diversity estimation established at low sampling efforts based on the two indices or their variants."
The pygmy field mouse — what does influence food quality?,"The dominant rodent species in Central European agricultural landscapes are granivorous mouse species and herbivorous common voles. Although our knowledge of European wood mice is relatively good, there is a distinct lack of information on pygmy field mice inhabiting Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In this study, we examine the food quality of pygmy field mice in relation to environmental and population factors, and compare the food quality of related mouse species and common voles living in the same study plots. The dietary quality of the pygmy field mouse is similar to that of other mouse species; however, the food quality of pygmy field mice and common voles differed substantially, with mice having lower and more variable nitrogen content. For both rodent species, factors such as body size, age and sex had no influence on diet quality. Pygmy field mouse diet was mainly dependent on season, while total abundance had greatest influence on common vole diet."
Neighbourhood crowding severely limits seed offspring recruitment in a temperate mesic old-field meadow,"Testing the full impact of neighbourhood crowding within natural vegetation requires more than just effects incurred by established plants. It must also include measurements that take into account suppressive effects on the earliest plant life stages of resident individuals — seeds, their germination (emergence of radicles and cotyledons), and very young rooted seedlings. In this study, we explored the potential for these effects in a field experiment spanning three years, using a novel design for controlling granivory and small mammal herbivory. This allowed us to assess the limitations of natural crowding on seed recruitment success for non-resident species introduced into both natural and denuded neighbourhood plots within a temperate mesic old field meadow in eastern Ontario, Canada. Our results show that crowding by standing vegetation of resident species caused an overall reduction of seed recruitment success by more than 90%. These data provide strong inference that suppression resulting directly from near neighbour effects are likely to impose routinely intense natural selection within temperate mesic old field habitats like our study site. The consequences of this selection, in terms of traits promoting plant fitness under competition, are traditionally interpreted in terms of superior resource depletion/uptake, typically associated with greater growth accumulation and larger potential body size. We suggest, however, that these consequences are rare. Individuals of any species approach maximum potential body size only when near neighbour effects are relatively weak — not within crowded neighbourhoods. Recent studies suggest that severe neighbourhood crowding (where virtually all resident plants are forced to remain relatively small) selects instead for ‘reproductive economy’ — i.e., capacity to produce at least a few (or even at least one) offspring despite severe body size suppression, involving a relatively small minimum reproductive threshold size. Potential for additional component traits of reproductive economy are also suggested for investigation in future research."
Status of the Ibera Seedeater Sporophila iberaensis,"Paraguayan records of the recently described Ibera Seedeater Sporophila iberaensis are compiled and reviewed. Observations of birds identifiable to this species in Paraguay date from at least 1998, with the first photographic documentation in December 2004. The species has now been recorded at a minimum of 11 localities in the departments of Cordillera, Itapúa, Misiones, San Pedro and Presidente Hayes. The first two records of the species from Brazil (both from Mato Grosso do Sul) are also listed. Most Paraguayan records are of singing males, and breeding has been documented (a pair feeding fledglings) at one locality in Cordillera department, significantly expanding the known breeding range of the species. At least three localities appear to hold small populations (observations of multiple territorial males and/or pairs). In Paraguay, as in Argentina, the species appears to prefer wet tall grasslands bordering wetland areas. Its preference for tall grasslands makes the species particularly susceptible to habitat loss and degradation through overgrazing, frequent burning, and conversion to agriculture. These threats are all present at the principal localities for the species in the country. A reassessment of the species global conservation status taking into consideration the Paraguayan range and population suggests that it may best be treated as “Vulnerable”."
Aspirin Ameliorates Preeclampsia Induced by a Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Antagonist,"Reduced expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) in the placenta was found in women with severe preeclampsia. Aspirin is currently used as the only recommended intervention in pregnancies for prevention of preeclampsia. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether aspirin could attenuate PPARγ inhibitor (T0070907)-induced preeclampsia and its impact on expression of PPARγ. Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were used and treated with different doses of aspirin (0, 1, and 1.5 mg/kg) in presence or absence of PPARγ antagonist, T0070907. We found that mean arterial blood pressure was significantly reduced by aspirin treatment in T0070907-exposed rats. T0070907 exposure also led to significant decrease in fetal weight and increase in placental weights. However, 1.5 mg/kg of aspirin reversed these effects of T0070907. Additionally, aspirin also reversed T0070907-induced changes in the levels of thromboxane B2, vascular endothelial growth factor, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase, and matrix metalloproteinase 2 in both maternal blood and placental tissue. The increased messenger RNA and protein levels of Cox1 and Cox2 induced by T0070907 were markedly reduced by aspirin treatment. Importantly, T0070907 repressed both transcriptional and translational levels of PPARγ, which were reversed by aspirin. In conclusion, this study suggests that aspirin prevented the occur-rence of preeclampsia, which is possibly through enhancing both transcriptional and translational levels of PPARγ."
The Role and Molecular Mechanism of Long Nocoding RNA-MEG3 in the Pathogenesis of Preeclampsia,"A growing body of evidence suggests that the dysregulation of long noncoding RNA is increasingly linked to many human diseases. Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is one such gene thought to be affected. In the placenta of patients with preeclampsia, there is reduced expression of MEG3; however, its role and the mechanism involved are not clear. Therefore, we examined the expression of MEG3, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (E-cadherin and N-cadherin), and TGF-β/smad signaling pathway genes (TGF-β1, smad3, and smad7) in the placental tissues of 20 patients with preeclampsia and 20 healthy patients. We further observed the impact of MEG3 on the invasion and migration functions of human trophoblast cells and the effects on EMT and TGF-β/smad signaling pathways in an Human trophoblast cell-8 (HTR-8)Vneo cell line. The expression of MEG3 was lower in tissues from patients with preeclampsia having an EMT decline, as well as a messenger RNA expression of smad7. The expression of TGF-β1 and smad3 were higher in patients with preeclampsia. In HTR-8/SVneo cells with overexpressed MEG3, the invasion and migration functions were enhanced and accompanied by higher EMT and a significantly increased expression of smad7. Our data indicate that MEG3 is closely associated with the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and thus associated with changes in the EMT of placental trophoblast cells. These results indicate that MEG3 regulation of trophoblast cell EMT via the TGF-β pathway inhibitor smad7 may be the molecular mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia."
Elevated CD14++CD16+ Monocytes in Hyperhomocysteinemia-Associated Insulin Resistance in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,"Background: Hyperhomocysteinemia, chronic low-grade inflammation, and insulin resistance are predominant features in women with polycystic ovary Syndrome (PCOS). CD14++CD16+ inflammatory monocytes are elevated in cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, in which inflammation is one of the pathogenesis. We aimed to determine whether homocysteine levels are associated with monocyte Subtypes or insulin resistance in women with PCOS. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between December 2014 and June 2015 at Peking University Third Hospital. Among 196 Chinese patients with PCOS enrolled, 102 had homocysteine levels ≥10 μmol/L and 94 exhibited normal homocysteine levels. Monocyte surface markers and related cytokines were detected in peripheral blood samples using a flow cytometry, and data on insulin resistance and homocysteine levels were collected. Results: Our results showed thatfasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment indices that reflectthe severity of insulin resistance were increased in the hyperhomocysteinemia PCOS group. Simple linear regression analysis revealed that homocysteine level is one of the influence factors of insulin resistance in PCOS. Compared with the normal homocysteine group, patients with hyperhomocysteinemia had increased numbers of CD14++CD16+ inflammatory monocyte in their peripheral blood and elevated plasma levels of interleukin-l ß and interleukin-6, 2 typical cytokines secreted by the inflammatory monocytes. Unlike CD 14+CD16++ nonclassical monocytes, CD 14++CD16+ inflammatory monocytes are characterized by high expression of Human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related (HLA-DR). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that CD14++CD16+ inflammatory monocytes are associated with hyperhomocysteinemia and insulin resistance in patients with PCOS. Notably, CD14++CD16+ monocytes may contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in women with PCOS."
Hysteroscopic Corrections for Complete Septate and T-Shaped Uteri Have Similar Surgical and Reproductive Outcome,"Aim: To compare the surgical results and reproductive Performances of patients with ESHRE/ESGE (European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology/European Society for Gynaecologic Endoscopy) class U1a and U2b uterine anomalies after hysteroscopic correction. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a university hospital infertility clinic. Ninety-six patients with class U2b (complete septate Uterus) and 78 patients with class U1a (T-shaped Uterus) uterine anomalies who underwent hysteroscopic correction between January 2009 and December 2015 were recruited. Results: The Operation time was significantly longer in class U2b anomalies (26.5 ± 5.3 minutes) than class U1a anomalies (22.8 ± 5.8 minutes; mean difference [95% confidence interval [Cl]: 3.6 ± 0.9 [1.8–5.3]; P < .001). Six out of all complete septate patients and 3 of T-shaped patients were reoperated due to postoperative synechia or to further enlarge the cavity. There were no differences between the groups regarding intraoperative (blood loss and uterine rupture) and postoperative (bleeding and infection) complications. After surgical correction, the term delivery rates increased from 3% to 71 % (P < .001) in class U2b and from 4% to 62.1 % (P < .001) in class U1a. The chance of live birth significantly increased after hysteroscopic correction both in class U2b (odds ratio [OR] 106.1; 95% Cl, 29.1–387.1; P < .001) and class U1a (OR 35.7; 95% Cl, 11.6–109.9; P < .001). The postoperative reproductive Performances of both anomalies were similar. Conclusion: Both types of anomalies seem to have similar severity and prognosis. Patients with both types of anomalies have excellent reproductive outcome after hysteroscopic correction."
Growing pigs developed different types of diabetes induced by streptozotocin depending on their transcription factor 7-like 2 gene polymorphisms,"The different polymorphisms of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene promote variances in diabetes susceptibility in humans. We investigated whether these genotypes also promote differences in diabetic susceptibility in commercial pigs. Growing pigs (Landrace, both sex, 50–60 kg) with the C/C (n=4) and T/T (n=5) TCF7L2 genotypes were identified and intravenously injected with streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/kg) twice in weekly intervals, then a high-energy diet was offered. Oral glucose tolerance tests, blood analyses and the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index calculations were performed. The animals were sacrificed at the end of 12 weeks of treatment to reveal the pancreas histomorphometry. The results showed that all of the treated pigs grew normally despite exhibiting hyperglycemia at two weeks after the induction. The glycemic level of the fasting or postprandial pigs gradually returned to normal. The fasting insulin concentration was significantly decreased for the T/T carriers but not for the C/C carriers, and the resulting HOMA-IR index was significantly increased for the C/C genotype, indicating that the models of insulin dependence and resistance were respectively developed by T/T and C/C carriers. The histopathological results illustrated a significant reduction in the pancreas mass and insulin active sites, which suggested increased damage. The results obtained here could not be compared with previous studies because the TCF7L2 background has not been reported. Growing pigs may be an excellent model for diabetic in children if the animals are genetically pre-selected."
Regulation of gastrointestinal hormones during laxative activity of gallotannin-enriched extract isolated from Galla Rhois in loperamide-induced constipation of SD rats,"Regulation of gastrointestinal hormones have been reported in animal models for constipation undergoing laxative therapy when administered herbal products. We undertook to investigate whether the laxative activity of gallotannin-enriched extracts isolated from Galla Rhois (GEGR) affects the regulation of gastrointestinal hormones, by examining the concentration of four hormones and the activation of their receptors in the loperamide (Lop)-induced constipation model. Stool parameters, including number, weight and water content, were significantly recovered in the Lop+GEGR treated group, relative to the Lop+ vehicle treated group; however, food intake and water consumption were maintained at a constant level. Also, a similar recovery was detected for thickness of mucosa, muscle and flat luminal surface in the Lop+GEGR treated group. Furthermore, concentration of the four gastrointestinal hormones evaluated, namely, cholecystokinin (CCK), gastrin (GAS), somatostatin (SS) and motilin (MTL), were lower in the Lop+vehicle treated group than the No treated group, but were remarkably enhanced in the Lop+GEGR treated group. Moreover, the downstream signaling pathway of MTL and SS receptors were recovered after GEGR administration. Results of the present study therefore indicate that the laxative effects of GEGR treatment may be tightly related with the regulation of gastrointestinal hormones in the Lop-induced constipation model."

Evidence of Large-Scale Social Interactions in Mammography in the United States,"This paper examines the extent of social interactions in an individual’s decision to undergo mammography. Using Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System surveys from 1993 to 2016, the effect of other female screening behavior on an individual’s decision to have a routine breast cancer screening was measured by calculating the size of a so called “social multiplier” in mammography. A vector of social multipliers was estimated in the use of mammograms in the past 1–2 years by taking the ratio of group-level effects of exogenous explanatory variables to individual-level effects of the same variables. Peer groups were defined as same-aged women living in the same state. Three age groups of women were considered: 40–49, 50–74, and 75 and older. Several econometric approaches were used to analyze the effect of social interactions on mammography use, including ordinary least squares, fixed effects, and split-sample instrumental variable. For all women, evidence was found of social interactions associated with individual’s education, employment, and poor health. In addition, number of age-group-specific social multipliers was found. The strongest evidence of spillover in mammography was found for women ages 75 and older. Policy makers should be aware that, in the presence of a social multiplier, the value of any type of screening intervention is higher than the one that would be measured at the individual-level."
Status of the Ibera Seedeater Sporophila iberaensis,"Paraguayan records of the recently described Ibera Seedeater Sporophila iberaensis are compiled and reviewed. Observations of birds identifiable to this species in Paraguay date from at least 1998, with the first photographic documentation in December 2004. The species has now been recorded at a minimum of 11 localities in the departments of Cordillera, Itapúa, Misiones, San Pedro and Presidente Hayes. The first two records of the species from Brazil (both from Mato Grosso do Sul) are also listed. Most Paraguayan records are of singing males, and breeding has been documented (a pair feeding fledglings) at one locality in Cordillera department, significantly expanding the known breeding range of the species. At least three localities appear to hold small populations (observations of multiple territorial males and/or pairs). In Paraguay, as in Argentina, the species appears to prefer wet tall grasslands bordering wetland areas. Its preference for tall grasslands makes the species particularly susceptible to habitat loss and degradation through overgrazing, frequent burning, and conversion to agriculture. These threats are all present at the principal localities for the species in the country. A reassessment of the species global conservation status taking into consideration the Paraguayan range and population suggests that it may best be treated as “Vulnerable”."
Optimal Deterministic Mechanism Design: Type-Independent Preference Orderings,"We investigate revenue maximisation in general allocation problems with incomplete information, where we assume quasi-linearity, private values, independent type distributions and single-dimensionality of type spaces. We require a mechanism to be deterministic, strategy-proof and ex-post individually rational. We assume that each player has a type-independent preference ordering over deterministic allocations. We show that the Myerson’s technique to solve the incentive-constrained revenue maximisation problem in single-unit auctions can be applied to general allocation problems, where the incentive-constrained revenue maximisation problem can be reduced to the simple maximisation problem of the sum of players’ virtual valuations without imposing any incentive constraint."
Acute Drug Effects on the Human Placental Tissue: The Development of a Placental Murine Xenograft Model,"Objective: A pilot study was conducted to establish a human placental xenograft, which could serve as a model to evaluate the effect of toxic exposures during pregnancy. Study Design: The protocol consisted of engraftment of third-trimester human placental tissue in immunocompromised mice, after induction of a pseudo-pregnancy State by ovariectomy and progesterone supplementation. To validate the model, the placental tissue before and after engraftment was examined by immunohistochemistry, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, and whole transcriptome sequencing (WTSS). The human chorion gonadotropin (hCG) production in serum and urine was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Microscopic evaluation of the placental tissue before and after engraftment revealed a stable morphology and preserved histological structure of the human tissue. Viable trophoblast was present after engraftment and remained stable over time. Vascularization and hormonal secretion (hCG) were present till 3 weeks after engraftment. Thirty-one SNPs were equally present, and there was a stable expression level for 56 451 genes evaluated by whole transcriptome sequencing. Conclusion: Although this human placental xenograft model cannot copy the unique uterine environment in which the placenta develops and interacts between the mother and the fetus, it could be a suitable tool to evaluate the acute impact and adaptive processes of the placental tissue to environmental changes."
Aspirin Ameliorates Preeclampsia Induced by a Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Antagonist,"Reduced expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) in the placenta was found in women with severe preeclampsia. Aspirin is currently used as the only recommended intervention in pregnancies for prevention of preeclampsia. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether aspirin could attenuate PPARγ inhibitor (T0070907)-induced preeclampsia and its impact on expression of PPARγ. Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were used and treated with different doses of aspirin (0, 1, and 1.5 mg/kg) in presence or absence of PPARγ antagonist, T0070907. We found that mean arterial blood pressure was significantly reduced by aspirin treatment in T0070907-exposed rats. T0070907 exposure also led to significant decrease in fetal weight and increase in placental weights. However, 1.5 mg/kg of aspirin reversed these effects of T0070907. Additionally, aspirin also reversed T0070907-induced changes in the levels of thromboxane B2, vascular endothelial growth factor, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase, and matrix metalloproteinase 2 in both maternal blood and placental tissue. The increased messenger RNA and protein levels of Cox1 and Cox2 induced by T0070907 were markedly reduced by aspirin treatment. Importantly, T0070907 repressed both transcriptional and translational levels of PPARγ, which were reversed by aspirin. In conclusion, this study suggests that aspirin prevented the occur-rence of preeclampsia, which is possibly through enhancing both transcriptional and translational levels of PPARγ."
The Role and Molecular Mechanism of Long Nocoding RNA-MEG3 in the Pathogenesis of Preeclampsia,"A growing body of evidence suggests that the dysregulation of long noncoding RNA is increasingly linked to many human diseases. Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is one such gene thought to be affected. In the placenta of patients with preeclampsia, there is reduced expression of MEG3; however, its role and the mechanism involved are not clear. Therefore, we examined the expression of MEG3, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (E-cadherin and N-cadherin), and TGF-β/smad signaling pathway genes (TGF-β1, smad3, and smad7) in the placental tissues of 20 patients with preeclampsia and 20 healthy patients. We further observed the impact of MEG3 on the invasion and migration functions of human trophoblast cells and the effects on EMT and TGF-β/smad signaling pathways in an Human trophoblast cell-8 (HTR-8)Vneo cell line. The expression of MEG3 was lower in tissues from patients with preeclampsia having an EMT decline, as well as a messenger RNA expression of smad7. The expression of TGF-β1 and smad3 were higher in patients with preeclampsia. In HTR-8/SVneo cells with overexpressed MEG3, the invasion and migration functions were enhanced and accompanied by higher EMT and a significantly increased expression of smad7. Our data indicate that MEG3 is closely associated with the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and thus associated with changes in the EMT of placental trophoblast cells. These results indicate that MEG3 regulation of trophoblast cell EMT via the TGF-β pathway inhibitor smad7 may be the molecular mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia."
Elevated CD14++CD16+ Monocytes in Hyperhomocysteinemia-Associated Insulin Resistance in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,"Background: Hyperhomocysteinemia, chronic low-grade inflammation, and insulin resistance are predominant features in women with polycystic ovary Syndrome (PCOS). CD14++CD16+ inflammatory monocytes are elevated in cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, in which inflammation is one of the pathogenesis. We aimed to determine whether homocysteine levels are associated with monocyte Subtypes or insulin resistance in women with PCOS. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between December 2014 and June 2015 at Peking University Third Hospital. Among 196 Chinese patients with PCOS enrolled, 102 had homocysteine levels ≥10 μmol/L and 94 exhibited normal homocysteine levels. Monocyte surface markers and related cytokines were detected in peripheral blood samples using a flow cytometry, and data on insulin resistance and homocysteine levels were collected. Results: Our results showed thatfasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment indices that reflectthe severity of insulin resistance were increased in the hyperhomocysteinemia PCOS group. Simple linear regression analysis revealed that homocysteine level is one of the influence factors of insulin resistance in PCOS. Compared with the normal homocysteine group, patients with hyperhomocysteinemia had increased numbers of CD14++CD16+ inflammatory monocyte in their peripheral blood and elevated plasma levels of interleukin-l ß and interleukin-6, 2 typical cytokines secreted by the inflammatory monocytes. Unlike CD 14+CD16++ nonclassical monocytes, CD 14++CD16+ inflammatory monocytes are characterized by high expression of Human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related (HLA-DR). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that CD14++CD16+ inflammatory monocytes are associated with hyperhomocysteinemia and insulin resistance in patients with PCOS. Notably, CD14++CD16+ monocytes may contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in women with PCOS."
Hysteroscopic Corrections for Complete Septate and T-Shaped Uteri Have Similar Surgical and Reproductive Outcome,"Aim: To compare the surgical results and reproductive Performances of patients with ESHRE/ESGE (European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology/European Society for Gynaecologic Endoscopy) class U1a and U2b uterine anomalies after hysteroscopic correction. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a university hospital infertility clinic. Ninety-six patients with class U2b (complete septate Uterus) and 78 patients with class U1a (T-shaped Uterus) uterine anomalies who underwent hysteroscopic correction between January 2009 and December 2015 were recruited. Results: The Operation time was significantly longer in class U2b anomalies (26.5 ± 5.3 minutes) than class U1a anomalies (22.8 ± 5.8 minutes; mean difference [95% confidence interval [Cl]: 3.6 ± 0.9 [1.8–5.3]; P < .001). Six out of all complete septate patients and 3 of T-shaped patients were reoperated due to postoperative synechia or to further enlarge the cavity. There were no differences between the groups regarding intraoperative (blood loss and uterine rupture) and postoperative (bleeding and infection) complications. After surgical correction, the term delivery rates increased from 3% to 71 % (P < .001) in class U2b and from 4% to 62.1 % (P < .001) in class U1a. The chance of live birth significantly increased after hysteroscopic correction both in class U2b (odds ratio [OR] 106.1; 95% Cl, 29.1–387.1; P < .001) and class U1a (OR 35.7; 95% Cl, 11.6–109.9; P < .001). The postoperative reproductive Performances of both anomalies were similar. Conclusion: Both types of anomalies seem to have similar severity and prognosis. Patients with both types of anomalies have excellent reproductive outcome after hysteroscopic correction."
Repeat stent implementation for recanalization of the proximal right coronary artery: a case report,"A stent in a false lumen is a common cause of stent occlusion after coronary percutaneous coronary artery intervention therapy, particularly in the culprit lesion of acute myocardial infarction. Here, we present an unusual case of successful recanalization of the proximal right coronary artery with implementation of another stent to crush the previous stent in the false lumen."
Basic and Applied Research: A Welfare Analysis,"This study constructs a variety expansion growth model that integrates basic research to analyse its effects on household welfare. In our model, the research sector consists of applied and basic research components. The former creates blueprints and expands the variety of goods available for consumption, whereas the latter adds to the public-knowledge stock. The analysis yields several results. First, the steady-state welfare-maximizing level of basic research is below the steady-state growth-maximizing level. Second, a consideration of the welfare effects during the transition path suggests that marginal changes in the level of basic research can increase household welfare even at its steady-state welfare-maximizing level. Third, by using data from Japan, we calibrate the model and find that an increase in basic research spending raises household welfare."
Effect of Bank Mergers on Client Firms: Evidence from the Credit Supply Channel,"This study investigates the effects of bank mergers on client firms. A rich panel of data detailing firm borrowing from individual banks enables controls for demand-side effects to isolate the effect of bank mergers on the supply of credit. The impact of bank mergers on other firm outcomes (growth in total borrowing, distance to default and investment) is also examined. A merger announcement by a firm’s main bank results in a contraction in credit supply from the merging bank. Firms are not able to compensate for the reduced credit supply from the main bank, so overall borrowing also declines."
"Child Benefit, Tax Allowances and Behavioural Responses: The Case of Japanese Reform, 2010–2011","The reform of Japan’s child benefit system in 2010 was followed by the abolition of the tax allowance for dependents in 2011. The present study uses micro-level data from the Employment Status Survey and an estimation of a discrete-choice model of labour supply to examine the effects of these reforms on the labour supply, after-tax incomes and the utility of households. The results show that the reforms decreased the labour supply of parents and that the funds necessary to implement them were underestimated by 22% when this behavioural change was disregarded."
Estimating Compensation of Employees Based on Taxation Data,"In this paper, we develop a novel approach to estimate the compensation of employees as a portion of Japan’s gross domestic income. The methodology is characterized by its extensive use of comprehensive taxation data, and all data used is publicly available. Our estimates turn out to be larger than the numbers in the official statistics, and the difference has been widening in recent years. In addition, the discrepancy of the two estimates for net lending/borrowing between non-financial and financial transactions accounts (in theory, they should be the same) shrinks when the former is recalculated based on our estimates, both for households and for corporations."
"Kleptoparasitism and territoriality in the Snail Kite Rostrhamus sociabilis (Accipitriformes: Accipitridae) in the Complejo Güija, El Salvador","We present the observations of some kleptoparasitic and territorial interactions in the Snail Kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis), following focal individuals from January to May 2017 in two wetlands of El Salvador. Those interactions were performed during their food searching and managing of prey on perch. We observed two attempts of kleptoparasitism from Great-tailed Grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus) to R. sociabilis. On the first case, a flock of Q. mexicanus chased an adult Snail Kite, which had captured a snail; on the second case, a male of Q. mexicanus tried to steal a young Snail Kite’s prey, which was managing its prey on perch. On both cases in response to the attack, two individuals chose to change perch to complete the consumption of its prey. We also observed an intent of kleptoparasitism between two male Snail Kites, after the attack, on perch the chased bird released the snail and moved to another site, meanwhile, the attacker ended up eating the snail. We attribute this observation to a kleptoparasitic behavior, related to water stress and variations in prey availability. We recorded Snail Kite’s territorial behavior between the species and against other raptors, as a way to protect their feeding territories. With these observations, we provide some information about the ecological behavior of the species in El Salvador. We stress the need to carry out research related to the interaction between R. sociabilis and Q. mexicanus on its feeding sites, focusing in the effect of water scarcity and snail availability on the behavior of the Snail Kite."
"Behavior and seasonal abundance of Neotropic Cormorant Nannopterum brasilianus (Gmelin, 1789) in southeastern, Brazil","The Neotropic Cormorant Nannopterum brasilianus (Gmelin, 1789) is one of the most common and abundant species in Brazil’s aquatic environments, but little is known about its natural history. This study elaborates and quantitatively evaluates the ethogram and seasonal abundance of this species at Lake Açu, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Between August 2013 and July 2014, behaviors were registered by the ad libitum sampling method and quantified by the continuous recording during 30-min sessions. The mean number of sighted individuals per month was 30.41 ± 4.79. Abundance was higher during the dry season (41.5 ± 5.36) compared to the rainy season (19.33 ± 4.81) (t = 3.07, P = 0.01). A total of 42 behaviors were described and grouped into five behavioral categories: maintenance (83.59%), ingestion/excretion (10.67%), locomotion (3.48%), play (1.65%), and agonistic behavior (0.61%). The time spent in these categories did not vary significantly between the morning and afternoon periods. This study can be used as a starting point for further ethological studies on the species."
Dose dependence and durability of the therapeutic effects of Asparagus cochinchinensis fermented extract in an ovalbumin-challenged asthma model,"The butanol extract of Asparagus cochinchinensis roots fermented with Weissella cibaria (BAfW) significantly suppressed the inflammatory response induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment in RAW264.7 cells. To investigate the dose dependence and durability of BAfW on the anti-asthma effects, alterations in key parameters were measured in ovalbumin (OVA)-challenged Balb/c mice treated with the different doses of BAfW at three different time points. The number of immune cells, OVA-specific IgE level, thickness of respiratory epithelium and mucus score decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner in response to treatment with 125 to 500 mg/kg BAfW (P<0.05), although the highest level was detected in the 500 mg/kg treated group. Moreover, the decrease in these parameters was maintained from 24 to 48 h in the 500 mg/kg of BAfW treated group. At 72 h, the effects of BAfW on the number of immune cells, OVA-specific IgE level and thickness of respiratory epithelium partially disappeared. Overall, this study provides the first evidence that the anti-asthma effect of BAfW may reach the maximum level in OVA-challenged Balb/c mice treated with 500 mg/kg and that these effects can last for 48 h."
Ensuring reproducibility and ethics in animal experiments reporting in Korea using the ARRIVE guideline,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the reporting quality of animal experiments in Korea using the Animals in Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guideline developed in 2010 to overcome the reproducibility problem and to encourage compliance with replacement, refinement and reduction of animals in research (3R’s principle). We reviewed 50 papers published by a Korean research group from 2013 to 2016 and scored the conformity with the 20-items ARRIVE guideline. The median conformity score was 39.50%. For more precise evaluation, the 20 items were subdivided into 57 sub-items. Among the sub-items, status of experimental animals, housing and husbandry were described under the average level. Microenvironment sub-items, such as enrichment, bedding material, cage type, number of companions, scored under 10%. Although statistical methods used for the studies were given in most publications (84%), sample size calculation and statistical assumption were rarely described. Most publications mentioned the IACUC approval, but only 8% mentioned welfare-related assessments and interventions, and only 4% mentioned any implications of experimental methods or findings for 3R. We may recommend the revision of the present IACUC proposal to collect more detailed information and improving educational program for animal researchers according to the ARRIVE guideline."
Effects of dietary lipid-coated zinc on the antioxidant defense system in the small intestine and liver of piglets,"The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of lipid-coated ZnO (LCZ) and the level of LCZ compared with ordinary zinc oxide (ZnO) on antioxidant defense system in the intestine and liver of piglets. A total of forty piglets (n=8) were fed a diet supplemented with 100 ppm Zn with ZnO (ZnO-1), 2,500 ppm Zn with ZnO (ZnO-2), 100 ppm Zn as LCZ (LCZ-1), 200 ppm Zn as LCZ (LCZ-2), or 400 ppm Zn as LCZ (LCZ-3) for 14-d, respectively. The LCZ-3 group resulted in higher (P<0.05) mRNA expressions and activities of CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in jejunal mucosa compared with the ZnO-1 and LCZ-1 groups, while no difference was observed in the mRNA level of antioxidant genes between the ZnO-1 and ZnO-2 groups. Within the LCZ groups, the LCZ level linearly and quadratically (P<0.01) increased antioxidant enzymes in the jejunum. The maximum response of jejunal antioxidant enzymes to Zn supplementation was achieved by 400 ppm of LCZ. Hepatic mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes was unaffected by Zn source and level, while hepatic SOD and GST activities were greater (P<0.05) in the LCZ-3 group than in the ZnO-1 group. No difference was observed in lipid peroxidation of the jejunum and liver and the total antioxidant power of plasma among groups. In conclusion, a supplementation with 400 ppm of LCZ resulted in a maximum increase in antioxidant enzymes, indicating that LCZ may affect antioxidant defense system more profoundly than ZnO."
Anti-Helicobacter pylori activity and inhibition of gastritis by Allium hookeri extract,"Allium hookeri is widely consumed plant as a vegetable and herbal medicine in southeastern Asia. Allium hookeri has been reported antioxidant, improvement of bone health and antidiabetic effects. In the present study, we investigated the potential inhibitory effect of Allium hookeri extract (AHE) on Helicobacter pylori. The in vitro anti-bacterial activities of AHE were determined by disk agar diffusion method. Also, the inhibition effect of the AHE on H. pylori infection was investigated using a mouse model. H. pylori colonization was confirmed by rapid urease tests, as described previously. Mucosal damage was evaluated grossly and histologically according to previously described criteria. As the results of the disk agar diffusion assay, CLR, AMX and MTZ inhibited the bacterial growth with inhibition zone of 19.2, 15.2 and 7.5 mm, respectively. AHE 100 ώg/mL showed an inhibition zone value of 20.6 mm. Rapid urease tests of the mice stomachs demonstrated a significant reduction in H. pylori colonization. In addition to the therapeutic effect against H. pylori infection, the AHE reduced mucosal inflammation and epithelial damages in the stomach of H. pylori-infected mice. These results demonstrate that the AHE successfully cured an H. pylori infection and treated the H. pylori infection. This AHE could be a promising treatment for patients with gastric complaints including gastritis caused by H. pylori."
Hyperglycemia aggravates decrease in alpha-synuclein expression in a middle cerebral artery occlusion model,"Hyperglycemia is one of the major risk factors for stroke. Hyperglycemia can lead to a more extensive infarct volume, aggravate neuronal damage after cerebral ischemia. α-Synuclein is especially abundant in neuronal tissue, where it underlies the etiopathology of several neurodegenerative diseases. This study investigated whether hyperglycemic conditions regulate the expression of α-synuclein in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced cerebral ischemic injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with streptozotocin (40 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection to induce hyperglycemic conditions. MCAO were performed four weeks after streptozotocin injection to induce focal cerebral ischemia, and cerebral cortex tissues were obtained 24 hours after MCAO. We confirmed that MCAO induced neurological functional deficits and cerebral infarction, and these changes were more extensive in diabetic animals compared to non-diabetic animals. Moreover, we identified a decrease in α-synuclein after MCAO injury. Diabetic animals showed a more serious decrease in α-synuclein than non-diabetic animals. Western blot and reverse-transcription PCR analyses confirmed more extensive decreases in α-synuclein expression in MCAO-injured animals with diabetic condition than these of non-diabetic animals. It is accepted that α- synuclein modulates neuronal cell death and exerts a neuroprotective effect. Thus, the results of this study suggest that hyperglycemic conditions cause more serious brain damage in ischemic brain injuries by decreasing α-synuclein expression."
Disruption of the Tff1 gene in mice using CRISPR/Cas9 promotes body weight reduction and gastric tumorigenesis,"Trefoil factor 1 (TFF1, also known as pS2) is strongly expressed in the gastrointestinal mucosa and plays a critical role in the differentiation of gastric glands. Since approximately 50% of all human gastric cancers are associated with decreased TFF1 expression, it is considered a tumor suppressor gene. Tff1 deficiency in mice results in histological changes in the antral and pyloric gastric mucosa, with severe hyperplasia and dysplasia of epithelial cells, resulting in the development of antropyloric adenoma. Here, we generated Tff1-knockout (KO) mice, without a neomycin resistant (NeoR) cassette, using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (CRSIPR/Cas9) system. Though our Tff1-KO mice showed phenotypes very similar to the previous embryonic stem (ES)-cell-based KO mice, they differed from the previous reports in that a reduction in body weight was observed in males. These results demonstrate that these newly established Tff1-KO mice are useful tools for investigating genetic and environmental factors influencing gastric cancer, without the effects of artificial gene insertion. Furthermore, these findings suggest a novel hypothesis that Tff1 expression influences gender differences."
"Bacopa monnieri extract improves novel object recognition, cell proliferation, neuroblast differentiation, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein in the dentate gyrus","Bacopa monnieri is a medicinal plant with a long history of use in Ayurveda, especially in the treatment of poor memory and cognitive deficits. In the present study, we hypothesized that Bacopa monnieri extract (BME) can improve memory via increased cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus. BME was administered to 7-week-old mice once a day for 4 weeks and a novel object recognition memory test was performed. Thereafter, the mice were euthanized followed by immuno-histochemistry analysis for Ki67, doublecortin (DCX), and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and western blot analysis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BME-treated mice showed moderate increases in the exploration of new objects when compared with that of familiar objects, leading to a significant higher discrimination index compared with vehicle-treated mice. Ki67 and DCX immunohistochemistry showed a facilitation of cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation following the administration of BME in the dentate gyrus. In addition, administration of BME significantly elevated the BDNF protein expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, and increased CREB phosphorylation in the dentate gyrus. These data suggest that BME improves novel object recognition by increasing the cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus, and this may be closely related to elevated levels of BDNF and CREB phosphorylation in the dentate gyrus."
Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 is dispensable for host immune responses against pulmonary infection of Acinetobacter baumannii in mice,"Nucleotide-binding domain 1 (Nod1) is a cytosolic receptor that is responsible for the recognition of a bacterial peptidoglycan motif containing meso-diaminophimelic acid. In this study, we sought to identify the role of Nod1 in host defense in vivo against pulmonary infection by multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Wildtype (WT) and Nod1-deficient mice were intranasally infected with 3x107 CFU of A. baumannii and sacrificed at 1 and 3 days post-infection (dpi). Bacterial CFUs, cytokines production, histopathology, and mouse β-defensins (mBD) in the lungs of infected mice were evaluated. The production of cytokines in response to A. baumannii was also measured in WT and Nod1-deficient macrophages. The bacterial clearance in the lungs was not affected by Nod1 deficiency. Levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β in the lung homogenates were comparable at days 1 and 3 between WT and Nod1-deficient mice, except the TNF-α level at day 3, which was higher in Nod1-deficient mice. There was no significant difference in lung pathology and expression of mBDs (mBD1, 2, 3, and 4) between WT and Nod1-deficient mice infected with A. baumannii. The production of IL-6, TNF-α, and NO by macrophages in response to A baumannii was also comparable in WT and Nod1-deficient mice. Our results indicated that Nod1 does not play an important role in host immune responses against A. baumannii infection."
Generation of knockout mouse models of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors by engineered nuclease-mediated genome editing,"Cell cycle dysfunction can cause severe diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and cancer. Mutations in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors controlling the G1 phase of the cell cycle are prevalent in various cancers. Mice lacking the tumor suppressors p16Ink4a (Cdkn2a, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a), p19Arf (an alternative reading frame product of Cdkn2a,), and p27Kip1 (Cdkn1b, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1b) result in malignant progression of epithelial cancers, sarcomas, and melanomas, respectively. Here, we generated knockout mouse models for each of these three cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors using engineered nucleases. The p16Ink4a and p19Arf knockout mice were generated via transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and p27Kip1 knockout mice via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (CRISPR/Cas9). These gene editing technologies were targeted to the first exon of each gene, to induce frameshifts producing premature termination codons. Unlike preexisting embryonic stem cell-based knockout mice, our mouse models are free from selectable markers or other external gene insertions, permitting more precise study of cell cycle-related diseases without confounding influences of foreign DNA."
Comparison of scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment responses in three different ICR stocks,"Cognitive impairment responses are important research topics in the study of degenerative brain diseases as well as in understanding of human mental activities. To compare response to scopolamine (SPL)-induced cognitive impairment, we measured altered parameters for learning and memory ability, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, cholinergic dysfunction and neuronal cell damages, in Korl:ICR stock and two commercial breeder stocks (A:ICR and B:ICR) after relevant SPL exposure. In the water maze test, Korl:ICR showed no significant difference in SPL-induced learning and memory impairment compared to the two different ICRs, although escape latency was increased after SPL exposure. Although behavioral assessment using the manual avoidance test revealed reduced latency in all ICR mice after SPL treatment as compared to Vehicle, no differences were observed between the three ICR stocks. To determine cholinergic dysfunction induction by SPL exposure, activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) assessed in the three ICR stocks revealed no difference of acetylcholinesterase activity. Furthermore, low levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and high levels of inflammatory cytokines in SPL-treated group were maintained in all three ICR stocks, although some variations were observed between the SPLtreated groups. Neuronal cell damages induced by SPL showed similar response in all three ICR stocks, as assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, Nissl staining analysis and expression analyses of apoptosis-related proteins. Thus, the results of this study provide strong evidence that Korl:ICR is similar to the other two ICR. Stocks in response to learning and memory capacity."
The effect of near-infrared fluorescence conjugation on the anti-cancer potential of cetuximab,"This study investigated the anti-cancer potential of a near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) molecule conjugated with Cetuximab (Cetuximab-NIRF) in six-week-old female BALB/c athymic (nu+/nu+) nude mice. A431 cells were cultured and injected into the animals to induce solid tumors. Paclitaxel (30 mg/kg body weight (BW)), Cetuximab (1 mg/kg BW), and Cetuximab-NIRF (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg BW) were intraperitoneally injected twice a week into the A431 cell xenografts of the nude mice. Changes in BW, tumor volume and weight, fat and lean mass, and diameter of the peri-tumoral blood vessel were determined after two weeks. Tumor volumes and weights were significantly decreased in the Cetuximab-NIRF (1 mg/kg BW) group compared with the control group (P<0.001). Lean mass and total body water content were also conspicuously reduced in the Cetuximab-NIRF (1 mg/kg BW) group compared with the vehicle control group. Peri-tumoral blood vessel diameters were very thin in the Cetuximab-NIRF groups compared with those of the paclitaxel group. These results indicate that the conjugation of Cetuximab with NIRF does not affect the anti-cancer potential of Cetuximab and NIRF can be used for molecular imaging in cancer treatments."
Determinants of ant species spatial distribution in habitats from central Argentina,"A great challenge in ecology is to link patterns in nature with the factors that determine species coexistence and community structure. In general, these patterns have been associated with different environmental conditions and species traits. The coexistence of ant species could be affected by the availability of food and nesting resources, which depend on vegetation diversity and structural complexity. In this study, we attempt to reproduce, through null models, the properties of ant community structure in areas with different physiognomy of vegetation associated to different wildfire regimes. The null model construction considered ant traits such as occurrence frequency, body size, and nest type; and site characteristics such as vegetation height and extra-floral nectar availability, and their combinations. The null models were compared to observed species segregation and nestedness patterns. Ant species were more aggregated in space than expected by chance. Vegetation height and extra-floral nectar availability were included in the most successful models in predicting ant segregation and aggregation pattern. Furthermore, ants’ body size was enough to reproduce the nestedness of species distribution in sites. Our results suggest that under post-fire conditions, habitat complexity, resource availability and species traits such as body size may be the determinants of ant community structure."
Synanthropic-dominated biomass in an insular landbird assemblage,"The effect of anthropization on sedentary landbirds occurring in late summer on a small Mediterranean island (San Pietro, SW Sardinia) has been studied comparing abundance and biomass among different ecological guilds. The two specialized insular guilds (Mediterranean warblers and rocky cliff species) represent about half of the total individual abundance (47%) but only 16% in terms of biomass. Although almost all the surface of the island is covered by Mediterranean scrub (maquis), Mediterranean warblers were not as dominant as the guild of strictly synanthropic species. This latter guild was the most represented in frequency both for abundance and biomass. I hypothesize that (i) here the anthropization could be considered a locally relevant process disrupting the resource flow and lowering the trophic level and (ii) the dominance of synanthropic birds in terms of biomass could be a general phenomenon extended to a large set of Mediterranean islands. The three most abundant synanthropic species, linked to highly disturbed habitats, showed a larger body mass when compared to specialized species as Mediterranean warblers: when applying the Abundance/Biomass Comparison (ABC), an early cumulating biomass curve was observed, partially overlapping with abundance curve. This pattern did not match with the classic predictions for the ABC model (i.e., species with higher biomass are typical of undisturbed assemblage) and could be wrongly interpreted. Therefore, I suggest that the ABC assumptions are not universal but limited only to assemblages where high body mass species coincide to species of a higher trophic level."
Importance of thermophilous habitats for protection of wild bees (Apiformes),"Research on wild bees (Apiformes) was conducted in the Lower Oder Valley (NW Poland) at Natura 2000 sites near the border between Poland and Germany. The analysis involved 3 landscape types with xerothermic and sandy grasslands, differing in the proportion of woody vegetation. In total, we collected there 4158 specimens of Apiformes, representing 180 species. We have proved that mid-forest grasslands with a high proportion of thermophilous broad-leaved forests and xerothermic shrub communities are equally attractive to wild bees as open habitats (sandy grasslands, xerothermic grasslands/heaths). We observed varied responses of wild bee species with specific functional characteristics to increasing proportion of woody vegetation. The grasslands surrounded by forests were characterized by the highest number of cleptoparasitic species. In contrast, solitary and social bee species preferred forest-steppe habitats. However, in open habitats, solitary bees were the most abundant. Moreover, open habitats were distinguished by the highest number and abundance of rare species. Active protection of thermophilous grasslands is crucial for biodiversity conservation, also with respect to the natural resources of Apiformes. Preservation of biodiversity in threatened xerothermic and sandy grasslands should be one of the key objectives of nature conservation in European countries. Currently, more and more actions are undertaken to improve their condition and to restore those particularly valuable and threatened habitat types."
Response of vegetation to fire disturbance: short-term dynamics in two savanna physiognomies,"Fire is a constitutive ecological force in savanna ecosystems, but few studies have monitored its short-term effects on plant community dynamics. This study investigated changes in plant diversity in the South American savanna (Cerrado) after severe disturbance by fire. We monitored 30 permanent plots (10 m × 5 m) distributed in two Cerrado physiognomies (típico: more forested; ralo: grass-dominated), being 10 plots in the area disturbed by fire, and five in a preserved control area (undisturbed). From August 2010 to June 2011, we evaluated changes in species richness, abundance and composition of savanna vegetation. Monitoring started one week after the fire; disturbed plots were surveyed monthly, while control plots were surveyed every two months. We observed rapid reassembling in both physiognomies: plots affected by fire showed rapid increase in species richness and plant density during the first four months after the disturbance. Concerning species composition, disturbed plots in the cerrado típico tended to converge to control plots after one year, but each local assemblage followed particular temporal trajectories. A different pattern characterized cerrado ralo plots, which showed heterogeneous trajectories and lack of convergence between disturbed and control plots; the structure of these assemblages will likely change in next years. In conclusion, our results showed that fire significantly affected plant diversity in the two savanna physiognomies (cerrado típico and ralo), but also indicated that community reassembling is fast, with different dynamics between Cerrado physiognomies."
Trait-based paradise — or only feeding the computer with biology?,We briefly discuss the relationship between the biological knowledge and the methodological issues related to traitbased ecological analyses. We provide illustrative examples and argue that the biological novelty of trait-based research is generally less than expected - while new information is mostly coming from data management and methodology.
Is there anybody out there? Occupancy of the carnivore guild in a temperate archipelago,"Carnivores are important components of ecological communities with wide-ranging effects that vary with carnivore size, natural history, and hunting tactics. Researchers and managers should strive to understand both the presence and distribution of carnivores within their local environment. We studied the carnivore guild in the Apostle Islands, where the distribution and occupancy of carnivores was largely unknown. We monitored 19 islands with 160 functioning camera traps from 2014–2017, from which we collected 203,385 photographs across 49,280 trap nights. We documented 7,291 total wildlife events with 1,970 carnivore events, and detected 10 of the 12 terrestrial carnivores found in Wisconsin. Detection rates for species were generally higher in summer than winter, except for coyotes (Canis latrans) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Finitesample occupancy estimates for carnivores varied across islands, with mean estimated occupancy across islands varying from a high of 0.73 for black bears to a low of 0.21 for gray wolves. Of the potential island biogeography explanatory variables for carnivore occupancy we considered, island size was the most important, followed by distance to the mainland, and then interisland distance. We estimated that terrestrial carnivore species varied in the number of islands they were detected on from 1 island for gray wolves to 13 islands for black bears. Estimated carnivore richness across islands (i.e., the number of carnivores occupying an island) also varied substantively from 1 species on Michigan Island to 10 species on Stockton Island. Island size and connectivity between islands appear important for the persistence of the carnivore community in the Apostle Islands."
"Mayfly ecological traits in a European karst spring: species, microhabitats and life histories","Despite the recent increase in the number of mayfly studies in karst freshwater habitats, their biology and ecology in springs are still poorly characterized. Therefore, we studied mayfly assemblages in a European karst rheocrene spring at five microhabitats monthly over a one-year period. Three species were recorded: Baetis alpinus (Pictet, 1843), Baetis rhodani (Pictet, 1843) and Rhithrogena braaschi (Jacob, 1974). The latter species represents a new record for the fauna of Bosnia and Herzegovina. All three species inhabited all studied microhabitats but with varying abundance. Individual species were associated with a specific substrate type and/or water velocity and/or water depth. The grazer/scraper Rh. braaschi was most common at microhabitats with inorganic substrate (cobbles, mixture of pebbles and sand), moderate water velocity and higher water depth. The rheophilic grazer/scraper and gatherer/collector B. alpinus was most common at microhabitats with mosses and highest water velocity. The grazer/scraper and gatherer/collector B. rhodani was recorded at all microhabitats, yet due to its preference for moderate water velocity, the highest number of individuals were collected from cobbles. We recorded movements of mayfly nymphs among the available microhabitats during their life cycles, due likely to their dietary requirements and search for suitable refugia. Baetis alpinus has a bivoltine, B. rhodani polyvoltine and Rh. braaschi univoltine life cycle with a long emergence period. The results presented here contribute to the knowledge of spring and mayfly ecology."
Effects of Drought Stress on Hybrids of Vigna radiata at Germination Stage,"Drought is one the critical abiotic factors that reduces the germination, growth and yield of crops. Therefore the present project was designed with the objective to screen the best drought tolerant hybrid of Vigna radiata. Genetic variations for drought tolerance among these hybrids were assessed by simple and efficient technique. Seven hybrids of V. radiata (9801, 7002, 9706, 08003, 07007, 97012 and 08007) were used for screening against three levels of drought stress (zero, control), 5% (-0.05 MPa) and 10% (-0.1 MPa) induced by Polyethyleneglycol (PEG6000). A. higher proline content was observed in 07007 (6.10 μg/g fresh weight) as compared to all other hybrids. Treated seedlings of each hybrid were com-pared with their respective control to evaluate the differences in their growth under drought. Different parameters such as percentage of germination, germination stress tolerance index (GSI), shoot and root weights (bath fresh and dry) and lengths, root length stress index (RLSI), dry matter stress index (DMSI) and plant height stress index (PHSI) showed considerable variations. Germination percentage, shoot weights, PHSI and DMSI decreased in all hybrids along with the increase of PEG induced drought stress (5% and 10% PEG). In contrary, root weights and RLSI were increased under drought. Overall 07007 showed a better performance, and can therefore be classified as a drought tolerant hybrid."
Comparative Toxicity Evaluation of Targeted Anticancer Therapeutics in Embryonic Zebrafish and Sea Urchin Models,"Cancer drug resistance and poor selectivity towards cancer cells demand the constant search for new therapeutics. PI3K-Akt-mTOR and RAS-MAPK-ERK signaling pathways are key mechanisms involved in cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism and their deregulation in cancer can pro-mote development of therapy resistance. We investigated the effects of targeted inhibitors (wortmannin, GSK690693, AZD2014 and tipifarnib) towards these two pathways on early zebrafish and sea urchin development to assess their toxicity in normal, fast proliferating cells. PI3K inhibitor wortmannin and RAS inhibitor tipifarnib displayed highest toxicity while GSK690693, a pan-Akt kinase inhibitor, exhib-ited a less significant impact on embryo survival and development. Moreover, inhibition of the upstream part of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway (wortmannin/GSK690693 co-treatment) produced a synergistic effect and impacted zebrafish embryo survival and development at much lower concentrations. Dual mTORCl/mTORC2 inhibitor AZD2014 showed no considerable effects on embryonic cells of zebrafish in concentrations substantially toxic in cancer cells. AZD2014 also caused the least prominent effects on sea urchin embryo development compared to other inhibitors. Significant toxicity of AZD2014 in human cancer cells, its capacity to sensitize resistant cancers, lower antiproliferative activity against human normal cell lines and fast proliferating embryonic cells could make this agent a promising candidate for anticancer therapy."
Comparison of the Responses to NaCl Stress of Three Tomato Introgression Lines,"We aimed to examine the response of three tomato introgression lines (IL925.3, IL925.5 and IL925.6) to NaCl stress. These lines originated from a cross between M82 (Solarium lycopersicum) and the wild salt-tolerant tomato Solarium permellii, each line containing a different fragment of the S.pennellii genome. Salt-sensitive phenotypes related to plant growth and physiology, and the response of antioxidants, pig-ments and antioxidant enzymes were measured. In general, salt stress decreased the fresh weight of leaves, leaf area and leaf number and an increase of Na+ accumulation in aerial parts was observed, which caused a reduction in the absorption of K+ and Ca2+. Salt stress also induced a decrease in chlorophyll, carotenoids and lipid peroxidation (MDA) and an increase in anthocyanins and reduced ascorbate, although some differences were seen between the lines, for example for carotenoid levels. Guaiacol per-oxidase, catalase and glutathione reductase activity enhanced in aerial parts of the lines, but again some differences were seen between the three lines. It is concluded that IL925.5 might be the most sensitive line to salt stress as its dry weight loss was the greatest in response to salt and this line showed the high-est Na+ ion accumulation in leaves."
New DOI Detector Using a Bottom and Side Readouts with a Cross-Arranged Scintillator Array for Positron Emission Tomography,"We designed a depth-encoding positron emission tomography (PET) detector by using a bottom and side readout method with a cross-arranged scintillator array. To evaluate the characteristics of the novel detector module, we used the DETECT2000 simulation tool to perform the optical photon transport in the crystal array. The detector module consists of an M (column) × N (row) cross-arranged crystal array composed of M/3 sub-arrays consisting of N × 3 crystals. The second column of the sub-array is arranged perpendicular to the first and the third columns. The crystal is optically coupled to the crystals of the other columns; however, the surfaces between the crystals in the same column are treated as reflectors. A 6 × 5 crystal array consisting of two sub-arrays was considered for proof of concept. The two multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) arrays are coupled to the bottom and one side of the crystal array, respectively. The x-y position is determined by the bottom MPPC array, and the side MPPC array gives depth information. All pixels in the x-y plane and the z direction were clearly distinguished."
Crystal Structure and Magnetic Properties of Sodium-Iron Phosphates NaFe0.9Mn0.1PO4 Cathode Material,"The sodium-iron phosphate maricite-NaFe0.9Mn0.1PO4 was synthesized using the ball mill method. The crystal structure and magnetic properties of the prepared materials were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and Mössbauer spectroscopy. Structural refinement of maricite-NaFe0.9Mn0.1PO4 was analyzed using the FullProf program. From the XRD patterns, the crystal structure of maricite-NaFe0.9Mn0.1PO4 was found to be orthorhombic with the space group Pmnb. The lattice parameters of maricite-NaFe0.9Mn0.1PO4 are as follows: a0 = 6.866 Å, b0 = 8.988 Å, c0 = 5.047 Å, and V = 311.544 Å3. Maricite-NaFePO4 has an edge-sharing structure that consists of FeO6 octahedral. Under an applied field of 100 Oe, the temperature dependences of zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) curves were measured from 4.2 to 295 K. Mössbauer spectra were also recorded at various temperatures ranging from 4.2 to 295 K. We thus confirmed that the Néel temperature of NaFe0.9Mn0.1PO4 (TN = 14 K) was lower than that of maricite-NaFePO4 (TN = 15 K)."
PEG cross-linked Chitosan: a biomacromolecule as corrosion inhibitor for sugar industry,"The present work reports the application of polyethylene glycol (PEG) cross-linked chitosan (Cht-PEG) as a green corrosion inhibitor. This is the first study reporting the application of Cht-PEG as corrosion inhibitor for mild steel in 1 M sulphamic acid solution. The results of gravimetric measurements, electrochemical study and surface analysis (SEM) are presented in this work. The adsorption of the inhibitor over the mild steel surface obeyed the Langmuir isotherm. At an optimum concentration of 200 ppm, the maximum corrosion inhibition efficiency obtained was 93.9%. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study showed an increase in polarization resistance with increase in the concentration of inhibitor justifying the adsorption and inhibition behaviour. Potentiodynamic polarization indicated that the Cht-PEG behaved as a mixed type inhibitor with cathodic predominance. The density functional theory (DFT) based calculations supported the experimental observations."
"3-D printing of chitosan-calcium phosphate inks: rheology, interactions and characterization","Bone substitute fabrication is of interest to meet the worldwide incidence of bone disorders. Physical chitosan hydrogels with intertwined apatite particles were chosen to meet the bio-physical and mechanical properties required by a potential bone substitute. A set up for 3-D printing by robocasting was found adequate to fabricate scaffolds. Inks consisted of suspensions of calcium phosphate particles in chitosan acidic aqueous solution. The inks are shear-thinning and consist of a suspension of dispersed platelet aggregates of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate in a continuous chitosan phase. The rheological properties of the inks were studied, including their shear-thinning characteristics and yield stress. Scaffolds were printed in basic water/ethanol baths to induce transformation of chitosan-calcium phosphates suspension into physical hydrogel of chitosan mineralized with apatite. Scaffolds consisted of a chitosan polymeric matrix intertwined with poorly crystalline apatite particles. Results indicate that ink rheological properties could be tuned by controlling ink composition: in particular, more printable inks are obtained with higher chitosan concentration (0.19 mol·L−1)."
Keratin nanoparticles-coating electrospun PVA nanofibers for potential neural tissue applications,"Keratin has the potential to improve biocompatibility and bioactivity of polymeric nanofibers. However, the addition of keratin into the blend nanofiber would decrease the mechanical properties of nanofibers due to the poor spinnability of keratin, and caused inhomogeneous distribution of keratin inside the nanofibers. Therefore, polymeric nanofibers surface-modified with keratin nanoparticles would improve the hydrophility and mechanical property. In this study, keratose (oxidative keratin, KOS) nanoparticles-coating PVA nanofibers (KNPs/PVA) were fabricated by electrospray deposition after electrospinning and acted on neural cells. The chemical conformation, mechanical properties and wettability of KNPs/PVA nanofibers were characterized. The KNPs/PVA nanofibers provided better wettability and stronger mechanical properties compared to KOS/PVA blend nanofibers at the same mass ratio of KOS to PVA. Furthermore, KNPs/PVA nanofibers displayed better cyto-biocompatibility in terms of cell morphology, adhesion and proliferation compared with PVA nanofibers and KOS/PVA blend nanofibers. These results suggested that polymeric nanofibers surface-modified with KOS nanoparticles can provide superior wettability, mechanical properties and biocompatibility by comparison with the blend nanofibers."
Classical Relativistic Extension of Kanai’s Frictional Lagrangian,"Working in an arbitrary Lorentz frame, we address the question of formulating the covariant variational principle for classical, single-particle, dissipative, relativistic mechanics. First, within a Minkowskian geometry, the basic properties of the proper time τ and the covariant velocity uμ are recapitulated. Next, using a scalar function ψ(x) and its negative derivatives ϕμ’s, we construct a covariant Lagrangian Λ that generalizes the famous Bateman-Caldirola-Kanai Lagrangian of nonrelativistic frictional mechanics. Finally, we propose a deterministic model for ψ (involving the drag coefficient A) whose explicit solution leads to relativistic damped Rayleigh motion in the rest frame of the medium."
Electron Collision Cross Sections for the TRIES Molecule and Electron Transport Coefficients in TRIES-Ar and TRIES-O2 Mixtures,"A reliable set of low-energy electron collision cross sections for the triethoxysilane (TRIES) molecule was derived based on the measured electron transport coefficients for a pure TRIES molecule by using an electron swarm method and a two-term approximation of the Boltzmann equation. The electron transport coefficients calculated using the derived set are in good agreement with experimental value over a wide range of E/N values (ratio of the electric field E to the neutral number density N). The present electron collision cross section set for the TRIES molecule, therefore, is the most reliable so far for plasma discharges and for materials processing using the TRIES molecule. Moreover, the electron transport coefficients for the TRIES-Ar and the TRIES-O2 mixtures were also calculated and analyzed over a wide range of E/N for the first time."
Feasibility of a Nonlinear Acoustic Method for the Assessment of Bone Status and Osteoporosis in Trabecular Bone,"The present study aims to investigate the feasibility of using a simple nonlinear acoustic method for the assessment of bone status and osteoporosis in trabecular bone. Correlations of linear and nonlinear ultrasound parameters with the apparent bone density were obtained in 32 bovine femoral trabecular bone samples. Highly significant positive correlations were observed between the apparent bone density and the two linear ultrasound parameters, the speed of sound (SOS) and the normalized broadband ultrasound attenuation (nBUA), with Spearman’s correlation coefficients of r = 0.85 and 0.77. In contrast, the apparent bone density was found to be negatively correlated with the nonlinear ultrasound parameter introduced in the present study, the logarithmic difference between the power spectrum levels of the fundamental frequency and the second harmonic (PSL1-PSL2), with the highest correlation coefficient of r = −0.92. These results suggest that the PSL1-PSL2, in addition to the SOS and the nBUA, may be useful for the assessment of bone status and osteoporosis."
Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Study of Al-incorporated ZnO:Mn Diluted Magnetic Semiconductors,"We have employed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetization measurements in order to study the effect of Al-incorporation on the magnetic interactions in ZnO:Mn diluted magnetic semiconductors. Al-doping is shown to decrease the antiferromagnetic correlation and to increase the ferromagnetic interaction, which is attributed to the hydrogen-mediated ferromagnetic Mn complexes in our Mn-doped ZnO samples."
Analysis of Deep-Trap States in GaN/InGaN Ultraviolet Light-Emitting Diodes after Electrical Stress,"We analyzed the deep-trap states of GaN/InGaN ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs) before and after electrical stress. After electrical stress, the light output power dropped by 5.5%, and the forward leakage current was increased. The optical degradation mechanism could be explained based on the space-charge-limited conduction (SCLC) theory. Specifically, for the reference UV LED (before stress), two sets of deep-level states which were located 0.26 and 0.52 eV below the conduction band edge were present, one with a density of 2.41 × 1016 and the other with a density of 3.91×1016 cm −3. However, after maximum electrical stress, three sets of deep-level states, with respective densities of 1.82×1016, 2.32×1016 cm −3, 5.31×1016 cm −3 were found to locate at 0.21, 0.24, and 0.50 eV below the conduction band. This finding shows that the SCLC theory is useful for understanding the degradation mechanism associated with defect generation in UV LEDs."
No difference in strength and clinical outcome between early and late repair after Achilles tendon rupture,"This retrospective study aimed to determine the patient-reported and functional outcome of patients with delayed presentation, who had received no treatment until 14 days following injury of Achilles tendon rupture repaired with minimally invasive surgery and were compared with a group of sex- and age-matched patients presenting acutely. Based on the outcomes following delayed presentation reported in the literature, it was hypothesized that outcomes would be inferior for self-reported outcome, tendon elongation, heel-rise performance, ability to return to play, and complication rates than for acutely managed patients."
Gene mutation analysis in 12 Chinese children with congenital nephrotic syndrome,"Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) is characterised by increased proteinuria, hypoproteinemia, and edema beginning in the first 3 months of life. Recently, molecular genetic studies have identified several genes involved in the pathogenesis of CNS. A systematic investigation of the genes for CNS in China has never been performed; therefore, we conducted a mutational analysis in 12 children with CNS,with the children coming from 10 provinces and autonomous regions in China."
MLH1 enhances the sensitivity of human endometrial carcinoma cells to cisplatin by activating the MLH1/c-Abl apoptosis signaling pathway,"MLH1 plays a critical role in maintaining the fidelity of DNA replication, and defects in human MLH1 have been reported. However, the role of MLH1 in endometrial carcinoma has not been fully investigated. Therefore, we aimed to study the role of MLH1 in the sensitivity of human endometrial carcinoma cells to cisplatin."
"Neoadjuvant plus adjuvant or only adjuvant nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine for resectable pancreatic cancer - the NEONAX trial (AIO-PAK-0313), a prospective, randomized, controlled, phase II study of the AIO pancreatic cancer group","Even clearly resectable pancreatic cancer still has an unfavorable prognosis. Neoadjuvant or perioperative therapies might improve the prognosis of these patients. Thus, evaluation of perioperative chemotherapy in resectable pancreatic cancer in a prospective, randomized trial is warranted. A substantial improvement in overall survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with FOLFIRINOX and nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine vs standard gemcitabine has been demonstrated in phase III-trials. Indeed nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine has a more favorable toxicity profile compared to the FOLFIRINOX protocol and appears applicable in a perioperative setting."
Multisource feedback as part of the Medical Board of Australia’s Professional Performance Framework: outcomes from a preliminary study,"The recent introduction of the Professional Performance Framework by the Medical Board of Australia is intended to strengthen continuing professional development for the 100,000 or so medical practitioners in Australia. An important option within the Framework is the use of multisource feedback from patients, colleagues and self-evaluations to allow doctors to reflect on their performance and identify methods for self-improvement. The aim of this study is to explore the relationships between patient feedback, colleague feedback, and self-evaluation using the same questionnaires as used by patients and colleagues."
Research on long-term care insurance: status quo and directions for future research,"We provide a structured literature review of long-term care (LTC) insurance using main path analysis, a mathematical tool to identify the most significant paths in a citation network. We identify three major research areas (financing, demand, and insurability) and systematically evaluate them based on standard frameworks. We further review established and innovative (insurance) solutions for LTC financing. Our results illustrate the immense difficulties of insuring LTC both on the demand side (e.g., low value of consumption while in care, existence of substitutes) and supply side (e.g., lack of predictability and asymmetric information), explaining the marginal contribution of insurance mechanisms to LTC financing. Combined products that bundle the risks, and public–private partnerships that integrate LTC into the pension systems might help to overcome the insurability limitations. In addition, alternative financing methods that go beyond the idea of risk pooling (LTC bond, LTC put option, equity release) could help to improve the sustainability of LTC financing."
Clinical phenotypes and biologic treatment use in juvenile dermatomyositis-associated calcinosis,"Few risk factors have been identified for the development of calcinosis among patients with Juvenile Dermatomyositis, and currently no clinical phenotype has been associated with its development. We analyzed a large database of patients to further elucidate any relationships among patients with and without calcinosis."
Coronary artery status of patients with transient fever 24–36 h after first IVIG infusion did not differ from that seen in responsive patients,Current management guidelines for patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) differ in their recommendations for fever observation times when determining resistance to initial intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). This retrospective study assessed coronary artery status in patients with transient fever 24–36 h after the completion of a first IVIG infusion.
Model based on GA and DNN for prediction of mRNA-Smad7 expression regulated by miRNAs in breast cancer,"The Smad7 protein is negative regulator of the TGF-β signaling pathway, which is upregulated in patients with breast cancer. miRNAs regulate proteins expressions by arresting or degrading the mRNAs. The purpose of this work is to identify a miRNAs profile that regulates the expression of the mRNA coding for Smad7 in breast cancer using the data from patients with breast cancer obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas Project."
Plasma mitochondrial DNA and metabolomic alterations in severe critical illness,Cell-free plasma mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels are associated with endothelial dysfunction and differential outcomes in critical illness. A substantial alteration in metabolic homeostasis is commonly observed in severe critical illness. We hypothesized that metabolic profiles significantly differ between critically ill patients relative to their level of plasma mtDNA.
Outcomes of re-irradiation for brain recurrence after prophylactic or therapeutic whole-brain irradiation for small cell lung Cancer: a retrospective analysis,Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) can recur in the brain after whole-brain irradiation (WBI). We documented outcomes after treatment of such recurrences and sought predictors of local control and overall survival (OS).
Knowledge translation in child welfare—improving educational outcomes for children at risk: study protocol for a hybrid randomized controlled pragmatic trial,"In Norway, a disproportionately high number of children receiving Child Welfare Services (CWS) struggle academically and drop out of school. Academic attainment is one of the strongest protective factors against societal marginalization. The present study is part of a knowledge translation project in collaboration with local CWS with the aim to develop, implement, and evaluate Enhanced Academic Support (EAS) for primary school children in CWS."
Development of a core outcome set for diabetes after pregnancy prevention interventions (COS-DAP): a study protocol,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) increases the risk of adverse short- and long-term outcomes, including development of type 2 diabetes. The US Diabetes Prevention Program demonstrates this risk can be halved with an intensive health behavior change intervention in women with pre-diabetes averaging 12 years since a GDM pregnancy. In recent years, the number of studies looking at changing the behaviors of women with previous GDM closer to the time of delivery has steadily grown, but reported outcomes vary and most studies are not long enough or large enough to examine incident diabetes. This initiative aims to develop a core outcome set (COS) for interventions seeking to prevent diabetes after pregnancy (DAP) in both women with prior GDM and their families."
Using mobile phone technology to treat alcohol use disorder: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,A primary concern within the healthcare system is to make treatment more accessible as well as attractive for the great majority of alcohol-dependent people who feel reluctant to participate in the treatment programs available. This paper presents the protocol for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of two different technical devices (mobile phone application and breathalyzer) on alcohol consumption.
Energy Optimization for Cellular-Connected Multi-UAV Mobile Edge Computing Systems with Multi-Access Schemes,"In this paper, a cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mobile edge computing system is studied where several UAVs are associated to a terrestrial base station (TBS) for computation offloading. To compute the large amount of data bits, a part of computation task is migrated to TBS and the other part is locally handled at UAVs. Our goal is to minimize the total energy consumption of all UAVs by jointly adjusting the bit allocation, power allocation, resource partitioning as well as UAV trajectory under TBS’s energy budget. For deeply comprehending the impact of multi-UAV access strategy on the system performance, four access schemes in the uplink transmission is considered, i.e., time division multiple access, orthogonal frequency division multiple access, one-by-one access and non-orthogonal multiple access. The involved problems under different access schemes are all formulated in non-convex forms, which are difficult to be tackled optimally. To solve this class of problem, the successive convex approximation technique is employed to obtain the suboptimal solutions. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme save significant energy consumption compared with the benchmark schemes."
"Access to care for non-communicable diseases in Mosul, Iraq between 2014 and 2017: a rapid qualitative study","During June 2014 to April 2017, the population of Mosul, Iraq lived in a state of increasing isolation from the rest of Iraq due to the city’s occupation by the Islamic State group. As part of a study to develop a generalisable method for estimating the excess burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in conflict-affected settings, in April–May 2017 we conducted a brief qualitative study of self-reported care for NCDs among 15 adult patients who had fled Mosul and presented to Médecins Sans Frontières clinics in the Kurdistan region with hypertension and/or diabetes. Participants reported consistent barriers to NCD care during the so-called Islamic State period, including drug shortages, insecurity and inability to afford privately sold medication. Coping strategies included drug rationing. By 2016, all patients had completely or partially lost access to care. Though limited, this study suggests a profound effect of the conflict on NCD burden."
Novel Technique in Multihop Environment for Efficient Emergency Message Dissemination and Lossless Video Transmission in VANETS,"Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) support safety- and non-safety-related applications that require the transmission of emergency safety messages and periodic beacon messages. The dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) standard in VANETs is used to exchange safety messages, and is involved in multi-hop data dissemination and routing. Many researchers have focused either on emergency data dissemination or routing, but both are critical. Routing protocols are commonly used for position-based routing and distancebased routing. This paper focuses on both emergency data dissemination and multi-hop routing, with the selection of the best data disseminator and trustworthy forwarder. To select the best forwarder, ring partitioning is performed, which segregates vehicles into rings based on the coverage area for routing. Each partition is selected with a best forwarder, which minimizes the hop count for data transmission. The work also includes effective video transmission for a user’s request. Video transmission in VANETs is involved in this work to provide efficient video delivery between rapidly travelling vehicles with reduced delay owing to the selection of good-quality channels. Video transmission is prioritized according to frame types, and they are then transmitted with respect to the preference of channels. The major issue in video streaming is the loss of packets, which is our focus to minimize it. Our proposed VANET environment is simulated in OMNeT++, and the results show remarkable improvements in terms of the packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and reliability."
UAV-Aided Networks for Emergency Communications in Areas with Unevenly Distributed Users,"Nowadays, daily human life is closely intertwined with various networks. When natural disasters or malicious attacks break out, the failure of communication infrastructure due to direct destruction or indirect impact tends to cause a massive outage of communications. Emergency communication networks play a significant role in rescue operations. Recently, a flexible and efficient solution has been provided for emergency communications using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). By means of their excellent characteristics, UAVs, serving as aerial base stations (ABSs), can be rapidly deployed to temporarily rebuild a damaged communication network to restore the users’ connectivity. In this study, we investigate the use of UAVs as ABSs for an emergency communication scene where user equipment is unevenly distributed and the communication infrastructure has completely failed due to a severe disaster. Effective communication probability (ECP), which integrates throughput coverage and connectivity, is used to evaluate the performance of a communication network. Through simulations, we analyze communication improvements that can be obtained by the flexible deployment of ABSs. The results show a noticeable increase in ECP when some ABSs are deployed in optimal locations."
Coverage Optimization for UAV-Aided Internet of Things with Partial Channel Knowledge,"Due to the high maneuverability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), they have been widely deployed to boost the performance of Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, to promote the coverage performance of UAV-aided IoT communications, we maximize the minimum average rate of the IoT devices by jointly optimizing the resource allocation strategy and the UAV altitude. Particularly, to depict the practical propagation environment, we take the composite channel model including both the small-scale and the large-scale channel fading into account. Due to the difficulty in acquiring the random small-scale channel fading, we assume that only the large-scale channel sate information is available. On this basis, we formulate an optimization problem, which is not convex and challenging to solve. Then, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed using block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization tools. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the significant performance gain of the proposed scheme over existing ones."
New Deterministic and Stochastic Simulation Models for UAV-MIMO Ricean Fading Channels,"For the practical simulation and performance evaluation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Ricean fading channels, it is desirable to develop accurate UAV-MIMO channel simulation models for more realistic scenarios of non-isotropic scattering. In this study, using a two-cylinder reference model to describe the distribution of scatterers, we propose new deterministic and stochastic simulation models. Analytical and numerical results indicate that both simulation models provide good approximations to the desired statistical properties of the reference model, and the stochastic simulation model results in a better performance under comparable computational complexity."
Proteolytic cleavage of Beclin 1 exacerbates neurodegeneration,"Neuronal cell loss contributes to the pathology of acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It remains crucial to identify molecular mechanisms sensitizing neurons to various insults and cell death. To date, the multifunctional, autophagy-related protein Beclin 1 has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for neuronal integrity in neurodegenerative models associated with protein aggregation. Interestingly, besides its role in cellular homeostasis, Beclin 1 has also been ascribed a role in apoptosis. This makes it critical to elucidate whether Beclin 1 regulates neuronal death and survival across neurodegenerative conditions independent of protein clearance. Here, we provide experimental evidence for a direct functional link between proteolytic cleavage of Beclin 1 and apoptotic neuronal cell loss in two independent models of neurodegeneration in vivo."
Association of HLA-G 3′ UTR polymorphism and expression with the progression of cervical lesions in human papillomavirus 18 infections,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G is an immune checkpoint molecule, which expression in cervical cancer cells enables them to escape immunosurveillance. To date, limited information has been published on the association of HLA-G genetic background in malignant cells with levels of HLA-G expression and the clinical outcome of patients."
PIK3CA mutations are frequent in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma associated with chagasic megaesophagus and are associated with a worse patient outcome,"Chronic diseases such as chagasic megaesophagus (secondary to Chagas’ disease) have been suggested as etiological factors for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; however, the molecular mechanisms involved are poorly understood."
User-centered practicability analysis of two identification strategies in electrode arrays for FES induced hand motion in early stroke rehabilitation,"Surface electrode arrays have become popular in the application of functional electrical stimulation (FES) on the forearm. Arrays consist of multiple, small elements, which can be activated separately or in groups, forming virtual electrodes (VEs). As technology progress yields rising numbers of possible elements, an effective search strategy for suitable VEs in electrode arrays is of increasing importance. Current methods can be time-consuming, lack user integration, and miss an evaluation regarding clinical acceptance and practicability."
Anatomic single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a calcium phosphate-hybridized tendon graft: a randomized controlled trial with 2 years of follow-up,"To improve tendon-to-bone healing in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, a novel technique via calcium phosphate (CaP)-hybridized tendon graft using an alternate soaking process was developed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical results of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction using the CaP-hybridized tendon graft with up to 2 years follow-up, and compare the outcome with conventional ACL reconstruction and preoperative data."
A compact streamfunction-velocity scheme for the 2-D unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in arbitrary curvilinear coordinates,"A streamfunction-velocity formulation-based compact difference method is suggested for solving the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the arbitrary curvilinear coordinates, in which the streamfunction and its first derivatives as the unknown variables are utilized. Numerical examples, involving the boundary layer problem, a constricted channel flow, driven polar cavity flow and trapezoidal cavity flow problem, are solved by the present method. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed scheme and exhibit the numerical capability to simulate the flow problems on geometries beyond rectangular. For driven polar cavity flow problem, the results show that the flow for Re = 5 000 is not steady but time-periodic, and the critical Reynold number (Rec) for the occurrence of a Hopf bifurcation is given."
The trouble with surrogates in environmental risk assessment: a daphniid case study,"The use of indicator species to test for environmental stability and functioning is a widespread practice. In aquatic systems, several daphniids (Cladocera: Daphniidae) are commonly used as indicator species; registration of new pesticides are mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency to be accompanied by daphniid toxicity data. This reliance upon a few species to infer ecosystem health and function assumes similar responses to toxicants across species with potentially very different life histories and susceptibility. Incorporating lab-derived life-history data into a simple mathematical model, we explore the reliability of three different daphniid species as surrogates for each other by comparing their responses to reductions in survivorship and fecundity after simulated exposure to toxicants. Our results demonstrate that daphniid species’ responses to toxicant exposure render them poor surrogates for one another, highlighting that caution should be exercised in using a surrogate approach to the use of indicator species in risk assessment."

Analysis of Deep-Trap States in GaN/InGaN Ultraviolet Light-Emitting Diodes after Electrical Stress,"We analyzed the deep-trap states of GaN/InGaN ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs) before and after electrical stress. After electrical stress, the light output power dropped by 5.5%, and the forward leakage current was increased. The optical degradation mechanism could be explained based on the space-charge-limited conduction (SCLC) theory. Specifically, for the reference UV LED (before stress), two sets of deep-level states which were located 0.26 and 0.52 eV below the conduction band edge were present, one with a density of 2.41 × 1016 and the other with a density of 3.91×1016 cm −3. However, after maximum electrical stress, three sets of deep-level states, with respective densities of 1.82×1016, 2.32×1016 cm −3, 5.31×1016 cm −3 were found to locate at 0.21, 0.24, and 0.50 eV below the conduction band. This finding shows that the SCLC theory is useful for understanding the degradation mechanism associated with defect generation in UV LEDs."
Classical Relativistic Extension of Kanai’s Frictional Lagrangian,"Working in an arbitrary Lorentz frame, we address the question of formulating the covariant variational principle for classical, single-particle, dissipative, relativistic mechanics. First, within a Minkowskian geometry, the basic properties of the proper time τ and the covariant velocity uμ are recapitulated. Next, using a scalar function ψ(x) and its negative derivatives ϕμ’s, we construct a covariant Lagrangian Λ that generalizes the famous Bateman-Caldirola-Kanai Lagrangian of nonrelativistic frictional mechanics. Finally, we propose a deterministic model for ψ (involving the drag coefficient A) whose explicit solution leads to relativistic damped Rayleigh motion in the rest frame of the medium."
Electron Collision Cross Sections for the TRIES Molecule and Electron Transport Coefficients in TRIES-Ar and TRIES-O2 Mixtures,"A reliable set of low-energy electron collision cross sections for the triethoxysilane (TRIES) molecule was derived based on the measured electron transport coefficients for a pure TRIES molecule by using an electron swarm method and a two-term approximation of the Boltzmann equation. The electron transport coefficients calculated using the derived set are in good agreement with experimental value over a wide range of E/N values (ratio of the electric field E to the neutral number density N). The present electron collision cross section set for the TRIES molecule, therefore, is the most reliable so far for plasma discharges and for materials processing using the TRIES molecule. Moreover, the electron transport coefficients for the TRIES-Ar and the TRIES-O2 mixtures were also calculated and analyzed over a wide range of E/N for the first time."
Feasibility of a Nonlinear Acoustic Method for the Assessment of Bone Status and Osteoporosis in Trabecular Bone,"The present study aims to investigate the feasibility of using a simple nonlinear acoustic method for the assessment of bone status and osteoporosis in trabecular bone. Correlations of linear and nonlinear ultrasound parameters with the apparent bone density were obtained in 32 bovine femoral trabecular bone samples. Highly significant positive correlations were observed between the apparent bone density and the two linear ultrasound parameters, the speed of sound (SOS) and the normalized broadband ultrasound attenuation (nBUA), with Spearman’s correlation coefficients of r = 0.85 and 0.77. In contrast, the apparent bone density was found to be negatively correlated with the nonlinear ultrasound parameter introduced in the present study, the logarithmic difference between the power spectrum levels of the fundamental frequency and the second harmonic (PSL1-PSL2), with the highest correlation coefficient of r = −0.92. These results suggest that the PSL1-PSL2, in addition to the SOS and the nBUA, may be useful for the assessment of bone status and osteoporosis."
Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Study of Al-incorporated ZnO:Mn Diluted Magnetic Semiconductors,"We have employed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetization measurements in order to study the effect of Al-incorporation on the magnetic interactions in ZnO:Mn diluted magnetic semiconductors. Al-doping is shown to decrease the antiferromagnetic correlation and to increase the ferromagnetic interaction, which is attributed to the hydrogen-mediated ferromagnetic Mn complexes in our Mn-doped ZnO samples."
Crystal Structure and Magnetic Properties of Sodium-Iron Phosphates NaFe0.9Mn0.1PO4 Cathode Material,"The sodium-iron phosphate maricite-NaFe0.9Mn0.1PO4 was synthesized using the ball mill method. The crystal structure and magnetic properties of the prepared materials were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and Mössbauer spectroscopy. Structural refinement of maricite-NaFe0.9Mn0.1PO4 was analyzed using the FullProf program. From the XRD patterns, the crystal structure of maricite-NaFe0.9Mn0.1PO4 was found to be orthorhombic with the space group Pmnb. The lattice parameters of maricite-NaFe0.9Mn0.1PO4 are as follows: a0 = 6.866 Å, b0 = 8.988 Å, c0 = 5.047 Å, and V = 311.544 Å3. Maricite-NaFePO4 has an edge-sharing structure that consists of FeO6 octahedral. Under an applied field of 100 Oe, the temperature dependences of zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) curves were measured from 4.2 to 295 K. Mössbauer spectra were also recorded at various temperatures ranging from 4.2 to 295 K. We thus confirmed that the Néel temperature of NaFe0.9Mn0.1PO4 (TN = 14 K) was lower than that of maricite-NaFePO4 (TN = 15 K)."
New DOI Detector Using a Bottom and Side Readouts with a Cross-Arranged Scintillator Array for Positron Emission Tomography,"We designed a depth-encoding positron emission tomography (PET) detector by using a bottom and side readout method with a cross-arranged scintillator array. To evaluate the characteristics of the novel detector module, we used the DETECT2000 simulation tool to perform the optical photon transport in the crystal array. The detector module consists of an M (column) × N (row) cross-arranged crystal array composed of M/3 sub-arrays consisting of N × 3 crystals. The second column of the sub-array is arranged perpendicular to the first and the third columns. The crystal is optically coupled to the crystals of the other columns; however, the surfaces between the crystals in the same column are treated as reflectors. A 6 × 5 crystal array consisting of two sub-arrays was considered for proof of concept. The two multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) arrays are coupled to the bottom and one side of the crystal array, respectively. The x-y position is determined by the bottom MPPC array, and the side MPPC array gives depth information. All pixels in the x-y plane and the z direction were clearly distinguished."
PEG cross-linked Chitosan: a biomacromolecule as corrosion inhibitor for sugar industry,"The present work reports the application of polyethylene glycol (PEG) cross-linked chitosan (Cht-PEG) as a green corrosion inhibitor. This is the first study reporting the application of Cht-PEG as corrosion inhibitor for mild steel in 1 M sulphamic acid solution. The results of gravimetric measurements, electrochemical study and surface analysis (SEM) are presented in this work. The adsorption of the inhibitor over the mild steel surface obeyed the Langmuir isotherm. At an optimum concentration of 200 ppm, the maximum corrosion inhibition efficiency obtained was 93.9%. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study showed an increase in polarization resistance with increase in the concentration of inhibitor justifying the adsorption and inhibition behaviour. Potentiodynamic polarization indicated that the Cht-PEG behaved as a mixed type inhibitor with cathodic predominance. The density functional theory (DFT) based calculations supported the experimental observations."
No difference in strength and clinical outcome between early and late repair after Achilles tendon rupture,"This retrospective study aimed to determine the patient-reported and functional outcome of patients with delayed presentation, who had received no treatment until 14 days following injury of Achilles tendon rupture repaired with minimally invasive surgery and were compared with a group of sex- and age-matched patients presenting acutely. Based on the outcomes following delayed presentation reported in the literature, it was hypothesized that outcomes would be inferior for self-reported outcome, tendon elongation, heel-rise performance, ability to return to play, and complication rates than for acutely managed patients."
"Rapamycin treatment increases hippocampal cell viability in an mTOR-independent manner during exposure to hypoxia mimetic, cobalt chloride","Cobalt chloride (CoCl2) induces chemical hypoxia through activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α). Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a multifaceted protein capable of regulating cell growth, angiogenesis, metabolism, proliferation, and survival. In this study, we tested the efficacy of a well-known mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, in reducing oxidative damage and increasing cell viability in the mouse hippocampal cell line, HT22, during a CoCl2-simulated hypoxic insult."

Downregulation of TGF-β1 suppressed proliferation and increased chemosensitivity of ovarian cancer cells by promoting BRCA1/Smad3 signaling,"Studies have demonstrated that transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) exhibits oncogenic activity in different types of cancer, including ovarian cancer (OC). However, its regulatory mechanism in OC and whether TGF-β1 is involved in chemosensitivity regulation remains unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of TGF-β1 in OC."
"Anxiety, depression, and quality of life in backache patients before and after spinal traction",Chronic pain has a negative impact on quality of life and psychological well-being. The objectives of this study are to investigate the psychological status and quality of life in backache patients before and after spinal traction and reflect how this maneuver is effective in treating backache.
Application of Bonelike® as synthetic bone graft in orthopaedic and oral surgery in veterinary clinical cases,"Autologous bone remains the gold standard grafting substrate for bone fusions used for small gaps and critical defects. However, significant morbidity is associated with the harvesting of autologous bone grafts and, for that reason, alternative bone graft substitutes have been developed. In the present case series, a glass-reinforced hydroxyapatite synthetic bone substitute, with osteoinductive and osteoconductive proprieties, was applied. This synthetic bone substitute comprises the incorporation of P2O5-CaO glass-based system within a hydroxyapatite matrix, moulded into spherical pellets with 250-500 μm of diameter. A total of 14 veterinary clinical cases of appendicular bone defects and maxillary / mandibular bone defects are described. In all clinical cases, the synthetic bone substitute was used to fill bone defects, enhancing bone regeneration and complementing the recommended surgical techniques. Results demonstrated that it is an appropriate synthetic bone graft available to be used in veterinary patients. It functioned as a space filler in association with standard orthopaedic and odontological procedures of stabilization, promoting a faster bone fusion without any local or systemic adverse reactions. This procedure improves the animals’ quality of life, decreasing pain and post-operative recovery period, as well as increasing bone stability improving positive clinical outcomes."
18F-choline PET/CT incidental thyroid uptake in patients studied for prostate cancer,Thyroid incidental uptake is defined as a thyroid uptake incidentally detected by imaging examinations performed for non-thyroid disease.

Tetraspanin 7 autoantibodies predict progressive decline of beta cell function in individuals with LADA,The aim of this work was to investigate whether tetraspanin 7 autoantibodies (TSPAN7A) are valuable in predicting poor beta cell function in individuals with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).
"3-D printing of chitosan-calcium phosphate inks: rheology, interactions and characterization","Bone substitute fabrication is of interest to meet the worldwide incidence of bone disorders. Physical chitosan hydrogels with intertwined apatite particles were chosen to meet the bio-physical and mechanical properties required by a potential bone substitute. A set up for 3-D printing by robocasting was found adequate to fabricate scaffolds. Inks consisted of suspensions of calcium phosphate particles in chitosan acidic aqueous solution. The inks are shear-thinning and consist of a suspension of dispersed platelet aggregates of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate in a continuous chitosan phase. The rheological properties of the inks were studied, including their shear-thinning characteristics and yield stress. Scaffolds were printed in basic water/ethanol baths to induce transformation of chitosan-calcium phosphates suspension into physical hydrogel of chitosan mineralized with apatite. Scaffolds consisted of a chitosan polymeric matrix intertwined with poorly crystalline apatite particles. Results indicate that ink rheological properties could be tuned by controlling ink composition: in particular, more printable inks are obtained with higher chitosan concentration (0.19 mol·L−1)."
Keratin nanoparticles-coating electrospun PVA nanofibers for potential neural tissue applications,"Keratin has the potential to improve biocompatibility and bioactivity of polymeric nanofibers. However, the addition of keratin into the blend nanofiber would decrease the mechanical properties of nanofibers due to the poor spinnability of keratin, and caused inhomogeneous distribution of keratin inside the nanofibers. Therefore, polymeric nanofibers surface-modified with keratin nanoparticles would improve the hydrophility and mechanical property. In this study, keratose (oxidative keratin, KOS) nanoparticles-coating PVA nanofibers (KNPs/PVA) were fabricated by electrospray deposition after electrospinning and acted on neural cells. The chemical conformation, mechanical properties and wettability of KNPs/PVA nanofibers were characterized. The KNPs/PVA nanofibers provided better wettability and stronger mechanical properties compared to KOS/PVA blend nanofibers at the same mass ratio of KOS to PVA. Furthermore, KNPs/PVA nanofibers displayed better cyto-biocompatibility in terms of cell morphology, adhesion and proliferation compared with PVA nanofibers and KOS/PVA blend nanofibers. These results suggested that polymeric nanofibers surface-modified with KOS nanoparticles can provide superior wettability, mechanical properties and biocompatibility by comparison with the blend nanofibers."
PK-profiling method for identifying the expression of resistance-associated genes in partially resistant oats to crown rust,"Protein kinases play a key role in plant cell homeostasis and the activation of defense mechanisms. Partial resistance to fungi in plants is interesting because of its durability. However, the variable number of minor loci associated with this type of resistance hampers the reliable identification of the full range of genes involved. The present work reports the technique of protein kinase (PK)-profiling for the identification of the PK genes induced in the partially resistant oats line MN841801–1 following exposure to the fungus Puccinia coronata. This is the first time this technique has been used with cDNA (complementary DNA) from a suppression subtractive hybridization library obtained after the hybridization of cDNAs from inoculated and mock-inoculated plants."
Physiological and proteome studies of maize (Zea mays L.) in response to leaf removal under high plant density,"Under high plant density, intensifying competition among individual plants led to overconsumption of energy and nutrients and resulted in an almost dark condition in the lower strata of the canopy, which suppressed the photosynthetic potential of the shaded leaves. Leaf removal could help to ameliorate this problem and increase crop yields. To reveal the mechanism of leaf removal in maize, tandem mass tags label-based quantitative analysis coupled with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry were used to capture the differential protein expression profiles of maize subjected to the removal of the two uppermost leaves (S2), the four uppermost leaves (S4), and with no leaf removal as control (S0)."
An APETALA1 ortholog affects plant architecture and seed yield component in oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.),"Increasing the productivity of rapeseed as one of the widely cultivated oil crops in the world is of upmost importance. As flowering time and plant architecture play a key role in the regulation of rapeseed yield, understanding the genetic mechanism underlying these traits can boost the rapeseed breeding. Meristem identity genes are known to have pleiotropic effects on plant architecture and seed yield in various crops. To understand the function of one of the meristem identity genes, APETALA1 (AP1) in rapeseed, we performed phenotypic analysis of TILLING mutants under greenhouse conditions. Three stop codon mutant families carrying a mutation in Bna.AP1.A02 paralog were analyzed for different plant architecture and seed yield-related traits."
Alterations in the proteomic composition of Serratia marcescens in response to manganese (II),"Proteomics is an important tool for the investigation of dynamic physiological responses of microbes under heavy metal stress.

Multisource feedback as part of the Medical Board of Australia’s Professional Performance Framework: outcomes from a preliminary study,"The recent introduction of the Professional Performance Framework by the Medical Board of Australia is intended to strengthen continuing professional development for the 100,000 or so medical practitioners in Australia. An important option within the Framework is the use of multisource feedback from patients, colleagues and self-evaluations to allow doctors to reflect on their performance and identify methods for self-improvement. The aim of this study is to explore the relationships between patient feedback, colleague feedback, and self-evaluation using the same questionnaires as used by patients and colleagues."
Parameter estimation of qualitative biological regulatory networks on high performance computing hardware,"Biological Regulatory Networks (BRNs) are responsible for developmental and maintenance related functions in organisms. These functions are implemented by the dynamics of BRNs and are sensitive to regulations enforced by specific activators and inhibitors. The logical modeling formalism by René Thomas incorporates this sensitivity with a set of logical parameters modulated by available regulators, varying with time. With the increase in complexity of BRNs in terms of number of entities and their interactions, the task of parameters estimation becomes computationally expensive with existing sequential SMBioNET tool. We extend the existing sequential implementation of SMBioNET by using a data decomposition approach using a Java messaging library called MPJ Express. The approach divides the parameters space into different regions and each region is then explored in parallel on High Performance Computing (HPC) hardware."
Non-uniform radiation-induced biological responses at the tissue level involved in the health risk of environmental radiation: a radiobiological hypothesis,"The conventional concept of radiation protection is based on epidemiological studies of radiation that support a positive correlation between dose and response. However, there is a remarkable difference in biological responses at the tissue level, depending on whether radiation is delivered as a uniform or non-uniform spatiotemporal distribution due to tissue sparing effects (TSE). From the point of view of radiation micro-dosimetry, environmental radiation is delivered as a non-uniform distribution, and radiation-induced biological responses at the tissue level, such as TSE, would be implicated in individual risk following exposure to environmental radiation."
Tuberculosis incidence inequalities and its social determinants in Manaus from 2007 to 2016,"Brazil is among the 30 countries with high-burden of tuberculosis worldwide, and Manaus is the capital with the highest tuberculosis incidence. The accelerated economic and population growth in Manaus in the last 30 years has strengthened the process of social stratification that may result in population groups that are less favored in terms of healthcare and are vulnerable to infection and illness due to tuberculosis. This study aimed to characterize inequalities associated with tuberculosis incidence in relation to the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the resident population of Manaus and to identify their determinants from 2007 to 2016."
Health outcomes measurement and organizational readiness support quality improvement: a systematic review,"Using outcome measures to advance healthcare continues to be of widespread interest. The goal is to summarize the results of studies which use outcome measures from clinical registries to implement and monitor QI initiatives.

Choosing wisely? Quantifying the extent of three low value psychotropic prescribing practices in Australia,"The global Choosing Wisely campaign has identified the following psychotropic prescribing as low-value (harmful or wasteful): (1) benzodiazepine use in the elderly, (2) antipsychotic use in dementia and (3) prescribing two or more antipsychotics concurrently. We aimed to quantify the extent of these prescribing practices in the Australian population."
"Bypassing health facilities in rural Mozambique: spatial, institutional, and individual determinants","Access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services is critical for such outcomes as pregnancy and birth, prenatal and neonatal mortality, maternal morbidity and mortality, and prevention of vertical transmission of infections like HIV. Health facilities are typically set up where they can efficiently serve the nearby targeted population. However, the actual utilization of health care can be complicated as people sometimes bypass the closest or nearby facilities for various reasons such as service quality. A better understanding of how people actually utilize health services can benefit future health resource allocation as well as health program planning."
Indigenous patient experiences of returning to country: a qualitative evaluation on the Country Health SA Dialysis bus,"Rates of End-Stage Kidney Disease among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) Australians in remote areas are disproportionately high; however, haemodialysis is not currently offered in most remote areas. People must therefore leave their ‘Country’ (with its traditions and supports) and relocate to metropolitan or regional centres, disrupting their kinship and the cultural ties that are important for their wellbeing. The South Australian Mobile Dialysis Truck is a service which visits remote communities for one to two week periods; allowing patients to have dialysis on ‘Country’, reuniting them with their friends and family, and providing a chance to take part in cultural activities. The aims of the study were to qualitatively evaluate the South Australian Mobile Dialysis Truck program, its impact on the health and wellbeing of Indigenous dialysis patients, and the facilitators and barriers to using the service."
Quality improvement strategies for organizational change: a multiphase observational study to increase insight into nonparticipating organizations,"The scope of implementation research is often restricted to the analysis of organizations that participate voluntarily in implementation interventions. The recruitment of participants for a quality improvement collaborative increases awareness of the specific innovation. The objective of this multiphase observational study was to identify differences between organizations that participated in a large-scale implementation project aiming to improve perioperative care, functional recovery, and length of hospital stay after gynecologic surgery and organizations that did not participate. A secondary objective was to explore how perioperative practice changed among nonparticipants."

Development of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework for off-patent pharmaceuticals – an application on improving tender decision making in Indonesia,"Off-patent pharmaceuticals (OPPs) hold vital importance in meeting public health objectives, especially in developing countries where resources are limited. OPPs are comprised of off-patent originals, branded generics and unbranded generics; nonetheless, these products are not identical and often there are differences in their equivalence, manufacturing quality standards and reliability of supply. This necessitates reconsideration of the lowest price policy objective in pharmaceutical decision making. The aim of this study was to develop a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework through a pilot workshop to inform the national procurement of OPPs in Indonesia."
IMCI and ETAT integration at a primary healthcare facility in Malawi: a human factors approach,"Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) and Emergency Triage, Assessment and Treatment (ETAT) are guidelines developed by the World Health Organization to reach targets for reducing under-5 mortality. They were set out in the Millennium Development Goals. Each guideline was established separately so the purpose of this study was to understand how these systems have been integrated in a primary care setting and identify barriers and facilitators to this integration using a systems approach."
An actin-binding protein ESPN is an independent prognosticator and regulates cell growth for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,"ESPN (Espin), an actin filament-binding protein, plays an important role in regulating the organization, dimensions, dynamics, and signaling capacities of the actin filament-rich, microvillus-type specializations that mediate sensory transduction in various mechanosensory and chemosensory cells. Recent few studies show that ESPN regulates metastasis and cell proliferation in melanoma. However, the significance of ESPN in other cancers such as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains largely unknown."
A 23-year study of mortality and development of co-morbidities in patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery (laparoscopic gastric banding) in comparison with medical treatment of obesity,"Several studies have shown that bariatric surgery reduces long term mortality compared to medical weight loss therapy. In a previous study we have demonstrated that gastric banding (LAGB) is associated with reduced mortality in patients with and without diabetes, and with reduced incidence of obesity co-morbidities (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer) at a 17 year follow-up. The aim of this study was to verify at a longer time interval (23 years) mortality and incidence of co-morbidities in patients undergoing LAGB or medical weight loss therapy."
3D Interconnected MoO2 Nanocrystals on Nickel Foam as Binder-free Anode for Li-ion Batteries,"MoO2 nanocrystals (NCs) on Ni foam were simply synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method and a dip-coating method. It was worth noting that ultrafine interconnected MoO2 nanocrystals (about 10 nm) were uniformly anchored on Ni foam to fabricate a particular three-dimensional architecture, which may provide more active sites and shorter transmission pathways for lithium ions. As binder-free anode, MoO2 NCs on Ni foam deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 990 mAh·g-1 and retain a reversible capacity of 924 mAh· g-1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.1 C. More importantly, when the current density returns from 2 C to 0.1 C, the capacity recovers to 910 mAh·g-1 (about 92% of the original high capacity), suggesting excellent cycling stability and rate capability. The particular 3D electrode as binder-free anode makes it a promising anode candidate for high-performance lithium-ion batteries."
Corrosion Inhibition from Thiol Self-assembly Layer: A High Pressure Perspective,"Taking dodecanethiol as the representative, we investigated the corrosion inhibition performance of SAL in seawater under pressures from 0.1 to 9 MPa. By using scanning Kelvin probe, the dodecanethiol SAL is confirmed to build on Cu surface, and the modification of SAL has positively shifted the surface potential to realize the inertness. Electrochemical techniques, such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization were used to reveal the corrosion behavior of Cu modified by SAL under the different pressure, i e, 0.1, 3, 6, and 9 MPa. It is indicated that the longer modification time affords better corrosion resistance to Cu. Higher static pressure is easier to deteriorate the corrosion inhibition capability due to the penetration effect. A plausible mechanism is proposed to illustrate the degradation process of SAL in the high pressure seawater environment."
Seed Free Growth of Aligned ZnO Nanowire Arrays on AZO Substrate,"In the absence of commonly used seed layer, we can still successfully synthesized aligned ZnO nanowire arrays by the hydrothermal method. By using aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) glass as a substrate, high-density and vertically aligned ZnO nanowires were synthesized directly on the substrate in the absence of the ZnO seed layer. The current-voltage curve indicated that the sample grown on AZO glass substrate in the absence of seed layer possesses better conductivity than that synthesized on FTO glass substrate with ZnO seed layer. Thus, a simplified, seed-free and low-cost experimental protocol was reported here for large-scale production of high quality ZnO nanowire arrays with promoted conductivity."
"Preparation, Characterization, and Formation Mechanism of Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate Whiskers","Calcium sulfate hemihydrate whiskers were synthesized successfully via one-step hydrothermal crystallization method using phosphogypsum at 130 °C for 240 min with an initial slurry mass fraction of 2.5wt%. The phase compositions, microstructures, thermal properties and molecular structures of asprepared samples were analyzed by XRD, ESEM, EDS, TG-DTA, and FT-IR. The influence of raw materials’ ball-milling time on the morphologies of whiskers was investigated. The effects of impurities on crystallization morphologies and length to diameter ratio (L/D) of calcium sulfate hemihydrate whiskers were studied. The results indicated that the calcium sulfate dihydrate crystalline could be translated directly into fibrous calcium sulfate hemihydrate whiskers. It was beneficial to form fine fiber structure when the ball-milling time of the raw material was 15 min. Aspect ratio of calcium sulfate hemihydrate whiskers decreased with increasing content of impurities. Moreover, the relative growth mechanism of whisker crystals via one-step hydrothermal crystallization method was discussed in detail."
Properties of Steel Slag and Stainless Steel Slag as Cement Replacement Materials: A Comparative Study,"To enhance the understanding about the utilization of steel slags as a cementitious material, we comparatively studied the chemical, mineralogical and morphological properties of two types of steel slag; basic-oxygen-furnace carbon slag (BOF C) and electric-arc-furnace stainless steel slag (EAF S). Moreover, we studied the standard consistency, setting time and the effect of the slag replacement ratios on the fluidity and compressive strength of blended cement mortar. The experimental results showed that BOF C had higher alkalinity, higher pH value and more hydraulic phases than EAF S. Both types of slag showed water reduction effect due to its high fineness. Neat BOF C paste showed flash set and acceleration in the initial setting time of blended cement especially at high slag proportions. However, EAF S prolonged the setting time of blended cement even at low slag proportions. The pH values for blended cement contained 50% BOF C or EAF S were lower than those of pure cement paste. Despite of slag type, compressive strength gradually decreased with increasing slags content. The strength of BOF C mortar was higher than that of EAF S mortar with the same replacement ratio for the same age. Slag activity index demonstrated that BOF C and EAF S conformed to the Chinese National Standard (GB/T 20491-2006) requirements for steel slag as grade one and grade two, respectively."
Preparation of Rod-like Aluminum Doped Zinc Oxide Powders by Sol-gel Technique Using Metal Chlorides and Acetylacetone Precursors,"Al-doped ZnO (AZO) powders were prepared by using metal chloride precursors and the sol-gel technique. IR peaks observed at 1590 cm-1 and 1620 cm-1 indicated the formation of metal chelate as a consequence of the addition of acetylacetone to the metal chloride solution. TG-DSC analysis of the AZO gels confirmed the formation of metal chelate as evidenced by the development of several weight loss peaks accompanied by the introduction of new endothermic peaks. The resulting AZO gels were annealed at 500, 600, and 800 °C to study the effect of annealing temperature. XRD and SEM results showed that crystallization of AZO gels takes place around 600 °C. Hexagonal wurtzite structure was identified as the main phase for all the samples. In addition, small shift of the XRD (002) peak coupled with XPS results from the AZO powders confirmed the successful doping of the ZnO powders. Micron sized rod-like AZO powders were uniform in dimension and morphology and remained stable even at 800 °C."
Effects of CFB Ash on the Adsorption Mechanism of Polycarboxylate Superplasticiser,"The effects of circulating fluid bed (CFB) ash on the adsorption performance of polycarboxylate superplasticiser and the mechanism of this influence on the dispersive property of the polycarboxylate superplasticiser were investigated by determing the cement paste fluidity, total organic carbon adsorption, infrared spectroscopic analyses and ζ potential test. The experimental results show that the addition of an inorganic salt into the mixture to change the content of SO42- and Fe2O3 can improve the adaptability between the CFB ash and polycarboxylate superplasticiser. Adsorption may occur between the polycarboxylate superplasiciser and Fe2O3, SO42- or other components in CFB ash, leading to a significant reduction in paste fluidity. As the content of Na2SO4 in CFB ash reaches 3% or Fe2O3 reaches 9%, the paste loses its liquidity. The organic carbon content in the liquor decreases with an increase in Na2SO4 or Fe2O3 content. Adding some Ba(NO3)2 and Na2S to the liquor can recover the organic carbon content to a certain extent, and the absolute value of ζ potential will increase. The addition of Ba(- NO3)2 or Na2S reduces the adsorption property of Na2SO4 or Fe2O3 in CFB ash on the polycarboxylate superplasticiser."
"Electronic, Thermal Expanding, and Optical Absorption Properties of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides: A First-principles Study","A comprehensive investigation was made on the electronic structure, thermal expansion coefficient and light absorption spectrum of total six transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) compounds with formula of MX2 (M=Mo, W, Cr, X=S, Se). First, an indirect-direct band gap transition from bulk to singlelayer was declared for all the six compounds. Moreover, the detailed lattice constants and thermal expansion coefficients provided in the paper were the key information for designing MX2-based field effect transistors. Finally, the calculated optical absorption spectra demonstrate that these compounds can effectively utilize solar energy and are good photo catalyst candidates. All these present findings will benefit the design of new generation of novel two-dimensional materials."
A Modulus Variation Model of Concrete under External Sulfate Attack: New Perspective from Statistical Evolution of Microcracks,"A numerical model was proposed to describe the modulus variation of mortar exposed to external sulfate attack and the effectivity was verified by experiments. The model joints statistical evolution of microcracks to effective elastic modulus with microcracks and is applied to predict the damage degree of mortar attacked by sulfate. The experimental results show that the model can predict the modulus variation development of the specimen and the microcraks density. The elastic modulus values calculated by the model are consistent with that measured by experiments. The model focuses on nucleation of microcracks and finds that the theoretical results of microcracks number density show a linear growth over time in mortar. Compared with other sulfate attack damage model, this model provides a more suitable damage evolution equation that can be used to analyze the chemically assisted damage."
Coexistence of Bipolar and Unipolar Resistive Switching Behavior in Ag/ZnMn2O4/p+-Si Device,"ZnMn2O4 thin films were deposited by a sol-gel technique onto a p+-Si substrate, and a RRAM device with the Ag/ZnMn2O4/p+-Si structure was fabricated. The microstructure of ZnMn2O4 films and the resistive switching behavior of Ag/ZnMn2O4/p+-Si device were investigated. ZnMn2O4 thin films had a spinel structure after annealing at 650 °C for 1 h. The Ag/ZnMn2O4/p+-Si device showed unipolar and/or bipolar resistive switching behavior, exhibiting different ION/IOFF ratio and switching endurance properties. In bipolar resistive switching, high-resistance-state (HRS) conduction was dominated by the space-charge-limited conduction mechanism, whereas the filament conduction mechanism dictated the low resistance state (LRS). For unipolar resistive switching, HRS and LRS were controlled by the filament conduction mechanism. For bipolar resistive switching, the conduction process can be explained by the space-charge region of the p-n junction."
Microstructure and Properties of a Low Carbon Ti-V Microalloyed Steel,"Due to the largely inhomogeneous deformation among constituent phases, the advanced high-strength multi-phase steels are always facing challenges when applied to automotive parts where local formability is critically required. In this work, two characteristic microstructures were produced from a low carbon Ti-V microalloyed steel by varying the cooling path. In the ferrite single-phase microstructure resulted from “ultra-fast cooling (UFC) + furnace-cooling (FC)”, the hole-expanding ratio of 200% and tensile strength of 647 MPa were achieved. In the ferrite-bainite-martensite (F+B+M) multi-phase microstructure produced by “UFC + air-cooling (AC) + UFC”, the ferrite has been strengthened by Ti-V carbides to promote the strain partitioning, which resulted in the tensile strength of ≥780MPa, a moderate elongation and hole-expanding ratio of 93%. The strengthening contributions of Ti-V carbides were calculated to be 126MPa and 149MPa in the ferrite single-phase and F+B+M multi-phase microstructure, respectively."
Effect of Silver Element on Microstructure and Properties of W-30Cu/TiC Composites,"W-30wt%Cu and TiC-50wt%Ag were successfully synthesized by a novel simplified pretreatment followed by electroless plating. The 0wt% TiC, 0.5wt% TiC, and 0.5wt%TiC-0.5wt%Ag composite powders were added to W-30wt%Cu composite powders by blending, and then reduced. The reduced W-30Cu, W-30Cu/0.5TiC, and W-30Cu-0.5Ag/0.5TiC composite powders were then compacted and sintered at 1 300 °C in protective hydrogen for 60 min. The phase and morphology of the composite powders and materials were analyzed using X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The relative density, electrical conductivity, and hardness of the sintered samples were examined. Results showed that W-30Cu and TiC-Ag composite powders with uniform structure were obtained using simplified pretreatment followed by electroless plating. The addition of TiC particles can significantly increase the compressive strength and hardness of the W-30Cu composite material but decrease the electrical conductivity. Next, 0.5wt% Ag was added to prepare W-30Cu-0.5Ag/TiC composites with excellent electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity of these composites (61.2%) is higher than that in the national standard (the imaginary line denotes electrical conductivity of GB IACS 42%) of 45.7%."
Characterization of Stress Concentration by Tangential Component Hp(x) of Metal Magnetic Memory Signals,"The correlation between the stress concentration and the spontaneous magnetic signals of metal magnetic memory (MMM) was investigated via tensile tests. Sheet specimens of the Q235 steel were machined into standard bars with rectangular holes to obtain various stress concentration factors. The tangential component Hp(x) of MMM signals and its related magnetic characteristic parameters throughout the loading process were presented and analyzed. It is found that the tangential component Hp(x) is sensitive to the abnormal magnetic changes caused by the local stress concentration in the defect area. The minimum magnetic field is positively correlated to the magnitude of the load and the distance from the notch. The tangential magnetic stress concentration factor presents good numerical stability during the entire loading process, and can be used to evaluate the stress concentration factor. The results obtained will be a complement to the MMM technique."
Relation of Damage Variable and Gas Permeability Coefficient of Concrete under Stress,"Compressive stress and tensile stress were applied to concrete specimens using test rigs designed by RILEM TC 246-TDC. Ultrasonic wave velocity and autoclam permeability system were used to characterize the damage variable and gas permeability coefficient of concrete, respectively. The experimental results show that the strain value of concrete increases with the increasing of stress level and loading time. The damage variable and gas permeability coefficient of concrete under compressive stress decrease at first and increase after a threshold value between 0 and 0.6. When the concrete is under tensile load, the damage variable and gas permeability coefficient increase with tensile stress, with a significant increase from 0.3 to 0.6 tensile stress. There is a strong linear relationship between the damage variable and the gas permeability coefficient, suggesting both as good indicators to characterize the damage of concrete under stress."
Exponential time differencing schemes for the 3-coupled nonlinear fractional Schrödinger equation,Two modified exponential time differencing schemes based on the Fourier spectral method are developed to solve the 3-coupled nonlinear fractional Schrödinger equation. We compare the stability of the schemes by plotting their stability regions. The local truncation errors of the time integrators are proved to be fourth-order. Numerical experiments illustrating the solution to the equations with various parameters and the mass conservation results of the numerical methods are carried out.
Performance Evaluation of CFRP Reinforced Concrete Members Utilizing Fuzzy Technique,"Aging and structural deterioration under severe environments are major causes of damage in reinforced concrete (RC) structures, such as buildings and bridges. Degradations such as concrete cracks, corrosion of steel, and deformation of structural members can significantly degrade the structural performance and safety. Therefore, effective and easy-to-use methods are desired for repairing and strengthening such concrete structures. Various methods for the strengthening and rehabilitation of RC structures have been developed over the past several decades. Recently, FRP composite materials have emerged as a cost-effective alternative to conventional materials for repairing, strengthening, and retrofitting deteriorating/deficient concrete structures, by externally bonding FRP laminates to concrete structural members. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the FRP retrofit for circular type concrete columns under the framework of the  adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Retrofit ratio, strength of existing concrete, thickness, number of layer, stiffness, ultimate strength of fiber, and size of specimens are used as input parameters to predict strength, strain, and stiffness of the post-yielding modulus. These proposed ANFIS models show reliable increased accuracy in predicting the constitutive properties of concrete retrofitted by FRP, compared to the constitutive models suggested by other researchers."
Optimum Locations of Outriggers in a Concrete Tall Building to Reduce Differential Axial Shortening,"Differential axial shortening (DAS) in a tall building can produce adverse effects on its structural and nonstructural elements. Therefore, DAS should be considered in the design phase and appropriate measures should be taken to reduce its unfavorable effects. In this study, the utilization of outriggers, which has been originally designed to reduce lateral displacements, is proposed to reduce DAS. The optimum locations of outriggers that minimize the maximum DAS are determined by an optimization method. The integrality requirement posed by the outrigger locations, which should be given as integer numbers, is resolved by piecewise quadratic interpolation with discrete analysis results. The proposed optimization method stably yielded optimum solutions for a total of 24 design cases. The optimum design results show that although the maximum DAS decreases as the number of outriggers increases, the maximum DAS does not decrease significantly when the number of outriggers is greater than 2."
A combination of ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction with transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells promotes recovery of acute liver injury,"Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) can provide an additional source of therapeutic stem cells for regeneration of liver cells during acute liver injury (ALI). However, the insufficient hepatic homing by the transplanted BMSCs limits their applications. Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) has been reported to promote the homing of transplanted stem cells into the ischemic myocardium. In this study, we investigated whether UTMD promotes the hepatic homing of BMSCs in ALI rats and evaluated the therapeutic effect."
Proteomics and multivariate modelling reveal sex-specific alterations in distinct regions of human carotid atheroma,"Atherosclerotic lesions are comprised of distinct regions with different proteomic profiles. Men and women develop differences in lesion phenotype, with lesions from women generally being more stable and less prone to rupture. We aimed to investigate the differences in proteomic profiles between sexes, including distinct lesion regions, to identify altered proteins that contribute to these differences observed clinically."
Multiple sign-changing solutions for nonlinear fractional Kirchhoff equations,This paper is concerned with the following nonlinear fractional Kirchhoff equation:
Implications of reconstruction protocol for histo-biological characterisation of breast cancers using FDG-PET radiomics,"The aim of this study is to determine if the choice of the 18F-FDG-PET protocol, especially matrix size and reconstruction algorithm, is of importance to discriminate between immunohistochemical subtypes (luminal versus non-luminal) in breast cancer with textural features (TFs)."
On the development and studies of nano- and micro-fiber hybridized strain hardened cementitious composite,"In this study, strain hardened cementitious composite is developed by systematically incorporating fibers of two different length scales, viz., PVA fibers (micro-fibers) and CNTs (nano-fibers) to improve the load transfer and crack formation mechanism at their corresponding scales. At first, the influence of individual fibers on the tension associated (axial tension-, fracture- and flexure-) properties is investigated. Then, the composite is developed using hybrid fibers with appropriate dosage to cater the desired performance. The tensile strength, stiffness, strain carrying capacity and fracture energy of the developed composite is found to be improved by almost 2 times, 3 times, 220 times and 130 times respectively to that of the original cement composite. The outstanding performance of the developed composite is resulted from the effective crack bridging and preferred load transfer in micro-scale due to incorporation of (a meagre amount of) hetero fibers of distinctly different length scales. In order to investigate the fracture and crack propagation phenomenon of the developed cementitious composite, Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique is also employed. The findings of this study will lead towards development of multi-performance cementitious composite (MPCC) by tailoring the material to attain the desired level of strength, stiffness and ductility."
Reduced nuclear DNA methylation and mitochondrial transcript changes in adenomas do not associate with mtDNA methylation,"Altered mitochondrial function and large-scale changes to DNA methylation patterns in the nuclear genome are both hallmarks of colorectal cancer (CRC). Mitochondria have multiple copies of a 16 kb circular genome that contains genes that are vital for their function. While DNA methylation is known to alter the nuclear genome in CRC, it is not clear whether it could have a similar influence in mtDNA; indeed, currently, the issue of whether mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) methylation occurs is controversial. Thus our goal here was to determine whether the methylation state of mtDNA is linked to mitochondrial gene transcription in colorectal adenomas, and to assess its suitability as a biomarker in CRC."
Adjusting for BMI in analyses of volumetric mammographic density and breast cancer risk,"Fully automated assessment of mammographic density (MD), a biomarker of breast cancer risk, is being increasingly performed in screening settings. However, data on body mass index (BMI), a confounder of the MD–risk association, are not routinely collected at screening. We investigated whether the amount of fat in the breast, as captured by the amount of mammographic non-dense tissue seen on the mammographic image, can be used as a proxy for BMI when data on the latter are unavailable."
A case report and literature review: previously excluded tuberculosis masked by amiodarone induced lung injury,"Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug which is used to treat and prevent several dysrhythmias. This includes ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, wide complex tachycardia, as well as atrial fibrillation (AF) and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Amiodarone may prove to be the agent of choice where the patient is hemodynamically unstable and unsuitable for direct current (DC) cardioversion. Although, it is not recommended for long-term use. The physician might encounter issues when differentiating amiodarone-induced lung toxicity with suspicion of interstitial lung disease, cancer or vasculitis. Adverse drug reactions are difficult to confirm and it leads to serious problems of pharmacotherapy."
Effect of Beam Current and Diameter on Electron Probe Microanalysis of Carbonate Minerals,"The effect of operating conditions on the time-dependent X-ray intensity variation is of great importance for the optimal EPMA conditions for accurate determinations of various elements in carbonate minerals. Beam diameters of 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 μm, and beam currents of 3, 5, 10, 20, and 50 nA were tested. Ca, Mg, Zn, and Sr were found to be more sensitive to electron beam irradiation as compared to other elements, and small currents and large beam diameters minimized the time-dependent X-ray intensity variations. We determined the optimal EPMA operating conditions for elements in carbonate: 10 μm and 5 nA for calcite; 10 μm and 10 nA for dolomite; 5 μm and 10 nA or 10 μm and 20 nA for strontianite; and 20 nA and 5 μm for other carbonate. Elements sensitive to electron beam irradiation should be determined first. In addition, silicate minerals are preferred as standards rather than carbonate minerals."
Adipose stem cell crosstalk with chemo-residual breast cancer cells: implications for tumor recurrence,"Most triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients exhibit an incomplete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, resulting in chemo-residual tumor cells that drive tumor recurrence and patient mortality. Accordingly, strategies for eliminating chemo-residual tumor cells are urgently needed. Although stromal cells contribute to tumor cell invasion, to date, their ability to influence chemo-residual tumor cell behavior has not been examined. Our study is the first to investigate cross-talk between adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and chemo-residual TNBC cells. We examine if ASCs promote chemo-residual tumor cell proliferation, having implications for tumor recurrence."
Seasonal changes in foraminiferal assemblages along environmental gradients in Adventfjorden (West Spitsbergen),"Foraminifera are numerically abundant components of the benthic fauna; thus, they are very important compounds in glaciomarine environments. However, ongoing oceanographic changes may influence their distribution, abundances and diversity differently at different times of the year. In the present study, we aimed to assess seasonal environmental changes in an Arctic fjord (Adventfjorden, W Spitsbergen) and the structure and distribution of benthic foraminiferal assemblages during four seasons (January, May, August, November). The study revealed that the benthic foraminiferal assemblages in Adventfjorden are susceptible to environmental changes related to enhanced inflow of shelf-transformed water (STW). We distinguished three zones in the fjord: (1) the deeper outer part influenced by STW, with living specimens staying in the few uppermost layers of sediment, (2) the shallower interior influenced by freshwater outflows and high sediment load, resulting in the dominance of opportunistic glaciomarine taxa constantly buried in the sediment, and (3) the central part, where the seasonal variation in the foraminifera assemblage reflects the interplay between the influence of riverine inputs and STW. Our study also revealed that the presence of STW in Adventfjorden favours an early spring appearance of juvenile foraminifera; however, the majority of the specimens are later withered and do not contribute to the summer pool of mature individuals. On the other hand, the majority of the mature specimens can survive during the winter because of sufficient organic matter stocks and year-long ice-free conditions."
Sixteen years of simulated summer and winter warming have contrasting effects on soil mite communities in a sub-Arctic peat bog,"Northern peatlands are very sensitive to changes in climate. Impacts of increased temperatures on hydrology, vegetation structure and soil carbon are already well documented from northern peatlands. In contrast, effects of global warming on soil mites, and seasonal effects in particular, have received less attention, even though soil mites are an important component in ecosystems as they contribute to nutrient dynamics and decomposition. We investigated the impacts of long-term (16 years) experimental seasonal climate manipulations (summer warming, winter warming with snow accumulation, and year-round warming) on oribatid (Oribatida) and mesostigmatid (Mesostigmata) mite communities in a peat bog underlain by discontinuous permafrost, in Abisko, Northern Sweden. We found that (1) Year-round warming treatment had neither impact on life-history trait compositions nor on total abundances of oribatid mites, possibly because of opposite effects of summer and winter warming; (2) Small-bodied oribatid mites, in particular those belonging to genera Suctobelba, increased in abundance under the summer warming treatment; (3) The species richness of oribatid mites was negative affected by year-round warming; (4) Mesostigmatid mites, which were not identified to species level, were found to decrease in abundance under year-round warming. Because different mite taxa with different body sizes and diets play distinct roles in carbon and nutrient dynamics, the observed changes in mite communities may impact ecosystem functions in northern peatlands."
Mapping global forest biomass and its changes over the first decade of the 21st century,"Forests played an important role in carbon sequestration during the past two decades. Using a model tree ensemble method (MTE) to regress the seven reflectance bands of EOS-Terra-MODIS satellite data against country level forest biomass carbon density (BCD) of 2001–2005 provided by United Nations’s Forest Resource Assessment (FRA), we developed a global map of forest BCD at 1 km×1 km resolution for both 2001–2005 and 2006–2010. For 2006–2010, the total global forest biomass carbon stock is estimated as 279.6±7.1 Pg C, and the tropical forest biomass carbon stock is estimated as 174.4±5.4 Pg C. During the first decade of the 21st century, we estimated an increase of global forest biomass of 0.28±0.75 Pg C yr−1. Tropical forest biomass carbon stock slightly decreased (−0.31±0.60 Pg C yr−1); by contrast, temperate and boreal forest biomass increased (0.58±0.28 Pg C yr−1) during the same period. Our estimation of the global forest biomass carbon stock and its changes is subject to uncertainties due to lack of extensive ground measurements in the tropics, spatial heterogeneity in large countries, and different definitions of forest. The continuously monitoring of forest biomass carbon stock with MODIS satellite data will provide useful information for detecting forest changes."
Lattice reduction aided belief propagation for massive MIMO detection,"Efficient massive MIMO detection for practical deployment, which is with spatially correlated channel and high-order modulation, is a challenging topic for the fifth generation mobile communication (5G). In this paper, lattice reduction aided belief propagation (LRA-BP) is proposed for massive MIMO detection. LRA-BP applies the message updating rules of Markov random field based belief propagation (MRF-BP) in lattice reduced MIMO system. With the lattice reduced, well-conditioned MIMO channel, LRA-BP obtains better message updating and detection performance in spatially correlated channel than MRF-BP. Log-domain arithmetic is used in LRA-BP for computational complexity reduction. Simulation result shows that LRA-BP outperforms MRF-BP with 3–10 dB in terms of required SNR for 1% packet error rate in spatially correlated channel for 256-QAM. We also show that LRA-BP requires much lower complexity compared with MRF-BP."
Pressure-induced Lifshitz transition in the type II Dirac semimetal PtTe2,"Numerous exotic properties have been discovered in Dirac Semimetals (DSMs) and Weyl Semimetals (WSMs). In a given DSM/ WSM, the Dirac/Weyl nodes usually coexist with other bulk states, making their respective contribution elusive. In this work, we distinguish the role of bulk states from the tilted Dirac nodes on the transport properties in DSMs. Specifically, we applied pressure to a type-II DSM material, PtTe2, and studied its pressure modified electronic and lattice structure systematically by using in situ transport measurements and X-ray diffraction (XRD). A pressure-induced transition at about 20 GPa is revealed in the transport properties, while the layered lattice structure is robust against pressure as illustrated in XRD measurement results. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that this is originated from the Lifshitz transition in the bulk states. Our findings provide evidence to identify the bulk states’ influence on transport from the topologically-protected DSM states in the DSM material."
Liquefaction of Banana Pseudo-stem and Preparation of Polyurethane Adhesive from Liquefied Products,"Banana pseudo-stem was liquefied in the mixture of polyhydric alcohols of polyethylene glycol (PEG400) and glycerol. Hydroxyl value of liquefied products ranged from 294.8 to 370.2 mg KOH/g and \({\bar M_n}\) was about 430. Liquefied products (LBPP) could be used as raw materials for polyurethane by reacting with 4, 4’-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (4, 4’-MDI) and PEG400 to synthesize liquefied product-based polyurethane (LBPP-PU) adhesive. To analyze in depth the creation of urethane linkage among LBPP, PEG400 and 4, 4’-MDI, factors which had effects on the residue content were all investigated. They were characterized by FT-IR and TG. The shear strength of LBPP-PU adhesive was improved when decreasing the percentage of the substitution of PEG400 by LBPP. The adhesive strength was obtained from T-peel of aspen/polyurethane adhesive joints, and the maximum lap shear strength (4.40 MPa) was obtained when 16.70% of LBPP was added to the LBPP & PEG400 system."
Modification on the Performance of the Hemihydrate Gypsum with the Plant Source Polymer of Dry Matcha Powder,"The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using the plant-source polymer of the matcha powder as a composite admixture for hemihydrate gypsum. Hemihydrate gypsum was mixed with different contents of matcha powder, and then the water requirement for the normal consistency, setting times, density, strength, hydration and microstructure of the hardened mixture were evaluated. The experimental results showed that it increased the water requirement for the normal consistency, and it regulated the setting times and reduced the density. Hemihydrate gypsum with more matcha powder had the higher water requirement, longer setting times and lower density. Less than 1% matcha powder had slight impact on the strength of hardened paste, but more than 1% matcha powder had a remarkable one. Matcha powder changed the hydration process and prolonged the induction and acceleration period. Small needlelike crystals were transformed into longer, larger and thicker ones as more matcha powder was mixed. This case is closely related to the prolongation of the induction and acceleration period. Besides, more and larger pores were observed in the hardened paste with more matcha powder. It is attributed to the appearances of the tea polyphenol in matcha powder and the larger and longer crystal morphology in hardened paste as well as the high water requirement for the normal consistency. These results are important to the application of matcha powder as a composite admixture for the hemihydrate gypsum as well as the prosperity and development of the tea industry."
SPES/PVDF Binary Membrane as an Alternative Proton Exchange Membrane in Vanadium Redox Flow Battery Application,"SPES/PVDF blends were employed to prepare the ion exchange membranes for vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) application for the first time. The addition of the highly crystalline and hydrophobic PVDF effectively limited the swelling behavior of SPES. The vanadium ion permeability of SPES/PVDF membranes was one order of magnitude lower than that of Nafion117 membrane and pristine SPES membrane. Single cells with SPES/PVDF composite membranes showed significantly lower capacity loss, higher coulombic efficiency and higher energy efficiency than that with Nafion117 and pristine SPES membranes. The blend membrane with 40wt% of PVDF (denoted as S0.6P0.4) showed energy efficiency of 83.2% at 30 mA∙cm-2, which was superior to that of the Nafion117 and SPES membranes. In the self-discharge test, S0.6P0.4 membrane showed twice longer duration in open circuit decay than that with Nafion117 membrane. With all the good properties and low cost, the SPES/PVDF membranes are expected to have excellent commercial prospects as ion exchange membranes for VRB system."
Experimental and Numerical Analysis of Restrained Early Age Cracking based on Electrical Resistivity Using Eccentric Sample,"Crack potential and hydration processes of the cement pastes were monitored using an up-to-date eccentric steel cracking frame (ESCF), associated with the non-contact electrical resistivity apparatus, independently. The objective of employing the ESCF is to give a new method determining cracks of concrete at early age. The findings indicate that the lowest water-cement ratio paste reveals highest resistivity values, compasses an earlier inflection point and obtained higher stress. The eccentric restrained cracking test exhibited that lower water-cement ratio paste cracked at the earliest time, accordingly confirms cracking tendency is the highest. Tensile strength test and stresses utilizing ABAQUS simulation was performed. The crack initiation ages obtained are consistent with the experimental program results, which indicates that ABAQUS numerical analysis can well be utilized to predict the crack tendency of cement."
Isothermal Oxidation Kinetics of Artificial Magnetite Pellets,"In order to establish the kinetics of oxidation of artificial magnetite pellets, we comprehensively studied kinetics of the oxidation of artificial magnetite pellets from low temperature to high temperature using chemical analysis. The results show that when the oxidation temperature is below 1 073 K (800 °C), the reaction is controlled by the step of internal diffusion, and the model function is 2 G(a) = 1−3(1−x)2/3 + 2(1−x) (α, reaction degree). When the temperature is above 1 073 K (800 °C), the reaction mechanism was chemical reaction, and the model function is 1 G(a) = 1−(1−x)1/3. The apparent activation energy for the oxidation of artificial magnetite pellets was also determined, which was 8.90 kJ/mol for the low temperature and 67.79 kJ/mol for the high temperature. Based on the derived kinetic equation for the oxidation of artificial magnetite pellets, the calculated value is consistent with the experimental data. Compared with that of nature magnetite pellets, the apparent activation energy is decreased obviously, which indicates that the artificial magnetite pellets are oxidized more easily than nature magnetite pellets."
Supercolonial structure of invasive populations of the tawny crazy ant Nylanderia fulva in the US,"Social insects are among the most serious invasive pests in the world, particularly successful at monopolizing environmental resources to outcompete native species and achieve ecological dominance. The invasive success of some social insects is enhanced by their unicolonial structure, under which the presence of numerous queens and the lack of aggression against non-nestmates allow high worker densities, colony growth, and survival while eliminating intra-specific competition. In this study, we investigated the population genetics, colony structure and levels of aggression in the tawny crazy ant, Nylanderia fulva, which was recently introduced into the United States from South America."
Testing the devil’s impact on southern Baltic and North Sea basins whitefish (Coregonus spp.) diversity,"The diversity and phylogeny of whitefish of the genus Coregonus is complex, and includes many endemic species of high conservation concern. However, because of commercial importance of whitefish fisheries, stockings and translocations have occurred repeatedly, which challenges the identification of local populations as conservation units. This study analyses the phylogenetic relationships of 15 contemporary and two historical populations of lake-resident and anadromous whitefish (Coregonus spp.) from the southern Baltic and North Sea basins. We elucidated the complex history of Lake Schaal (northern Germany) whitefish, for which a local tale suggests that the devil threw whitefish from the Central European Lake Constance into this lake. Studies from the early twentieth century indeed suggested numerous stocking events for Lake Schaal from Lake Constance, from Estonian/Russian Lake Peipsi and from the anadromous whitefish of the Baltic Sea."
Large-scale spatial population synthesis for Denmark,"The recent development in micro-based transport models is a major step towards an improved understanding of transport demand and its underlying drivers. By adapting a detailed geographical resolution level and a fine-grained social description of individuals it becomes possible to investigate distribution effects across social classes and geographical spaces, elements which were not possible to take into account until recently. However, the increasing amount of details comes at a cost. As the prediction-space is enlarged, models become increasingly dependent on the quality of inputs and exogenous model assumptions of which the formation of synthetic population forecasts is by far the most important one. The paper presents a coherent description of a large-scale population synthesis framework involving all relevant steps in the synthesis stages from target harmonisation, matrix fitting, post simulation of households and agents and reweighting of the final population. The model is implemented in the Danish National Transport Model and is aimed at predicting the entire Danish population at a very detailed spatial and social level. In the paper we offer some insight with respect to the propagation of sampling noise caused by the household simulation stage and a brief validation of the model when comparing a modelled 2015 population with observed data."
"Detrital-zircon geochronology and Hf isotope of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks in the Jilin Province, NE China: tectonic significance for microcontinental blocks of eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt","We undertook U-Pb-Hf isotope testing of detrital zircons from Late Paleozoic sedimentary rocks in the Jilin Province, NE China, with the aim of constraining the tectonic evolution of eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt. The age populations of the detrital zircons from the sandstone of the Jiefangcun Formation in the Songliao Block are ~2234, ~1782, ~1030–921, ~817, ~540, and ~381–254 Ma, whereas those of the zircons from the greywacke of the Permian Kedao Formation in the Songliao Block yield are ~2436, ~1905, ~1692, 1146–1170, ~554–498, and ~342–255 Ma. Combined Hf isotope characteristics, these ages reveal that: (1) rocks from the Jiefangcun and Kedao formations were deposited after 254 and 255 Ma, respectively; (2) these formations were sourced mainly from the Songliao Block and the Jiamus Terrane in the eastern CAOB and to a lesser amount, from the northern margin of the NCC; and (3) it appears that several remnants of ancient Precambrian basement occur adjacent to these Late Paleozoic strata that occur within the microcontinental blocks. Detrital zircons from the silty sandstone of the Miaoling Formation in the western margin of the Khanka Terrane yield peak age populations of 508–476, 463–396, and 348–258 Ma, having similar εHf(t) values to those obtained from zircons within the Jiamusi Terrane. These data indicate that (1) deposition of the Miaoling Formation in the western margin of the Khanka Terrane had started by 258 Ma, and (2) these sediments were sourced mainly from the Jiamusi Terrane and local magmatic rocks. The widespread occurrence of detrital zircons with ages of 480–550 Ma and positive εHf(t) values within the Late Paleozoic strata in the Songliao Block and the Jiamusi–Khanka Terrane, indicates that the amalgamation of these blocks took place during the middle stage of the Paleozoic, probably after the Silurian, prior to the Late Permian."
"Mediterraneibacter butyricigenes sp. nov., a butyrate-producing bacterium isolated from human faeces","A Gram-stain-positive, obligately anaerobic, non-motile, nonspore-forming, and rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated KGMB01110T, was isolated from a faecal sample of a healthy male in South Korea. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene showed that strain KGMB01110T belonged to Clostridium cluster XIVa and was most closely related to Mediterraneibacter glycyrrhizinilyticus KCTC 5760T (95.9% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). The DNA G + C content of strain KGMB01110T based on its whole genome sequence was 44.1 mol%. The major cellular fatty acids (> 10%) of the isolate were C14:0 and C16:0. The strain KGMB01110T was positive for arginine dihydrolase, β-galactosidase-6-phosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase. The strain KGMB01110T also produced acid from D-glucose and D-rhamnose, and hydrolyzed gelatin and aesculin. Furthermore, HPLC analysis and UV-tests of culture supernatant revealed that the strain KGMB01110T produced butyrate as the major end product of glucose fermentation. Based on the phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics, strain KGMB01110T represent a novel species of the genus Mediterraneibacter in the family Lachnospiraceae. The type strain is KGMB01110T (= KCTC 15684T = CCUG 72830T)."
Effect of biological activated carbon filter depth and backwashing process on transformation of biofilm community,"The biological activated carbon (BAC) is a popular advanced water treatment to the provision of safe water supply. A bench–scale device was designed to gain a better insight into microbial diversity and community structure of BAC biofilm by using high–throughput sequencing method. Both samples of BAC biofilm (the first, third and fifth month) and water (inlet water and outlet water of carbon filter, outlet water of backwashing) were analyzed to evaluate the impact of carbon filter depth, running time and backwash process. The results showed that the microbial diversity of biofilm decreased generally with the increase of carbon filter depth and biofilm reached a steady–state at the top layer of BAC after three months’ running. Proteobacteria (71.02%–95.61%) was found to be dominant bacteria both in biofilms and water samples. As one of opportunistic pathogen, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the outlet water of device (1.20%) was about eight times higher than that in the inlet water of device (0.16%) at the genus level after five–month operation. To maintain the safety of drinking water, the backwash used in this test could significantly remove Sphingobacteria (from 8.69% to 5.09%, p<0.05) of carbon biofilm. After backwashing, the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) number and the Shannon index decreased significantly (p<0.05) at the bottom of carbon column and we found the Proteobacteria increased by about 10% in all biofilm samples from different filter depth. This study reveals the transformation of BAC biofilm with the impact of running time and backwashing."
Bone Fracture Acute Phase Response—A Unifying Theory of Fracture Repair: Clinical and Scientific Implications,"Bone fractures create five problems that must be resolved: bleeding, risk of infection, hypoxia, disproportionate strain, and inability to bear weight. There have been enormous advancements in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that resolve these problems after fractures, and in best clinical practices of repairing fractures. We put forth a modern, comprehensive model of fracture repair that synthesizes the literature on the biology and biomechanics of fracture repair to address the primary problems of fractures. This updated model is a framework for both fracture management and future studies aimed at understanding and treating this complex process. This model is based upon the fracture acute phase response (APR), which encompasses the molecular mechanisms that respond to injury. The APR is divided into sequential stages of “survival” and “repair.” Early in convalescence, during “survival,” bleeding and infection are resolved by collaborative efforts of the hemostatic and inflammatory pathways. Later, in “repair,” avascular and biomechanically insufficient bone is replaced by a variable combination of intramembranous and endochondral ossification. Progression to repair cannot occur until survival has been ensured. A disproportionate APR—either insufficient or exuberant—leads to complications of survival (hemorrhage, thrombosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, infection, death) and/or repair (delayed- or non-union). The type of ossification utilized for fracture repair is dependent on the relative amounts of strain and vascularity in the fracture microenvironment, but any failure along this process can disrupt or delay fracture healing and result in a similar non-union. Therefore, incomplete understanding of the principles herein can result in mismanagement of fracture care or application of hardware that interferes with fracture repair. This unifying model of fracture repair not only informs clinicians how their interventions fit within the framework of normal biological healing but also instructs investigators about the critical variables and outputs to assess during a study of fracture repair."
Evaluation of Japanese potatoes using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),"An understanding of the genetic diversity and structure of a breeding population is fundamental information for breeders to develop strategies for variety improvement. The genetic diversity of 250 diverse North American potatoes was previously characterized using an 8K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. In this study, using a 12K SNP array, 164 Japanese potatoes including 70 breeding clones for chip processing were characterized and compared with North American and European potatoes. A cluster analysis using 5972 polymorphic SNP loci grouped recently released Japanese chip processing varieties and breeding clones with North American and European chip processing varieties. The other Japanese potatoes, including those for starch processing, were not clearly differentiated to specific market types. A unique group of double-cropping varieties was identified, suggesting that strong selection pressure was applied to the cultivation system (spring-season product is used for fall-season cropping). The inter-populational distance between Japanese and foreign genotypes (mean Euclidean distance of 48.4) was significantly lower than the within-populational distance of foreign genotypes (49.3), indicating that the Japanese potatoes are not uniquely differentiated but are included within the genetic diversity of foreign genotypes. This study demonstrates the usefulness of SNP array technology for performing a cost-effective, robust and direct comparison of genetic diversity among different gene pools."
Bring your own hand: how a single sensor is bringing multiple biometrics together,"In spite of innumerable benefits of multi-biometry authentication, a couple of imaging sensors are required to capture multi-biometric samples, but that increase the overall cost as well as degree of user cooperation. This work presents a single sensor-based multimodal biometric identification system by fusing major finger knuckle, minor finger knuckle, palm print and handprint features of the human hand for enhancing the security and privacy of any consumer device. A virtual imaging device has been suggested to capture palmer and dorsal view of hand with single-shot multi-trait acquisition mechanism. The hand images captured from digital camera are first preprocessed to get the major knuckle, minor knuckle and palm ROI’s. The finger knuckles and palm print ROI’s are then enhanced and transformed to illumination invariant representation using robust encoding techniques, over which ray tracing features are emphasized predominantly. A non-rigid multi-scale approach, namely deep matching, has been employed to obtain the matching score between the corresponding correlation maps for finger knuckle or palm print recognition. Apart from that, we present a new scheme to extract shape, and geometrical features of handprint and employ metric learning-based L2-norm for feature matching in \(2D^{2}{} \textit{PCA}+2D^{2}{} \textit{LDA}\) space. Five publicly available databases are used to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed approach. Finally, the score-level weighted sum rule fusion has been adopted to combine matching scores of four traits which show that the proposed method outperforms other unimodal and state-of-the-art multimodal identification methods in terms of EER (0.01%), DI (3.64) and CRR (100%)."
The impact of rural-urban community settings on cognitive decline: results from a nationally-representative sample of seniors in China,"Aging and rural-urban disparities are two major social problems in today’s ever-developing China. Much of the existing literature has supported a negative association between adverse community setting with the cognitive functioning of seniors, but very few studies have empirically investigated the impact of rural-urban community settings on cognitive decline in the late life course of the population in developing countries."
The generation of consensus guidelines for carrying out process evaluations in rehabilitation research,"Although in recent years there has been a strong increase in published research on theories (e.g. realist evaluation, normalization process theory) driving and guiding process evaluations of complex interventions, there is limited guidance to help rehabilitation researchers design and carry out process evaluations. This can lead to the risk of process evaluations being unsystematic. This paper reports on the development of new consensus guidelines that address the specific challenges of conducting process evaluations alongside clinical trials of rehabilitation interventions."
"Non-Impact Origin of the Baisha Structure in Hainan Province, China","The Baisha Structure, with a rim-to-rim diameter of ~3.7 km, in the center of the Hainan Province, southern China has been considered to be an impact crater. Field investigation and petrological study are presented in this paper to investigate the impact hypothesis for this structure. The ~600-m-thick Lower Cretaceous feldspathic quartz sandstones from the Lumuwan Formation are the major outcrops both within and outside of the structure. The amphitheater-shaped rim of the structure is composed of granite porphyries that are intruded in the Lumuwan Formation. Previously interpreted impact breccia and impact melt rocks are actually granite porphyries different cooling rates and weathering status. Rocks from locations that most likely have recorded shock metamorphic signatures are sampled, but petrographic analyses reveal no indications of shock metamorphism. While subtle structural deformation occurs at the contact boundary between the granite porphyries and the feldspathic quartz sandstones, the feldspathic quartz sandstones exhibit uniformed dipping strata across the crater floor and walls. All the evidence suggests that the Baisha Structure was not formed by impact cratering. It most likely has been shaped by a combination of magmatic intrusion and long-term differential erosion."
"An Upper Crustal Ophiolite Remnant within the Feather River Ultramafic Belt, California: Tectonomagmatic Origins and Implications for Its Evolution","The 150-km-long Feather River ultramafic belt (FRB) of the northern Sierra Nevada, California, consists of serpentinized ultramafic rocks, gabbroic rocks, with lesser amounts of amphibolitic rocks. The gabbroic rocks contain metagabbro and dikes within it. Based on the electron microprobe analyses, the metagabbro consists of typical igneous composition for clinopyroxene and early hornblende, indicating that they bear low grade metamorphism. The gabbroic rocks show Nb and Ta depletion in primitive-mantle normalized plots that is similar to typical island arc rocks. We present that the metagabbro within the ultramafic rocks is forming in the suprasubduction zone setting. Tectonic models are presented for the metagabbro and amphibolitic rocks in FRB. The low P burial metamorphism of the upper plate metagabbro and the high grade amphibolitic rocks are typical of relationships of upper plate ophiolites to metamorphic soles. The amphibolitic rocks record as metamorphic sole forming during subduction initiation beneath the ultramafic rocks and metagabbro. The unusual and protracted tectonic history of the FRB is similar to other ophiolite belts of the Cordillera of California but differs in the lack of crustal rocks."
Spotted fever rickettsioses causing myocarditis and ARDS: a case from Sri Lanka,Spotted fever group of rickettsial infections are emerging in Sri Lanka.

A genome wide SNP genotyping study in the Tunisian population: specific reporting on a subset of common breast cancer risk loci,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Around 50% of breast cancer familial risk has been so far explained by known susceptibility alleles with variable levels of risk and prevalence. The vast majority of these breast cancer associated variations reported to date are from populations of European ancestry. In spite of its heterogeneity and genetic wealth, North-African populations have not been studied by the HapMap and the 1000Genomes projects. Thus, very little is known about the genetic architecture of these populations."
KRas4B-PDE6δ complex stabilization by small molecules obtained by virtual screening affects Ras signaling in pancreatic cancer,"The GTPase KRas4B has been utilized as a principal target in the development of anticancer drugs. PDE6δ transports KRas4B to the plasma membrane, where it is released to activate various signaling pathways required for the initiation and maintenance of cancer. Therefore, identifying new small molecules that prevent activation of this GTPase by stabilizing the KRas4B-PDE6δ molecular complex is a practical strategy to fight against cancer."

Twelve-month effect of chronic pain self-management intervention delivered in an easily accessible primary healthcare service - a randomised controlled trial,"To investigate the effects after twelve months related to patient activation and a range of secondary outcomes on persons with chronic pain of a chronic pain self-management course compared to a low-impact outdoor physical activity, delivered in an easily accessible healthcare service in public primary care."
Quality and safety of in-hospital care for acute medical patients at weekends: a qualitative study,"The increased mortality risk associated with weekend admission to hospital (the ‘weekend effect’) has been reported across many health systems. More recently research has focused on causal mechanisms. Variations in the organisation and delivery of in-hospital care between weekends and weekdays have been identified, but this is not always to the detriment of weekend admissions, and the impact on mortality is uncertain. The insights of frontline staff and patients have been neglected. This article reports a qualitative study of patients and clinicians, to explore their views on quality and safety of care at weekends."
Sociodemographic and disease-related determinants of return to work among women with breast cancer: a German longitudinal cohort study,"Return to work (RTW) is a key parameter of outcome quality that ensures social participation. Therefore, this study analyses the sociodemographic and disease-related determinants of RTW among newly diagnosed breast cancer patients."
Evidence on the effectiveness of health literacy interventions in the EU: a systematic review,"In the last decade, the attention for health literacy has increased in the European Union. This is due to three main reasons. First, reviews have shown that inadequate health literacy is associated with worse health outcomes, higher health care use and expenditure. Second, in all European countries the population is aging and the number of chronically ill people is rising. Improving health literacy in this group can offer greater opportunities to take an active part in society, be independent and improve quality of life. Third, since most research on health literacy has been conducted outside Europe and relatively little is known about the development of health literacy interventions and its effects on outcome measures in European countries. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence on the effectiveness of health literacy interventions in the European Union published between 1995 and 2018."
Perceived strain of undergraduate medical students during a simulated first day of residency,Residents face demanding situations on the job and have been found to perceive high levels of strain.

The ethnicity attainment gap among medical and biomedical science students: a qualitative study,"Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) medical students and professionals frequently underachieve when compared with their White counterparts not only in the United Kingdom, but across the globe. There is no consensus for the definitive causes of this attainment gap, but suggestions contributing towards it include: increased feelings of isolation as a member of a minority culture or religion; a poorer higher education (HE) experience compared with White counterparts; and stereotype threat, whereby students underperform in exams from the stresses of fearing confirming to a negative-stereotype."
The ethical experiences of trainees on short-term international trips: a systematic qualitative synthesis,"Medical student and resident participation in short-term international trips for trainees (STINTTs) has increased in the past few decades.

Big data hurdles in precision medicine and precision public health,"Nowadays, trendy research in biomedical sciences juxtaposes the term ‘precision’ to medicine and public health with companion words like big data, data science, and deep learning. Technological advancements permit the collection and merging of large heterogeneous datasets from different sources, from genome sequences to social media posts or from electronic health records to wearables. Additionally, complex algorithms supported by high-performance computing allow one to transform these large datasets into knowledge. Despite such progress, many barriers still exist against achieving precision medicine and precision public health interventions for the benefit of the individual and the population."
Measurement of glomerular filtration rate in patients undergoing obesity surgery,"Most studies on obesity surgery have measured renal function using the estimated GFR. However, due to the reduction of muscle mass, and therefore creatinine that accompanies weight loss, such measures can falsely suggest an improvement in renal function. To balance the risks of surgery versus any potential benefits on renal function, we need to be able to determine renal function using valid and reliable methodologies. In this pilot study we aimed to measure renal function in patients with CKD undergoing obesity surgery using the gold standard 51Cr-EDTA GFR clearance methodology which is independent of measures of muscle mass."
A chicken bioreactor for efficient production of functional cytokines,"The global market for protein drugs has the highest compound annual growth rate of any pharmaceutical class but their availability, especially outside of the US market, is compromised by the high cost of manufacture and validation compared to traditional chemical drugs. Improvements in transgenic technologies allow valuable proteins to be produced by genetically-modified animals; several therapeutic proteins from such animal bioreactors are already on the market after successful clinical trials and regulatory approval. Chickens have lagged behind mammals in bioreactor development, despite a number of potential advantages, due to the historic difficulty in producing transgenic birds, but the production of therapeutic proteins in egg white of transgenic chickens would substantially lower costs across the entire production cycle compared to traditional cell culture-based production systems. This could lead to more affordable treatments and wider markets, including in developing countries and for animal health applications."
The effectiveness of colostral antibodies for preventing bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection in vitro,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the causative agent of enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL). The incidence of EBL in Japan is increasing annually; and the cases of EBL in cattle younger than 2 years old has been reported. Therefore, it is vital to find a method to control BLV infection, especially in young calves. In this study, to evaluate the protective ability of colostral antibodies against BLV infection, as well as the potential for BLV infection mediated by colostrum/milk, we investigated temporal fluctuations in the anti-BLV antibody titer and BLV proviral load (PVL) in colostrum/milk and peripheral blood of six infected dams during lactation. The association between PVL and antibody titer in colostrum and peripheral blood was then investigated using samples from a further twenty-seven cattle. Antibody concentrations were measured with a Syncytium-induction Inhibition Assay using colostral/milk whey and serum. PVL in peripheral blood and colostrum was measured by real-time PCR."
Entanglement measures of a new type pseudo-pure state in accelerated frames,"In this work we analyze the characteristics of quantum entanglement of the Dirac field in noninertial reference frames in the context of a new type pseudo-pure state, which is composed of the Bell states. This will help us to understand the relationship between the relativity and quantum information theory. Some states will be changed from entangled states into separable ones around the critical value F = 1/4, but there is no such a critical value for the variable y related to acceleration a. We find that the negativity \({N_{A{B_I}}}\left( {\rho _{A{B_I}}^{{T_A}}} \right)\) increases with F but decreases with the variable y, while the variation of the negativity \({N_{{B_I}{B_{II}}}}\left( {\rho _{{B_I}{B_{II}}}^{{T_{{B_I}}}}} \right)\) is opposite to that of the negativity \({N_{A{B_I}}}\left( {\rho _{A{B_I}}^{{T_A}}} \right)\). We also study the von Neumann entropies S(ρABI) and S(ρBIBII). We find that the S(ρABI) increases with variable y but S(ρBIBII ) is independent of it. However, both S(ρABI) and S(ρBIBII ) first decreases with F and then increases with it. The concurrences C(ρABI) and C(ρBIBII) are also discussed. We find that the former decreases with y while the latter increases with y but both of them first increase with F and then decrease with it."
Bank Switching and Interest Rates: Examining Annual Transfers Between Savings Accounts,"We study the savings transfers between banks by retail depositors. Our sample comprises annual savings account data from the Netherlands for the period from 2004 to 2014. We control for demographic factors and find that the differences in interest rates across savings accounts help explain the extent to which depositors reallocate their savings to either a newly opened or an existing account. The depositors in our sample transfer between 3 and 6% of their savings for each percentage point difference in the interest rates. This effect is robust across various selected samples and model specifications. In addition, we show that depositors transfer a higher proportion of their deposits during the 2008–2009 financial crisis than during non-crisis years. During that crisis, the difference in interest rates remained a highly important determinant of transfer behavior."
Mapping global forest biomass and its changes over the first decade of the 21st century,"Forests played an important role in carbon sequestration during the past two decades. Using a model tree ensemble method (MTE) to regress the seven reflectance bands of EOS-Terra-MODIS satellite data against country level forest biomass carbon density (BCD) of 2001–2005 provided by United Nations’s Forest Resource Assessment (FRA), we developed a global map of forest BCD at 1 km×1 km resolution for both 2001–2005 and 2006–2010. For 2006–2010, the total global forest biomass carbon stock is estimated as 279.6±7.1 Pg C, and the tropical forest biomass carbon stock is estimated as 174.4±5.4 Pg C. During the first decade of the 21st century, we estimated an increase of global forest biomass of 0.28±0.75 Pg C yr−1. Tropical forest biomass carbon stock slightly decreased (−0.31±0.60 Pg C yr−1); by contrast, temperate and boreal forest biomass increased (0.58±0.28 Pg C yr−1) during the same period. Our estimation of the global forest biomass carbon stock and its changes is subject to uncertainties due to lack of extensive ground measurements in the tropics, spatial heterogeneity in large countries, and different definitions of forest. The continuously monitoring of forest biomass carbon stock with MODIS satellite data will provide useful information for detecting forest changes."

Turbulent rectangular compound open channel flow study using multi-zonal approach,"In this paper, an improved Shiono–Knight model (SKM) has been proposed to calculate the rectangular compound open channel flows by considering a multi-zonal (MZ) approach in modelling turbulence and secondary flows across lateral flow direction. This is an effort to represent natural flows with compound shape more closely. The proposed model improves the estimation of secondary flow by original SKM model to increase the accuracy of depth-averaged velocity profile solution formed within the transitional region between different sections (i.e. between main-channel and floodplain) of compound channel. This proposed MZ model works by sectioning intermediate zones between floodplain and main-channel for running computation in order to improve the modelling accuracy. The modelling results have been validated using the experimental data by national UK Flood Channel Facility. It has been proven to work reasonably well to model secondary flows within the investigated compound channel flow cases and hence produce better representation to their flow lateral velocity profile."

The amphibolitic rocks record as metamorphic sole forming during subduction initiation beneath the ultramafic rocks and metagabbro. The unusual and protracted tectonic history of the FRB is similar to other ophiolite belts of the Cordillera of California but differs in the lack of crustal rocks."
"Geochemistry of upper Permian siliceous rocks from the Lower Yangtze region, southeastern China: implications for the origin of chert and Permian ocean chemistry","The Permian Chert Event is of great significance to understanding the geological evolution of the entire Permian; however, the origin of widespread chert formation is debated. We report new geochemical data from deep-marine siliceous rocks of the upper Permian Da-long Formation, Lower Yangtze region, southeastern China. Their geochemical results show that these thin-bedded siliceous rocks have a clear biologic origin, with rare to no evidence of hydrothermal influence. The values of Al/(Al + Fe + Mn) and Eu/Eu* are 0.60–0.84 (mean = 0.72) and 0.45–1.08 (mean = 0.77), respectively, and Mn/Ti ratios are relatively low (mean = 0.72). The correlations of LaN/CeN, LaN/YbN, and Fe2O3/TiO2 with Al2O3/(Al2O3 + Fe2O3), along with the Ce anomaly, indicate that the Da-long siliceous rocks were deposited at a transitional zone between a continental margin and the open ocean; i.e., relatively close to terrestrial sediment input and far from hydrothermal activity. The accumulation of chert is related to its unique paleogeographic location in an equatorial setting with many submarine paleo-highlands. Intense upwelling and frequent local volcanism are the main factors that promoted the development of siliceous rocks in the studied area. Ocean acidification triggered by large-scale volcanism (Large Igneous Province) during the late Permian led to extensive silica precipitation and preservation."
"Detrital-zircon geochronology and Hf isotope of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks in the Jilin Province, NE China: tectonic significance for microcontinental blocks of eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt","We undertook U-Pb-Hf isotope testing of detrital zircons from Late Paleozoic sedimentary rocks in the Jilin Province, NE China, with the aim of constraining the tectonic evolution of eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt. The age populations of the detrital zircons from the sandstone of the Jiefangcun Formation in the Songliao Block are ~2234, ~1782, ~1030–921, ~817, ~540, and ~381–254 Ma, whereas those of the zircons from the greywacke of the Permian Kedao Formation in the Songliao Block yield are ~2436, ~1905, ~1692, 1146–1170, ~554–498, and ~342–255 Ma. Combined Hf isotope characteristics, these ages reveal that: (1) rocks from the Jiefangcun and Kedao formations were deposited after 254 and 255 Ma, respectively; (2) these formations were sourced mainly from the Songliao Block and the Jiamus Terrane in the eastern CAOB and to a lesser amount, from the northern margin of the NCC; and (3) it appears that several remnants of ancient Precambrian basement occur adjacent to these Late Paleozoic strata that occur within the microcontinental blocks. Detrital zircons from the silty sandstone of the Miaoling Formation in the western margin of the Khanka Terrane yield peak age populations of 508–476, 463–396, and 348–258 Ma, having similar εHf(t) values to those obtained from zircons within the Jiamusi Terrane. These data indicate that (1) deposition of the Miaoling Formation in the western margin of the Khanka Terrane had started by 258 Ma, and (2) these sediments were sourced mainly from the Jiamusi Terrane and local magmatic rocks. The widespread occurrence of detrital zircons with ages of 480–550 Ma and positive εHf(t) values within the Late Paleozoic strata in the Songliao Block and the Jiamusi–Khanka Terrane, indicates that the amalgamation of these blocks took place during the middle stage of the Paleozoic, probably after the Silurian, prior to the Late Permian."
"Mediterraneibacter butyricigenes sp. nov., a butyrate-producing bacterium isolated from human faeces","A Gram-stain-positive, obligately anaerobic, non-motile, nonspore-forming, and rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated KGMB01110T, was isolated from a faecal sample of a healthy male in South Korea. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene showed that strain KGMB01110T belonged to Clostridium cluster XIVa and was most closely related to Mediterraneibacter glycyrrhizinilyticus KCTC 5760T (95.9% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). The DNA G + C content of strain KGMB01110T based on its whole genome sequence was 44.1 mol%. The major cellular fatty acids (> 10%) of the isolate were C14:0 and C16:0. The strain KGMB01110T was positive for arginine dihydrolase, β-galactosidase-6-phosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase. The strain KGMB01110T also produced acid from D-glucose and D-rhamnose, and hydrolyzed gelatin and aesculin. Furthermore, HPLC analysis and UV-tests of culture supernatant revealed that the strain KGMB01110T produced butyrate as the major end product of glucose fermentation. Based on the phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics, strain KGMB01110T represent a novel species of the genus Mediterraneibacter in the family Lachnospiraceae. The type strain is KGMB01110T (= KCTC 15684T = CCUG 72830T)."
Bring your own hand: how a single sensor is bringing multiple biometrics together,"In spite of innumerable benefits of multi-biometry authentication, a couple of imaging sensors are required to capture multi-biometric samples, but that increase the overall cost as well as degree of user cooperation. This work presents a single sensor-based multimodal biometric identification system by fusing major finger knuckle, minor finger knuckle, palm print and handprint features of the human hand for enhancing the security and privacy of any consumer device. A virtual imaging device has been suggested to capture palmer and dorsal view of hand with single-shot multi-trait acquisition mechanism. The hand images captured from digital camera are first preprocessed to get the major knuckle, minor knuckle and palm ROI’s. The finger knuckles and palm print ROI’s are then enhanced and transformed to illumination invariant representation using robust encoding techniques, over which ray tracing features are emphasized predominantly. A non-rigid multi-scale approach, namely deep matching, has been employed to obtain the matching score between the corresponding correlation maps for finger knuckle or palm print recognition. Apart from that, we present a new scheme to extract shape, and geometrical features of handprint and employ metric learning-based L2-norm for feature matching in \(2D^{2}{} \textit{PCA}+2D^{2}{} \textit{LDA}\) space. Five publicly available databases are used to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed approach. Finally, the score-level weighted sum rule fusion has been adopted to combine matching scores of four traits which show that the proposed method outperforms other unimodal and state-of-the-art multimodal identification methods in terms of EER (0.01%), DI (3.64) and CRR (100%)."
Bank Switching and Interest Rates: Examining Annual Transfers Between Savings Accounts,"We study the savings transfers between banks by retail depositors. Our sample comprises annual savings account data from the Netherlands for the period from 2004 to 2014. We control for demographic factors and find that the differences in interest rates across savings accounts help explain the extent to which depositors reallocate their savings to either a newly opened or an existing account. The depositors in our sample transfer between 3 and 6% of their savings for each percentage point difference in the interest rates. This effect is robust across various selected samples and model specifications. In addition, we show that depositors transfer a higher proportion of their deposits during the 2008–2009 financial crisis than during non-crisis years. During that crisis, the difference in interest rates remained a highly important determinant of transfer behavior."
Entanglement measures of a new type pseudo-pure state in accelerated frames,"In this work we analyze the characteristics of quantum entanglement of the Dirac field in noninertial reference frames in the context of a new type pseudo-pure state, which is composed of the Bell states. This will help us to understand the relationship between the relativity and quantum information theory. Some states will be changed from entangled states into separable ones around the critical value F = 1/4, but there is no such a critical value for the variable y related to acceleration a. We find that the negativity \({N_{A{B_I}}}\left( {\rho _{A{B_I}}^{{T_A}}} \right)\) increases with F but decreases with the variable y, while the variation of the negativity \({N_{{B_I}{B_{II}}}}\left( {\rho _{{B_I}{B_{II}}}^{{T_{{B_I}}}}} \right)\) is opposite to that of the negativity \({N_{A{B_I}}}\left( {\rho _{A{B_I}}^{{T_A}}} \right)\). We also study the von Neumann entropies S(ρABI) and S(ρBIBII). We find that the S(ρABI) increases with variable y but S(ρBIBII ) is independent of it. However, both S(ρABI) and S(ρBIBII ) first decreases with F and then increases with it. The concurrences C(ρABI) and C(ρBIBII) are also discussed. We find that the former decreases with y while the latter increases with y but both of them first increase with F and then decrease with it."
Effect of biological activated carbon filter depth and backwashing process on transformation of biofilm community,"The biological activated carbon (BAC) is a popular advanced water treatment to the provision of safe water supply. A bench–scale device was designed to gain a better insight into microbial diversity and community structure of BAC biofilm by using high–throughput sequencing method. Both samples of BAC biofilm (the first, third and fifth month) and water (inlet water and outlet water of carbon filter, outlet water of backwashing) were analyzed to evaluate the impact of carbon filter depth, running time and backwash process. The results showed that the microbial diversity of biofilm decreased generally with the increase of carbon filter depth and biofilm reached a steady–state at the top layer of BAC after three months’ running. Proteobacteria (71.02%–95.61%) was found to be dominant bacteria both in biofilms and water samples. As one of opportunistic pathogen, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the outlet water of device (1.20%) was about eight times higher than that in the inlet water of device (0.16%) at the genus level after five–month operation. To maintain the safety of drinking water, the backwash used in this test could significantly remove Sphingobacteria (from 8.69% to 5.09%, p<0.05) of carbon biofilm. After backwashing, the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) number and the Shannon index decreased significantly (p<0.05) at the bottom of carbon column and we found the Proteobacteria increased by about 10% in all biofilm samples from different filter depth. This study reveals the transformation of BAC biofilm with the impact of running time and backwashing."
Evidence on the effectiveness of health literacy interventions in the EU: a systematic review,"In the last decade, the attention for health literacy has increased in the European Union. This is due to three main reasons. First, reviews have shown that inadequate health literacy is associated with worse health outcomes, higher health care use and expenditure. Second, in all European countries the population is aging and the number of chronically ill people is rising. Improving health literacy in this group can offer greater opportunities to take an active part in society, be independent and improve quality of life. Third, since most research on health literacy has been conducted outside Europe and relatively little is known about the development of health literacy interventions and its effects on outcome measures in European countries. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence on the effectiveness of health literacy interventions in the European Union published between 1995 and 2018."

"Small-scale field evaluation of the efficacy and residual effect of Fludora® Fusion (mixture of clothianidin and deltamethrin) against susceptible and resistant Anopheles gambiae populations from Benin, West Africa","In recognition of the threat of insecticide resistance in vectors of malaria, the WHO Global Malaria Programme recommends the development of an appropriate and comprehensive response to insecticide resistance. In principle, good resistance management practice requires the application of multiple insecticides of different modes of action, for example, in rotations and mixtures. Insecticides recommended by the World Health Organization for indoor residual spraying and long-lasting insecticide nets are limited. It is, therefore, judicious to prevent the rapid spread of insecticide resistance by evaluating new insecticides formulations with different modes of action and long residual effect."
The effectiveness of colostral antibodies for preventing bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection in vitro,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the causative agent of enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL). The incidence of EBL in Japan is increasing annually; and the cases of EBL in cattle younger than 2 years old has been reported. Therefore, it is vital to find a method to control BLV infection, especially in young calves. In this study, to evaluate the protective ability of colostral antibodies against BLV infection, as well as the potential for BLV infection mediated by colostrum/milk, we investigated temporal fluctuations in the anti-BLV antibody titer and BLV proviral load (PVL) in colostrum/milk and peripheral blood of six infected dams during lactation. The association between PVL and antibody titer in colostrum and peripheral blood was then investigated using samples from a further twenty-seven cattle. Antibody concentrations were measured with a Syncytium-induction Inhibition Assay using colostral/milk whey and serum. PVL in peripheral blood and colostrum was measured by real-time PCR."
Big data hurdles in precision medicine and precision public health,"Nowadays, trendy research in biomedical sciences juxtaposes the term ‘precision’ to medicine and public health with companion words like big data, data science, and deep learning. Technological advancements permit the collection and merging of large heterogeneous datasets from different sources, from genome sequences to social media posts or from electronic health records to wearables. Additionally, complex algorithms supported by high-performance computing allow one to transform these large datasets into knowledge. Despite such progress, many barriers still exist against achieving precision medicine and precision public health interventions for the benefit of the individual and the population."
Sociodemographic and disease-related determinants of return to work among women with breast cancer: a German longitudinal cohort study,"Return to work (RTW) is a key parameter of outcome quality that ensures social participation.

Quality and safety of in-hospital care for acute medical patients at weekends: a qualitative study,"The increased mortality risk associated with weekend admission to hospital (the ‘weekend effect’) has been reported across many health systems. More recently research has focused on causal mechanisms. Variations in the organisation and delivery of in-hospital care between weekends and weekdays have been identified, but this is not always to the detriment of weekend admissions, and the impact on mortality is uncertain. The insights of frontline staff and patients have been neglected. This article reports a qualitative study of patients and clinicians, to explore their views on quality and safety of care at weekends."

Twelve-month effect of chronic pain self-management intervention delivered in an easily accessible primary healthcare service - a randomised controlled trial,"To investigate the effects after twelve months related to patient activation and a range of secondary outcomes on persons with chronic pain of a chronic pain self-management course compared to a low-impact outdoor physical activity, delivered in an easily accessible healthcare service in public primary care."
A chicken bioreactor for efficient production of functional cytokines,"The global market for protein drugs has the highest compound annual growth rate of any pharmaceutical class but their availability, especially outside of the US market, is compromised by the high cost of manufacture and validation compared to traditional chemical drugs. Improvements in transgenic technologies allow valuable proteins to be produced by genetically-modified animals; several therapeutic proteins from such animal bioreactors are already on the market after successful clinical trials and regulatory approval. Chickens have lagged behind mammals in bioreactor development, despite a number of potential advantages, due to the historic difficulty in producing transgenic birds, but the production of therapeutic proteins in egg white of transgenic chickens would substantially lower costs across the entire production cycle compared to traditional cell culture-based production systems. This could lead to more affordable treatments and wider markets, including in developing countries and for animal health applications."
Multiple interspecific hybridization and microsatellite mutations provide clonal diversity in the parthenogenetic rock lizard Darevskia armeniaca,"The parthenogenetic Caucasian rock lizard Darevskia armeniaca, like most other parthenogenetic vertebrate species, originated through interspecific hybridization between the closely related sexual Darevskia mixta and Darevskia valentini. Darevskia armeniaca was shown to consist of one widespread allozyme clone and a few rare ones, but notwithstanding the origin of clonal diversity remains unclear. We conduct genomic analysis of D. armeniaca and its parental sexual species using microsatellite and SNP markers to identify the origin of parthenogenetic clonal lineages."
Large-scale spatial population synthesis for Denmark,"The recent development in micro-based transport models is a major step towards an improved understanding of transport demand and its underlying drivers. By adapting a detailed geographical resolution level and a fine-grained social description of individuals it becomes possible to investigate distribution effects across social classes and geographical spaces, elements which were not possible to take into account until recently. However, the increasing amount of details comes at a cost. As the prediction-space is enlarged, models become increasingly dependent on the quality of inputs and exogenous model assumptions of which the formation of synthetic population forecasts is by far the most important one. The paper presents a coherent description of a large-scale population synthesis framework involving all relevant steps in the synthesis stages from target harmonisation, matrix fitting, post simulation of households and agents and reweighting of the final population. The model is implemented in the Danish National Transport Model and is aimed at predicting the entire Danish population at a very detailed spatial and social level. In the paper we offer some insight with respect to the propagation of sampling noise caused by the household simulation stage and a brief validation of the model when comparing a modelled 2015 population with observed data."
Bone Fracture Acute Phase Response—A Unifying Theory of Fracture Repair: Clinical and Scientific Implications,"Bone fractures create five problems that must be resolved: bleeding, risk of infection, hypoxia, disproportionate strain, and inability to bear weight. There have been enormous advancements in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that resolve these problems after fractures, and in best clinical practices of repairing fractures. We put forth a modern, comprehensive model of fracture repair that synthesizes the literature on the biology and biomechanics of fracture repair to address the primary problems of fractures. This updated model is a framework for both fracture management and future studies aimed at understanding and treating this complex process. This model is based upon the fracture acute phase response (APR), which encompasses the molecular mechanisms that respond to injury. The APR is divided into sequential stages of “survival” and “repair.” Early in convalescence, during “survival,” bleeding and infection are resolved by collaborative efforts of the hemostatic and inflammatory pathways. Later, in “repair,” avascular and biomechanically insufficient bone is replaced by a variable combination of intramembranous and endochondral ossification. Progression to repair cannot occur until survival has been ensured. A disproportionate APR—either insufficient or exuberant—leads to complications of survival (hemorrhage, thrombosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, infection, death) and/or repair (delayed- or non-union). The type of ossification utilized for fracture repair is dependent on the relative amounts of strain and vascularity in the fracture microenvironment, but any failure along this process can disrupt or delay fracture healing and result in a similar non-union. Therefore, incomplete understanding of the principles herein can result in mismanagement of fracture care or application of hardware that interferes with fracture repair. This unifying model of fracture repair not only informs clinicians how their interventions fit within the framework of normal biological healing but also instructs investigators about the critical variables and outputs to assess during a study of fracture repair."
Evaluation of Japanese potatoes using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),"An understanding of the genetic diversity and structure of a breeding population is fundamental information for breeders to develop strategies for variety improvement. The genetic diversity of 250 diverse North American potatoes was previously characterized using an 8K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. In this study, using a 12K SNP array, 164 Japanese potatoes including 70 breeding clones for chip processing were characterized and compared with North American and European potatoes. A cluster analysis using 5972 polymorphic SNP loci grouped recently released Japanese chip processing varieties and breeding clones with North American and European chip processing varieties. The other Japanese potatoes, including those for starch processing, were not clearly differentiated to specific market types. A unique group of double-cropping varieties was identified, suggesting that strong selection pressure was applied to the cultivation system (spring-season product is used for fall-season cropping). The inter-populational distance between Japanese and foreign genotypes (mean Euclidean distance of 48.4) was significantly lower than the within-populational distance of foreign genotypes (49.3), indicating that the Japanese potatoes are not uniquely differentiated but are included within the genetic diversity of foreign genotypes. This study demonstrates the usefulness of SNP array technology for performing a cost-effective, robust and direct comparison of genetic diversity among different gene pools."
"How to avoid false interpretations of Sentinel-1A TOPSAR interferometric data in landslide mapping? A case study: recent landslides in Transdanubia, Hungary","It is a crucial issue to better understand the usability of Sentinel-1 satellites in geomorphologic applications, since Sentinel-1 and the Copernicus Program are considered to be the workhorse of Earth observation by the European Space Agency during the next decades. Yet, a very limited experience is available on the applicability of Sentinel-1 images in the detection and identification of surface deformations and especially landslide mapping and monitoring in densely vegetated (low-coherence) areas. Few Synthetic Aperture Radar images (not more than 20) are sufficient for a successful run of interferometric stacking algorithms. This number is really low compared to the tremendous data flow of Sentinel-1 images that are available for interferometric analysis nowadays. Despite the availability of acquisitions, only a few papers exist on the accuracy of Sentinel-1 data, signal-to-noise ratio and the value of the acquired imagery for geomorphologic interpretation. Two test sites and a control site—affected by active surface deformations—have been investigated using 40 Sentinel-1A images and conventional persistent scatterers (PSI) method. PSI results have been combined with the geomorphologic information of the studied sites. We verified that the given number of Sentinel-1A acquisitions provide a unique base for surface deformation recognition and mapping in low-coherence areas. We found that scatterers were corrupted by a strong noise if their line of sight (LOS) velocity was below ± 6–7 mm/year all over the three test sites, although noise can easily be reduced. Noise reduction was achieved by a significant increase of the length of time series, i.e., time range between the first and last image to reduce the effect of atmospheric phase screen (APS)."
Placement Optimization for UAV-Enabled Wireless Networks with Multi-Hop Backhauls,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising solution to provide wireless data access for ground users in various applications (e.g., in emergency situations). This paper considers a UAV-enabled wireless network, in which multiple UAVs are deployed as aerial base stations to serve users distributed on the ground. Different from prior works that ignore UAVs’ backhaul connections, we practically consider that these UAVs are connected to the core network through a ground gateway node via rate-limited multi-hop wireless backhauls. We also consider that the air-to-ground access links from UAVs to users and the air-to-air backhaul links among UAVs are operated over orthogonal frequency bands. Under this setup, we aim to maximize the common (or minimum) throughput among all the ground users in the downlink of this network subject to the flow conservation constraints at the UAVs, by optimizing the UAVs’ deployment locations, jointly with the bandwidth and power allocation of both the access and backhaul links. However, the common throughput maximization is a non-convex optimization problem that is difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this issue, we use the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex programming to obtain a locally optimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed design significantly improves the common throughput among all ground users as compared to other benchmark schemes."
Classification of triple-negative breast cancers based on Immunogenomic profiling,"Abundant evidence shows that triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is heterogeneous, and many efforts have been devoted to identifying TNBC subtypes on the basis of genomic profiling. However, few studies have explored the classification of TNBC specifically based on immune signatures that may facilitate the optimal stratification of TNBC patients responsive to immunotherapy."
Concentric UCAs Based Low-Order OAM for High Capacity in Radio Vortex Wireless Communications,"Due to the potential capacity-boosting for wireless communications, radio vortex wireless communication (RowComm) over orthogonal states/modes of orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been paid much attention to in recent years. A uniform circular array (UCA), as an efficient and convenient antenna structure, can transmit/receive multiple OAM beams with different OAM-modes simultaneously when the transmitter and receiver are aligned. However, for high-order OAMmodes, the OAM beams are divergent accompanied by severe attenuation. Thus, it is difficult to directly use high-order OAM-modes to achieve high capacity for RowComms. To obtain high capacity potentially offered by OAM-modes, in this paper we transform the singular UCA into the concentric UCAs, where high capacity can be achieved using multiple parallel low-order OAM-modes instead of all high-order OAM-modes, to increase the capacity of transmitter-receiver aligned Row-Comms. In particular, we study two cases: 1). concentric UCAs based RowComms without co-mode interference; 2). concentric UCAs based RowComms with co-mode interference. We propose a co-mode-interference-free and a co-mode-interference-contained mode-decomposition schemes to recover transmitted signals for these two cases, respectively. Additionally, we develop optimal power allocation schemes to maximize the capacity for these two cases. Numerical simulations are presented to validate and evaluate that our developed concentric UCAs based low-order RowComms can significantly increase the capacity as compared with that of singular UCA based RowComms."
Timing Synchronization and Ranging in Networked UAV-Aided OFDM Systems,"The space-air-ground network architecture integrates satellite systems, aerial networks, and terrestrial networks, where the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication in the air segment has attracted particular interest and demonstrated tremendous potential in both military and civilian applications. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) can be an effective solution to provide high rate and reliable transmission in UAV communication systems because of its high spectral efficiency and robustness against frequency selective fading. We herein focus our attention on two critical issues in our proposed UAV aided OFDM system, i.e., timing synchronization and ranging. Moreover, extensive simulations are conducted for evaluation. Finally, we design a real-world field test for verifying the effectiveness of our proposed multi-UAV OFDM communication system."
Cerebrospinal fluid penetration of very high-dose meropenem: a case report,"Standard dosing of meropenem (2 g t.i.d.) produces CSF concentrations of only 1–2 mg/L which is inferior to the clinical breakpoint for most Gram-negative bacteria. There is therefore concern that dosing must be increased in order to achieve therapeutic CSF concentrations for bacteria with susceptibility close to clinical breakpoints. Yet, the effects of high-dose meropenem on CSF concentrations are not well described in literature. We therefore determined meropenem CSF-levels in a patient who was treated with 15 g/day of meropenem."

Head and pelvic vertical displacement in dogs with induced swinging limb lameness: an experimental study,"Swinging limb lameness is defined as a motion disturbance ascribed to a limb in swing phase. Little is known about its biomechanics in dogs, particularly about the body motions that accompany it, such as vertical head and pelvic motion asymmetry. The aim of this study was to describe the changes in vertical head and pelvic motion asymmetry in dogs with induced swinging limb motion disturbance, mimicking a swinging limb lameness. Fore- and hind-limb lameness was induced in ten sound dogs by placing a weight (200 g) proximal to the carpus or tarsus, respectively. Marker-based motion capture by eight infrared light emitting video cameras recorded the dogs when trotting on a treadmill. Body symmetry parameters were calculated, including differences between the two highest positions of the head (HDmax) and pelvis (PDmax) and between the two lowest positions of the head (HDmin) and pelvis (PDmin), with a value of zero indicating perfect symmetry."
The value of a causal loop diagram in exploring the complex interplay of factors that influence health promotion in a multisectoral health system in Australia,"Despite calls for the application of complex systems science in empirical studies of health promotion, there are very few examples.

Cluster randomized evaluation of the Nia Project: study protocol,"The onset of puberty and menarche is a specifically vulnerable time for girls, during which they begin to show interest in the opposite sex, while becoming exposed to a myriad of external pressures, including sexual coercion or harassment from boys and men, expectations to marry from their families, and the need to perform well in primary school in order to qualify for secondary school. According to several qualitative studies in Africa, such pressures are exacerbated by girls’ lack of knowledge of their bodies, their rights, and the implications of their decisions, and by their inability to manage puberty and adolescence safely and comfortably with appropriate menstrual health and hygiene management (MHM) products. The evaluation of the Nia Project is one of the first to analyze the individual and combined contributions of sanitary pads and provision of comprehensive reproductive health education on girls’ education and reproductive health outcomes."

The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of overweight pregnant women in relation to lifestyle changes during pregnancy to improve their health."
"Tranexamic acid for the prevention of postpartum bleeding in women with anaemia: study protocol for an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is responsible for about 100,000 maternal deaths every year, most of which occur in low- and middle-income countries. Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces bleeding by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of fibrin blood clots. TXA decreases blood loss in surgery and reduces death due to bleeding after trauma. When given within 3 h of birth, TXA reduces deaths due to bleeding in women with PPH. However, for many women, treatment of PPH is too late to prevent death. Over one third of pregnant women in the world are anaemic and many are severely anaemic. These women have an increased risk of PPH and suffer more severe outcomes if PPH occurs. There is an urgent need to identify a safe and effective way to reduce postpartum bleeding in anaemic women."
Conditional economic incentives and motivational interviewing to improve adolescents’ retention in HIV care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy in Southeast Nigeria: study protocol for a cluster randomised trial,"Adolescent HIV patients face enormous difficulty in accessing HIV care services. Given their vulnerability to risk-taking behaviour, this group also have worse treatment outcomes compared to other age groups. Poor treatment outcomes will impact negatively on HIV/AIDS management and control particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as more than eight out of ten of the world’s HIV-infected adolescents live in this region of the world.

"Comparison of the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab for colchicine-resistant or colchicine-intolerant familial Mediterranean fever: study protocol for an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an inherited disorder caused by a number of mutations of the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene, coding a protein named pyrin that acts as a major regulatory component of the inflammasome. The first-line drug for FMF treatment is colchicine, but 10% of patients with FMF do not respond well to colchicine. Although the efficacy of tocilizumab (TCZ), which is a recombinant, humanized, antihuman interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor monoclonal antibody, has been reported to prevent FMF attacks, the effects of TCZ on individuals with colchicine-resistant or colchicine-intolerant FMF have not been evaluated in a randomized clinical trial."
The effects of an acute bout of exercise on neural activity in alcohol and cocaine craving: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Numerous studies suggest that exercise may be an effective adjunct treatment for substance use disorders.

The ethical experiences of trainees on short-term international trips: a systematic qualitative synthesis,"Medical student and resident participation in short-term international trips for trainees (STINTTs) has increased in the past few decades. However, there has been no systematic review of trainees’ actual ethical experiences. The authors sought to identify what ethical issues medical trainees encounter during STINTTs, as elicited by and reported in peer-reviewed, quantitative and qualitative research papers."
Perceived strain of undergraduate medical students during a simulated first day of residency,Residents face demanding situations on the job and have been found to perceive high levels of strain. Medical students also reported a high degree of strain and even depressive tendencies when entering their clinical rotations. The aim of this study was to explore the perceived strain of medical students from different undergraduate curricula and at different stages of academic advancement during different phases of an assessment simulating a resident’s first day in hospital.
The ethnicity attainment gap among medical and biomedical science students: a qualitative study,"Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) medical students and professionals frequently underachieve when compared with their White counterparts not only in the United Kingdom, but across the globe. There is no consensus for the definitive causes of this attainment gap, but suggestions contributing towards it include: increased feelings of isolation as a member of a minority culture or religion; a poorer higher education (HE) experience compared with White counterparts; and stereotype threat, whereby students underperform in exams from the stresses of fearing confirming to a negative-stereotype."
Identification of high-risk groups for complication after arthroplasty: predictive value of patient’s related risk factors,"Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) benefit patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

The aim of this study is to identify groups at higher risk for infections and mechanical complications after TJA in patients with RA and OA based on their most significant predictors."
Parameter estimation for Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes driven by fractional Lévy process,"We study the minimum Skorohod distance estimation \(\theta _{\varepsilon}^{\ast }\) and minimum \(L_{1}\)-norm estimation \(\widetilde {\theta _{\varepsilon}}\) of the drift parameter θ of a stochastic differential equation \(dX_{t}=\theta X_{t}\,dt+\varepsilon \,dL^{d}_{t}\), \(X_{0}=x_{0}\), where \(\{L^{d}_{t},0\leq t\leq T\}\) is a fractional Lévy process, \(\varepsilon \in (0,1]\).

Moreover, we also study the asymptotic laws of their limit distributions for \(T\rightarrow \infty \)."
Hermite–Hadamard type inequalities for F-convex function involving fractional integrals,"In this study, the family F and F-convex function are given with its properties. In view of this, we establish some new inequalities of Hermite–Hadamard type for differentiable function. Moreover, we establish some trapezoid type inequalities for functions whose second derivatives in absolute values are F-convex.

Amylopectin structure and crystallinity explains variation in digestion kinetics of starches across botanic sources in an in vitro pig model,"Starch is the main source of energy in commonly used pig diets. Besides effects related to the extent of starch digestion, also several effects related to variation in digestion rate have recently been demonstrated in non-ruminants. Different rates of starch digestion in animals and in in vitro models have been reported, depending on the botanic origin of starch. Starches from different botanic sources differ widely in structural and molecular properties. Predicting the effect of starch properties on in vitro digestion kinetics based on existing literature is hampered by incomplete characterization of the starches, or by a selective choice of starches from a limited number of botanic sources. This research aimed to analyse the relationships between starch properties and in vitro digestion kinetics of pure starches isolated from a broad range of botanic origins, which are used in non-ruminant diets or have a potential to be used in the future. Therefore we studied starch digestion kinetics of potato, pea, corn, rice, barley, and wheat starches, and analysed the granule diameter, number of pores, type and amount of crystalline structure, amylose content and amylopectin side-chain length of all starches."
Experimental Observation on Variation of Rheological Properties during Concrete Pumping,"Workability of concrete varies during pumping. Even though concrete satisfies the required workability before pumping, it often does not satisfy the required standard after pumping. Moreover, serious problem could happen such as segregation and blockage. In this study, the rheological properties of concrete change during pumping from the pressure distribution over the pipe length was investigated. The rheological properties and the pressures measured from seven different real-scale pumping tests with 116 m to 1000 m long pipelines and 24 MPa to 100 MPa concrete were analyzed. As a result, it was found that the rheological properties vary gradually along the pipeline, and could abruptly change inside the pump. The variation of rheological properties during pumping seems to be attributed in part to the increase of water absorption in aggregates under high pressure and the additional mixing effect, namely, intensive shearing under high pressure inside pump."
Strength Calculation of Short Concrete-filled Steel Tube Columns,"The aim of this work is to propose a technique to calculate the strength of short concrete-filled steel tube columns under the short-term action of a compressive load, based on the phenomenological approach and the theoretical positions of reinforced concrete mechanics. The main dependencies that allow the realization of the deformation calculation model in practice are considered. A distinctive feature of the proposed approach is the method of the multipoint construction of deformation diagrams for a concrete core and steel shell. In this case, two main factors are taken into account. First, the steel shell and the concrete core work under conditions of a complex stress state. Since the proposed dependencies to determine the strength and the ultimate relative strain of volumetrically compressed concrete are obtained phenomenologically, they are more versatile than the commonly used empirical formulas. In particular, they can be used for self-stressing, fine-grained and other types of concrete. Second, with a step-by-step increase in the relative deformation, the lateral pressure on a concrete core and a steel shell constantly change. Thus, the parametric points of the concrete and steel deformation diagrams also change at each step. This circumstance was not taken into account in earlier calculations. A comparison of the theoretical and experimental results indicates that the practical application of the developed calculation procedure gives a reliable and fairly stable estimate of the stress–strain state and the strength of concrete-filled steel tube columns."
Timing Synchronization and Ranging in Networked UAV-Aided OFDM Systems,"The space-air-ground network architecture integrates satellite systems, aerial networks, and terrestrial networks, where the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication in the air segment has attracted particular interest and demonstrated tremendous potential in both military and civilian applications. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) can be an effective solution to provide high rate and reliable transmission in UAV communication systems because of its high spectral efficiency and robustness against frequency selective fading. We herein focus our attention on two critical issues in our proposed UAV aided OFDM system, i.e., timing synchronization and ranging. Moreover, extensive simulations are conducted for evaluation. Finally, we design a real-world field test for verifying the effectiveness of our proposed multi-UAV OFDM communication system."
Placement Optimization for UAV-Enabled Wireless Networks with Multi-Hop Backhauls,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising solution to provide wireless data access for ground users in various applications (e.g., in emergency situations). This paper considers a UAV-enabled wireless network, in which multiple UAVs are deployed as aerial base stations to serve users distributed on the ground. Different from prior works that ignore UAVs’ backhaul connections, we practically consider that these UAVs are connected to the core network through a ground gateway node via rate-limited multi-hop wireless backhauls. We also consider that the air-to-ground access links from UAVs to users and the air-to-air backhaul links among UAVs are operated over orthogonal frequency bands. Under this setup, we aim to maximize the common (or minimum) throughput among all the ground users in the downlink of this network subject to the flow conservation constraints at the UAVs, by optimizing the UAVs’ deployment locations, jointly with the bandwidth and power allocation of both the access and backhaul links. However, the common throughput maximization is a non-convex optimization problem that is difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this issue, we use the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex programming to obtain a locally optimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed design significantly improves the common throughput among all ground users as compared to other benchmark schemes."
Classification of triple-negative breast cancers based on Immunogenomic profiling,"Abundant evidence shows that triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is heterogeneous, and many efforts have been devoted to identifying TNBC subtypes on the basis of genomic profiling. However, few studies have explored the classification of TNBC specifically based on immune signatures that may facilitate the optimal stratification of TNBC patients responsive to immunotherapy."

The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of overweight pregnant women in relation to lifestyle changes during pregnancy to improve their health."
Numerical simulation of bubble detachment at submerged orifice and analysis of interface stability,"This paper presents the experimental and numerical results of the bubble detachment from a submerged orifice at a constant gas flow rate. The compressible large eddy simulation combined with the volume of fluid method is adopted in the simulation and is validated by experiment. The transition criterion from the elongation stage to the detachment is obtained. In the detaching stage in the simulation, the distributions of the pressure and the surface tension on the cylindrical bubble neck are obtained. The Rayleigh-Plesset equation in the cylindrical coordinate frame is used to describe this process. Based on the comparison between the numerical results and the equation analysis, a reference value of the uncertain integral parameter in the equation is determined."
Effects of air relief openings on the mitigation of solitary wave forces on bridge decks,"For inverted T-type bridge decks, the air entrapped in the chambers between adjacent girders could increase the wave forces and lead to the destruction of the bridge decks. This paper studies the effects of the air relief openings (ARO) on the mitigation of the solitary wave-induced forces on the bridge decks. Hydrodynamic experiments are conducted for three inverted T-type decks with four, five, and six girders with different wave properties and deck clearances. The open source computational fluid dynamics toolbox OpenFOAM is adopted to conduct numerical simulations for the effects of the AROs. Since the numerical results correlate well with the measurements, the mechanism of the wave-structure interaction can be revealed by the numerical flow fields. Furthermore, the relationship between the shape and the volume of the ARO and the wave forces on the bridge decks, as well as the contribution of each ARO to the effect of the wave force mitigation, is also obtained from the numerical results of the OpenFOAM. Experimental and numerical results demonstrate that the AROs could effectively reduce the vertical wave forces on the bridge decks. The effects of the AROs increase with the increase of the volume of the ARO, while the shape of the ARO has no effect on the reduction of the wave forces."
Pitch control strategy before the rated power for variable speed wind turbines at high altitudes,"The wind turbines in the world’s highest wind farm with an altitude of over 4 000 m in Naqu county of China were put into operation in 2014. Compared with the wind turbines at lower altitudes, the rated wind speed of these wind turbines are much larger, and the corresponding tip-speed ratio at the rated power reduces significantly due to the lower air density. Hence, the power coefficient at the point of the rated power is decreased to a rather low level. To improve the performance of the wind turbines at very high altitudes, this paper proposes a new pitch control strategy for variable speed wind turbines at the constant-speed phase, especially at the rated-speed phase before the rated power is reached. It is shown that the new pitch control strategy works very well for the wind farms at very high altitude and with low air density, with the catch of the wind energy enhanced and the aerodynamic loads significantly reduced."
3D modeling of geoelectrical data: assessment of groundwater potentialities in Hassi R’mel (Southern Algeria),"This work reveals the modeling contribution to the techniques of investigations in the electrical resistivity area. Two campaigns of electric soundings (maximum length AB = 6000 m) were conducted in the Saharan region—Hassi R’mel (Algeria), to supply two new cities with drinking water. An analytical procedure, also known as inversion, was applied to the processing of the registered measurements. The results of this interpretation allowed to locate the porous and permeable formations likely to be aquifers. A simulation algorithm based on the finite difference method has been adapted for the direct calculation of the electrical resistivity data. The obtained models laid a more detailed description of the subsurface structure. So, based on these results adjusted with the help of drill logs of the region, it is believed that the best orientation for the exploitation of these waters in the first evaluated zone (Bellil) is in the Northeast part of the area under investigation, whereas in the second region (Bouzbier), the privileged areas are those located in the North-east and the South-east parts."
Is sleep apnea underdiagnosed in adult patients with osteogenesis imperfecta? –a single-center cross-sectional study,"Patients with Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) suffer from increased bone fracture tendency generally caused by a mutation in genes coding for type I collagen. OI is also characterized by numerous co-morbidities, and recent data from questionnaire studies suggest that these may include increased risk for sleep apnea, a finding that lacks clinical evidence from cohort studies. In this cross-sectional study, 25 adults with OI underwent clinical otorhinolaryngology examination as well as overnight polysomnography to address the question. The participants were aged between 19 and 77 years, and ten of them had mild clinical OI phenotype, seven had a moderately severe phenotype, and eight had a severe phenotype."
Anti-Refugee Sentiment without Refugees: Human Rights Violations and Social Work in Post-Socialist Countries of Southeastern Europe in their Social Contexts,"In the article, the authors pose a question: to what extent can we speak of social work practice in support of refugees in post-socialist Southeastern Europe given that in the region, which was part of the Balkans Humanitarian Corridor in 2015 and 2016, state-supported social work practice is very limited and very prescriptive at the same time? The vocal anti-refugee sentiment in Central and Southeastern Europe that accompanied the migrants can be said to stem from the nineteenth-century primordialism: the one-state, one-nation ideology that also was embedded in the very construction of post-socialist states after 1991. Consequently, refugees are seen as the ultimate danger to everything “ours,” to women, men, and children of purportedly pure-blooded ethnonational origin, threatening “our” transgenerational sense of cultural and pseudobiological homogeneity. The rising post-socialist ethnonational primordialism, intertwined with conservative neopatriarchal ideologies, directly affects human rights observance and social work education and practice. The predominantly government-funded social workers generally are neither trained nor encouraged to work with refugees, while the popular and party politics of hatred is directed toward those who support refugees, social workers included. Anti-refugee sentiment, culturalization, and neopatriarchy are rationalized with arguments of fear and care; protecting the cultural and biological homogeneity of native residents leads to processes that turn care into violence, and ultimately into coercive care."
A scoring system to predict local progression-free survival in patients irradiated with 20 Gy in 5 fractions for malignant spinal cord compression,Local progression-free survival (LPFS = stable or improved motor function/resolution of paraplegia during RT without in-field recurrence following RT) is important when treating metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC). An instrument to estimate LPFS was created to identify patients appropriately treated with short-course RT instead of longer-course RT plus/minus decompressive surgery.
Surgical experience and patient-related restrictions predict the adequacy of cervical mediastinoscopy in non-small cell lung carcinoma lymph node staging,"Until recently, cervical mediastinoscopy was considered to be the reference standard for mediastinal staging for Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC). In the absence of metastases, mediastinal lymph node involvement is the most important prognostic factor and as such it determines therapeutic strategies. In this study we evaluated the adequacy of cervical mediastinoscopy in NSCLC lymph node staging in a large university hospital over more than a decade. In addition, we determined the influence of: (1) surgeon’s experience (2) video-assisted mediastinoscopy (VAM) and (3) patient-related restrictions (PRR) on the adequacy of lymph node sampling."
Patterns of Fasciola hepatica infection in Danish dairy cattle: implications for on-farm control of the parasite based on different diagnostic methods,"Bovine fasciolosis is an economically important livestock disease in Europe, and represents a particular challenge for organic farms, where cattle are grazed extensively and the use of anthelmintic is limited. A two-year longitudinal study was conducted on two conventional and two organic Danish dairy farms to examine the current temporal trend of F. hepatica infection on-farm, and to gather data of practical relevance for parasite control. Data were collected both at the herd and individual level using currently available diagnostic methods: a commercial serum antibody ELISA, a commercial copro-antigen ELISA, faecal egg counts, and monthly bulk tank milk (BTM) ELISA. The temporal patterns (animal age, farm-level temporal trends and seasonality) in the animal-level test results were analysed by generalised additive mixed models (GAMM)."
Long-term exposure of Aedes aegypti to Bacillus thuringiensis svar. israelensis did not involve altered susceptibility to this microbial larvicide or to other control agents,"Bacillus thuringiensis svar. israelensis (Bti) is an effective and safe biolarvicide to control Aedes aegypti. Its mode of action based on four protoxins disfavors resistance; however, control in endemic areas that display high mosquito infestation throughout the year requires continuous larvicide applications, which imposes a strong selection pressure. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of an intensive Bti exposure on an Ae. aegypti strain (RecBti), regarding its susceptibility to Bti and two of its protoxins tested individually, to other control agents temephos and diflubenzuron, and its profile of detoxifying enzymes."
Recapitulation of methotrexate hepatotoxicity with induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis,"Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Listeria monocytogenes meningitis in immunocompetent and healthy children: a case report and a review of the literature,"Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive bacteria generally transmitted to humans through ingestion of contaminated food. It typically infects high risk subjects, such as pregnant women, neonates, the elderly and immunocompromised patients. Listeria meningitis is rarely reported in previously healthy children with no immunological disorders. However, it can be aggressive in such subjects and is associated with a high mortality rate. Prompt diagnosis is essential so that adequate antibiotic treatment can be started and the best outcome achieved."
Hybrid Precoding Design Achieving Fully Digital Performance for Millimeter Wave Communications,"As a promising candidate for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) communications, hybrid precoding techniques can reap the benefit of large antenna arrays, yet with only limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains. In this paper, we investigate the problem of achieving the same performance of the fully digital system with hybrid precoding. Specifically, for the single user MIMO system, we propose a closed form hybrid precoding design that can achieve the optimal fully digital performance for both frequency-flat and frequency-selective channels, and only requires the number of RF chains to equal the number of paths of the channel. The design for the case with even less RF chains is also given. Furthermore, for the multiuser (MU) system with single antenna at each mobile terminal (MT), two MU beamforming schemes are considered, which are the directional beamforming and zero-forcing. We show that for both schemes, the fully digital performance can be achieved with our proposed hybrid precoding designs with the number of RF chains no less than the sum number of channel paths from the base station to all the selected MTs. Numerical results are provided to validate our analytical results and show the performance gain of the proposed hybrid precoding designs compared to other benchmark schemes."
Bandwidth Allocation and Control Message Scheduling Algorithms for Improving the QoSs of High Priority Traffic in PON,"The passive optical network (PON) is the most promising candidate for supporting multiple service classes, i.e., high priority (HP) traffic and best-effort (BE) traffic, in the next-generation broadband access networks. Providing an efficient dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) algorithm is the most important issue for supporting multiple service classes of traffic simultaneously. This paper presents a new DBA algorithm, which is the modified version of the hybrid slot-size/rate (HSSR) scheme, and is called the modified HSSR (MHSSR) algorithm. We have also modified the control message scheduling algorithm to fit it to the proposed scheme. In the proposed MHSSR scheme, each cycle time, i.e., the length of a time cycle, is equally divided into two parts. In the 1st part of the cycle time, the bandwidth is dynamically allocated to the HP traffic of all the optical network units (ONUs). In contrast, in the 2nd part of the cycle time, the bandwidth is dynamically allocated to the BE traffic of one or multiple ONUs. Furthermore, to ensure guaranteed service for the HP traffic, the 1st part of the cycle time is extended while the 2nd part of the cycle time is compressed if the demand of the HP traffic is very high. However, the 1st part of the cycle time will never be compressed, even at the lightly loaded condition of the HP traffic. The modified control message-scheduling algorithm effectively coordinates the timing sequence between the two parts of the cycle time and ensures the synchronization between two Gate messages to each ONU. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed schemes through numerical simulations in terms of end-to-end packet delay, bandwidth wastage, remaining bytes per time cycle, jitter, and throughput for different offered loads. From the comparative analysis, it can be seen that the proposed scheme provides better performance than the existing HSSR and delay variation-guaranteed schemes."
Oxytetracycline reduces the diversity of tetracycline-resistance genes in the Galleria mellonella gut microbiome,"Clinically-relevant multidrug resistance is sometimes present in bacteria not exposed to human-made antibiotics, in environments without extreme selective pressures, such as the insect gut.

The influence of grain size on the magnetic properties of Fe3O4 nanocrystals synthesized by solvothermal method,"The peculiar magnetic properties of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SIONs) have spurred great interest in their potential application in enhancing medical images and drug delivery. Currently hindering the application of nanomagnetic particles in these fields is due to SIONs nonuniform size distribution, agglomeration, non-crystallinity, and low magnetic moment. In this paper, magnetic nanocrystals of different sizes and morphologies were prepared by the solvothermal method, which utilized an n-hexane-surfactant system with Fe(acac)3 and iron-powder precursors. The crystalline structure and particle size of grown SIONs are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). HRTEM showed that the SIONs were approximately 5.6–6.8 nm in size with no agglomeration and a uniform distribution. Within the reaction time, HRTEM also confirmed that the shape and nanocrystals of SIONs had changed from an irregular crystal shape to triangles and quadrilaterals, and finally to hexagonal nanoparticles. According to the test results of the magnetic properties test and the literature, the material that has been synthesized is a superparamagnetic material. And the maximum saturation magnetization was 62.65 emu/g, which is reported among the largest magnetic properties of SIONs at a size of 6.8 nm."

Tendon Healing in the Context of Complex Fractures,"Tendons connect muscle to bone and play an integral role in bone and joint alignment and loading. Tendons act as pulleys that provide anchorage of muscle forces for joint motion and stability, as well as for fracture reduction and realignment. Patients that experience complex fractures also have concomitant soft tissue injuries, such as tendon damage or rupture. Tendon injuries that occur at the time of bone fracture have long-term ramifications on musculoskeletal health, yet these injuries are often disregarded in clinical treatment and diagnosis for patients with bone fractures as well as in basic science approaches for understanding bone repair processes. Delayed assessment of soft tissue injuries during evaluation of trauma can lead to chronic pain, dysfunction, and delayed bone healing even following successful fracture repair, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating damaged tendons early. Treatment strategies for bone repair, such as mechanical stabilization and biological therapeutics, can impact tendon healing and function. Because poor tendon healing following complex fracture can significantly impact the function of tendon during bone fracture healing, a need exists to understand the healing process of complex fractures more broadly, beyond the healing of bone. In this review, we explored the mechanical and biological interaction of bone and tendon in the context of complex fracture, as well as the relevance and potential ramifications of tendon damage following bone fracture, which has particular impact on patients that experience complex fractures, such as from combat, automobile accidents, and other trauma."
Mother-Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (M-NICU): A Novel Concept in Newborn Care,"Health facilities in India are faced with the challenge of providing quality newborn care in the face of major skilled human resource shortage. A possible solution is the concept of Mother-Neonatal ICU (M-NICU), where the mother has her bed inside the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) by the side of baby’s warmer. Our observations in M-NICU of a public sector hospital in New Delhi, India, indicate that mothers can be easily trained to follow asepsis routines and monitor the neonates, and are better prepared for their post-discharge care. Incorporating space for both mothers and their newborns in level-II NICUs may provide quality and developmentally supportive newborn care in coming years."

Seismic Imaging of the Sedimentary System of the Upper Cretaceous Nenjiang Formation in the Northern Songliao Basin,"This paper studied seismic imaging of the sedimentary system of the Nenjiang Formation in the Northern Songliao Basin based on seismic sedimentology. An accurate and detailed depiction and explanation is provided for underground geological bodies within a relative geological period using the stratal slice technology, based on three-order sequence correlations of well logging and seismic data for the purpose of obtaining high-resolution pictures of the sedimentary system. Research results have revealed that the sedimentary system of the Upper Cretaceous Nenjiang Formation in the Northern Songliao Basin includes meandering streams, anastomosing streams, lake deltas, and sediment gravity flow channels. Based on seismic imaging analysis, the genesis and seismic geomorphology of the sedimentary system of the Nenjiang Formation are explored in order to understand the spatial distribution of typical sedimentary bodies and the evolution of streams in the Nenjiang Formation. According to the research results, the sedimentation of the Nenjiang Formation was subject to the delta system in the east and northeast of the formation. The provenance in the northeastern part played a dominant role during the deposition of the Nenjiang Formation for some time; after the earlier maximum flooding in the second and third members of the Nenjiang Formation, the northeastern system began to decline and was gradually replaced by the eastern system. Stratal slices have revealed that a well-developed gravity flow channel system was developed in the first member of the Nenjiang Formation, and massive slip blocks occurred in the second and third members of the formation. The research results indicated that the large gravity flow channel system in the first member of the Nenjiang Formation was formed by streams that emptied directly into the lake; and the slip blocks in the second and third members were the results of gravity sliding of sediments along steep slopes at the delta front."
"Machine learning methodologies versus cardiovascular risk scores, in predicting disease risk","The use of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk estimation scores in primary prevention has long been established.

Clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes in six cases of malignant tenosynovial giant cell tumor: initial experience of molecularly targeted therapy,"Although tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is classified as a benign tumor, it may undergo malignant transformation and metastasize in extremely rare occasions. High aberrant expression of CSF1 has been implicated in the development of TGCT and recent studies have shown promising activity of several CSF1R inhibitors against benign diffuse-type TGCT; however, little is known about their effects in malignant TGCT."
Endothelial cells from pulmonary endarterectomy specimens possess a high angiogenic potential and express high levels of hepatocyte growth factor,"Impaired angiogenesis is assumed to be an important factor in the development of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). However, the role of endothelial cells (ECs) in CTEPH remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the angiogenic potential of ECs from pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) specimens."
Plaque biofilm microbial diversity in infants aged 12 months and their mothers with or without dental caries: a pilot study,"A number of studies on oral microbial diversity of early childhood caries (ECC) have tended to focus on mid- or late-stage of ECC, with a lack of research into early stage of tooth eruption and maternal influence. The aims of this study are to compare the supragingival plaque biofilm microbiota diversity between mothers with or without dental caries and their 12-month-old infants, and to explore the relationship of microbial diversity between infants and their mothers, using sequencing analysis."

Use of pregnancy ultrasound before the 19th week scan: an analytical study based on the Icelandic Childbirth and Health Cohort,"Use of ultrasound scans early in pregnancy is increasing, but we have limited knowledge about the actual prevalence, associated decision-making and impact on expectant women/couples in a general population. The aim of this study was to document the use of, and experiences related to, foetal scanning before the recommended 19th week scan among pregnant women in Iceland."
Does endometrial scratching increase the rate of spontaneous conception in couples with unexplained infertility and a good prognosis (Hunault > 30%)? Study protocol of the SCRaTCH-OFO trial: a randomized controlled trial,"In the Netherlands, couples with unexplained infertility and a good prognosis to conceive spontaneously (i.e. Hunault > 30%) are advised to perform timed intercourse for at least another 6 months. If couples fail to conceive within this period, they will usually start assisted reproductive technology (ART). However, treatment of unexplained infertility by ART is empirical and can involve significant burdens. Intentional endometrial injury, also called ‘endometrial scratching’, has been proposed to positively affect the chance of embryo implantation in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). It might also be beneficial for couples with unexplained infertility as defective endometrial receptivity may play a role in these women. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether endometrial scratching increases live birth rates in women with unexplained infertility."
Acceptability of option B+ among HIV positive women receiving antenatal and postnatal care services in selected health centre’s in Lusaka,"In 2013, Zambia accepted the immediate operationalization of Option B+, a policy used to try and eliminate mother to child transmission. This policy requires all HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women to initiate antiretroviral treatment for life regardless of CD4 count. However, not all HIV positive women accept treatment for life. This study aimed to investigate acceptability of lifelong ART (Option B+) among HIV positive women receiving antenatal and postnatal services at the university teaching hospital and Lusaka urban city clinics."
miR-18a reactivates the Epstein-Barr virus through defective DNA damage response and promotes genomic instability in EBV-associated lymphomas,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is closely associated with several types of malignancies. EBV is normally present in the latent state in the peripheral blood B cell compartment. The EBV latent-to-lytic switch is required for virus spread and virus-induced carinogenesis. Immunosuppression or DNA damage can induce the reactivation of EBV replication. EBV alone is rarely sufficient to cause cancer. In this study, we investigated the roles of host microRNAs and environmental factors, such as DNA-damage agents, in EBV reactivation and its association with lymphomagenesis."

Association of high body mass index with development of interstitial fibrosis in patients with IgA nephropathy,"The worldwide prevalence of obesity is increasing. Obesity is associated with a variety of chronic diseases, including chronic kidney disease. Several studies suggested that body mass index (BMI) could be an independent risk factor for progression of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). However, whether high BMI is associated with progression of IgAN remains uncertain."
First insights on the genetic diversity of MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Lebanon,"Lebanon hosts a heterogeneous population coming from underdeveloped and developing countries, resulting in increasing incidences of tuberculosis over the past years.

"Association of HIV-infection, antiretroviral treatment and metabolic syndrome with large artery stiffness: a cross-sectional study","Effective combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved life expectancy among people living with HIV-1 infection. Treated HIV-1infection increases the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS). Despite sub-Saharan Africa having among the highest rates of HIV-1 infection, the effects of MS in HIV-1-infected individuals on cardiovascular risk is poorly explored. The aim of the study was to assess whether MS and/or HIV-1 treatment correlates with large elastic artery stiffness in HIV-1-infected patients treated with first-line cART."
Enhanced Incorporation of Gaseous CO2 to Succinate by a Recombinant Escherichia coli W3110,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are related to global warming. However, CO2 can be used as an abundant and cheap carbon source for production of valuable chemicals using carbon capture and storage technology. Here, the genes related to carbon flux toward pyruvate biosynthesis in E. coli were deleted to enhance the incorporation of CO2 for succinate production. The codonoptimized carbonic anhydrase gene (SP(-)HCCA) derived from Hahella chejuensis KCTC 2396 and the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene (ppc) of E. coli W3110 were co-overexpressed to enhance carbon flux toward oxaloacetate synthesis in E. coli. Finally, we constructed SGJS134, which shows the highest production of succinate derived from CO2 compared with other strains. SGJS134 produced approximately 6.5 mM succinate from CO2 and yielded approximately 13.0 mM succinate per dry cell weight. These results may be useful for enhancing the incorporation of CO2 for succinate production in E. coli. Additionally, the metabolic engineering method used in this study will propose the potential of E. coli to convert CO2 to valuable chemicals."
Metabolomic profiling reveals enrichment of cordycepin in senescence process of Cordyceps militaris fruit bodies,"Cordyceps militaris is a species of Cordyceps that is classified in the Cordycipitaceae family and is well known in East Asia as a traditional medicinal mushroom. Its artificial fruit body has been widely cultivated for commercial use in cosmetics, functional food, and medicine. To explore the metabolites associated with fruit body development, we conducted gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses based on developmental stage, which was divided into the growth period (stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3) and aging period (stage 4). We detected 39 biochemical metabolites associated with nucleotide, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism. Cordycepin, one of the representative bioactive compounds in C. militaris, was significantly enriched in stage 4 of aging period and is associated with glucose accumulation. The accumulation of cordycepin in stage 4 of aging period also seems to be related to the glutamine and glutamic acid pathway. Our results also showed enrichment of other bioactive compounds such as mannitol and xylitol in stage 4 of aging period. Our metabolomic profiling based on the developmental stages of C. militaris is useful for exploring bioactive compounds (e.g., cordycepin, mannitol, GABA, and xylitol) that are enriched in stage 4 of aging period and understanding the biosynthetic mechanisms associated with cordycepin production. Through optimization of fruit body cultivation by selecting stage 4 of aging period as a harvesting time, our findings can be utilized in food and medical applications of C. militaris in future."
Mother-Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (M-NICU): A Novel Concept in Newborn Care,"Health facilities in India are faced with the challenge of providing quality newborn care in the face of major skilled human resource shortage. A possible solution is the concept of Mother-Neonatal ICU (M-NICU), where the mother has her bed inside the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) by the side of baby’s warmer. Our observations in M-NICU of a public sector hospital in New Delhi, India, indicate that mothers can be easily trained to follow asepsis routines and monitor the neonates, and are better prepared for their post-discharge care. Incorporating space for both mothers and their newborns in level-II NICUs may provide quality and developmentally supportive newborn care in coming years."

Comprehensive assembly and analysis of the transcriptome of maritime pine developing embryos,"There are clear differences in embryo development between angiosperm and gymnosperm species. Most of the current knowledge on gene expression and regulation during plant embryo development has derived from studies on angiosperms species, in particular from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The few published studies on transcript profiling of conifer embryogenesis show the existence of many putative embryo-specific transcripts without an assigned function. In order to extend the knowledge on the transcriptomic expression during conifer embryogenesis, we sequenced the transcriptome of zygotic embryos for several developmental stages that cover most of Pinus pinaster (maritime pine) embryogenesis."
Na+/K+ Balance and Transport Regulatory Mechanisms in Weedy and Cultivated Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Under Salt Stress,"Salinization is a primary abiotic stress constraining global plant growth and production. Weedy rice, though highly homologous to cultivated rice, is more salt tolerant during seed germination and seedling growth; we hypothesize that this is owing to ionic homeostasis and changes in the expression of genes encoding ion transport regulators."
Transciptome profiling at early infection of Elaeis guineensis by Ganoderma boninense provides novel insights on fungal transition from biotrophic to necrotrophic phase,"Basal stem rot (BSR) caused by hemibiotroph Ganoderma boninense is a devastating disease resulting in a major loss to the oil palm industry. Since there is no physical symptom in oil palm at the early stage of G. boninense infection, characterisation of molecular defense responses in oil palm during early interaction with the fungus is of the utmost importance. Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) seedlings were artificially infected with G. boninense inoculums and root samples were obtained following a time-course of 0, 3, 7, and 11 days-post-inoculation (d.p.i) for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)."
Tendon Healing in the Context of Complex Fractures,"Tendons connect muscle to bone and play an integral role in bone and joint alignment and loading. Tendons act as pulleys that provide anchorage of muscle forces for joint motion and stability, as well as for fracture reduction and realignment. Patients that experience complex fractures also have concomitant soft tissue injuries, such as tendon damage or rupture. Tendon injuries that occur at the time of bone fracture have long-term ramifications on musculoskeletal health, yet these injuries are often disregarded in clinical treatment and diagnosis for patients with bone fractures as well as in basic science approaches for understanding bone repair processes. Delayed assessment of soft tissue injuries during evaluation of trauma can lead to chronic pain, dysfunction, and delayed bone healing even following successful fracture repair, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating damaged tendons early. Treatment strategies for bone repair, such as mechanical stabilization and biological therapeutics, can impact tendon healing and function. Because poor tendon healing following complex fracture can significantly impact the function of tendon during bone fracture healing, a need exists to understand the healing process of complex fractures more broadly, beyond the healing of bone. In this review, we explored the mechanical and biological interaction of bone and tendon in the context of complex fracture, as well as the relevance and potential ramifications of tendon damage following bone fracture, which has particular impact on patients that experience complex fractures, such as from combat, automobile accidents, and other trauma."
The influence of grain size on the magnetic properties of Fe3O4 nanocrystals synthesized by solvothermal method,"The peculiar magnetic properties of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SIONs) have spurred great interest in their potential application in enhancing medical images and drug delivery. Currently hindering the application of nanomagnetic particles in these fields is due to SIONs nonuniform size distribution, agglomeration, non-crystallinity, and low magnetic moment. In this paper, magnetic nanocrystals of different sizes and morphologies were prepared by the solvothermal method, which utilized an n-hexane-surfactant system with Fe(acac)3 and iron-powder precursors. The crystalline structure and particle size of grown SIONs are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). HRTEM showed that the SIONs were approximately 5.6–6.8 nm in size with no agglomeration and a uniform distribution. Within the reaction time, HRTEM also confirmed that the shape and nanocrystals of SIONs had changed from an irregular crystal shape to triangles and quadrilaterals, and finally to hexagonal nanoparticles. According to the test results of the magnetic properties test and the literature, the material that has been synthesized is a superparamagnetic material. And the maximum saturation magnetization was 62.65 emu/g, which is reported among the largest magnetic properties of SIONs at a size of 6.8 nm."
Occurrence of brassinosteroids and influence of 24-epibrassinolide with brassinazole on their content in the leaves and roots of Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Golden Promise,24-epibrassinolide overcame the inhibitory effect of brassinazole on the barley growth and the content of brassinosteroids.
Full steam ahead: direct steam exposure to inhibit spread of invasive aquatic macrophytes,"Biosecurity protocols designed to prevent invader spread have become integral to invasive species management strategies. However, application of many proposed spread-prevention practices is inhibited due to low practicality, high expense, undesirable non-target effects and a lack of known efficacy. Here, we examine the use of direct steam exposure to induce substantial fragment (i.e. propagule stage) degradation of seven invasive macrophytes: Ceratophyllum demersum, Crassula helmsii, Egeria densa, Elodea canadensis, Elodea nuttallii, Lagarosiphon major and Potamogeton crispus. Each species was independently exposed to steam treatments in loose clumps of three fragments, steamed at a distance of 2–3 cm from the source, for varied exposure times: 10 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and 5 min. Furthermore, we develop and apply a novel degradation scale describing visual tissue biodegradation stages and/or resumption of growth for fragmentary propagules. Steam treatments were observed to be highly efficacious, with total degradation being induced by 10 s of direct steam exposure. This was apparent for all species following a seven day recovery period, except C. demersum, which took until 21 days. Conversely, control specimens displayed excellent survival and/or viability (i.e. resumption of growth). Therefore, we argue that this innovative, yet simple technique can be used to improve biosecurity practices to inhibit the spread of invasive macrophytes."
In vivo long-term investigation of tumor bearing mKate2 by an in-house fluorescence molecular imaging system,"Optical imaging is one of the most common, low-cost imaging tools used for investigating the tumor biological behavior in vivo.

"Interaction, Ideology, and Practice in Mental Health Rehabilitation","This paper investigates how two ideologies of mental health rehabilitation—recovery ideology and communal approach—are realized in interactional practices associated with psychosocial rehabilitation. More spesifically, the paper discusses employee selection in the context of the Clubhouse-created Transitional Employment (TE) programme, which offers employment opportunities for rehabilitants. The paper describes how joint decisions are established during the moment-by-moment interactional processes at the Clubhouse. Drawing from the data set of 29 video-recorded rehabilitation group meetings, and Conversation Analysis as a method, the paper analyzes two questions: (1) How do the participants talk about the decision-making process associated with the TE on a “meta” level? And (2) how are the TE employees actually selected in the turn-by-turn sequential unfolding of interaction? When discussing the TE employee selection procedure on a “meta” level, the values of recovery ideology focusing on client empowerment and self-determination are prevalent. Also, the central ideals of the communal approach—openness and collaboration—are defended as decision-making guidelines. However, in the meetings where decisions on the TE employees are concretely made, there is a mismatch between the two ideological approaches to rehabilitation and the actual practices observable in the relevant interactional encounters."
Impact of the variations in potential glycosylation sites of the hemagglutinin of H9N2 influenza virus,"Variations in the potential glycosylation sites were observed in hemagglutinin (HA) sequences of H9N2 avian influenza virus isolated in China, deposited in the Influenza Virus Resource of NCBI before 2017, which showed a deleted glycosylation site at amino acid residue 218, and an introduced glycosylation site at amino acid residue 313. Based on the variations in the glycosylation sites at these amino acids, H9N2 avian influenza viruses could be divided into three categories. Firstly, most of the H9N2 influenza viruses were 218G+ viruses; less 313G+ viruses were isolated between 1997 and 2004. Secondly, the occurrence of the 218G+/313G+ viruses increased, while the 218G+/313G− viruses decreased from 2005 to 2012. Thirdly, from 2013 to 2016, the 218G−/313G+ viruses were predominant compared to the 218G+/313G+ viruses. Here, based on an F/98 virus backbone, a 218G+/313G− virus, two reassortment viruses were generated, and named rF/HA218G+/313G+ and rF/HA 218G+/313G−, respectively. HA protein migration demonstrated that the glycosylation sites at amino acid residues 313 and 218 were both functional. The absence of the glycosylation site at amino acid residue 218 and the presence of the glycosylation site at amino acid residue 313 increased antibody binding and moderately prevented the virus from escaping neutralization with homologous antisera. Additionally, compared to the F/98 virus (218G+/313G−), the viruses rF/HA218G+/313G+ or rF/HA218G−/313G+ showed significantly increased infectivity of MDCK cells, chicken embryo eggs, and trachea and lung tissue of SPF chickens, but did not display differences in airborne spread in chickens or infectivity of mice compared with its parental virus F/98."
Myocardial segmental thickness variability on echocardiography is a highly sensitive and specific marker to distinguish ischemic and non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy in new onset heart failure,"The aim of this study was to determine non-invasive diagnostic markers by echocardiography that differentiate ischemic dilated (ICM) from non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NICM) in patients with new onset heart failure. We identified 100 consecutive new heart failure patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (valvular etiology excluded). Clinical risk factors, medication history, serum biomarkers, ECG and echocardiographic variables were compared between the ICM and NICM groups (as confirmed by coronary angiography). Mean age, left ventricular size and ejection fraction were 56 years, 6.1 cm and 26% respectively. A total of 24% had ICM. Patients with ICM were older (65 vs. 53 years; P < 0.001). No significant difference was observed between ICM and NICM among 18 clinical variables, 7 laboratory tests, 6 EKG parameters and 10 of the 13 echocardiographic markers evaluated. Segmental wall thickness variability, regional wall motion abnormality and RV enlargement on echocardiogram (echo) differentiated ICM from NICM. Segmental thickness variability outperformed wall motion abnormality in diagnosing ICM with a sensitivity and specificity of 79.2 and 98.7% versus 62.5 and 84.2% respectively. RV enlargement was not sensitive but 90.6% specific for predicting NICM. Myocardial segmental thickness variability on echo, resulting from thinned infarcted or hibernating myocardium, is a highly sensitive and specific marker to differentiate ICM from NICM in new onset heart failure."
Seismic Imaging of the Sedimentary System of the Upper Cretaceous Nenjiang Formation in the Northern Songliao Basin,"This paper studied seismic imaging of the sedimentary system of the Nenjiang Formation in the Northern Songliao Basin based on seismic sedimentology. An accurate and detailed depiction and explanation is provided for underground geological bodies within a relative geological period using the stratal slice technology, based on three-order sequence correlations of well logging and seismic data for the purpose of obtaining high-resolution pictures of the sedimentary system. Research results have revealed that the sedimentary system of the Upper Cretaceous Nenjiang Formation in the Northern Songliao Basin includes meandering streams, anastomosing streams, lake deltas, and sediment gravity flow channels. Based on seismic imaging analysis, the genesis and seismic geomorphology of the sedimentary system of the Nenjiang Formation are explored in order to understand the spatial distribution of typical sedimentary bodies and the evolution of streams in the Nenjiang Formation. According to the research results, the sedimentation of the Nenjiang Formation was subject to the delta system in the east and northeast of the formation. The provenance in the northeastern part played a dominant role during the deposition of the Nenjiang Formation for some time; after the earlier maximum flooding in the second and third members of the Nenjiang Formation, the northeastern system began to decline and was gradually replaced by the eastern system. Stratal slices have revealed that a well-developed gravity flow channel system was developed in the first member of the Nenjiang Formation, and massive slip blocks occurred in the second and third members of the formation. The research results indicated that the large gravity flow channel system in the first member of the Nenjiang Formation was formed by streams that emptied directly into the lake; and the slip blocks in the second and third members were the results of gravity sliding of sediments along steep slopes at the delta front."
Metabolomic analyses reveal lipid abnormalities and hepatic dysfunction in non-human primate model for Yersinia pestis,"Pneumonic plague is caused by the aerosolized form of Yersinia pestis and is a highly virulent infection with complex clinical consequences, and without treatment, the fatality rate approaches 100%. The exact mechanisms of disease progression are unclear, with limited work done using metabolite profiling to study disease progression."
Effects of Thickness on the Electrical Conductivity of Sputtered YSZ Film with Nanocrystalline Columnar Microstructure,"In order to investigate the effect of the thickness on the electrical conductivity of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) film, the nanocrystalline columnar-structured YSZ film with thickness of 0.67-2.52 μm was prepared by magnetron sputtering through controlling the deposition time. All the sputtered films with different thicknesses consist of the main phase of cubic YSZ as well as a small amount of monoclinic YSZ. The thicker films exhibit a typical columnar grain structure based on the fractured cross-sectional SEM observations. The average diameters of columnar grains increase from about 40 nm to 100 nm with the film thickness from 0.67 μm to 2.52 μm according to TEM analysis. The thinnest YSZ film with 0.67 μm thickness shows the highest apparent electrical conductivity in the four films in 400–800 °C due to the contribution from the highly conductive film/substrate interfacial region. On the other hand, the real electrical conductivities of YSZ films increase with film thickness from 0.67 μm to 2.52 μm after eliminating the contribution of the film/substrate interface. The increasing film thickness leads to the grain growth as well as the decrement in the volumetric fraction of the resistive columnar grain boundary and a consequent higher real electrical conductivity."
Bipolar Resistive Switching Effect in BiFeO3/Nb:SrTiO3 Heterostructure by RF Sputtering at Room Temperature,"The (001) oriented BiFeO3 thin film was deposited on the Nb: SrTiO3 substrate by radio frequency magnetron sputtering technology, and the bipolar resistive switching effect was observed in the BiFeO3/Nb: SrTiO3 heterostructure. The results showed that the ratio between the high resistance and low resistance was more than two orders at a reading pulse of -0.5 V and it exhibited excellent retention over 3600 s. The current density-voltage characteristic was dominated by the space-charge-limited conduction. The resistive switching effect of the structure was attributed to the trapping/detrapping of the charge carriers."
Nanomechanical Property Measurements of SrTiO3 Submicron-fiber,"Strontium titanate (SrTiO3) submicron-fibers with perovskite structure were successfully synthesized by electrospinning method. The nanomechanical properties of synthesized SrTiO3 were investigated by the novel amplitude modulation-frequency modulation (AM-FM) method based on atomic force microscope and nanoindentation technique. The results of AM-FM show that the resonant frequency of SrTiO3 submicron-fiber is lower than that of the Si substrate, which indicates that the Young’s modulus of SrTiO3 submicron-fiber is smaller than that of Si substrate in the range of 105–125 GPa. Nanoindentation further confirmed the results, showing a value of 104 ± 17 GPa. The atomic force microscope-based AM-FM provides us a new way to study the mechanical performance of low dimensional materials."
Fabrication of High Nano-ZnO Assembled Cotton Fabric with UV Blocking Property,"In order to fabricate a novel ZnO/cotton composite, a high proportion of ZnO nanoparticles were assembled in cotton fibers, and the as-obtained cotton fabric can possess better UV blocking property compared with common ZnO/cotton composite. Firstly, the cotton fibers were pre-treated by hydrogen peroxide solution(H2O2) and sodium hydroxide(NaOH), urea(CON2H4). Secondly, the fabric was fabricated via in situ deposition. The effects of concentration of treatment liquid, ammonia-smoking time and curing temperature on the tensile property of the fabric, UV blocking property and water-washing durability test of as-obtained cotton fabrics were investigated. Thirdly, the as-obtained cotton sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction(XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy(FESEM). It was shown that ZnO nanoparticles were assembled between cotton fibers, the surface and inside of the lumen and the mesopores of cotton fibers, while the content of nano-ZnO assembled in fabric can reach 15.63wt%. It is proved that the finished fabric can obtain a very excellent UV blocking property, under the condition of zinc ion in concentration of 15wt%, ammonia-smoking time for 10 min, curing temperature at 150 °C for 2 min."
A Numerical Study of Densification Behavior of Silicon Carbide Matrix Composites in Isothermal Chemical Vapor Infiltration,"We studied the characteristics of two-scale pore structure of preform in the deposition process and the mass transfer of reactant gas in dual-scale pores, and observed the physiochemical phenomenon associated with the reaction. Thereby, we established mathematical models on two scales, respectively, preform and reactor. These models were used for the numerical simulation of the process of ceramic matrix composites densified by isothermal chemical vapor infiltration (ICVI). The models were used to carry out a systematic study on the influence of process conditions and the preform structure on the densification behaviors. The most important findings of our study are that the processing time could be reduced by about 50% without compromising the quality of the material, if the processing temperature is 950–1 000 °C for the first 70 hours and then raised to 1 100 °C."
Powder Quartz/Nano-TiO2 Composite: Mechanochemical Preparation and Photocatalytic Degradation of Formaldehyde,"Powder quartz (PQ)/nano-TiO2 composite was prepared by a mechanochemical method. Based on as-prepared PQ/nano-TiO2 composite, we prepared interior paints and investigated the degradation efficiency of formaldehyde (DEF). Scanning electron microscopy showed that nano-TiO2 got well dispersed by the adding of PQ. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that the mass ratio of 4:1 was a relatively good proportion for the most production of PQ/nano-TiO2 composite. Fourier transform-infrared spectrometry showed that the peak position of Ti-O-Si bond varied with the milling time. At the early stage, no characteristic peak of Ti-O-Si bond was observed, while at the later stage, new peaks at 902 cm-1 and 937 cm-1 appeared. Meanwhile, PQ/nano-TiO2 composite-based interior paint exhibited significant DEF of 96.3% compared to that consisting of sole nano- TiO2 of 92.0% under visible light illumination. As an abundant mineral resource, PQ would make interior paints with HCHO purifying effect much more efficient and cheaper."
Preparation of Functionalized Graphene Nano-platelets and Use for Adsorption of Pb2+ from Solution,"Functionalized graphene nano-platelets (FGN) were obtained via treating graphene nanoplatelets (GN) with HNO3, and served as adsorbent for the removal of Pb2+ from solutions. We investigated the FGN adsorption capacity for Pb2+ at different initial concentrations, varying pH, contact time and temperature. The characterization results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal analysis (TG/DTG), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method indicated that FGN layers were thin and possess large specific area with oxygen-containing functional groups grafted onto their surface. Meanwhile, the determined equilibrium adsorption capacity of FGN for Pb2+ was 57.765 mg/g and adsorption isotherms well confirmed to Langmuir isotherms models. The results reveals that the FGN has better effect of water treatment."
The Study of Nerve Conduit with Biocompatibility and Electrical Stimulation Effect,"Conductive polymers show great promise because of their electrical property based on bioelectricity in vivo. In order to search electro-activity materials which insure abduction of tissue, we synthesized conductive nerve conduits with poly-dl-lactic-acid (PDLLA) and tetra-aniline (TA). Preparation technology of TA was optimized, and the properties of the conduit were studied. RSC96 cell were used to investigate the toxicity and electrical stimulation effect. SD rats were used to assess biocompatibility in vivo. The results showed that the reaction ratio of 1:1, the reaction time of 2 h and the HCl concentration of 2 mol/L were the optimum conditions for synthesis of TA. The influence of TA content on the mechanical properties, hydrophilicity, conductivity and microstructure of the nerve conduit was evaluated. Cell and histocompatibility study showed PDLLA/TA possessed good biocompatibility. These results showed it had application values in tissue projects."
Synthesis of Fluorescent Carbon Quantum Dots and Their Application in the Plant Cell Imaging,"Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) exhibit tremendous advantages for plant growth study due to its strong fluorescence and good biocompatibility. The fluorescent CQDs were synthesized by the one-step microwave method with the raw materials of citric acid (CA) and urea (UR), and expressed a unique green fluorescence with the optimal excitation wavelength of over 400 nm through adjusting the doping of N elements. It is demonstrated that CQDs can act as deliver media in plant and fluorescent probes for plant cell imaging through directly cultivated in the seedlings of melon and wheat, respectively. Based on the effects of the fluorescent CQDs on plants growth, we can further study the mechanisms of the ions transport in plants."
Electrochemical Sensing of Heavy Metal Ions based on Monodisperse Single-crystal Fe3O4 Microspheres,"Single-crystal Fe3O4 with monodisperse microspheres structure has been used for individual electrochemical detection of heavy metal ions. Morphology and structure of the as-prepared Fe3O4 microspheres were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Meanwhile the electrochemical properties of the Fe3O4 microspheres modified glass carbon electrodes (GCE) were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the enhanced electrochemical response in stripping voltammetry for individual detection of Pb(II), Hg(II), Cu(II), and Cd(II) was evaluated using square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV). With high specific surface area and excellent catalytic activity toward heavy metal ions, the as-prepared monodisperse and single-crystal Fe3O4 microspheres show a preferable sensing sensitivity (22.2 μA/μM) and limit of detection (0.0699 μM) toward Pb(II). Furthermore, the electrochemical sensor of Fe3O4 microspheres exhibits excellent stability and it also offers potential practical applicability for the determination of heavy metal ions in real water samples. This study provides a potential simple and low cost iron oxide for the construction of sensitive electrochemical sensors applied to monitor and control the pollution of toxic metal ions."
Comparative Study on Oxidation Behavior of Fe-5wt% Cr Alloy in Various Mixed Atmospheres at 900–1 000 °C,"The high-temperature oxidation behavior of Fe-5wt% Cr alloys was investigated in both N2+5vol% H2O and N2+21vol% O2+5vol% H2O atmospheres at 900–1000 °C for 120 min by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The oxidation kinetics, phase composition and cross-sectional microstructure of the oxide scale were contrastively analyzed in both environments. Also, the phase composition of oxide scale was measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The cross-sectional microstructure and the interface elements distribution were studied by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The experimental results demonstrated that the growth rate and the mass gain of the oxide scale in the N2+5vol% H2O atmosphere were both significantly lower than the growth rate and the mass gain in the N2+21vol% O2+5vol% H2O atmosphere. The apparent layer structure of the oxide scale could be observed in an oxygen-enriched environment and did not appear in a pure water vapor without oxygen. In addition, the inner oxide layer growth mechanisms and the outward diffusion of the metal cations were introduced in the atmosphere of N2+5vol% H2O. Consequently, the effects of temperature and humid atmosphere on the Fe-Cr spinal scale evolution were also discussed."
Effect of Current Density on Microstructure and Corrosion Behavior of Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation Coated 6063 Aluminum Alloy,"Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) coatings were fabricated on 6063 aluminum alloy in a cheap and convenient electrolyte. The effect of different current densities, i e, 5, 10, 15, and 20 A/dm2 on the microstructure and corrosion behavior of coatings was comprehensively studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), stereoscopic microscopy, potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), respectively. It is found that the pore density decreases and the pore size increases with increasing current density. The XRD results show that the coatings are only composed of α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3. Potentiodynamic polarization test proves that the coating formed under 10 A/dm2 possesses the best anticorrosion property. The long time EIS test shows that the coating under 10 A/dm2 is able to protect the aluminum alloy substrate after long time of immersion in 0.59 M NaCl solution, which confirms the salt solution immersion test results in 2 M NaCl solution."
Synthesis and Characterization of Carboxyl-terminated Polyethylene Glycol Functionalized Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles,"Colloidal mesoporous silica nanoparticles functionalized with carboxy-terminated polyethylene glycol (CMS-PEG-COOH) were successfully synthesized by covalently grafting dicarboxy-terminated polyethylene glycol (HOOC-PEG-COOH) on the surface of the amino functionalized CMS nanoparticles with amide bond as a cross linker. Moreover, the structural and particle properties of CMS-PEG-COOH were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The nanomaterials presented a relatively uniform spherical shape morphology with diameters of about 120 nm,and favorable dispersibility in weak acid solution. The CMS-PEG-COOH exhibited no changes in the state of amorphous, while the mesopores sizes of 5.25 nm might provide the nanomaterials with large capacity for the loading and releasing of drugs. So the results indicated that CMS-PEG-COOH might be a critical nanomaterial for drug delivery system in the future."
hoDCA: higher order direct-coupling analysis,"Direct-coupling analysis (DCA) is a method for protein contact prediction from sequence information alone. Its underlying principle is parameter estimation for a Hamiltonian interaction function stemming from a maximum entropy model with one- and two-point interactions. Vastly growing sequence databases enable the construction of large multiple sequence alignments (MSA). Thus, enough data exists to include higher order terms, such as three-body correlations."
Time-lagged Ordered Lasso for network inference,"Accurate gene regulatory networks can be used to explain the emergence of different phenotypes, disease mechanisms, and other biological functions. Many methods have been proposed to infer networks from gene expression data but have been hampered by problems such as low sample size, inaccurate constraints, and incomplete characterizations of regulatory dynamics. Since expression regulation is dynamic, time-course data can be used to infer causality, but these datasets tend to be short or sparsely sampled. In addition, temporal methods typically assume that the expression of a gene at a time point depends on the expression of other genes at only the immediately preceding time point, while other methods include additional time points without any constraints to account for their temporal distance. These limitations can contribute to inaccurate networks with many missing and anomalous links."
"Determination of antioxidant capacity, phenolic acid composition and antiproliferative effect associated with phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity in some plants naturally growing under salt stress","Being a considerable abiotic stress factor particularly for arid and semi-arid regions, salt stress may significantly limit the plant growth and yield. Plant’s response to salt stress involves secondary metabolites and especially phenylpropanoids that significantly contribute to the antioxidant activity of plant tissues. In addition to their important role in the control of cancer, phenylpropanoid compounds act as quenchers of singlet oxygen formation, free radical scavengers and reducing agents. One of the important gateway enzymes in the secondary metabolic pathway leading to the synthesis of phenylpropanoids is phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). The aim of this study is to determine the phenolic acid composition, antioxidant capacity and antiproliferative effect associated with PAL activity in some plants that grow naturally under salt stress. The PAL activities of Salsola nitraria, Salvia halophila and Cyathobasis fruticulosa were evaluated. The antioxidant content of the extracts was studied and they were evaluated for their antioxidant activity. MTT assay was used to determine the antiproliferative effects of the extracts on HT-29 cells. Also, phenolic acids in extracts, namely p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid, gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and syringic acid were screened using LC-MS/MS. Considering all results, C. fruticulosa with its highest PAL activity (62.85 μmol.min−1.mg−1 protein) has become prominent among the three plants. C. fruticulosa extract exhibited the highest antioxidant content with total phenolic content (120.36 mg/g) as the major antioxidant component. It was also found to be the plant extract richest in p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid, gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and syringic acid as phenolic acids. Besides its marked antiproliferative activity against HT-29 cells, C. fruticulosa extract had the highest antioxidant activity compared with other extracts. In conclusion, the antioxidant and anticancer properties of plants naturally growing under salt stress may partly arise from their high PAL activities. Therefore, compounds obtained through plants exhibiting high levels of PAL activities could be used in the development of new pharmaceuticals as an antioxidant and anticancer agent."
Urinary β2-microglobulin and disease activity in patients with tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome,Urinary β2-microglobulin (Uβ2M) is elevated in tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome and has emerged as an important diagnostic tool. This study aims to determine whether Uβ2M correlates with uveitis activity in TINU.
The pay-off of hypsodonty - timing and dynamics of crown growth and wear in molars of Soay sheep,"Several lineages of herbivorous mammals have evolved hypsodont cheek teeth to increase the functional lifespan of their dentition. While the selective drivers of this trend and the developmental processes involved have been studied in greater detail, thus far no quantitative information is available on the relationship between additional investment into tooth growth and the resulting extension of the functional period of these teeth. To achieve this, we performed a detailed analysis of molar crown growth in known-age Soay sheep repeatedly injected with different fluorochromes."
Whole-exome sequencing identified a novel mutation of AURKC in a Chinese family with macrozoospermia,Macrozoospermia is a rare sperm morphologic abnormality associated with male infertility and is characterized by a high percentage of spermatozoa with large irregular heads. The aim of this study was to identify the genetic cause of an infertile male with macrozoospermia from a consanguineous family.
Mitotic activity patterns and cytoskeletal changes throughout the progression of diapause developmental program in Daphnia,"Diapause is a form of dormancy that is genetically predetermined to allow animals to overcome harsh environmental conditions. It is induced by predictive environmental cues bringing cellular activity levels into a state of suspended animation. Entering diapause requires organismal, molecular and cellular adaptation to severely reduced energy flows. Cells must therefore have evolved strategies that prepare them for periods with limited metabolic resources. However, changes that occur on the (sub-)cellular level have not been thoroughly described."
Towards an Archaeological Theory of Infrastructure,"Infrastructure makes up a considerable portion of the material culture that archaeologists study. Whether measured in terms of spatial extension or just sheer mass, infrastructural entities are often among the biggest artifacts that archaeologists encounter in the field. Yet there is no overarching theoretical framework for the archaeological study of infrastructure, and its different varieties tend to be treated in a rather piecemeal fashion. This article therefore seeks to lay some foundations for a more theoretically unified approach to infrastructure within the discipline. It offers a general definition or infrastructure, as well as a basic typology. The typology presented is fourfold, encompassing (1) static infrastructure (e.g., terraces, harbors and storehouses), (2) circulatory infrastructure (e.g., highways, canals, aqueducts, and sewers), (3) bounding infrastructure (e.g., palisades, ditches, and corrals), and (4) signaling infrastructure (e.g., lighthouses and beacons). By analogy with more heavily theorized categories such as urbanism, it is suggested that infrastructure should be a topic of global comparative analysis within archaeology and its allied disciplines."
Computer comparisons in the presence of performance variation,"Performance variability, stemming from non-deterministic hardware and software behaviors or deterministic behaviors such as measurement bias, is a well-known phenomenon of computer systems which increases the difficulty of comparing computer performance metrics and is slated to become even more of a concern as interest in Big Data analytic increases. Conventional methods use various measures (such as geometric mean) to quantify the performance of different benchmarks to compare computers without considering this variability which may lead to wrong conclusions. In this paper, we propose three resampling methods for performance evaluation and comparison: a randomization test for a general performance comparison between two computers, bootstrapping confidence estimation, and an empirical distribution and five-number-summary for performance evaluation. The results show that for both PARSEC and high-variance BigDataBench benchmarks 1) the randomization test substantially improves our chance to identify the difference between performance comparisons when the difference is not large; 2) bootstrapping confidence estimation provides an accurate confidence interval for the performance comparison measure (e.g., ratio of geometric means); and 3) when the difference is very small, a single test is often not enough to reveal the nature of the computer performance due to the variability of computer systems.We further propose using empirical distribution to evaluate computer performance and a five-number-summary to summarize computer performance. We use published SPEC 2006 results to investigate the sources of performance variation by predicting performance and relative variation for 8,236 machines. We achieve a correlation of predicted performances of 0.992 and a correlation of predicted and measured relative variation of 0.5. Finally, we propose the utilization of a novel biplotting technique to visualize the effectiveness of benchmarks and cluster machines by behavior. We illustrate the results and conclusion through detailed Monte Carlo simulation studies and real examples."
Nickel Doping on Cobalt Oxide Thin Film Using by Sputtering Process-a Route for Surface Modification for p-type Metal Oxide Gas Sensors,"This study proposes a route for surface modification for p-type cobalt oxide-based gas sensors. We deposit a thin layer of Ni on the Co oxide film by sputtering process and annealed at 350 °C for 15 min in air, which changes a typical sputtered film surface into one interlaced with a high density of hemispherical nanoparticles. Our in-depth materials characterization using transmission electron microscopy discloses that the microstructure evolution is the result of an extensive inter-diffusion of Co and Ni, and that the nanoparticles are nickel oxide dissolving some Co. Sensor performance measurement unfolds that the surface modification results in a significant sensitivity enhancement, nearly 200% increase for toluene (at 250 °C) and CO (at 200 °C) gases in comparison with the undoped samples."
Transfer Matrix Algorithm for Computing the Geometric Quantities of a Square Lattice Polymer,"I develop a transfer matrix algorithm for computing the geometric quantities of a square lattice polymer with nearest-neighbor interactions. The radius of gyration, the end-to-end distance, and the monomer-to-end distance were computed as functions of the temperature. The computation time scales as ≲ 1.8N with a chain length N, in contrast to the explicit enumeration where the scaling is ~ 2.7N. Various techniques for reducing memory requirements are implemented."
Optical Reconstruction of Full-color Optical Scanning Holography Images using an Iterative Direct Binary Search Algorithm,"We introduce a process for optically reconstructing full-color holographic images recorded by optical scanning holography. A complex RGB-color hologram was recorded and converted into a binary hologram using a direct binary search (DBS) algorithm. The generated binary hologram was then optically reconstructed using a spatial light modulator. The discrepancies between the reconstructed object sizes and colors due to chromatic aberration were corrected by adjusting the reconstruction parameters in the DBS algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first optical reconstruction of a full-color hologram recorded by optical scanning holography."
Ionic Conductivity in Lithium-Borate-Tantalate Compound Glasses,"We have investigated the ionic conductivity and dielectric relaxation in Li2B4O7 (LBO) and Li2OB2O3-Ta2O5 (LBTO) glasses. The sample was synthesized by using the melt quenching method. The frequency dependence of the electrical data from the LBO and LBTO glasses has been analyzed in the frameworks of the impedance Cole-Cole formalism and the universal power-law representation driven by the modified fractional Rayleigh equation. The potential barriers in the LBO and the LBTO glasses turn out to be the same. Comparing with the dc and ac activation energies of the LBO glass, these energies of the LBTO glass decrease due to the increasing Coulomb interaction of inter-cationic interaction."
Investigation of X-ray-induced Defects on Metals and Silicon by Using Coincidence Doppler Broadening Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy,"The mechanical properties of Al, Ti, Fe, and Cu metals p-type Si, and n-type Si were investigated by using coincidence Doppler broadening (CDB) positron annihilation spectroscopy. The samples in this experiment were irradiated by using X-rays at generating powers for up to 9 kW. The data taken after the irradiation showed all the characteristic features predicted from defects with vacancies. The S parameter values of the metals were generally less than those of semiconductors such as p-type Si and n-type Si. The relationship between n-type Si and p-type Si were more affected when n-type Si rather than p-type Si was irradiated with X-rays."
A High Efficient Piezoelectric Windmill using Magnetic Force for Low Wind Speed in Wireless Sensor Networks,"An innovative small-scale piezoelectric energy harvester has been proposed to gather wind energy. A conventional horizontal-axis wind power generation has a low generating efficiency at low wind speed. To overcome this weakness, we designed a piezoelectric windmill optimized at low-speed wind. A piezoelectric device having high energy conversion efficiency is used in a small windmill. The maximum output power of the windmill was about 3.14 mW when wind speed was 1.94 m/s. Finally, the output power and the efficiency of the system were compared with a conventional wind power system. This work will be beneficial for the piezoelectric energy harvesting technology to be applied to the real world such as wireless sensor networks (WSN)."
Continuous fixed-bed studies for adsorptive remediation of phenol by garlic peel powder,"In the quest for eco-friendly and cost-effective adsorbents for the removal of phenol from aqueous systems, garlic peel has been identified as a potential candidate in our earlier study. In the current investigations, we have studied the performance of garlic peel powder in packed fixed-bed column, to assess its potential for real-time deployment for remediation of phenol-contaminated aqueous effluents. Accordingly, parametric studies were carried out with reference to feed concentration, bed height, and flow rate. The experiments indicated the suitability of garlic peel powder-packed columns for remediation of phenol present in aqueous effluents. Salient observations include the improvement of adsorption and remediation efficiency at lower feed flow rates. The assessment of the experimental data using different theoretical models indicated the applicability of Yoon–Nelson model for the adsorption of phenol by garlic peel powder."
Enhancing organic waste decomposition with addition of phosphorus and calcium through different sources,This study assessed the constituent element in rock phosphate (RP) that is responsible for enhancing quick decomposition of cow dung–waste paper mixtures during vermicomposting.
Study of an argon dielectric barrier discharge reactor with atmospheric pressure for material treatment,"In this study, effects of the variation in the dielectric barrier discharge’s (DBD) gap distance and the nature of dielectric layers which cover both of the reactor electrodes on the electron density, mass fraction of excited argon atoms across the discharge gap, mean electron energy, ion and electron current density, and electron temperature are investigated at atmospheric pressure. In order to find the optimal reactor gap, the DBD’s average power consumption is studied. The achievements show that when the value of dielectric constant is increased from 7.6 to 10, discharge gap of 1 mm still demonstrates the maximum power consumption, which can be considered as the optimum discharge gap. To optimize the characteristics of one-dimensional modeling of DBD system for material treatment, various types of materials with different values of the permittivity [aluminum, glass (quartz) and silicon] are embedded in the discharge gap between the two electrodes. In this case, the reactor gap is changed from 0.5 mm to 2 mm, while the dielectric constant of the dielectric layers which cover both of the metallic electrodes is assumed to be 10. Compared to the other examined materials, our numerical results illustrate that the treated material with higher value of the relative permittivity (silicon) has greater influences on the variations in the electron density, argon ion density and also total plasma current density than in the values of excited argon atom density, mass fraction of excited argon atoms and also average power consumption."
Biofabrication of vessel-like structures with alginate di-aldehyde—gelatin (ADA-GEL) bioink,"One of the key challenges in the field of blood vessel engineering is the in vitro production of small and large diameter vessels. Considering that a combination of alginate di-aldehyde and gelatin (ADA-GEL) has been successfully applied for different biofabrication approaches, the aim of this study was to exploit ADA-GEL for the fabrication of vessel structures with diameters up to 4 mm. To explore plotting possibilities and to study the swelling behaviour, a library of vessel-like constructs with different diameters made from 2, 3 and 4% (w/v) alginate was created by using various hand-crafted double-needle extrusion systems. Vessel diameters were varied through changes of the double-needle core and outer diameters. A straightforward model for the production of vessel of different diameters from a variety of double-needle systems was established and vessel-constructs with diameters of up to 3.7 mm could be created. It was successfully demonstrated that an artificial vessel, consisting of an outer layer of 7.5% ADA50-GEL50 and an inner core of 3% gelatin, can support the proliferation and migration of an immobilized co-culture containing fibroblast (NHDF) and endothelial (HUVEC) cells. The openness and tightness of the hollow ADA-GEL structures were further confirmed by a dye injection test. Nanoindentation was performed to determine the Young’s modulus of the used materials. Cell vitality was proved after 1, 2 and 3 weeks of incubation. The results showed a nearly twofold increase of viable cells per week. Fluorescent images confirmed cell migration during the whole incubation time."
Factors predictive of high-output ileostomy: a retrospective single-center comparative study,"High-output syndrome (HOS) is a complication of ileostomy, which can affect quality of life significantly; however, its exact cause remains unknown. The aim of this study was to establish the frequency, as well as the preoperative and intraoperative factors predictive of HOS."
"Electrons Trapped in Solid Neon–Hydrogen Mixtures Below \(1\, \hbox {K}\)",We report on an electron spin resonance study of electrons stabilized in solid films of neon–hydrogen mixtures. We found that these films are highly porous and may absorb large amount of liquid helium. We observed that free electrons can be stabilized in two different positions: in a pure neon environment and in \(\hbox {H}_{2}\) clusters formed in the pores of solid neon. It turned out that the presence of the superfluid helium film suppresses the escape of the trapped electrons via diffusion through the pores and stimulates their accumulation in the \(\hbox {H}_{2}\) clusters even in Ne samples of the best available purity. We propose several possible explanations for this behavior.
Anti-ICAM-1 antibody-modified nanostructured lipid carriers: a pulmonary vascular endothelium-targeted device for acute lung injury therapy,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome without effective treatment. Targeting delivery of glucocorticoid to lung shows potential efficacy for ALI based on their anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties, breaking through their clinical application limitation due to systemic side effects. This work was aimed to establish lung-targeted dexamethasone (DEX) loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) with opposite surface charge and investigate their therapeutic effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mice."
Assessing the quality of medical death certification: a case study of concordance between national statistics and results from a medical record review in a regional hospital in the Philippines,"Medical certificates of cause of death (MCCOD) issued by hospital physicians are a key input to vital registration systems. Deaths certified by hospital physicians have been implicitly considered to be of high quality, but recent evidence suggests otherwise. We conducted a medical record review (MRR) of hospital MCCOD in the Philippines and compared the cause of death concordance with certificates coded by the Philippines Statistics Authority (PSA)."
Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix) provides the main contribution to Shaoyao-Gancao decoction on enhancements of CYP3A4 and MDR1 expression via pregnane X receptor pathway in vitro,"Chinese herbal formula Shaoyao Gancao decoction (SGD) is often used as an adjuvant with chemotherapeutic agents to treat cancer. Due to the herb-drug interactions, the alternations of drug metabolic enzyme and drug transporters induced by SGD deserve to be explored. We aimed to investigate the effect of SGD on the pregnane X receptor (PXR)-mediated transcriptional regulation of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and drug transporter multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) in vitro. Besides, we assessed the contribution of constituent herbs to SGD on the regulation of CYP3A4 and MDR1."
Beyond surgery: clinical and economic impact of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery programs,"Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is a perioperative management based on multimodality and multidisciplinary work. ERAS has been shown to have important clinical and economic benefits, but its spread remains slow worldwide."
Age and sex differences in the association between access to medical care and health outcomes among older Chinese,Whether the association between access to medical care and health outcomes differs by age and gender among older adults in China is unclear. We aimed to investigate the associations between self-reported inadequate access to care and multiple health outcomes among older men and women in mainland China.
Exploring MEST: a new universal teaching strategy for school health services to promote positive mental health literacy and mental wellbeing among Norwegian adolescents,"Mental health among adolescents is an important public health challenge. School health services perform central public health functions in Norwegian municipalities, where school nurses are uniquely positioned to educate and promote mental health among adolescents. MEST (MEST is not an acronym; MEST is a short version of the Norwegian word for coping) is a newly developed universal working strategy for school health services that aims to promote positive mental health literacy (MHL) and mental wellbeing in the adolescent population. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential outcome mean differences in positive MHL and mental wellbeing between adolescents who participated and those who did not participate in MEST over a school year."
A methodology to design a performance management system in preventive care,"Preventive care has gained increasing attention in health reforms around the world due to its ability to reduce the burden of disease and to save health costs. Nevertheless, there is a gap in terms of the development of reliable systems to measure and evaluate performance of preventive care in order to support decision-making and increase service outcomes. The aim of this study is to define a methodology for designing a performance management system (PMS) in order to effectively support the planning, control and evaluation of preventive care and to identify the factors that influence such a process."
An 8-week diet high in cereal fiber and coffee but free of red meat does not improve beta-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized controlled trial,"Higher dietary intake of fibers and coffee, but lower red meat intake is associated with reduced risk for type 2 diabetes in epidemiological studies. We hypothesized that a calorie-restricted diet, which is high in fiber and coffee, but free of red meat, improves beta-cell function in patients with T2D."
Learning to speak Franklin: nature as co-teacher,"Through the personal this article seeks to extend the lived experience felt by the authors that all-inclusive nature, the more-than-human world, is agential and possesses the potential to be considered as guide and co-teacher. As a combination of vignettes and reflections it is auto-ethnographic (Holman-Jones 2013) in tone and method. Yet this personal ethnography is extended by an attempt to include the voice of the river and its more-than-human inhabitants. Throughout the paper there is a persistent concern for the etymological roots of the terms wild and pedagogy that anchors the article in its core concerns of self-will and agency. Twin voices are utilised in parallel to explore several touchstones of wild pedagogies."
Estimating levels of HIV testing coverage and use in prevention of mother-to-child transmission among women of reproductive age in Zambia,"Mother to child transmission of HIV (MTCT) still remains a challenge affecting many countries. Globally, an estimated 150,000 children were newly infected with HIV in 2015, over 90% of them in Sub-Saharan Africa through MTCT. In Zambia approximately 500,000 babies are born and 40,000 acquire the infection vertically if there is no intervention annually. This study estimated the HIV testing coverage and associated factors among Zambian women of reproductive age 15–49 years."
Representations of solutions to linear and bilinear difference equations and systems of bilinear difference equations,"We represent general solution to a homogeneous linear difference equation of second order in terms of a specially chosen solution to the equation and apply it to get a representation of general solution to the bilinear difference equation in terms of a solution to an associate difference equation of second order, considerably generalizing some recent results in an elegant way. We also present the corresponding representations for some systems of bilinear difference equations. Many historical notes not so known to wide audience are also presented, and we offer an answer to an open question regarding the attribution of the bilinear difference equation."
Feasibility of a Radiant Floor Cooling System for Residential Buildings with Massive Concrete Slab in a Hot and Humid Climate,"In Korea, radiant floor heating systems are commonly used in residential buildings, even high-rise houses. If these existing radiant floor heating panels could be used for cooling as well, additional benefits beyond the basic advantages of radiant heating and cooling systems in terms of energy efficiency and comfort level could be conferred upon the homeowner, such as avoiding redundant investments for both heating and cooling equipment, and reducing the area occupied by the equipment. However, the comfort requirement of floor surface temperature has to be satisfied, because the human body comes in direct contact with the floor surface. In addition, dehumidification equipment is required to remove the latent load and to prevent surface condensation. It may be particularly difficult to apply such a system in high-rise residential buildings with massive concrete slabs as compared to light-weight buildings, because of the complexity of the system configuration and the thermal capacity of the building structure. In this study, the feasibility of radiant floor cooling systems (RFCS) for residential buildings with massive concrete slabs was evaluated. The strategy for the configuration and arrangement of an RFCS was based on the current configuration of the heating and cooling system as well as the cooling load. Then, through field testing, the performance of this system for cooling and condensation prevention was evaluated along with the occupants’ characteristics for adjusting parameters related to thermal comfort. As a result, an RFCS combined with supplementary equipment for dehumidification and cooling would satisfy the requirements for cooling and condensation prevention in a residential house with multi-zones."
Time-Dependent Deformations of Eccentrically Loaded Reinforced Concrete Columns,"If reinforced concrete columns and walls in high-rise buildings are subjected to axial load for a sustained duration, long-term lateral deformation (or curvature) as well as axial shortening increase over time due to the creep and shrinkage of concrete. In the present study, sustained load tests were performed to evaluate the time-dependent axial shortening and lateral displacement occurring in eccentrically loaded columns. A test set-up using post-tensioning steel rods was introduced for the sustained loading with or without eccentricity. The test results showed that the lateral displacement as well as the axial shortening increased over the sustained duration but the increasing rate of the long-term deformations rapidly decreased with increasing time. The time-dependent axial shortening and lateral displacement increasing with time were predicted by using the age-adjusted effective modulus method based on the creep and shrinkage models of ACI 209. The predictions agreed well with the test results."
Process for Integrating Constructability into the Design Phase in High-Rise Concrete Buildings: Focused on Temporary Work,"With the increase in high-rise building construction, failure to consider constructability in the design phase can result in huge wastes in the construction phase, as well as losing opportunities for design improvement. However, existing approaches for reflecting constructability rely heavily on reviews, resulting in an inefficient decision-making process. Thus, by considering appropriate timing and detail levels when applying construction knowledge, this study proposes a process for integrating constructability activities related to temporary work into the design phase in high-rise concrete buildings. Through an investigation of information-dependency relationships, 22 constructability activities were linked with 33 design activities. Further, these activities’ implementation processes were constructed based on optimized information flows from a partitioned dependency structure matrix. The results of this study can help a project team address constructability issues at the appropriate time during the design process and will contribute to improving the efficiency of the overall project operation in high-rise building construction."
Parameters of stochastic models for electroencephalogram data as biomarkers for child’s neurodevelopment after cerebral malaria,"The objective of this study was to test statistical features from the electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings as predictors of neurodevelopment and cognition of Ugandan children after coma due to cerebral malaria. The increments of the frequency bands of EEG time series were modeled as Student processes; the parameters of these Student processes were estimated and used along with clinical and demographic data in a machine-learning algorithm for the prediction of children’s neurodevelopmental and cognitive scores 6 months after cerebral malaria illness. The key innovation of this work is in the identification of stochastic EEG features that can serve as language-independent markers of the impact of cerebral malaria on the developing brain. The results can enhance prognostic determination of which children are in most need of rehabilitative interventions, which is especially important in resource-constrained settings such as sub-Saharan Africa."
Cognitive Load Theory for debriefing simulations: implications for faculty development,"The debriefing is an essential component of simulation-based training for healthcare professionals, but learning this complex skill can be challenging for simulation faculty. There are multiple competing priorities for a debriefer’s attention that can contribute to a high mental workload, which may adversely affect debriefer performance and consequently learner outcomes. In this paper, we conceptualize the debriefer as a learner of debriefing skills and we discuss Cognitive Load Theory to categorize the many potential mental loads that can affect the faculty debriefer as learner. We then discuss mitigation strategies that can be considered by faculty development programmes to enhance professional development of debriefing staff."
Distribution and synchronized massive flowering of Sasa borealis in the forests of Korean National Parks,"Genus Sasa, dwarf bamboos, are considered to be species that lower biodiversity in the temperate forests of East Asia. Although they have a long interval, they, the monocarpic species, have a unique characteristic of large-scale synchronized flowering. Therefore, once they have flowered and then declined, it may be an opportunity for suppressed surrounding species. A previous study reported that Sasa borealis showed specialized flowering nationwide with a peak in 2015. However, this was based on data from a social network service and field survey at Mt. Jeombong. Therefore, we investigated S. borealis in the forests of five national parks in order to determine whether this rare synchronized flowering occurred nationwide, as well as its spatial distribution."
"Unraveling the diversity, phylogeny, and ecological role of cryptic Coleopteran species of Vadodara district: a first comparative approach from India","More than 350 K described species, Coleoptera (beetles) represent the most diverse order from Class Insecta in the entire animal kingdom. However, their phylogeny is highly controversial due to their morphological crypticness and multiple markers used previously for sequence homology. Although many studies suggest that their diversity currently relies majorly on morphological analysis, nevertheless DNA barcodes may provide a functional, standardized tool for their unique identification. In the present report, a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene has been proposed as standard DNA barcoding marker for the identification of organisms."
Resection of lesions in the ileum of patients with IgG4-related disease may ameliorate disease progression without steroid administration,"IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a pathological condition that is characterized by an infiltrate composed of IgG4-positive plasma cells and recently recognized as an immune-mediated condition. It causes tissue throughout the body to become stiff and thickened due to autoimmune reactions that cause fibrosis and scarring. Disease-related changes commonly occur in the salivary glands, bile duct, pancreas, and lungs, but are seldom seen in the small bowel. A diagnosis of IgG4-RD is suspected if a high level of IgG4 is found on a blood test. The ideal diagnostic method is pathological examination, but because the clinical manifestations of IgG4-RD are very diverse and nonspecific, the disease may often go undiagnosed until an unrelated biopsy or resection specimen is obtained. The most common treatment for IgG4-RD is steroid use. However, tapering or stopping steroid administration is seen to result in recurrence in approximately 50% of cases. A complete cure is therefore considered extremely difficult."
Laparoscopic removal of an ingested fish bone that penetrated the stomach and was embedded in the pancreas: a case report,"The gastrointestinal tract can occasionally be perforated or penetrated by an ingested foreign body, such as a fish bone. However, there are very few reported cases in which an ingested fish bone penetrated the gastrointestinal tract and was embedded in the pancreas."
Emotional intelligence training intervention among trainee teachers: a quasi-experimental study,"Emotional intelligence (EI) has often been linked to improvements in professional performance. Indeed, generic competencies related to EI have been included in university curricula. However, learning EI involves significant time and effort on the part of students, and this may hinder the acquisition of specific content for each degree. In this study, an intervention to develop EI in higher education students is described and evaluated."
Mind-wandering rates fluctuate across the day: evidence from an experience-sampling study,"Previous research has demonstrated reliable fluctuations in attentional processes during the course of the day. Everyday life experience sampling, during which participants respond to “probes” delivered at random intervals throughout the day on their mobile devices, is an effective tool for capturing such diurnal fluctuations in a naturalistic way. The existence of diurnal fluctuations in the case of mind-wandering, however, has not been examined to date. We did so in two studies. In the first study, we employed everyday experience sampling to obtain self-reports from 146 university students who rated the degree of free movement in their thoughts multiple times per day over five days. These time course data were analyzed using multilevel modelling. Freely moving thought was found to fluctuate reliably over the course of the day, with lower ratings reported in the early morning and afternoon and higher ratings around midday and evening. In the second study, we replicated these effects with a reanalysis of data from a past everyday experience-sampling study. We also demonstrated differences in parameter values for the models representing freely moving thought and two common conceptualizations of mind-wandering: task-unrelated thought and stimulus-independent thought. Taken together, the present results establish and replicate a complex pattern of change over the course of the day in how freely thought moves, while also providing further evidence that freedom of movement is dissociable from other dimensions of thought such as its task-relatedness and stimulus-dependence. Future research should focus on probing possible mechanisms behind circadian fluctuations of thought dynamics."
Towards efficient human–machine collaboration: effects of gaze-driven feedback and engagement on performance,"Referential success is crucial for collaborative task-solving in shared environments. In face-to-face interactions, humans, therefore, exploit speech, gesture, and gaze to identify a specific object. We investigate if and how the gaze behavior of a human interaction partner can be used by a gaze-aware assistance system to improve referential success. Specifically, our system describes objects in the real world to a human listener using on-the-fly speech generation. It continuously interprets listener gaze and implements alternative strategies to react to this implicit feedback. We used this system to investigate an optimal strategy for task performance: providing an unambiguous, longer instruction right from the beginning, or starting with a shorter, yet ambiguous instruction. Further, the system provides gaze-driven feedback, which could be either underspecified (“No, not that one!”) or contrastive (“Further left!”). As expected, our results show that ambiguous instructions followed by underspecified feedback are not beneficial for task performance, whereas contrastive feedback results in faster interactions. Interestingly, this approach even outperforms unambiguous instructions (manipulation between subjects). However, when the system alternates between underspecified and contrastive feedback to initially ambiguous descriptions in an interleaved manner (within subjects), task performance is similar for both approaches. This suggests that listeners engage more intensely with the system when they can expect it to be cooperative. This, rather than the actual informativity of the spoken feedback, may determine the efficiency of information uptake and performance."
Forms of explanation and why they may matter,"Explanations from neuroscience are threatening to replace those from psychology in the eyes and hands of journalists, university administrators, granting agencies, and research students. If replacement happens, much of psychology will exist only as part of the historical record. It, thus, may be useful to understand what forms of explanation are used by the two fields. Such an understanding may help us explain how each field can contribute to the other and why they are different. I review several templates of psychological and neuroscientific explanation, and criticize some others. I argue that psychology (and neuroscience) should continue to exist. Neuroscience is not better than psychology, and it cannot replace psychology."
Dynamic prediction during perception of everyday events,"The ability to predict what is going to happen in the near future is integral for daily functioning. Previous research suggests that predictability varies over time, with increases in prediction error at those moments that people perceive as boundaries between meaningful events. These moments also tend to be points of rapid change in the environment. Eye tracking provides a method for noninterruptive measurement of prediction as participants watch a movie of an actor performing a series of actions. In two studies, we used eye tracking to study the time course of prediction around event boundaries. In both studies, viewers looked at objects that were about to be touched by the actor shortly before the objects were contacted, demonstrating predictive looking. However, this behavior was modulated by event boundaries: looks to to-be-contacted objects near event boundaries were less likely to be early and more likely to be late compared to looks to objects contacted within events. This result is consistent with theories proposing that event segmentation results from transient increases in prediction error."
When does population growth pay off? A case study of suburban land consumption to assess the Lower Austrian infrastructural cost calculator,"‘To increase the number of inhabitants’ is a commonly stated top objective in municipal strategies across European countries. Not differently in Austria, local policy follows a logic of growth as financial tax and redistribution systems reward according to population figures; but is demographic growth necessarily financially beneficial for a municipality, irrespective of the type of land use changes, and potentially urban sprawl, that it triggers? The Federal State of Lower Austria offers to its municipalities a strategic online planning tool to pre-assess eventual municipal infrastructural costs and tax revenues that would come with certain population increase. This study tests the Lower Austrian infrastructural cost calculator and, in so doing, seeks to add a spatial perspective to an otherwise oversimplified financial calculation of planning for growth. The case study municipality of Michelhausen formulated an ambitious objective of 25% population growth (+ 700 inhabitants) within a few years in its local development strategy, to be realised by enlarging a rural settlement area. The study will assess five possible alternatives of settlement enlargement with varying housing types for their municipal financial consequences. In conducting this case study, the infrastructural cost calculator, a strategic planning tool offered by the federal planning authority of Lower Austria to their municipalities, will be assessed for its current potential as well as possible enhancement as strategic planning instrument to support municipalities in financial questions when developing building land. Normative lessons drawn from the whole exercise directly address actors and decision-makers in local and regional planning context in Lower Austria. The study ends with a short outlook of possible learnings and transfer into other national and international planning practice contexts."
The role of rolling forecasting in budgetary control systems: reactive and proactive types of planning,"The paper examines how rolling forecasting is used in planning and linked to other practices in a management control system. The paper combines a function-based view of budgeting with a more disaggregation-based conceptualisation, considering individual control systems. A multiple-case-study approach was adopted to investigate differences in the design and use of control systems across three industrial firms that had recently sought to improve their planning. The findings reveal two approaches to forecasting. In proactive-type planning, rolling forecasting was employed to promote information oriented toward more realistic forecasts and ideas emerging from interactive discussion were often put into action before quantified monetary deviations between plans and targets emerged. In reactive planning, rolling forecasting supported the supremacy of annual budgeting, and a more stable, joint process for both enabled analysing variances formally in a diagnostically oriented manner and revising plans accordingly. Synergies between budgetary practices were also found—for instance, in the process of setting targets, wherein the forecasts informed managers of the outcome level that was likely to be achievable and hence served as a realistic basis for setting more demanding targets."
A new insight into underlying disease mechanism through semi-parametric latent differential network model,"In genomic studies, to investigate how the structure of a genetic network differs between two experiment conditions is a very interesting but challenging problem, especially in high-dimensional setting. Existing literatures mostly focus on differential network modelling for continuous data. However, in real application, we may encounter discrete data or mixed data, which urges us to propose a unified differential network modelling for various data types."
Characterization of miRNA profiles in the mammary tissue of dairy cattle in response to heat stress,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that play important roles in the regulation of gene expression. However, the role of miRNAs in bovine mammary gland responses to heat stress is not well understood."
Intelligent Vehicle Human-Simulated Steering Characteristics Access and Control Strategy,"As the traditional control algorithm is over-dependent on accurate vehicle model in intelligent vehicle steering control, a human-simulated intelligent control method is proposed based on experienced driver steering characteristics. Intelligent vehicle unmanned steering system dynamics model and the driver model are set up. Through experienced drivers’ trial run experiment, the analysis is mainly conducted on the double lanes condition. After the transformation of coordinates on global positioning system (GPS) derivative, the path information of local coordinates is accessed. The ideal driver steering path is obtained through fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm. The human-simulated intelligent controller is designed. Characteristic model is established according to the ideal and practical steering angle deviation and the deviation rate. Besides, the corresponding control rules and control modality set are designed. The joint simulation under CarSim joint/Simulink environment shows that the humanoid steering controller designed in this paper has better tracking performance than the model predictive control."

Searching with and against each other: Spatiotemporal coordination of visual search behavior in collaborative and competitive settings,"Although in real life people frequently perform visual search together, in lab experiments this social dimension is typically left out. Here, we investigate individual, collaborative and competitive visual search with visualization of search partners’ gaze. Participants were instructed to search a grid of Gabor patches while being eye tracked. For collaboration and competition, searchers were shown in real time at which element the paired searcher was looking. To promote collaboration or competition, points were rewarded or deducted for correct or incorrect answers. Early in collaboration trials, searchers rarely fixated the same elements. Reaction times of couples were roughly halved compared with individual search, although error rates did not increase. This indicates searchers formed an efficient collaboration strategy. Overlap, the proportion of dwells that landed on hexagons that the other searcher had already looked at, was lower than expected from simulated overlap of two searchers who are blind to the behavior of their partner. The proportion of overlapping dwells correlated positively with ratings of the quality of collaboration. During competition, overlap increased earlier in time, indicating that competitors divided space less efficiently. Analysis of the entropy of the dwell locations and scan paths revealed that in the competition condition, a less fixed looking pattern was exhibited than in the collaborate and individual search conditions. We conclude that participants can efficiently search together when provided only with information about their partner’s gaze position by dividing up the search space. Competing search exhibited more random gaze patterns, potentially reflecting increased interaction between searchers in this condition."

Super Annigeri 1 and improved JG 74: two Fusarium wilt-resistant introgression lines developed using marker-assisted backcrossing approach in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.),"Annigeri 1 and JG 74 are elite high yielding desi cultivars of chickpea with medium maturity duration and extensively cultivated in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, respectively. Both cultivars, in recent years, have become susceptible to race 4 of Fusarium wilt (FW). To improve Annigeri 1 and JG 74, we introgressed a genomic region conferring resistance against FW race 4 (foc4) through marker-assisted backcrossing using WR 315 as the donor parent. For foreground selection, TA59, TA96, TR19 and TA27 markers were used at Agricultural Research Station, Kalaburagi, while GA16 and TA96 markers were used at Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya, Jabalpur. Background selection using simple sequence repreats (SSRs) for the cross Annigeri 1 × WR 315 in BC1F1 and BC2F1 lines resulted in 76–87% and 90–95% recurrent parent genome recovery, respectively. On the other hand, 90–97% genome was recovered in BC3F1 lines in the case of cross JG 74 × WR 315. Multilocation evaluation of 10 BC2F5 lines derived from Annigeri 1 provided one superior line referred to as Super Annigeri 1 with 8% increase in yield and enhanced disease resistance over Annigeri 1. JG 74315-14, the superior line in JG 74 background, had a yield advantage of 53.5% and 25.6% over the location trial means in Pantnagar and Durgapura locations, respectively, under Initial Varietal Trial of All India Coordinated Research Project on Chickpea. These lines with enhanced resistance and high yield performance are demonstration of successful deployment of molecular breeding to develop superior lines for FW resistance in chickpea."
"Cloning, Expression and Characterization of Two Beta Carbonic Anhydrases from a Newly Isolated CO2 Fixer, Serratia marcescens Wy064","Bacterial strains from karst landform soil were enriched via chemostat culture in the presence of sodium bicarbonate. Two chemolithotrophic strains were isolated and identified as Serratia marcescens Wy064 and Bacillus sp. Wy065. Both strains could grow using sodium bicarbonate as the sole carbon source. Furthermore, the supplement of the medium with three electron donors (Na2S, NaNO2, and Na2S2O3) improved the growth of both strains. The activities of carbonic anhydrase (CA) and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) could be detected in the crude enzyme of strain Wy064, implying that the strain Wy064 might employ Calvin cycle to fix CO2. S. marcescens genome mining revealed four potential CA genes designated CA1–CA4. The proteins encoded by genes CA1–3 were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant enzymes of CA1 and CA3 exhibited CO2 hydration activities, whereas enzyme CA2 was expressed in inclusion bodies. A CO2 hydration assay demonstrated that the specific activity of CA3 was significantly higher than that of CA1. The maximum CO2 hydration activities for CA1 and CA3 were observed at pH 7.5 and 40 °C. The activities of CA1 and CA3 were significantly enhanced by several metal ions, especially Zn2+, which resulted in 21.1-fold and 26.1-fold increases of CO2 hydration activities, respectively. The apparent Km and Vmax for CO2 as substrate were 27 mM and 179 WAU/mg for CA1, and 14 mM and 247 WAU/mg for CA3, respectively. Structure modeling combined with sequence analysis indicated that CA1 and CA3 should belong to the Type II β-CA."
Functional separator for Li/S batteries based on boron-doped graphene and activated carbon,"Lithium/sulfur (Li/S) batteries have received great attention due to their high theoretical energy density, but the “shuttle effect” of polysulfides restricts the further development of Li/S batteries. The construction of modified functional separator is an effective strategy to obstruct the diffusion of polysulfides. We report boron-doped graphene and activated carbon (B-G/AC)–modified functional separator for Li/S batteries. The B-G/AC composites are obtained via a one-step hydrothermal method and used as a functional layer to modify the battery separator. The B-G with highly porous three-dimensional (3D) network structure exhibits good electrical conductivity, and rich porous structure AC increases the specific surface area of the B-G/AC composite. The carbon coating layer can act as the second collector, utilizing the inactivated sulfur that is freed in the electrolyte. The modified separator can facilitate the polysulfide dissolution and migration towards the anode. The B-G/AC samples exhibit excellent electrochemical performances. The B-G/AC samples maintain a higher capacity of 1062 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 C than a routine separator (709 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 C). Diffusion experiments of polysulfides in U-shaped bottles also proved importance of B-G/AC as a separator. In addition, the B-G/AC samples also exhibit excellent cycling stability over 300 cycles, delivering a discharge capacity of 534 mA h g−1 when the current is 1 C. The present study confirms that separator modification is an effective technique that leads to good electrochemical performance."

Does the “delayed start” protocol with gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist improve the pregnancy outcome in Bologna poor responders? a randomized clinical trial,"Recently, a novel approach with delaying the start of controlled ovarian stimulation along with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist pretreatment for 7 days after estrogen priming for further suppression of endogenous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) during the early follicular phase, resulting in more FSH-responsive follicles and thus improving synchronous follicular development was introduced. Two clinical trials have examined this strategy and reported controversial results. This study aimed to compare the effect of delayed-start GnRH antagonist protocol and standard GnRH antagonist in patients with poor ovarian response (POR) undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF)/ intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)."
Comparing Early Adolescents’ Positive Bystander Responses to Cyberbullying and Traditional Bullying: the Impact of Severity and Gender,"Young people are frequently exposed to bullying events in the offline and online domain. Witnesses to these incidents act as bystanders and play a pivotal role in reducing or encouraging bullying behaviour. The present study examined 868 (47.2% female) 11–13-year-old early adolescent pupils’ bystander responses across a series of hypothetical vignettes based on traditional and cyberbullying events. The vignettes experimentally controlled for severity across mild, moderate and severe scenarios. The findings showed positive bystander responses (PBRs) were higher in cyberbullying than traditional bullying incidents. Bullying severity impacted on PBRs, in that PBRs increased across mild, moderate and severe incidents, consistent across traditional and cyberbullying. Females exhibited more PBRs across both types of bullying. Findings are discussed in relation to practical applications within the school. Strategies to encourage PBRs to all forms of bullying should be at the forefront of bullying intervention methods."
A typology of lexical borrowing in Modern Standard Chinese,"The question of how best to classify Modern Standard Chinese loanwords is rather a fraught one. Various principles of categorization have been proposed in the literature; however, previous classification systems have generally covered only a relatively small proportion of all loanwords currently in use. Even attempts to provide an exhaustive catalog of lexical borrowing strategies have often been characterized by non-transparent structure, internal inconsistency or even incompleteness. This has hindered meaningful cross-linguistic comparisons of language change in Modern Standard Chinese vis-à-vis other languages. The aim of this paper is to present a new and clearly structured, comprehensive inventory of the different types of lexical borrowing that have occurred in Modern Standard Chinese over the past 30 to 40 years. Systematic cross-linguistic comparisons reveal that examples of almost all of the categories of lexical borrowing noted in the literature on English language change can likewise be provided in relation to Modern Standard Chinese. In addition, Chinese offers several options for borrowing lexical items not available to speakers of English. Overall, this paper presents a picture of Modern Standard Chinese speakers as cultivating a flexible, creative, playful approach to their use of language. The explicit recognition of the fact that many so-called “alphabetic words” are established loanwords is found to have implications for the typological classification of Chinese script, as well as for other fields such as second language teaching. A secondary finding not anticipated in the research question is that Chinese orthography shows tentative early signs of potentially developing from a morpho-logographic to a phonetic writing system."
Energy Build-up and Triggering Leading to a M1.5 Flare on 1 August 2014,"The energy storage and trigger mechanisms of solar flares are important for understanding solar activity. We analyzed multi-wavelength observations of a M1.5 flare on 1 August 2014, in active region NOAA 12127 (SOL2014-08-01T18:13). There are evident large-scale sunspot rotations in positive magnetic field of the main energy-release region before the eruption; the rotations contain both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. Injection of magnetic helicity from the photosphere is prior to the flare. The sign of the helicity injection is reversed after the flare. It is found that both persistent larger-scale (\({\approx}\,\mbox{one day}\)) and impulse smaller-scale (\({\approx}\,\mbox{one to two hours}\)) magnetic-flux emergences are associated with the flare. We conclude that larger-scale flux emergence, helicity injection, and sunspot rotation contribute to the energy build up, while the small-scale magnetic-flux emergence plays a crucial role in triggering the flare."
Peptide Growth Factor Phytosulfokine-α Stimulates Cell Divisions and Enhances Regeneration from B. oleracea var. capitata L. Protoplast Culture,"Protoplasts of six cabbage accessions were isolated from leaf mesophyll and cultured in the presence of 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 µM phytosulfokine–α (PSK-α) and in a PSK-free control medium. PSK-α was applied for 10 days and later, protoplast-derived cells were cultured in the PSK-free medium. Supplementation of the culture medium with PSK-α showed a dose-dependent effect on the mitotic activity of cultured cells. On the 15th day of culture, the highest mitotic activity of protoplast-derived cells was observed in cultures treated with 0.1 µM of PSK-α, and ranged from 14 to 60% dependent on the accession. The number of multi-cell structures was also higher (90–93%) on this medium compared to the control (77–80%). Analysis of cellulose regeneration in cultured protoplasts after Calcofluor White staining showed that this process was not synchronous, but depended instead on the presence of PSK-α in the culture medium, and was more pronounced in the low-responding accession. Sustained cell divisions led to formation of microcallus colonies, subjected to regeneration on solid media. Supplementation of the regeneration media with 0.1 µM of PSK significantly increased shoot regeneration compared to the control media. Moreover, enhanced regeneration was observed from calluses developed from cells treated with PSK-α at the early stages of development and later transferred for regeneration onto the media supplemented with 0.1 µM of this peptide."
"Aeromagnetic data for mapping geologic contacts at Samr El-Qaa area, North Eastern Desert, Egypt","Delineating the edges of different magnetized sources represents a fundamental tool for interpreting and mapping rock boundaries of magnetic data. The present study deals with the enhancement of reduced to the pole map (RTP) of Samr El-Qaa area, North Eastern Desert, Egypt, to map deep and surface geologic contacts. The edge detection of geologic contacts is ensured by the upward continuation of reduced to the pole data at an altitude of 3 km, followed by the calculation of theta derivative and horizontal tilt angle derivative (HTAD) for RTP and upward continuation (3 km). The results obtained from the application of these techniques showed that the theta derivative delineates RTP source edges well, but the response of deeper sources is diffused. While HTAD presented well, responds to shallow and deep sources and also the edges of the sources were delineated well. HTAD showed a much sharper gradient over the edges of the magnetized sources at Samr El-Qaa area. The interpreted structural trends derived from shallow and deep Theta and HTAD maps of Samr El-Qaa territory illustrated that the most shallow dominant trends are NNE, NE, N-S, NNW, WNW, E-W and NW directions. While the deep structural ones are the ENE, NW, N-S, and E-W directions. This approach for edge detection used in this study is comprehensively applicable to other portions of the Egyptian Eastern Desert and other areas with alike geologic conditions around the world to give much sharper gradient over the edges of the magnetized sources which can be used for mineral and oil/gas exploration."
Mechanical criteria and sensitivity analysis of water inrush through a mining fault above confined aquifers,"A mechanical model of water inrush through a mining fault in the workface above confined aquifers was developed according to ground pressure and strata control theory. Based on limit equilibrium theory of rock mass, mechanical criteria of the water inrush through the mining fault in the workface above confined aquifers were deduced by considering Mohr–Coulomb yield criterion. Five influencing factors, namely fault dip, fault cohesion, fault internal friction angle, suspended goaf range behind the workface, and thickness of floor strata protective zone, were selected from the mechanical criteria of an ultimate hydraulic pressure that the stope floor strata with a fault can tolerate. An orthogonal test was performed to analyze the sensitivity of the ultimate hydraulic pressure tolerated by the stope floor strata with fault. Results show that the fault dip and thickness of the floor strata protective zone significantly influence the ultimate hydraulic pressure tolerated by the stope floor strata with fault and represent 32.8% and 32.5% of the total effects, respectively. The fault cohesion, fault internal friction angle, and suspended goaf range behind the workface exert similar effects on the ultimate hydraulic pressure that the floor strata with a fault can tolerate and comprise 10.5%, 13.5%, and 10.7% of the total effects, respectively. The ultimate hydraulic pressure that the stope floor strata with a fault can tolerate decreases with the increase in the fault dip, fault internal friction angle, and suspended goaf range behind the workface but increases with the fault cohesion and thickness of the floor strata protective zone. This property decreases with the distance between the coal wall of the workface and the fault. This study provides insights into the water inrush mechanism through the mining fault in the workface and its corresponding sensitivity, thereby aiding in establishing the safe mining of coal seam with fault above confined aquifers."
Wie stroomt er in de WIA in en wie stroomt uit?,"Kennis van factoren die samenhangen met arbeidsongeschiktheid kan helpen bij het identificeren van groepen die een hoog risico lopen om (langdurig) een WIA-uitkering te ontvangen en om effectieve interventies voor deze groepen te ontwikkelen. In deze studie wilden we de volgende onderzoeksvragen beantwoorden: (1) Wat zijn de belangrijkste diagnoses bij toekenning van een WIA-uitkering en hoe verschillen deze voor leeftijd, geslacht en opleiding? (2) Welke klanten stromen binnen vijf jaar uit de WIA?"
Absolute Proper Motions and the Kinematics of Globular Clusters,"Position data for stars in the vicinities of 119 Galactic globular clusters from the USNOB1, 2MASS, URAT1, and ALLWISE catalogs have been reduced in the system of the UCAC5 reference catalog. The published positions are used together with positions from the UCAC5 and Gaia DR1 catalogs (with a difference in their epochs of 65 years) and photometric data from the 2MASS survey to distinguish cluster members, determine their absolute proper motions with an accuracy of 1–2 milliarcseconds/year (mas/year), and calculate the mean absolute proper motions of the clusters with accuracies of about 0.4 mas/year. The derived proper motions and published distances and radial velocities for the clusters are used to establish the absence of rotation for a sample of metal-poor clusters in the Galactic halo. The mean velocity of the Sun relative to this sample is found to be (Vx(0), Vy(0), Vz(0)) = (−16 ± 16, −231 ± 19, +2± 16) km/s, and the distance of the Sun fromthe Galactic center is estimated to be R0 = 7.6 ±0.7 kpc.

Statistics of Stars with Relativistic Velocities,"The scenario for the dynamical capture of a binary system in the neighborhood of a supermassive black hole used byHills in 1988 to predict the existence of hypervelocity stars (~1000 km/s) allows the existence of stars with relativistic velocities attaining (1/3−2/3)c, where c is the speed of light. The increase of the kinetic energy of these stars by more than a factor of 100 is due to the replacement of one component of the binary with a supermassive black hole. This scenario takes candidate of relativisti©velocity stars outside our Galaxy, into intergalactic space, where they could be ejected from merging galaxies populated by supermassive black holes. At present, this is a hypothetical class of stars with anomalous kinematics, but it is already posing a serious challenge for modern astrometry, which, like 300 years ago, is still concerned with the detection of proper motions. While this was related to stars in the solar neighborhood at the time of Halley, is now a problem for studies of the most remote and weakest stars in intergalactic space. Possibilities for detecting such stars must be based on estimates of their abundances, that is, on their statistics. This paper is based on a presentation made at the conference “Modern Astrometry 2017,” dedicated to the memory of K.V. Kuimov (Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Moscow State University, October 23–25, 2017)."
Morphology of Seyfert Galaxies,"We probed the relation between properties of Seyfert nuclei and morphology of their host galaxies. We selected Seyfert galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with redshifts less than 0.2 identified by the Vé ron Catalog (13th). We used the FracDev parameter from SDSS galaxy fitting models to represent the bulge fractions of the Seyfert host galaxies. We found that the host galaxies of Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 are dominated by large bulge fractions, and Seyfert 2 galaxies are more likely to be located in disk galaxies whereas most of the Seyfert 1 galaxies are located in bulge-dominant galaxies. These results indicate that the types of AGNs are related to their host galaxies and cannot be explained by the traditional unification model of Seyfert galaxies."
Localized Objects Formed by Self-Trapped Gravitational Waves,"Geons are localized horizonless objects formed by gravitational waves, held together by the gravitational attraction of their own field energy. In many respects they are similar to scalar field pulson/oscillon configurations, which were found numerically in 1976 by Kudryavtsev, Bogolyubskii, and Makhankov. If there is a negative cosmological constant, the spacetime of geons asymptotically approaches the anti-de Sitter (AdS) metric. AdS geons are time-periodic regular localized vacuum solutions without any radiation loss at infinity. A higher order perturbative construction in terms of an amplitude parameter shows that there are one-parameter families of AdS geon solutions emerging from combinations of identical-frequency linear modes of the system."
Equilibrium Configurations of Rotating White Dwarfs at Finite Temperatures,"In this work, cold and hot, static and rotating white dwarf stars are investigated within the framework of classical physics, employing the Chandrasekhar equation of state. The main parameters of white dwarfs such as the central density, pressure, total mass and radius are calculated fulfilling the stability criteria for hot rotating stars. To construct rotating configurations the Hartle approach is involved. It is shown that the effects of finite temperatures become crucial in low-mass white dwarfs, whereas rotation is relevant in all mass range. The simultaneous accounting for temperature and rotation is critical in the calculation of the radii of white dwarfs. The results obtained in this work can be applied to explain a variety of observational data for white dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Releases."
On the Final Gravitational Wave Burst from Binary Black Holes Mergers,"We use perturbation theory in the strong-field regime to study the inspiral-to-plunge transition of a test particle into a Kerr black hole. We found a smooth transition, without burst, and with lower energy and angular momentum radiated in gravitational waves with respect to previous treatments in the literature. Besides their theoretical interest, our results are relevant for the waveform templates of binary black hole mergers used for gravitational waves detection which are constructed on the basis of a inspiral-to-plunge transition with a high energetic burst."
Loop Quantum Cosmology and Probability of Inflation,"We study the measure on the set of initial conditions in remote past for Loop Quantum Cosmology with massive scalar field motivated by various choices of the measure present in the literature. The main finding of the paper is existence of an attractor at contracting phase of the universe, which, in addition to the well known attractor at expanding phase, predicts a very specific duration of inflationary stage with the number of e-foldings about 140."
Dynamics of Natural Satellites of Planets Based on Observations,"There is wide interest in the results of studies of the dynamics of satellites of planets. Such data are needed to determine the physical properties of celestial bodies, and they may be able to provide information about the origins and evolution of the solar system. The general approach to studying the dynamics of satellites involves developing models for the motion and ephemerides based on observational data. Ephemerides are required to prepare and launch space missions to other planets and help discover new celestial bodies. High-precision astrometric coordinates of the principal satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are derived from photometric observations of occultations and eclipses of these satellites. To this end, worldwide observing campaigns have been organized. Enhancement in the precision of ephemerides can be obtained not only by increasing the accuracy of observations, but also by expanding the time interval covered by the observations. Many new, distant satellites of the major planets were discovered in the early 21st century. However, observations of these satellites are scarce and were obtained over short time intervals; as a result, some of these satellites were lost. To date, 179 natural satellites are known. This paper is based on a presentation made at the conference “Modern Astrometry 2017,” dedicated to the memory of K.V. Kuimov (Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Moscow State University, October 23–25, 2017)."
Kinematics of OB Associations and the First Data from the Gaia Satellite,"The first data release from the Gaia mission (Gaia DR1) is used to study kinematics of OB associations. The mean velocity dispersion in 18 OB associations containing at least 10 stars with proper motions from the TGAS catalog is 3.9 km/s. The contribution of binary systems to the velocity dispersions in OB associations is, on average, 1.2 km/s. Expansion of the OB associations Per OB1 and Car OB1 is observed. This paper is based on a presentation made at the conference “Modern Astrometry 2017,” dedicated to the memory of K.V. Kuimov (Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Moscow State University, October 23–25, 2017)."

This article is based on a presentation made at this conference."
On the Induced Gravitational Collapse: SPH Simulations,"The Induced Gravitational Collapse (IGC) paradigm points to a binary origin for the longduration gamma-ray burst (GRBs) associated with supernovae (SN). In this one, a carbon-oxygen core (COcore) explodes in a Type Ib/c SN in presence of a close neutron star (NS) companion. The SN triggers a hypercritical accretion into the NS and depending on the initial binary parameters, two outcomes are possible givimg place to two family of long GRBs: binary-driven hypernova (BdHNe), where the NS reaches its critical mass, and collapses to a black hole (BH), emitting a GRB; and x-ray flashes (XRFs) where the hypercritical accretion onto the NS is not sufficient to induce its gravitational collapse. We perform 3-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations of the IGC paradigm with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique. We determine whether the star gravitational collapse is possible and assess if the binary holds gravitationally bound or it becomes unbound by the SN explosion."
GAMMA-400 Project,"Extraterrestrial gamma-ray astronomy is now a source of a new knowledge in the fields of astrophysics, cosmic-ray physics, and the nature of dark matter. The next absolutely necessary step in the development of extraterrestrial high-energy gamma-ray astronomy is the improvement of the physical and technical characteristics of gamma-ray telescopes, especially their angular and energy resolutions. Such a new generation telescope will be GAMMA-400, currently under development. Together with an X-ray telescope, it will perform precise and detailed observations in the energy range of ~20 MeV to ~10 000 GeV and 3–30 keV the Galactic plane, especially, toward the Galactic Center, Fermi Bubbles, Crab, Cygnus, etc. The GAMMA-400 will operate in the highly elliptic orbit continuously for a long time with the unprecedented angular (~0.01◦ at Eγ = 100 GeV) and energy (~1% at Eγ = 100 GeV) resolutions, exceeding the Fermi-LAT as well as ground-based gamma-ray telescopes by a factor of 5–10. GAMMA-400 will permit resolving gamma rays from annihilation or decay of dark matter particles, identifyingmany discrete sources (many of which are variable), clarifying the structure of extended sources, specifying the data on the diffuse emission, as well as measuring electron + positron fluxes and specifying electron + positron spectrum in the energy range from 1 GeV to 10 000 GeV."
Numerical Scheme for Treatment of Uehling–Uhlenbeck Equation for Binary and Triple Interactions in Relativistic Plasma,"We present a new efficient method to compute Uehling–Uhlenbeck collision integral for any two-particle and three-particle interactions in relativistic plasma with drastic improvement in computation time with respect to existingmethods. Reaction rates are compared, where possible, with the corresponding analytical expressions and another numerical results."
Prospects for Strongly Lensed Supernovae Behind Hubble Frontier Fields Galaxy Clusters with the James Webb Space Telescope,"Measuring time delays from strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) is emerging as a novel and independent tool for estimating the Hubble constant (H0). This is very important given the recent discord in the value of H0) from two methods that probe different distance ranges. The success of this technique will rely of our ability to discover strongly lensed SNe with measurable time delays. Here, we present the magnifications and the time delays for the multiply-imaged galaxies behind the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) galaxy clusters, by using recently published lensing models. Continuing on our previous work done for Abell 1689 (A1689) and Abell 370, we also show the prospects of observing strongly lensed SNe behind the HFF clusters with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). With four 1-hour visits in one year, the summed expectations of all six HFF clusters are ~0.5 core-collapse (CC) SNe and 0.06 Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in F115W band, while with F150W the expectations are higher, ~0.9 CC SNe and ~0.06 SNe Ia. These estimates match those expected by only surveying A1689, proving that the performance of A1689 as gravitational telescope is superior. In the five HFF clusters presented here, we find that F150W will be able to detect SNe Ia (SNe IIP) exploding in 93 (80) pairsmultiply-imaged galaxies with time delays of less than 5 years."
Relativistic Behavior and Equitemporal Surfaces in Ultra-Relativistic Prompt Emission Phase of Gamma-Ray Bursts,In this work we study a role of baryon load and interstellarmediumdensity to explain the nature of peaks in the ultra-relativistic prompt emission (UPE) phase of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs). We study the behavior of their Γ Lorenz factor fromthe moment of transparency all the way up to interstellarmedium. We finally study the characteristic of equitemporal surfaces in the UPE phase.
"Modeling and uncertainty analysis of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers using a surrogate model: a case study in Longkou, China","Seawater intrusion is a complex problem involving groundwater with variable density. It has an important impact on the development and utilization of groundwater resources in coastal areas. In previous studies, numerical simulations of seawater intrusion were performed by assigning fixed values to model parameters, thereby not taking into account the influence of stochastic variability of hydrogeological parameters on model predictions. In this study, we developed a three-dimensional mathematical model of seawater intrusion by modeling vertical solute transport due to density changes resulting from seawater intrusion. We then applied a Monte Carlo–based method to analyze uncertainty in model simulations of seawater intrusion. Because the Monte Carlo method requires the simulation model to be repeatedly run, we used the Kriging method to build a surrogate model that significantly reduced the computational load compared to the simulation model while ensuring the desired accuracy. Then we used a local sensitivity analysis method to select the two parameters with the greatest influence on model output. We treated the two selected parameters as random variables, and results show that (1) the three-dimensional, variable-density seawater intrusion model can effectively simulate and predict the distribution of seawater intrusion in the study area; (2) the local sensitivity analysis can accurately identify the hydrogeological parameters that most influence model output; (3) the uncertainty analysis based on the surrogate model reduces computing time substantially and provides a realistic assessment of the effect of hydrogeological parameter variability on seawater intrusion numerical simulation results."
"Influence of hydro-geochemical processes on groundwater quality through geostatistical techniques in Kadava River basin, Western India","Hydrogeochemistry and groundwater quality of the Kadava River Basin have been performed by analyzing 40 groundwater samples for pre- and post-monsoon seasons of 2011 through different geostatistical techniques. Analyses showed that the concentrations of Mg2+ exceeded Ca2+ in both the seasons suggesting silicate weathering as a source of ions. Average Ca + Mg values contribute 73.53% of total cations and signify the major supply of mafic minerals. Elevated TDS and TH limit drinking potential and other beneficial uses indicate permanently hard water. The average concentrations of the anions were found within Indian PL except NO3, attributed to use of fertilizers. The spatial distribution maps show the EC, Mg, Na, Cl, and SO4 to be generally higher for both the seasons in flood plain deposits than denuded landforms and middle-level/high-level plateaus containing fractured basalt aquifers. It is confirmed that silicate weathering is the dominant process followed by carbonate weathering. Inputs of TDS, Cl, SO4, Mg, Na, and NO3 are influenced by rainfall and human activities. Groundwater sample numbers 20, 37, and 38 have been severely impacted from agricultural runoff as these samples are located along the surface water flow path. The high loading of TDS and TH is controlled by the Mg, Na, Cl, and SO4 ions. Elevated concentration of Na over Ca represents the ion exchange between Ca and Na. High contents of Mg, Na, Cl, and SO4 corroborate that the groundwater is influenced by anthropogenic sources. This study is an insight for water managers to address groundwater pollution problems."
"Impact assessment of coal mining on river water and groundwater and its interaction through hydrological, isotopic characteristics, and simulation flow modeling","Impact assessment of coal mining of Gare IV/6 Coal Block (GCB) on river water (Kelo River) and groundwater and the interaction between them were studied through hydrological studies like water-level monitoring, short and long-term river flow measurements, isotopic characteristics, and groundwater flow modeling. The hydrological study reveals that the groundwater flow is towards the Kelo River and the river is acting as effluent in nature. The flow direction is parallel to Kelo River in the downstream of the GCB. The isotopic study suggests that the Kelo River water is enriched with δ 18O/16O ratio as compared to watershed samples. Flow modeling suggests that the Kelo River, which is adjacent to the boundary of GCB, may contribute 88.38 m3/day of groundwater. The groundwater effluence forms a meager component of the total groundwater effluence estimated for the entire length of the Kelo River passing through the study area. Based on the groundwater flow model results it is suggested that the proposed mining operation in GCB will not have any impact on the Kelo River water flow. The suspected seepage from the Kelo River flooding on the GCB is unlikely as the hydraulic gradient is towards the Kelo River. It is suggested to have a buffer zone and an embankment between Kelo River and GCB to prevent flooding from river water breaching. The present study provides an overall understanding of the hydrogeological conditions in and around mining area which will help in safe mining operations so that any hazard or threat to the local community may be prevented."
Enhancing multispectral remote sensing data interpretation for historical gold mines in Egypt: a case study from Madari gold mine,"In the last decade, most of the outcrops around the historic gold mines in Egypt had been damaged by the local miners, a situation that complicated remote sensing-based exploration research activities. Madari gold mine area was no more fortunate than other mines in the region. This study identifies a new integrated remote sensing workflow that emphasizes the spectral variations related to differences in chemical and mineralogical compositions of the investigated rock units and deemphasizes the spectral variations introduced by the local miners. All combinations of ratio images are first generated from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data, then a suite of ratio images that best differentiates between the investigated units is selected, and finally the selected ratio images were stacked to substitute the original image bands in the further processing techniques. The PCA was then applied to the selected ratio images within the stack. Subsequently, a statistical analysis of the eigenvector matrix for each of the PC bands was conducted to select the optimum PC bands and a Principal Component False Color Composite image (PC-FCC) was created from the three selected PC bands. The PC-FCC image (PC3, PC11, PC4 in RGB) was chosen as a result of subtracting the average PC eigenvector negative weights from the average positive eigenvectors weights. Not only was the PC-FCC image used to distinguish the main rock units in the damaged area, but also, to identify the areas with intense alteration zones."
A new insight into underlying disease mechanism through semi-parametric latent differential network model,"In genomic studies, to investigate how the structure of a genetic network differs between two experiment conditions is a very interesting but challenging problem, especially in high-dimensional setting. Existing literatures mostly focus on differential network modelling for continuous data. However, in real application, we may encounter discrete data or mixed data, which urges us to propose a unified differential network modelling for various data types."

Methods of increasing two-way transmission capacity of wireless ad hoc networks,"Two-way communication is required to support control functions like packet acknowledgement and channel feedback. Most previous works on the transmission capacity of wireless ad hoc networks, however, focused on one-way communication; reverse communication from the destination to the source was ignored. In this paper, we first establish mathematical expression for two-way transmission capacity under the fixing transmission distance (i.e., the distance between the source and the destination is a constant), by introducing the concept of two-way outage and setting different rate requirements in both directions. Next, based on the concept of guard zone and cooperative communication, methods of increasing two-way transmission capacity are proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed methods can improve two-way transmission capacity significantly."
Amyloid-beta and phosphorylated tau in post-mortem Alzheimer’s disease retinas,"In-vivo labeling of retinal amyloid-beta(Aβ) and tau has potential as non-invasive biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, literature on the presence of Aβ and phosphorylated tau (pTau) in AD retinas is inconclusive. We therefore assessed the presence of Aβ and pTau in post-mortem retinas in 6 AD and 6 control cases who donated brains and eyes to the Netherlands Brain Bank. Neuropathological diagnosis of AD was made according to NIA-AA criteria. Formalin fixed retinas were dissected in quadrants and cross-sections of medial and superior retinas were made. Immuno-histochemical stainings were performed for Aβ, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and pTau. To assess translation to an in-vivo set up using curcumin as labelling fluorophore, co-stainings with curcumin were performed. No typical Aβ-plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, like in the cerebral cortex, were observed in AD retinas. A diffuse immunoreactive signal for pTau was increased in the inner and outer plexiform layers of the retina in AD cases compared to control cases with absence of cerebral amyloid pathology. Immunostaining with anti-Aβ and anti-APP antibodies yielded signal in ganglion cells, amacrine cells, horizontal cells and Müller cells in both control and AD cases. We observed small extracellular deposits positive for anti-Aβ antibodies 12F4 and 6E10 and negative for 4G8 and curcumin. A subset of these deposits could be characterized as corpora amylacea. In conclusion we found that retinal manifestations of AD pathology appear to be different compared to cerebral AD pathology. Using a qualitative cross-sectional approach, we did not find Aβ/APP related differences in the retina between AD and control subjects. In contrast, tau related changes were found to be present in cases with cerebral AD pathology, suggesting retinal tau as a potential biomarker for AD."

"Assessment of genetic diversity of Saraca asoca (Roxb.) De Wilde: a commercially important, but endangered, forest tree species in Western Ghats, India","Saraca asoca (Roxb.) De Wilde is a valuable tree used in traditional medicine against a variety of ailments. Almost all parts of the tree are used for various commercial herbal preparations. Due to overexploitation, the species is rapidly disappearing from Western Ghats where it is native and grew extensively until recently. Conservation of this important medicinal plant is therefore an urgent need. To plan effective conservation strategies, a scientific assessment of the genetic diversity and distribution is needed."

A Method for the Quantitative Analysis of a Key Component in Complex Mixtures Using Raman Spectroscopy Based on Peak Decomposition,"Raman spectroscopy has been increasingly used in industrial production processes for analytical purposes. However, the quantitative analysis of complex mixtures based on their Raman spectra remains a problem, especially when not all of the spectra of pure components in the mixture are available. In this work, a method for the quantitative analysis of a key component in complex mixtures based on peak decomposition is introduced. The proposed method only requires the spectrum of the main component in the mixture before analysis. The spectra of the mixture are decomposed to the contributions of the main component and a group of parametric Lorentzian functions. Then, the representative peaks of the key component are extracted. Finally, a calibration model is established. This method is applied to a complex mixture containing m-xylene, o-xylene, p-xylene, ethylbenzene, methylbenzene, three trimethylbenzenes, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, etc. to determine the concentration of o-xylene in the mixture. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than the commonly-used partial least squares (PLS), especially when the number of training samples is very small."
Microdetermination of Sialic Acids in Blood Samples by Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography Coupled to Post-column Derivatization and Fluorometric Detection,"An analytical method for the determination of sialic acids in biological samples has been developed and applied to fetal bovine serum (FBS), newborn calf serum and adult bovine serum. The hydrolysis of sera was carried out and the liberated sialic acids were quantified using a rapid and sensitive HPLC. The HPLC includes the separation and detection of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and a fluorometric post-column reaction with 2-cyanoacetamide. The calibration graphs for Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc were linear over the range of 10 pmol - 5 nmol. The concentrations of sialic acids in FBS, newborn calf serum and adult bovine serum were 5.06, 3.79 and 1.64 mM, respectively. The ratios of Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac changed dramatically according to the development stages. The present method has a satisfactory sensitivity in the quantification of Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc in serum samples. It seems that this analytical system can therefore be applied for routine use in clinical investigations of serum sialylation changes in cancer patients."
"Room-temperature Chelate Vapor Generation of Lead Using Ammonium Ο,Ο-Diethyl Dithiophosphate as a Chelating Reagent and Determination by Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry in Environmental Water Samples","A novel gas-liquid separator (GLS) system for chelate vapor generation (Che-VG) combined with AFS was developed for the determination of trace Pb. It was shown that Pb can form a volatile chelate by mixing of Pb with ammonium O,O-diethyldithiophosphate (DEDTP) in various aqueous solutions. Under the optimal conditions (frit pores of the GLS, 5 - 15 μm; solution pH, 6.7; DEDTP concentration, 0.4%; flow rate of the two feed solutions in the on-line mode, 1.2 mL min−1; and carrier gas flow rate, 150 mL min−1), the calibration curve was linear up to 100 ng mL−1 Pb. The limit of detection (LOD) was 1.1 ng mL−1. The relative standard deviation was 5.6% for eleven replicate determinations of 10 ng mL−1 Pb. The efficiency of Che-VG was estimated to be 12%, and the volatile Pb species was preliminarily studied by ICP-OES. This method was applied to determine trace Pb in water samples."
Energy Build-up and Triggering Leading to a M1.5 Flare on 1 August 2014,"The energy storage and trigger mechanisms of solar flares are important for understanding solar activity. We analyzed multi-wavelength observations of a M1.5 flare on 1 August 2014, in active region NOAA 12127 (SOL2014-08-01T18:13). There are evident large-scale sunspot rotations in positive magnetic field of the main energy-release region before the eruption; the rotations contain both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. Injection of magnetic helicity from the photosphere is prior to the flare. The sign of the helicity injection is reversed after the flare. It is found that both persistent larger-scale (\({\approx}\,\mbox{one day}\)) and impulse smaller-scale (\({\approx}\,\mbox{one to two hours}\)) magnetic-flux emergences are associated with the flare. We conclude that larger-scale flux emergence, helicity injection, and sunspot rotation contribute to the energy build up, while the small-scale magnetic-flux emergence plays a crucial role in triggering the flare."

Ethanolic extract of Melia azedarach L. induces melanogenesis through the cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling pathway,"Since the cause of hypopigmentary skin disorders (hair graying and vitiligo) is typically unknown, there is no known cure for these disorders. Melia azedarach L. is used in Southeast Asia across China and Japan as a traditional medicine, and it has been reported to have various pharmacological properties. However, there have been no reports to demonstrate the involvement of M. azedarach L. in pigmentation. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of ethanolic extract of M. azedarach L. (MAE) on melanogenesis and to elucidate its mechanism of action in B16F10 mouse melanoma cells and human epidermal melanocytes."

"Microbial Diversity in an Arid, Naturally Saline Environment","The Arava Valley in is a rock desert within the Great African Rift valley. Soil from this area is covered with a salt crust. Here, we report microbial diversity from arid, naturally saline samples collected near Ein Yahav from the Arava Valley by culture-independent as well as culture-dependent analysis. High-throughput sequencing of the hypervariable region V4 of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that the microbial community consists of halophiles from the domain Bacteria as well as Archaea. Bacterial diversity was mainly represented by the genus Salinimicrobium of the order Flavobacteriales within the phylum Bacteroidetes, from the gammaproteobacterial orders Alteromonadales and Oceanospirillales as well as representatives from the order Bacillales of the phylum Firmicutes. Archaeal diversity was dominated by euryarchaeal Halobacteria from the orders Halobacteriales, Haloferacales, and Natrialbales. But more than 40% of the sequences affiliated with Archaea were assigned to unknown or unclassified archaea. Even if taxonomic resolution of the 16S rRNA gene V4 region for Archaea is limited, this study indicates the need of further and more detailed studies of Archaea. By using culture-dependent analysis, bacteria of the order Bacillales as well as archaea from all three halobacterial orders Halobacteriales, Haloferacales, and Natrialbales including potentially novel species from the genera Halorubrum and Haloparvum were isolated."
Coal mine microseismic velocity model inversion based on first arrival time difference,"The formation velocity is an important factor affecting the precise location of microseismic source. The establishment of elastic wave velocity model in the monitoring area to satisfy the requirements for precise location of seismic source has been a technical problem for the mine microseismic monitoring. Based on the assumption of horizontal layered medium condition, a new velocity model inversion method has been proposed. According to the concept of equal difference time surface, the first arrival travel time difference between the measured points and datum points is investigated on the basis of the observation point of first arrival travel time duration placed in the middle in the observational network. The minimal difference (double time difference) between the measured first arrival time difference and the calculated first arrival time difference is taken as the constraint condition, and the objective function is constructed to solve the velocity model. The DIRECT fast search algorithm with global optimization characteristics is applied to solve the objective function. This method is used to carry out the trial treatment for the mine microseismic model data and the measured data. The results show that the stratified velocity model under the horizontal layered medium can be obtained by his method using the microseismic data of known seismic source, with a better adaptability to different monitoring systems. Through the test for the actual data of “well-ground” joint microseismic monitoring, the velocity model obtained by the method in this paper can get more accurate location of the seismic source."

However, it is not enough for AADL to model cyber-physical systems (CPS) mainly because it cannot be used to model the continuous dynamic behaviors. This paper proposes an approach to construct a new sublanguage of AADL called AADL+, to facilitate the modeling of not only the discrete and continuous behavior of CPS, but also interaction between cyber components and physical components. The syntax and semantics of the sublanguage are provided to describe the behaviors of the systems. What’s more, we develop a plug-in to OSATE (open-source AADL tool environment) for the modeling of CPS. And the plug-in supports syntax checking and simulation of the system model through linking with modelica. Finally, the AADL+ annex is successfully applied to model a lunar rover control system."
Large-scale mining disease comorbidity relationships from post-market drug adverse events surveillance data,"Systems approaches in studying disease relationship have wide applications in biomedical discovery, such as disease mechanism understanding and drug discovery. The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) contains rich information about patient diseases, medications, drug adverse events and demographics of 17 million case reports. Here, we explored this data resource to mine disease comorbidity relationships using association rule mining algorithm and constructed a disease comorbidity network."
A multitask bi-directional RNN model for named entity recognition on Chinese electronic medical records,"Electronic Medical Record (EMR) comprises patients’ medical information gathered by medical stuff for providing better health care. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a sub-field of information extraction aimed at identifying specific entity terms such as disease, test, symptom, genes etc. NER can be a relief for healthcare providers and medical specialists to extract useful information automatically and avoid unnecessary and unrelated information in EMR. However, limited resources of available EMR pose a great challenge for mining entity terms. Therefore, a multitask bi-directional RNN model is proposed here as a potential solution of data augmentation to enhance NER performance with limited data."
Evaluation of top-down mass spectral identification with homologous protein sequences,"Top-down mass spectrometry has unique advantages in identifying proteoforms with multiple post-translational modifications and/or unknown alterations. Most software tools in this area search top-down mass spectra against a protein sequence database for proteoform identification. When the species studied in a mass spectrometry experiment lacks its proteome sequence database, a homologous protein sequence database can be used for proteoform identification. The accuracy of homologous protein sequences affects the sensitivity of proteoform identification and the accuracy of mass shift localization."
Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify breast cancer local recurrence,Identifying local recurrences in breast cancer from patient data sets is important for clinical research and practice. Developing a model using natural language processing and machine learning to identify local recurrences in breast cancer patients can reduce the time-consuming work of a manual chart review.
iMEGES: integrated mental-disorder GEnome score by deep neural network for prioritizing the susceptibility genes for mental disorders in personal genomes,"A range of rare and common genetic variants have been discovered to be potentially associated with mental diseases, but many more have not been uncovered. Powerful integrative methods are needed to systematically prioritize both variants and genes that confer susceptibility to mental diseases in personal genomes of individual patients and to facilitate the development of personalized treatment or therapeutic approaches."
Asymmetrical Gadolinium Leakage in Ocular Structures in Stroke Due to Internal Carotid Artery Stenosis or Occlusion,Gadolinium leakage in ocular structures (GLOS) on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (FLAIR) is a novel imaging marker in acute ischemic stroke. The present study sought to investigate the frequency and pattern of blood-retina barrier impairment in acute ischemic stroke due to internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis or occlusion as demonstrated by GLOS.
Decreased Handgrip Strength is Associated With Impairments in Each Autonomous Living Task for Aging Adults in the United States,The primary purpose of this study was to determine the time-varying associations between decreased handgrip strength (HGS) and individual instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments for a nationally-representative sample of aging adults in the United States.
Parametric process optimization to improve the accuracy and mechanical properties of 3D printed parts,"Investigating the mechanical properties and dimensional accuracy of 3D printed parts is an important step towards achieving optimum printing conditions. This condition, which leads to the fabrication of parts with appropriate mechanical properties and accuracy, is achieved by studying the effect of different process parameters on the final structure. In this work, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was employed to design specified experiments to investigate the effects of layer thickness, printing orientation and delay, on the compressive strength and dimensional error of the parts. The results show that an increase in the delay time in X orientation results in better binder spreading and uniformity followed by improvement in the compression strength. Furthermore, more binder spreads in the vertical direction leads to the higher dimensional error in the Z direction. The results proved that the RSM provides a time and cost-efficient design to print the prototypes with optimum strength and dimensional error."
Discovery of novel geranylgeranyl reductases and characterization of their substrate promiscuity,"Geranylgeranyl reductase (GGR) is a flavin-containing redox enzyme that hydrogenates a variety of unactivated polyprenyl substrates, which are further processed mostly for lipid biosynthesis in archaea or chlorophyll biosynthesis in plants. To date, only a few GGR genes have been confirmed to reduce polyprenyl substrates in vitro or in vivo."
Digital technology and practices for school improvement: innovative digital school model,"The aim of this study was to create a model which describes the main elements for improving schools with digital technology and helps to reveal differences between schools and identify their best practices and challenges. The innovative digital school model (IDI school) offers a framework for research but also a research-based model for schools to examine their own practices with digital technologies. The model combines previous research on school improvement, creation of innovations, and digital technology in education as a special case of innovations and learning as knowledge creation to define six main elements describing an innovative, digital school: visions of the school, leadership, practices of the teaching community, pedagogical practices, school-level knowledge practices and digital resources. The model was applied to investigate three basic education schools. The results indicate that the model worked: we found essential differences between the schools and their best practices and challenges for improvement. It worked particularly well for those elements, which are mainly the responsibility for leadership inside a school. The differences of various elements between schools were not based on socioeconomic background but on the school-level practices. As a conclusion, we suggest that to improve schools with digital technology, all elements of the model should be included in the evaluation and development process."
"Heterozygosity testing and multiplex DNA panel screening as a potential tool to monitor health and inbreeding in a small, closed dog population","Selective breeding in populations with a limited effective population size may result in a loss of genetic diversity, which can cause an increased concentration of specific disease liability genes. The Dutch Shepherd Dog (DSD) in the Netherlands is an example of such a breed with a small effective population."
Graph-based visual analytics for cyber threat intelligence,"The ever-increasing amount of major security incidents has led to an emerging interest in cooperative approaches to encounter cyber threats. To enable cooperation in detecting and preventing attacks it is an inevitable necessity to have structured and standardized formats to describe an incident. Corresponding formats are complex and of an extensive nature as they are often designed for automated processing and exchange. These characteristics hamper the readability and, therefore, prevent humans from understanding the documented incident. This is a major problem since the success and effectiveness of any security measure rely heavily on the contribution of security experts."
Assessment of artificial groundwater recharge potential through estimation of permeability values from infiltration and aquifer tests in unconsolidated alluvial formations in coastal areas,Twenty infiltration tests and 12 pumping tests were carried out in Wadi Baysh in southwestern Saudi Arabia. The objective of the study was to assess the soil and aquifer permeability from the point of view of artificial groundwater recharge. Infiltration tests showed that the soil permeability values ranged from 0.58 to 37.15 m/day and showed good recharge potential. The analysis of the pumping tests showed that the aquifer permeability values ranged from 2.6 to 57.4 m/day and were approximately within the same range as those obtained from infiltration tests. Monitoring of groundwater levels in a few wells before and 1 month after a heavy rainfall event in August 2016 shows an average increase of 2.25 m in the groundwater levels which substantiates the recharge rates obtained from infiltration and pumping tests. Average annual groundwater recharge for the area calculated from water table fluctuation method is 72.08 mm/year indicating that the lower reaches of Wadi Baysh catchment has good potential for groundwater recharge and if managed properly can help in tackling the problem of groundwater depletion due to excessive pumping.
Evaluation of drainage problems in Antalya Konyaalti parks in the context of landscape engineering,"In this study, factors that cause drainage problems in 23 Nisan Park and Mevlana Park have been investigated in the scope of landscape design and landscape engineering. To propose regulations to protect the natural topography and natural drainage lines, evaluations and observations were conducted, and these data were digitized. Water accumulation analyses were performed using field observations, which were used to create a water accumulation analysis map that was compared with water collection area maps created using Arc Hydro extension in ArcGIS. The results show that surface waters accumulate in areas such as pedestrian ways and playgrounds due to deficiencies in landscape design. Surface water quantities were calculated using the rational method. To prevent structural damage and excessive water entry, deep drainage and concrete or grass-covered parabolic surface drainage systems are recommended. Additional suggestions are provided for other studies to be conducted in this regard."
Effect of watershed land use on tributaries’ water quality in the east African Highland,"A study was carried out on four tributaries of Gilgel Gibe Reservoir to identify water physicochemical characteristics in different land use categories (farmland, naturally vegetated land, and settlement). Water samples were collected from 12 sampling sites along four permanent streams flowing into Gilgel Gibe Reservoir. Data sets were evaluated using nonparametric statistical techniques. Dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total nitrogen (TN), turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), and total suspended solids (TSS) spatially showed significant differences in the wet season and DO, temperature, and BOD5 varied significantly during the dry season. When excluding DO, electrical conductivity (EC), and TP during the wet and dry seasons, the remaining variables showed significant differences. During the wet season, concentrations of most water quality parameters were greatest in influents from agricultural land. Pollution and eutrophication risk is closely associated with drainage from agricultural land, requiring that emphasis and priorities be given to land use management and conservation."
"The effect of soil pollution with petroleum-derived substances on Porcellio scaber Latr. (Crustacea, Isopoda)","Presented research aimed at investigating the effect of short-term contact with petroleum-derived substances (PDSs) on life parameters of Porcellio scaber Latr. (Isopoda) and accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in its body. The influence of presence of P. scaber on the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) content in soil was also determined. The following objects were established: control—unpolluted soil; soil polluted with petrol; soil polluted with diesel fuel and soil polluted with used engine oil. Every pollutant was used in the amounts equal to 6000 mg of fuel/kg d.m. of soil 15 months earlier. In the laboratory, survival and body mass change of P. scaber reared in investigated soils were observed. The delivered food was not contaminated with PDSs. P. scaber reveals a considerable resistance in a short (4 weeks) contact with PDSs, evidenced as high survivability (from 68% on the soil polluted with engine oil to 77% on the soil polluted with diesel fuel) and undisturbed increase in body mass (on the level similar to control). It indicates the potential usefulness of this animal as a monitoring organism. No positive correlation was observed between TPH depletion in the soils contaminated with PDSs and P. scaber presence during 4 weeks of the experiment. PAH level in P. scaber bodies was generally very low (with the highest level of anthracene 0.40 μg/g of wet mass—after 4 weeks of rearing on the diesel fuel–contaminated soil), which may confirm the thesis about considerable abilities of isopods for biotransformation of these pollutants and low susceptibility to these xenobiotic penetration through integuments. However, a tendency for accumulation for phenanthrene and anthracene in conditions of soil polluted with diesel fuel was observed respectively 0.07 and 0.21 μg/g of wet mass for phenanthrene and 0.22 and 0.40 μg/g of wet mass for anthracene, observed successively in the 2nd and 4th week of rearing."
Hindcasting eutrophication and changes in temperature and storage volume in a semi-arid reservoir: a multi-decadal Landsat-based assessment,"In situ monitoring of freshwater systems is often constrained by cost and accessibility, particularly in developing countries and in remote areas. Satellite remote sensing is therefore increasingly being integrated with existing in situ water quality monitoring programs. In this study, we use the Landsat TM/ETM+ image record collected between 1984 and 2015 to track temporal changes in trophic status, chlorophyll-a levels, algal bloom incidences, water clarity, water temperature, and reservoir water volume in a poorly monitored hypereutrophic semi-arid reservoir. Historical reservoir water quality data are inferred from calibrated Landsat-based empirical algorithms. The results show that, although the reservoir has existed in a eutrophic to hypereutrophic state over the past 30 years, its water quality has significantly deteriorated in the most recent decade. Mean summer chlorophyll-a concentrations were found to have increased by around 163% between 1984 and 2015, while water clarity dropped by more than 58% over the same period. Statistically significant changes in surface water temperatures were also apparent for the month of August, with a cumulative increase of 1.24 °C over the 31-year study period. The rise in temperature appears to correlate with the incidence of Microcystis blooms observed in the reservoir over the past decade. On the other hand, the water volume in the reservoir was found to have been fairly stable over time, likely as a result of adaptive reservoir management. This study demonstrates the strength of using Landsat data to hindcast and quantify changes in water quality and quantity in poorly monitored freshwater systems."
Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in alpine ecosystems of Altun Mountain National Nature Reserve in dry China,"The Altun Mountain National Nature Reserve (AMNNR), characterized by complex topography, is located on the northern edge of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. The stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) are critically important for carbon and nitrogen sequestration in dry alpine ecosystems of the AMNNR, which is a “natural laboratory” for assessing the carbon and nitrogen storage without human disturbance. We explored the stocks of SOC and TN in soils of different dry alpine ecosystems by sampling 23 sites across the AMNNR during 2013. The results showed that the SOC and TN stocks of AMNNR varied significantly with ecosystem types. The SOC stocks of 0–15 cm were highest in the alpine wet meadow (7.96 kg/m2), followed by alpine steppe (2.63 kg/m2). The stocks of SOC and TN in 0–5 and 5–10 cm soils of alpine wet meadow were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those in the soils of other dry alpine ecosystems. In the whole AMNNR, total storage of SOC and TN were approximately 80.97 and 4.48 Tg, 34.25% of SOC and 24.01% of TN were stored in the alpine steppe, 21.51% of SOC and 26.01% of TN were stored in the alpine scrub, the largest ecosystem in the AMNNR. Our findings suggested it is important to protect the soil and vegetation of the dry alpine ecosystems, particularly the alpine wet meadow and alpine scrub to promote the carbon storage."
"Biomonitoring, physico-chemical, and biomarker evaluations of abattoir effluent discharges into the Ogun River from Kara Market, Ogun State, Nigeria, using Clarias gariepinus","The discharge of untreated effluents into aquatic ecosystems poses potential adverse effects to aquatic organisms. In this study, the physico-chemical characteristics of abattoir effluent from Kara Cow Market, Ogun State, Nigeria, surface water and sediments from the Ogun River were evaluated. Fish species and macrobenthic fauna diversity in the river were also examined. Acute toxicity and biochemical and histological studies were investigated in Clarias gariepinus exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of the effluent over a period of 28 days. Effluent physico-chemical parameters such as ammonia, conductivity, total dissolved solids, and total suspended solids were higher than set limits. Total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the effluent and sediment were 6.73 mg/L and 8.07 mg/kg, respectively. Tetracycline (an antibiotic administered to the cows at the market) levels in the effluent and surface water were 0.23 μg/mL and 0.85 μg/mL, respectively. Fish species diversity was lower at the test site compared to the reference site. Chironomus spp. and Tubifex tubifex dominated the benthic assemblage at the test site. There were significant changes (p < 0.05) in the biochemical indices but no histological alterations in exposed C. gariepinus after 28 days. The results demonstrate that the effluent poses potential risks to the aquatic organisms and ecosystem services provided by the river. We recommend that environmental regulatory agencies and stakeholders should establish effluent and solid wastes management systems at the market to prevent environmental and public health epidemics within the framework of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 6 (clean water and sanitation) and 14 (life below water)."
Pesticide waste disposal among farmers of Moghan region of Iran: current trends and determinants of behavior,"Unsafe disposal of pesticide waste at farms has serious consequences for the environment and public health. Investigation of disposal behavior of farmers towards pesticide waste after use helps to identify and improve their behavior. This study aimed to investigate how farmers dispose pesticide waste in Moghan area of Iran and factors influencing their behavior. A sample of 400 farmers, using multistage random sampling, was selected. Most respondents threw the empty pesticide containers into the general garbage, sold them to waste buyers or other farmers, threw them into irrigation canals, or dumped them at the farm. However, the majority of the farmers did not use the empty pesticide containers for home use (78.5%), nor did they send containers to recycling or pesticide supplying centers (84.1%). Almost half of the farmers (49.2%) had low awareness of pesticide risks. Married farmers, farmers who were happy with farming, farmers who had additional occupation, and farmers who had received training in integrated pest management (IPM) behaved more safely (P < 0.05) in pesticide waste disposal. Also, participants with academic degrees behaved more safely (P < 0.05) in pesticide waste disposal. Based on regression analysis, awareness of pesticide risks, spraying experience, distance to agriculture service center, and distance to the city accounted for 46% of farmers’ variation in pesticide waste disposal behavior. Farmers’ behavior in pesticide waste disposal after use is a critical point for reducing pesticide exposure and environmental contamination in Moghan region of Iran. Awareness creation and behavioral change communication are required to improve farmers’ attitudes towards disposal of pesticide waste along with training in IPM which minimizes pesticide use."
"Identifying representative watershed for the Urmia Lake Basin, Iran","Designation of representative watersheds (RWs) as a reference area representing key behavior of the whole region is an essential tool to provide a time and cost-effective basis for monitoring watershed performance against different driving forces. It is more important in developing countries facing lack of necessary investments in one hand and ever-increasing human interventions and need to assess the outcome behavior of the system in another hand. However, this serious affair has been less considered worldwide, in general, and in developing countries, in particular. Therefore, in the present study, a quantitative-based method of Representative Watershed Index (RWI) with potential range from 0 to 100 has been formulated using four important criteria and available national-wide raster data of elevation (meter), slope (%), rainfall erosivity factor (t m ha−1 cm h−1), and land use. The approach was then applied to the data prepared for the unique and invaluable global water ecosystem of the Urmia Lake Basin (ULB), north-western Iran, as a case study. The input raster was overlaid via matrices programming in the MATrix LABoratory (MATLAB) 2016 and Geographic Information System (GIS) 9.3 software environments. The RWIs were accordingly computed for 61 sub-watersheds of the ULB. The RWIs resulted from quadri-partite dimensional matrices that varied from 5.54 to 53.46 with respective maximum dissimilarity and resemblance with the entire 61 study sub-watersheds in the region. However, the sub-watershed with RWI of 40.65 (No. 57) was proposed as the final RW for the whole ULB due to hydrological independency, appropriate locality, and existence of functioning meteorological and hydrometric stations. The identified RW would be suggested to be considered as the basis for future insight monitoring and assessing environmental issues for the region eventually leading to an appropriate adaptive watershed management."
Ethanolic extract of Melia azedarach L. induces melanogenesis through the cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling pathway,"Since the cause of hypopigmentary skin disorders (hair graying and vitiligo) is typically unknown, there is no known cure for these disorders. Melia azedarach L. is used in Southeast Asia across China and Japan as a traditional medicine, and it has been reported to have various pharmacological properties. However, there have been no reports to demonstrate the involvement of M. azedarach L. in pigmentation. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of ethanolic extract of M. azedarach L. (MAE) on melanogenesis and to elucidate its mechanism of action in B16F10 mouse melanoma cells and human epidermal melanocytes."

Chronic exposure to ethylenethiourea induces kidney injury and polycystic kidney in mice,"Ethylenethiourea (ETU) is one of the main metabolite of ethylenebisdithiocarbamate fungicides and potential exposure is highest for workers involved in rubber and fungicide production. Exposure of ETU induces endocrine disruption, teratogenesis, carcinogenicity, and goitrogenicity."
Fundamental and Practical Limits of Achieving Artificial Magnetism and Effective Optical Medium by Using Self-Assembly of Metallic Colloidal Clusters,"The self-assembly of metallic colloidal clusters (so called plasmonic metamolecules) has been viewed as a versatile, but highly effective approach for the materialization of the metamaterials exhibiting artificial magnetism at optical frequencies (including visible and near infrared (NIR) regimes). Indeed, several proofs of concepts of plasmonic metamolecules have been successfully demonstrated in both theoretical and experimental ways. Nevertheless, this self-assembly strategy has barely been used and still remains an underutilized method. For example, the self-assembly and optical utilization of the plasmonic metamolecules have been limited to the discrete unit of the structure; the materialization of effective optical medium made of plasmonic metamolecules is highly challenging. In this work, we theoretically exploited the practical limits of self-assembly technology for the fabrication of optical magnetic metamaterials."
Magnetically-Programmable Cylindrical Microparticles by Facile Reaping Method,"Various shapes of magnetically-programmed polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based particles with Fe3O4 blocks were harvested by a facile reaping method. Specifically, elastic PEG-based particles can be obtained by applying uniform shear stress onto the array of densely-populated PEG/Fe3O4 microstructures. A simple theory based on geometric and material properties was developed based on experimental observations to produce highly uniform cylindrical microparticles in a cost-effective manner. We analyzed the force balance of hairy architectures to explain the uniform cutting process, which is based on operating zones with various geometries and material elasticity. Here, the alignments of mono-/multi-dispersed iron oxide (Fe3O4) in microparticles can be tunable by changing the external magnetic field during replications. Furthermore, the collective reversible motions of different magneto-responsive PEG particles were observed when the external magnetic field was controlled, wherein such behaviors can be applied in potential medial applications such as controllable drug-delivery or microrobotics."
Experimental validation of GNSS repeater detection based on antenna arrays for maritime applications,"In this work, we present an antenna array-based algorithm to detect GNSS repeater and/or spoofing attacks with an experimental validation. With an array receiver capable of measuring the impinging ranging signals direction of arrival in terms of azimuth and elevation, it is possible to estimate the antenna platforms attitude. The fact that this information is computed (w.r.t. a reference frame) during the position calculation is used. We propose an algorithm aiming to find the relation between both representations. This mapping defines the receiver’s attitude in terms of pitch, roll and yaw angle. The residual of this mapping is used to construct a quality metric for the mapping. If a threshold is undershot, spoofing/repeating is indicated. The performance is demonstrated using software simulations. To show the capabilities under realistic conditions, a test platform is described. It consists of a real-time array receiver and a sampling device enabling post-processing. A maritime measurement campaign including two vessels—one acting as receiver and the other acting as transmitter—is portrayed. Finally, the real-time and post-processing performance of the algorithm is evaluated."
"Time use, mobility and expenditure: an innovative survey design for understanding individuals’ trade-off processes","A large amount of information is required to model the complex trade-off processes between travel activities, non-travel activities and budget assignment at the individual level. This paper describes the development of a new survey design, which incorporates components of travel surveys, time use surveys and consumer expenditure surveys in an integrated format, which is expected to deliver a richer data set allowing deeper insights into individuals’ activity and consumption patterns. The survey procedure and the incentives paid, which were necessary to obtain acceptable response rates, are also described. Results from two pilot studies using a trip-based and an activity-based diary format are presented. The paper examines to which extent the diaries have been capable of collecting the required data with high quality and response rates. The innovative “Mobility–Activity–Expenditure-Diary” is introduced and results of the main survey using this design are presented. Travel behaviour and non-travel activities were reported at high quality. Expenditures would require longer observation periods (and preferably not only telephone but also personal support in the survey process) to reduce unsystematic variations and to better capture individuals’ long term equilibrium."
Efficient renal clearance of DNA tetrahedron nanoparticles enables quantitative evaluation of kidney function,"DNA tetrahedron nanostructure (DTN) is one of the simplest DNA nanostructures and has been successfully applied for biosensing, imaging, and treatment of cancer. To facilitate its biomedical applications and potential clinical translation, fundamental understanding of DTN’s transportation among major organs in living organisms becomes increasingly important. Here, we describe the efficient renal clearance of DTN in healthy mice by using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The kidney elimination of DTN was later applied for renal function evaluation in murine models of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). We further established a mathematical program of DTN to validate its changes of transportation pattern in healthy and UUO mice. We believe the establishment of pharmacokinetic profiles and mathematical model of DTN may provide insight for future optimization of DNA nanostructures for biomedical applications."
Design and Combustion Characteristic Analysis of Free Piston Stirling Engine External Combustion System,"The free piston Stirling engine external combustion system was simulated to investigate the diesel-air combustion characteristics in order to demonstrate its feasibility by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The different effects on combustion were distinguished by analyzing the combustion burner, the injection position of diesel oil, the front tube arrangement of Stirling heater head and the back fin. The results show that the tilted front tube arrangement of the heater head with the back fin is the best practicable technology while the distance between the diesel nozzle position and the swirler top is 0. Its total heat flux is 15.6 kW, and the average heat transfer coefficients of the front and back tubes are 127W/(m2 · K) and 192W/(m2 · K), respectively. The heat transfer is mainly through convection, and the proportion of radiative heat transfer is only 16.9%. The best combustion efficiency of the free piston Stirling engine external combustion system is 86%."
Poly(Dimethylbenzimidazolium) Iodide Assisted Dispersion of Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes and Their Palladium Nanoparticle Hybrid,"The multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) have always been as the catalyst supporting materials, but for high-performance composite catalysts, the dispersion and functionalization of MWNTs are important challenging problems. In this paper, Electrocatalytically active palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) on MWNTs with the high-performance and excellent solubility polymer, poly(dimethylbenzimidazolium) iodide (P(DMBI)-I−) as modifier and glue was first discussed. The results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrate a better dispersion of MWNTs with the assist of P(DMBI)-I−. The Raman spectra indicate a strong π-π interaction between MWNTs and P(DMBI)-I−. Taking advantages of the coordination effect of imidazole groups and the electrostatic attraction to Pd NPs, the prepared Pd/MWNTs-P(DMBI)-I−(Pd/MPDI−) hybrid is of well electrocatalytic activity to the ethanol fuel cells by electrochemical measurements. So it is believed that P(DMBI)-I− can be further applied in the dispersion of different carbon-based materials and metal nanoparticles for fabricating more novel composites for catalyst and electrode material."
Effects of Heat Intensity and Inflow Wind on the Reactive Pollution Dispersion in Urban Street Canyon,"This paper investigates the impacts of heating intensity and inflow wind speed on the characteristics of reactive pollutant dispersion in street canyons using the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model that includes the transportation of NO, NO2, and O3 coupled with NO-NO2-O3 photochemistry. The results indicated that the heat intensity and inflow wind speed have a significant influence on the flow field, temperature field and the characteristics of reactive pollutant dispersion in and above the street canyon. With the street canyon bottom heating intensity increasing, NO, NO2 and O3 concentrations in street canyon are decreased. The O3 concentration reductions are even more than the NO and NO2 concentrations. Improving the inflow wind speed can significantly reduce the NO and NO2 concentrations within street canyons. But the O3 concentrations have a slight rise with wind speed increasing. The results would be useful for understanding the interrelation among reactive vehicle emissions, and provide references for urban planners."
Residual Chart with Hidden Markov Model to Monitoring the Auto-Correlated Processes,"Autocorrelations exist in real production extensively, and special statistical tools are needed for process monitoring. Residual charts based on autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models are typically used. However, ARIMA models need a quite amount of experience, which sometimes causes inconveniences in the implementation. With a good performance under less experience or even none, hidden Markov models (HMMs) were proposed. Since ARIMA models have many different performances in positive and negative autocorrelations, it is interesting and essential to study how HMMs affect the performances of residual charts in opposite autocorrelations, which has not been studied yet. Therefore, we extend HMMs to negatively auto-correlated observations. The cross-validation method is used to select the relatively optimal state number. The experiment results show that HMMs are more stable than Auto-Regressive of order one (AR(1) models) in both cases of positive and negative autocorrelations. For detecting abnormalities, the performance of HMMs approach is much better than AR(1) models under positive autocorrelations while under negative autocorrelations both methods have similar performances."
"Structure-Forming Role of Heavy Cations in Sr3B2SiO8 (Sr(B,Si)O2.67) and Ba3B6Si2O16 Borosilicates","The crystallographic analysis of the orthorhombic (Pnma) structure of Sr3B2SiO8 ≈ (Sr(B,Si)O2.67) shows that its experimentally found symmetry is determined by the geometry of the Sr sublattice where the anion radical without this symmetry simulates it by the statistical averaging of four variants of real configurations. With a reduced fraction of heavy atoms in the triclinic (Р1) structure of Ba3B6Si2O16, the Ba and Si cations whose sublattice determines the presence of additional pseudosymmetry form the skeleton of the structure."
Synthesis and Crystal Structures of Two Coordination Polymers Based on a New N-Donor Aromatic Ligand,"Two new coordination polymers Co(C9H7N7)(SO4)(H2O) (I) and Cd(C9H6N7)2·H2O (II), where C9H7N7 is 4-(5-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)pyridine, are synthesized through hydrothermal reactions and structurally determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. The results reveal that compound I belongs to the triclinic space group P-1 with a 1-D chain structure, whereas compound II belongs to the monoclinic space group C2 with a 2D layer structure. Hydrogen bonds play an important role in the construction of 3D structure of the two compounds."
Structure of a Graphene-Modified Electroactive Polymer for Membranes of Biomimetic Systems: Simulation and Experiment,"A model is proposed that describes the structure of water filled Nafion-graphene composite forming the body of an electroactive polymer membrane for actuators of biomimetic systems able to work in air and a liquid medium. The model predicts the growth of the ionic conductivity with increasing concentration of a graphene modifier, which is due to that the size of a part of clusters of the Nafion framework containing hydrophobic graphene flakes enlarges together with the pore size. Then the optimal concentration of the graphene modifier is reached, which provides the maximum ionic conductivity and actuation ability of the membrane as well as its elastic properties. The possibility of introducing into Nafion the modifier amount needed to improve the actuator operation is experimentally tested."
A Novel Green Synthesis of Copper Oxide Nanoparticles Using a Henna Extract Powder,"Cupric oxide (CuO) nanoparticles are synthesized using Henna and copper nitrate as the copper source by the green method at different calcination temperatures. The effect of the amount of Henna extracts on the particle size and the morphology of nanoparticles is characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy. This method has many advantages such as nontoxicity, economic viability, easiness to scale up, less time consuming and environment-friendly approach for the synthesis of CuO nanoparticles without using any organic chemicals. The average crystallite size of CuO nanoparticles is calculated using the Scherrer formula. The powder XRD analysis reveals the formation of a monoclinic CuO phase with an average particle size of 22–38 nm. There is good agreement between the data obtained by XRD and microscopic measurements. The particle sizes of the prepared cupric oxide nanoparticles depend on the amount of Henna extracts and calcination temperatures."
Decreased Handgrip Strength is Associated With Impairments in Each Autonomous Living Task for Aging Adults in the United States,The primary purpose of this study was to determine the time-varying associations between decreased handgrip strength (HGS) and individual instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments for a nationally-representative sample of aging adults in the United States.
Parametric process optimization to improve the accuracy and mechanical properties of 3D printed parts,"Investigating the mechanical properties and dimensional accuracy of 3D printed parts is an important step towards achieving optimum printing conditions. This condition, which leads to the fabrication of parts with appropriate mechanical properties and accuracy, is achieved by studying the effect of different process parameters on the final structure. In this work, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was employed to design specified experiments to investigate the effects of layer thickness, printing orientation and delay, on the compressive strength and dimensional error of the parts. The results show that an increase in the delay time in X orientation results in better binder spreading and uniformity followed by improvement in the compression strength. Furthermore, more binder spreads in the vertical direction leads to the higher dimensional error in the Z direction. The results proved that the RSM provides a time and cost-efficient design to print the prototypes with optimum strength and dimensional error."
A nearly self-sufficient framework for modelling reactive-transport processes in concrete,"This paper describes a multi-species and multi-mechanism reactive-transport modelling framework for concrete. This modelling framework has the potential to be used in conjunction with performance specifications currently being developed in the US. The modelling framework is ‘nearly’ self-sufficient as it enables electrical resistivity to be used as the main physically measured input parameter in the simulations. The model uses thermodynamic calculations to predict pore solution composition, pore solution resistivity, pore volumes, and reactions between the solid and ionic components of the cementitious matrix such as chloride binding. The measured electrical resistivity is normalized by the calculated pore solution resistivity to compute the formation factor, which is used to predict transport properties of the ionic species. The framework allows the solution of reactive-transport equations with minimal input data to assess ionic movement, chloride ingress, and time to corrosion."
"Mapping ecoregions under climate change: a case study from the biological ‘crossroads’ of three continents, Turkey","Besides climate change vulnerability, most ecosystems are under threat from a history of improper land-use and conservation policies, yet there is little existing long-term ecological research infrastructure in Turkey. In regions with no ecological networks across large landscapes, ecoregion concept offers opportunities for characterizing the landscape under changing climate."
Molecular marker development and primary physical map construction for the tuber shape Ro gene locus in diploid potato (Solanum tuberosum L.),"Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is an important crop worldwide that is consumed fresh and processed in many different ways. The tuber shape is a critical trait in potato breeding, because it directly affects processing quality. Previous studies have demonstrated that the Ro locus on chromosome X is the major locus controlling tuber shape, and the round shape allele, Ro, is dominant over the long shape allele, ro. However, no reports on the cloning or physical mapping of this locus have been published. In this study, whole genome sequencing and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library construction were applied to develop molecular markers and construct a physical map of Ro. Eight round-tuber genotypes were used to construct the BAC library, which contains about 40,000 clones with an average insert size of 85 kb and represents approximately four haploid potato genomes. A total of 66 individuals with extreme round or long tubers were selected to construct a round-tuber shape DNA bulk and a long-tuber shape DNA bulk for WGS. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified from WGS data were used to develop nine polymorphic markers linked to Ro. These markers were used to screen the BAC library, and eight positive BAC clones were ultimately identified and then analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion and BAC end sequencing and used to develop markers and identify new positive BAC clones. Finally, a primary physical map of Ro was constructed using a chromosome walking strategy. This map provides an important reference for cloning the potato tuber shape gene and studying tuber shape variation."
High-density quantitative trait locus mapping revealed genetic architecture of leaf angle and tassel size in maize,"The maize leaf angle and tassel size have close relationships with grain yield. These traits had undergone a strong selection and great morphological changes during domestication and improvement. To understand the genetic architecture of these morphological traits, an F2:3 population was developed using the cross of Lv28 by H082183, the latter having more erect leaves and small tassels. Using a modified hidden Markov model (HMM), the genetic map covering 1495.79 cM was obtained from 1965 bin markers. QTL mapping identified six leaf angle QTL, seven tassel branch number QTL, and ten tassel dry weight QTL, including three large-effect QTL (R2 > 10%) qLA1_2, qLA2, and qTBN8. The inflorescence development gene tasselseed2 (ts2) and zea floricaula leafy2 (zfl2) were co-located in the interval of qTW1 and qTW2_1. Seven genes in qLA1_2 showed evidence of selection during maize improvement, including two protein kinase genes (GRMZM2G138475 and GRMZM2G114093) and two trehalose-phosphatase genes (GRMZM2G347280 and GRMZM2G008226). Interestingly, the significant SNPs associated with tassel branch number and the selection region in qTBN8 were consistent at 5′ non-coding region of GRMZM5G873917. And the nucleotide diversity analysis revealed that the 5′ regulatory region of GRMZM5G873917 was under strong selection. These results provide insights into genetic architectures of maize morphological traits and alleles which have potentials in maize breeding."
Analysis of structure and properties of DVB–GMA based porous polymers,"Polar porous polymeric microspheres divinylbenzene–glycidyl methacrylate (DVB–GMA) were synthesized with a suspension method. Two kinds of polymers differing in chemical composition and physical properties were obtained. The molar ratios of monomers in the polymers were 50:50 and 75:25, respectively. Next, the prepared materials were chemically treated with phosphoric or sulphuric acid in order to additionally modify their surface. Consequently, the polymers gained acidic character and cation exchange properties. The prepared materials were characterized by: elemental analysis, ATR-FTIR, DSC, low temperature nitrogen sorption and SPE experiments. CHN and ATR-FTIR confirmed the chemical structures of the polymers. The DSC analyses revealed their network was highly cross-linked. Porous structure parameters of the studied materials strongly depended on their chemical composition. All the materials were mesoporous with bimodal pore size distribution (3.7 nm and 5.5–7.5 nm). Highly cross-linked DVB–GMA 75:25 and its acidic derivatives had twice higher specific surface areas (320–370 m2/g) than their less cross-linked counterparts DVB–GMA 50:50 (140–190 m2/g). The prepared materials were tested for the sorption of phenolic compounds (phenol, 2-chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol) and popular pharmaceuticals—aspirin, paracetamol and ibuprofen. The process of dynamic sorption of phenols depended on both porous structure and surface chemistry of the polymers. And the less polar character of the polymeric surface was balanced by its higher porosity to maintain the sorption ability on the same level. In case of pharmaceuticals dependence of sorption properties on porosity and/or surface chemistry was more diversified and additionally chemical nature of adsorbate had to be taken into account."
Experimental validation of GNSS repeater detection based on antenna arrays for maritime applications,"In this work, we present an antenna array-based algorithm to detect GNSS repeater and/or spoofing attacks with an experimental validation. With an array receiver capable of measuring the impinging ranging signals direction of arrival in terms of azimuth and elevation, it is possible to estimate the antenna platforms attitude. The fact that this information is computed (w.r.t. a reference frame) during the position calculation is used. We propose an algorithm aiming to find the relation between both representations. This mapping defines the receiver’s attitude in terms of pitch, roll and yaw angle. The residual of this mapping is used to construct a quality metric for the mapping. If a threshold is undershot, spoofing/repeating is indicated. The performance is demonstrated using software simulations. To show the capabilities under realistic conditions, a test platform is described. It consists of a real-time array receiver and a sampling device enabling post-processing. A maritime measurement campaign including two vessels—one acting as receiver and the other acting as transmitter—is portrayed. Finally, the real-time and post-processing performance of the algorithm is evaluated."
First three cases of scalp temperature change in symptomatic areas affected by nummular headache: a case report,"Nummular headache is a distinct headache disorder characterized by a rounded or elliptical symptomatic area that is typically 2 to 6 cm in diameter and does not change in shape or size with time. Although the pathomechanism is still not clear, nummular headache is thought to be a primary headache disorder. To date, more than 250 cases have been reported; the symptoms of this disease vary, but no cases with scalp temperature changes in the symptomatic areas have been reported yet. In this study, we present three patients with a new manifestation of nummular headache, in which the symptomatic areas of the scalp were colder or warmer than normal areas; we believe that our work might be helpful for medical practitioners and researchers."

Here, we present a life-threatening case of ocular and bulbar MG symptoms after HPV vaccination and a brief literature review."
"Soil fixation and erosion control by Haloxylon persicum roots in arid lands, Iran","Vegetation roots contribute to soil fixation and reinforcement, thus improving soil resistance against erosion. Generally, the amount of soil fixation presented by roots mainly depends on root density and tensile strength. In the present study, we conducted the research in order to further understand the biotechnical properties of Haloxylon persicum and also to quantify its role in increasing soil cohesion in arid lands of Iran. Ten H. persicum shrubs were randomly selected for root distribution and strength investigations, in which five samples were set on flat terrain and other five samples on a moderate slope terrain. The profile trench method was used to assess the root area ratio (RAR) as the index of root density and distribution. Two profiles were dug around each sample, up and downslope for sloped treatment and north and south sides for flat treatment. The results showed that RAR increased with increasing soil depth and significantly decreased in 40–50 cm layers of downhill (0.320%) and 50–60 cm for uphill (0.210%). The minimum values for the northward and southward profiles were 0.003% and 0.003%, respectively, while the maximum values were 0.260% and 0.040%, respectively. The relationship between the diameter of root samples and root tensile strength followed a negative power function, but tensile force increased with increasing root diameter following a positive power function. The pattern of increased cohesion changes in soil profile was relatively similar to RAR curves. The maximum increased cohesion due to the presence of roots in uphill and downhill sides were 0.470 and 1.400 kPa, respectively. In the flat treatment, the maximum increased cohesions were 0.570 and 0.610 kPa in northward and southward profiles, respectively. The analysis of variance showed that wind and slope induced stresses did not have any significant effect on the amount of increased cohesion of H. persicum. The findings served to develop knowledge about biotechnical properties of H. persicum root system that can assist in assessing the efficiency of afforestation and restoration measures for erosion control in arid lands."
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ameliorate the chemical properties and enzyme activities of rhizosphere soil in reclaimed mining subsidence in northwestern China,"In semi-arid region of northwestern China, underground mining subsidence often results in decreased vegetation coverage, impoverishment of soil fertility and water stress. In addition, the physical-chemical and biological properties of soil also change, resulting in more susceptible to degradation. In particular, subsidence causes disturbance of the symbioses of plant and microbe that can play a beneficial role in the establishment of vegetation communities in degraded ecosystems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of revegetation with exotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculum on the chemical and biological properties of soil over time in mining subsidence areas. Soils were sampled at a depth up to 30 cm in the adjacent rhizosphere of Amorpha fruticose Linn. from five reclaimed vegetation communities in northwestern China. In August 2015, a field trial was set up with five historical revegetation experiments established in 2008 (7-year), 2011 (4-year), 2012 (3-year), 2013 (2-year) and 2014 (1-year), respectively. Each reclamation experiment included two treatments, i.e., revegetation with exotic AMF inoculum (AMF) and non-AMF inoculum (the control). Root mycorrhizal colonization, glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP), soil organic carbon (SOC), soil nutrients, and enzyme activities were also assessed. The results showed that mycorrhizal colonization of inoculated plants increased by 33.3%–163.0% compared to that of non-inoculated plants (P<0.05). Revegetation with exotic AMF inoculum also significantly improved total GRSR (T-GRSP) and easily extracted GRSP (EE-GRSP) concentrations compared to control, besides the T-GRSP in 1-year experiment and the EE-GRSP in 2-year experiment. A significant increase in SOC content was only observed in 7-year AMF reclaimed soils compared to non-AMF reclaimed soils. Soil total N (TN), Olsen phosphorus (P) and available potassium (K) were significantly higher in inoculated soil after 1–7 years of reclamation (except for individual cases), and increased with reclamation time (besides soil Olsen P). The exotic AMF inoculum markedly increased the average soil invertase, catalase, urease and alkaline phosphatase by 23.8%, 21.3%, 18.8% and 8.6%, respectively (P<0.05), compared with the control. Root mycorrhizal colonization was positively correlated with soil parameters (SOC, TN and soil available K) and soil enzyme activities (soil invertase, catalase, urease and alkaline phosphatase) in both AMF and non-AMF reclaimed soils (P<0.05), excluding available K in non-AMF reclaimed soils. T-GRSP (P<0.05) and EE-GRSP (P<0.05) were significantly correlated with the majority of edaphic factors, except for soil Olsen P. The positive correlation between root mycorrhizal colonization and available K was observed in AMF reclaimed soils, indicating that the AMF reclaimed soil with a high root mycorrhizal colonization could potentially accumulate available K in soils. Our findings concluded that revegetation with exotic AMF inoculum influenced soil nutrient availability and enzyme activities in the semi-arid ecosystem, suggesting that inoculating AMF can be an effective method to improve soil fertility and support restoration of vegetation communities under poor conditions like soil nutrient deficiency and drought."
Homology-independent multiallelic disruption via CRISPR/Cas9-based knock-in yields distinct functional outcomes in human cells,"Cultured human cells are pivotal models to study human gene functions, but introducing complete loss of function in diploid or aneuploid cells has been a challenge. The recently developed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-independent knock-in approach permits targeted insertion of large DNA at high efficiency, providing a tool for insertional disruption of a selected gene. Pioneer studies have showed promising results, but the current methodology is still suboptimal and functional outcomes have not been well examined. Taking advantage of the promoterless fluorescence reporter systems established in our previous study, here, we further investigated potentials of this new insertional gene disruption approach and examined its functional outcomes."
"Heterozygosity testing and multiplex DNA panel screening as a potential tool to monitor health and inbreeding in a small, closed dog population","Selective breeding in populations with a limited effective population size may result in a loss of genetic diversity, which can cause an increased concentration of specific disease liability genes.

Assessment of artificial groundwater recharge potential through estimation of permeability values from infiltration and aquifer tests in unconsolidated alluvial formations in coastal areas,Twenty infiltration tests and 12 pumping tests were carried out in Wadi Baysh in southwestern Saudi Arabia. The objective of the study was to assess the soil and aquifer permeability from the point of view of artificial groundwater recharge. Infiltration tests showed that the soil permeability values ranged from 0.58 to 37.15 m/day and showed good recharge potential. The analysis of the pumping tests showed that the aquifer permeability values ranged from 2.6 to 57.4 m/day and were approximately within the same range as those obtained from infiltration tests. Monitoring of groundwater levels in a few wells before and 1 month after a heavy rainfall event in August 2016 shows an average increase of 2.25 m in the groundwater levels which substantiates the recharge rates obtained from infiltration and pumping tests. Average annual groundwater recharge for the area calculated from water table fluctuation method is 72.08 mm/year indicating that the lower reaches of Wadi Baysh catchment has good potential for groundwater recharge and if managed properly can help in tackling the problem of groundwater depletion due to excessive pumping.
Evaluation of drainage problems in Antalya Konyaalti parks in the context of landscape engineering,"In this study, factors that cause drainage problems in 23 Nisan Park and Mevlana Park have been investigated in the scope of landscape design and landscape engineering. To propose regulations to protect the natural topography and natural drainage lines, evaluations and observations were conducted, and these data were digitized. Water accumulation analyses were performed using field observations, which were used to create a water accumulation analysis map that was compared with water collection area maps created using Arc Hydro extension in ArcGIS. The results show that surface waters accumulate in areas such as pedestrian ways and playgrounds due to deficiencies in landscape design. Surface water quantities were calculated using the rational method. To prevent structural damage and excessive water entry, deep drainage and concrete or grass-covered parabolic surface drainage systems are recommended. Additional suggestions are provided for other studies to be conducted in this regard."

AADL+: a simulation-based methodology for cyber-physical systems,"AADL (architecture analysis and design language) concentrates on the modeling and analysis of application system architectures. It is quite popular for its simple syntax, powerful functionality and extensibility and has been widely applied in embedded systems for its advantage. However, it is not enough for AADL to model cyber-physical systems (CPS) mainly because it cannot be used to model the continuous dynamic behaviors. This paper proposes an approach to construct a new sublanguage of AADL called AADL+, to facilitate the modeling of not only the discrete and continuous behavior of CPS, but also interaction between cyber components and physical components. The syntax and semantics of the sublanguage are provided to describe the behaviors of the systems. What’s more, we develop a plug-in to OSATE (open-source AADL tool environment) for the modeling of CPS. And the plug-in supports syntax checking and simulation of the system model through linking with modelica. Finally, the AADL+ annex is successfully applied to model a lunar rover control system."
Regular Substructures in the Rich Open Galaxy Clusters,"We present the results of study the 2D distribution of galaxies in 254 rich open galaxy clusters. The clusters have no concentration to the center, so all kinds of substructures are clearly seen. Regular linear substructures in galaxy clusters were described in Rood & Sastry scheme of morphological types according to positions of 10 brightest galaxies. Another types of regular substructures were missed. Our study fills the lacuna. We have found about 25% of clusters in our data set having four kinds of regular substructures, beyond founded before linear ones. New kinds of regular substructures are: crossing and divaricating filaments or X and Y-type peculiarities, as well as curved strips and short dense chains. We suppose the distribution of dark matter in founded galaxy clusters with substructures have corresponded regular peculiarities. Hot gas distribution in these clusters must be observed distorted X-ray halo. We suppose also the clusters will evolve in the different ways."

Technoscience and Biodiversity Conservation,"The discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 has opened new avenues in gene editing. This system, usually considered as molecular scissors, permits the cutting of the DNA at a targeted site allowing the introduction of new genes or the removal or the modification of existing ones. The genome-editing, involving gene drive or not, is then considered with a strong interest in a variety of fields ranging from agriculture to public health and conservation biology. Given its controversial aspects, it is then no surprise that actors in biodiversity conservation do express conflicting views on this emerging and disruptive technology. The positions are ranging from a request for a moratorium to the will to test and deploy it in strategies aiming at eradicating invasive species of mammals on islands. Reviewing some of its recent developments brings light on the conflicts of interest, the financial support, and lobbying currently occurring in this growing field of biotechnology. While an optimistic view on the use of gene drive for ecosystem conservation was first promoted by several molecular biologists, the risks and uncertainties associated have now led to some reservations. Overall, the eventual use of this novel approach for conservation raises concerns related to the engagement of the public, the communication between scientists, and the public and the risk of a manufactured consent. There are also a series of essential ethical and philosophical questions on the relations we have with Nature that needs to be answered."

Outcomes after toxic alcohol poisoning: a systematic review protocol,"Toxic alcohols have been implicated in accidental ingestions and intentional exposures. Recognition of toxic alcohol poisoning is challenging. The main treatment modalities include antidotes with alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitors and dialysis. Current guidelines exist for both methanol and ethylene glycol intoxication. However, treatment consensus related to other toxic alcohols is limited. Furthermore, uncertainties regarding thresholds for when to initiate antidotes and dialysis persist. As a consequence, variations exist in the interventions utilized for management of all toxic alcohol poisonings. To our knowledge, no prior systematic review of clinical outcomes of toxic alcohols exists. The objective of this study is to summarize existing evidence on short- and long-term outcomes of patients following toxic alcohol poisonings, including methanol, ethylene glycol, isopropanol, propylene glycol, and diethylene glycol."
Plantation species-specific adjustment functions for the Forest Carbon Predictor in New Zealand,"New Zealand’s planted forest area is dominated by radiata pine (90%), but also includes Douglas-fir (6%), and a range of minor species including eucalypts and cypress. Carbon sequestration in planted forest is currently estimated using yield tables from the Forest Carbon Predictor (FCP), which was designed to estimate dry matter in live biomass and dead organic matter pools in radiata pine stands. Stand variables required as model inputs include basal area, mean top height, stocking, and tending regime. In addition, wood density needs to be measured or estimated. When the FCP is applied to plantation species other than radiata pine, dry matter estimates may need to be adjusted to remove bias."
Potential use of hyperspectral data to classify forest tree species,"Remote sensing techniques and data are becoming increasingly popular in forest management, e.g. for change detection and health condition analysis. Tree species recognition is a fundamental issue in taking forest inventories, especially in carbon budget modelling. Hyperspectral imagery provides an accurate classification results for large areas based on a relatively small amount of training data."
"Invasive alien plant species, fragmentation and scale effects on urban forest community composition in Durban, South Africa","Urban forests are under increased pressure from invasion by exotic (alien) species. The vegetation present in the matrix of urban sites is a rich source of alien invasive propagules, which increases the risk of alien invasion in forests within an urban space, leading to a decline in indigenous species. Therefore, determining the distribution patterns of native and exotic species as influenced by environmental factors can assist in quantifying the impact of exotic species at broad scales based on responses on a finer scale. Quantifying the effects of multiple environmental factors on the distribution patterns of both indigenous and alien species in the ecosystem may help in prescribing suitable management efforts."
Appraisal of arid land status: a holistic assessment pertains to bio-physical indicators and ecosystem values,"Appraisal of arid land status is very crucial one to know the extent and factors associated with their degradation. Previous studies from arid regions are mostly qualitative in nature (indicator assessment like good, moderate, severe, and very severe) and generally overlooked the significance of temporal fluctuation."
"Examination of metal mobilization from a gunshot by scanning acoustic microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy: a case report","Projectile foreign bodies are known to cause chronic heavy metal toxicity due to the release of metal into the bloodstream. However, the local effect around the metallic object has not been investigated and the main goal of our study is to examine the influence of the object in close proximity of the object."
A prospective study of tinea capitis in children: making the diagnosis easier with a dermoscope,"Tinea capitis is a scalp infection caused by different fungi. Etiological diagnosis is based on suggestive clinical findings and confirmation depends on the fungus growth in culture. However, it is not always possible to perform this test due to lack of availability. The association of clinical and dermatoscopic findings in suspected cases of tinea capitis may help the identification of the etiological agent, facilitating precocious, specific treatment."
A nearly self-sufficient framework for modelling reactive-transport processes in concrete,"This paper describes a multi-species and multi-mechanism reactive-transport modelling framework for concrete. This modelling framework has the potential to be used in conjunction with performance specifications currently being developed in the US. The modelling framework is ‘nearly’ self-sufficient as it enables electrical resistivity to be used as the main physically measured input parameter in the simulations. The model uses thermodynamic calculations to predict pore solution composition, pore solution resistivity, pore volumes, and reactions between the solid and ionic components of the cementitious matrix such as chloride binding. The measured electrical resistivity is normalized by the calculated pore solution resistivity to compute the formation factor, which is used to predict transport properties of the ionic species. The framework allows the solution of reactive-transport equations with minimal input data to assess ionic movement, chloride ingress, and time to corrosion."
An Ultrasensitive Electrochemical DNA Biosensor Based on Carboxylated Multi-walled Carbon Nanotube/Molybdenum Disulfide Composites for KRAS Gene Detection,"In this paper, an ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor based on carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotube/molybdenum disulfide composites (MWCNTs-COOH/MoS2) for the detection of KRAS gene is described. An easy, low-cost method, named one-step hydrothermal, was used for the synthesize of MWCNTs-COOH/MoS2 nanocomposites, and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used for characterizing the prepared composites. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were employed for an electrochemical performance study of this biosensor. Under optimal conditions, the detection limit of target DNA achieved down to 3 fM (S/N = 3) with high sensitivity; the linear range with the logarithm of the concentrations of target DNA varied from 1.0 × 10−14 to 1.0 × 10−7 M. Finally, the practicality of our proposed sensor was verified by a determination of the KRAS gene in human serum samples with good accuracy and high precision due to the excellent conductivity and large active surface area of the MWCNTs-COOH/MoS2 nanocomposites. This proposed biosensor thus provides a practical method for the rapid and sensitive analysis of gene detection."
Polystyrene-coated Interdigitated Microelectrode Array to Detect Free Chlorine towards loT Applications,We apply interdigitated microelectrode array (IDA) sensors for water quality monitoring. IDA sensors with an ion-sensitive coating show higher sensitivity of about 600 mV with the hypochlorite ion concentration increasing from 0 to 10 ppm more than the traditional sensing method. The response mechanism and selectivity have been studied. Several material components that affect the sensing process were explored. Coupling agents and plasticizer were introduced into the coating material to improve the coating material quality and its adhesion to the electrodes. The stability/repeatability and linearity have been significantly improved.
miR-23a promotes invasion of glioblastoma via HOXD10-regulated glial-mesenchymal transition,"Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and invasive brain tumor and has a poor prognosis; elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms is essential to select molecular targeted therapies. Here, we investigated the effect of microRNAs on the marked invasiveness of glioblastoma. U373 glioblastoma cells were infected with 140 different microRNAs from an OncomiR library, and the effects of the invasion-related microRNAs and targeted molecules were investigated after repeated Matrigel invasion assays. Screening of the OncomiR library identified miR-23a as a key regulator of glioblastoma invasion. In six glioblastoma cell lines, a positive correlation was detected between the expression levels of miR-23a and invasiveness. A luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that homeobox D10 (HOXD10) was a miR-23a-target molecule, which was verified by high scores from both the PicTar and miRanda algorithms. Forced expression of miR-23a induced expression of invasion-related molecules, including uPAR, RhoA, and RhoC, and altered expression of glial-mesenchymal transition markers such as Snail, Slug, MMP2, MMP9, MMP14, and E-cadherin; however, these changes in expression levels were reversed by HOXD10 overexpression. Thus, miR-23a significantly promoted invasion of glioblastoma cells with polarized formation of focal adhesions, while exogenous HOXD10 overexpression reversed these phenomena. Here, we identify miR-23a-regulated HOXD10 as a pivotal regulator of invasion in glioblastoma, providing a novel mechanism for the aggressive invasiveness of this tumor and providing insight into potential therapeutic targets."
c-Myc promotes tubular cell apoptosis in ischemia-reperfusion-induced renal injury by negatively regulating c-FLIP and enhancing FasL/Fas-mediated apoptosis pathway,"c-Myc plays an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell apoptosis. FasL/Fas pathway is a key regulator of cell apoptosis. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of c-Myc on the FasL/Fas pathway in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced renal injury. Rats were objected to bilateral renal ischemia for 60 min and reperfused for 24 or 48 h. NRK-52E cells were treated with hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) or FasL. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify the distribution of c-Myc. Cell apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL staining. Ad-c-Myc and recombinant pcDAN 3.0 were used to overexpress c-Myc and c-FLIP, respectively. ChIP assay and luciferase assay were used to detect the binding of c-Myc to c-FLIP promoter. In I/R rats, c-Myc was increased significantly and mainly located in renal tubular epithelial cells; meanwhile, c-FLIP was decreased, cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL-positive staining cells were increased. Treatment of I/R rats with c-Myc inhibitor 10058-F4 significantly attenuated the decrease in c-FLIP, the increase in cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-3, TUNEL-positive cells, Scr and BUN in I/R rats. In NRK-52E cells, hypoxia and reoxygen induced the increase in c-Myc and decrease in c-FLIP. ChIP and luciferase assay results indicated that c-Myc binds to the promoter region of c-FLIP gene. Overexpression of c-Myc markedly decreased c-FLIP. Overexpression of c-FLIP inhibited the increase in cleaved caspase-8 and caspase-3 induced by FasL. Data indicated that c-Myc is increased in kidneys of I/R rats and negatively regulates the expression of c-FLIP, then enhanced FasL-induced cell apoptosis in I/R stress."
Antibacterial activities of plant-derived compounds and essential oils against Cronobacter strains,"Essential oils (EOs) are liquid preparations produced from plant materials. Their use as inhibitors of the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms is a good alternative to the chemical additives in foods. The disc-diffusion method was used to screen the EOs from thyme, cinnamon, clove, peppermint, marjoram, cumin, rosemary, fennel, basil, lime, bergamot orange, orange, lemon, grapefruit, mandarin, cardamom, anise, and ginger, against 21 strains of Cronobacter species, including: C. sakazakii, C. muytjensii, C. turicensis, C. condimenti, and C. malonaticus. In addition, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the maximum tolerable concentration (MTC) of thymol, trans-cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, and menthol were determined for five strains of Cronobacter spp. The most effective EOs were: thyme > cinnamon > marjoram. In turn, EOs from clove, cumin, and fennel had a moderate inhibiting effect against only some of the analyzed strains. The majority of the tested EOs: peppermint, rosemary, basil, cardamom, anise, ginger, and all EOs from citrus fruits were ineffective against all the studied strains."

Mechanical behaviors of bimsoils during triaxial deformation revealed using real-time ultrasonic detection and post-test CT image analysis,"Real-time ultrasonic experiments were conducted to investigate the mechanical responses of block-in-matrix soil (bimsoil) samples under triaxial deformation. Although the mechanical behaviors of bimrocks and bimsoils have been widely studied, the rock-soil (block-matrix) interface cracking, rock-soil interaction, block occlusion, and interlocking effects during triaxial deformation are still incompletely understood. This paper aims to investigate the effect of confining pressure and block proportion on ultrasonic and mechanical properties of bimsoils using ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV). Conventional compaction soil testing was adapted to produce cylindrical bimsoil samples of different rock block percentages (RBP) with various hammer counts, to ensure roughly the same compactness of soil matrix. The experimental results show that UPV reflects the complex mechanical behavior of bimosils during deformation. UPV measurements became more variable as samples deformed at the pre-peak and post-peak stages. It is suggested that the UPV is affected not only by stress level but also the meso-structures that develop during failure in bimsoils. Observation of macroscopic fracture morphology combined with image analysis of mesoscopic computed tomography (CT) scans reveals that multiple localized tortuous bands form during deformation due to the presence of rock blocks in bimsoils. The changes of UPV are mainly attributed to the interactions of soil matrix and rock block. The post-test CT images further confirm this result."
Paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental reconstruction at Tarfaya Atlantic coastal basin (Morocco) based on clay mineral records from Upper Cretaceous to Quaternary,"We generated clay mineral assemblage records on Late Cretaceous to Miocene-Pliocene rocks and on Holocene river sediments at Tarfaya Atlantic coastal basin in Morocco. Results show that illite, chlorite, kaolinite, smectite, and palygorskite originated from a continental source whereas corrensite formed within the basin. A very high kaolinite content and kaolinite/(illite+chlorite) ratio during the Turonian indicate a high chemical weathering which was coeval with a global weathering event during a warm and humid climate during that time. An increase in physical erosion during the Santonian as reflected by high (illite+chlorite) content and low kaolinite/(illite+chlorite) ratio was most likely associated with the early western Anti-Atlas uplift. Abundant (palygorskite+sepiolite) contents in Early Eocene rocks reflect the development of extremely dry and warm climatic conditions over the coastal regions of Tarfaya during that time. Dominant (illite+chlorite) and smectite clay minerals and a marked increase in sedimentation during the Miocene-Pliocene suggest an increase in physical erosion of the high-relief source region (western Anti-Atlas) which was mainly controlled by tectonic denudation. High kaolinite content and kaolinite/(illite+chlorite) ratio also occurred in the Holocene river sediments indicating warm and humid climate during that time. The abundant corrensite, however, indicates a basin depositional environment and suggests that oxic conditions were dominant in the Tarfaya basin during the Campanian and the Oligocene-Early Miocene."
Contributions of pore-throat size distribution to reservoir quality and fluid distribution from NMR and MIP in tight sandy conglomerate reservoirs,"Overall pore-throat size distribution is a critical foundation for evaluating tight sandy conglomerate reservoirs. However, the pore-throat size cannot be easily obtained from a single technic due to the complex microstructure. In this paper, a new method was introduced to characterize the microstructure by combining thin sections, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), pressure-controlled injected mercury (PMI), rate-controlled injected mercury (RMI), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Twenty-four tight sandy conglomerate cores from the Baikouquan Formation of the Mabei oil field, northwest China, were selected to conduct the series of experiments. Overall pore-throat size distribution (TRD) was reconstructed by combining mercury injection porosimetry (MIP) with NMR with pores that were equivalent to triangular cross-section; the radii of the inscribed spheres were obtained to weaken the influence of irregular shapes by RMI. Irreducible water saturation of the cores was achieved by nitrogen displacement, which decreases with increasing of micropore proportion. An ideal relationship between permeability, movable water saturation, and micropore percentages was constructed which indicates the effect of microstructure on reservoir quality and fluid distribution in tight sandy conglomerate reservoirs."

Views from a pinhole: experiments in wild pedagogy on the Franklin River,"This work, comprised of pinhole photographs paired with written text, represents a series of ontological experiments with participants on a rafting expedition, on the Franklin River, lutruwita (Tasmania). Through photographic experiences in this landscape these experiments interrogated ideas about ways to represent places and ideas. We began with informal riverside workshops on pinhole photography followed by making pictures and developing them during the river journey. The home-made pinhole camera used by participants in the making of these photographs had neither a lens nor a viewfinder, thus the making of photographs demanded a certain sensual presence. The written expression of this work is partly comprised of reflections on the experiences of participants, some of whom engaged directly in this making. Participants were asked to consider what drew their attention to particular photographic images, and what feelings, emotions, experiences, memories or thoughts these chosen images evoked. These reflections are conjoined with musings on wild, self-willed and educational opportunities therein. The way in which this work is deliberately presented is reminiscent of a lyric philosophy (Zwicky 1992, 2003) that seeks to engage the reader, in this case through visual and linguistic representations, with patterned resonance."
Lipid metabolism of phenol-tolerant Rhodococcus opacus strains for lignin bioconversion,"Lignin is a recalcitrant aromatic polymer that is a potential feedstock for renewable fuel and chemical production. Rhodococcus opacus PD630 is a promising strain for the biological upgrading of lignin due to its ability to tolerate and utilize lignin-derived aromatic compounds. To enhance its aromatic tolerance, we recently applied adaptive evolution using phenol as a sole carbon source and characterized a phenol-adapted R. opacus strain (evol40) and the wild-type (WT) strain by whole genome and RNA sequencing. While this effort increased our understanding of the aromatic tolerance, the tolerance mechanisms were not completely elucidated."

Properties and characterization of an aluminium–silicon nitride fibre powder metal composite,"In this article, we fabricated one-dimensional 0.5 vol% silicon nitride (Si3N4) fibre reinforced Alumix123 matrix composites by the powder metallurgy method. Si3N4 is a ceramic material with high strength, stiffness and low coefficient of thermal expansion. The Si3N4 used in the study is comprised of single crystal fibres with sub-micrometre diameter and length < 25 μm. The size of the fibre is smaller than the metal matrix powder allowing it to coat the metal powder before consolidation rather than forming agglomerations that might lead to pores and poor mechanical properties. We investigated the effects of Si3N4 fibre additions on the densification, hardness, elastic modulus and tensile strength. The experimental results found that the Si3N4 fibre effectively enhanced the mechanical properties of the composites at low additions. The microstructural analysis clearly shows the Si3N4 fibres in the sintered grain boundaries. The interface between the fibre and the Alumix123 matrix showed good wetting and bonding with only minimal reaction. The Si3N4 fibre reinforced Alumix123 composites have potential uses in the automobile and aerospace industries due to their improved specific mechanical properties."
Prediction of MicroRNAs in the Epstein–Barr Virus Reveals Potential Targets for the Viral Self-Regulation,"Studies involving miRNAs have opened discussions about their broad participation in viral infections. Regarding the Human gammaherpesvirus 4 or Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), miRNAs are important regulators of viral and cellular gene expression during the infectious process, promoting viral persistence and, in some cases, oncogenic processes. We identified 55 miRNAs of EBV type 2 and inferred the viral mRNA target to self-regulate. This data indicate that gene self-repression is an important strategy for maintenance of the viral latent phase. In addition, a protein network was constructed to establish essential proteins in the self-regulation process. We found ten proteins that work as hubs, highlighting BTRF1 and BSRF1 as the most important proteins in the network. These results open a new way to understand the infection by EBV type 2, where viral genes can be targeted for avoiding oncogenic processes, as well as new therapies to suppress and combat the persistent viral infection."
Application of transfer learning for cancer drug sensitivity prediction,"In precision medicine, scarcity of suitable biological data often hinders the design of an appropriate predictive model. In this regard, large scale pharmacogenomics studies, like CCLE and GDSC hold the promise to mitigate the issue. However, one cannot directly employ data from multiple sources together due to the existing distribution shift in data. One way to solve this problem is to utilize the transfer learning methodologies tailored to fit in this specific context."
Reconstructing high-resolution chromosome three-dimensional structures by Hi-C complex networks,"Hi-C data have been widely used to reconstruct chromosomal three-dimensional (3D) structures. One of the key limitations of Hi-C is the unclear relationship between spatial distance and the number of Hi-C contacts. Many methods used a fixed parameter when converting the number of Hi-C contacts to wish distances. However, a single parameter cannot properly explain the relationship between wish distances and genomic distances or the  locations of topologically associating domains (TADs)."
DLAD4U: deriving and prioritizing disease lists from PubMed literature,"Due to recent technology advancements, disease related knowledge is growing rapidly. It becomes nontrivial to go through all published literature to identify associations between human diseases and genetic, environmental, and life style factors, disease symptoms, and treatment strategies.

"Evolutionary, structural and functional analysis of the caleosin/peroxygenase gene family in the Fungi","Caleosin/peroxygenases, CLO/PXG, (designated PF05042 in Pfam) are a group of genes/proteins with anomalous distributions in eukaryotic taxa. We have previously characterised CLO/PXGs in the Viridiplantae. The aim of this study was to investigate the evolution and functions of the CLO/PXGs in the Fungi and other non-plant clades and to elucidate the overall origin of this gene family."
Characterization of GNSS observations from a Nexus 9 Android tablet,"Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) raw data were made available in the application programming interface (API) starting from version 7.0 of the Android operating system. This opens possibilities for precise positioning with Android devices, as externally generated GNSS corrections can now be included in the positioning estimation in a convenient way. The Nexus 9 tablet is a good candidate for an early assessment of the raw GNSS observables and the corresponding derived precise positions, as it also supports many of the optional features and observation types presented by the API, including carrier phase observations which play an important role in many precise positioning techniques. It is known from the previous studies that poor handling of multipath in smartphones and tablets is a big challenge when it comes to precise GNSS positioning with these kinds of devices. Hence, this study assesses the raw GNSS observations and the calculated precise positions of the Nexus 9 tablet in two experimental setups with different multipath impacts. In addition, various biases of the observations are determined, some of which is not present on high-grade geodetic receivers. The analysis is done for GPS and GLONASS, which are supported by the Nexus 9 tablet. The study shows that multipath plays an important role for the expected accuracy of the calculated precise positions, both due to the induced error on the measurements, and due to loss of lock of the GNSS signals, which significantly affects precise positioning from carrier-phase measurements. Position accuracy ranges from just below 1 m to a few decimeters between the experimental setups with moderate and low levels of multipath respectively, for positioning based on carrier-phase observations. It is, furthermore, demonstrated that consideration of code inter-system biases and code inter-frequency biases of the Nexus 9 tablet are crucial for differential GNSS with multiple GNSS systems and when GLONASS observations are used in the positioning solutions. Besides these expected biases, also other less expected behaviors were discovered in the Nexus 9 GNSS observations, including various drifts for the code and phase observations. This study also proposes some strategies to handle these."
Studies of Modern Star Catalogs Based on Photoelectric Observations of Lunar Occultations of Stars,"An important area of investigation in astronomy is the relationship between fundamental and dynamical coordinate systems. Valuable material for such studies is provided by photoelectric occultation observations of stars by the Moon, which can provide high precision of detecting rapidly occurring processes and have been carried out over a long time interval. This latter feature is especially important for analyses of the stellar propermotions dynamics. A method has been developed to use photoelectric occultation observations to determine the orientation and rotational parameters of the axes of the coordinate system used for modern star catalogs relative to the coordinate axes of a highly accurate dynamical ephemeris of theMoon. A complete database of photoelectric occultation observations has been created for this purpose, containing data for 57 365 events. The combination of photoelectric occultation observations and other astronomical observations such as lunar laser-ranging data enables the highly accurate determination of parameters of the Moon’s dynamics, such as systematic errors in catalog coordinate systems, including various geodetic reference systems. The parameters of shifts and the rotation of the axes of the Hipparcos Celestial Reference Frame relative to the DE421 dynamical system are obtained. This paper is based on a talk given at the conference “Modern Astrometry 2017,” dedicated to the memory of K.V. Kuimov (Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Moscow State University, October 23–25, 2017)."
"Next Generation Space Gravimetry: Scientific Tasks, Concepts, and Realization","A review of the achievements of space geodesy in the 21st century, represented by the successful realization of the CHAMP, GOCE, and GRACE missions, is presented. The main result of these missions is the creation of models for the gravitational field of the Earth with high spatial and temporal resolution. In particular, for an uncertainty in the height of the geoid of ~1 mm, the monthly models contain about 50 spherical harmonics, corresponding to a spatial resolution of ~400 km. The GRACE Follow On mission was launched inMay 2018, whose aim is to provide data for the monthly global models for the gravitational field of the Earth initiated with the GRACE mission. Paths for the development of the next generation of space gravimetry projects are considered. These will enable an appreciable (by no less than a factor of 10) improvement in the precision of models for the gravitational field of the Earth. This paper is based on a presentation made at the conference “Modern Astrometry 2017,” dedicated to the memory of K.V. Kuimov (Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Moscow State University, October 23–25, 2017)."

Kuimov (Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Moscow State University, October 23–25, 2017)."
Supernova Explosion Mechanism with the Neutrinos and the Collapse of the Rotation Core,"Most of the energy released in the gravitational collapse of the cores of massive stars is carried away by neutrinos. Neutrinos play a pivotal role in explaining core-collapse supernovae. In this work the multidimensional gas dynamics is used with neutrino transport in the flux-limited diffusion approximation to study the role of multi-dimensional effects. The possibility of large-scale convection is discussed, which is interesting both for explaining SNII and for setting up observations to register possible high-energy (≲10 MeV) neutrinos from the supernova. In compare with the previous work describing a new multidimensional gas dynamics method with neutrino transport we investigate the role of the rotation in the convection."
Observations of the Ly-α Forest,"We analyze four high resolution rich samples of Ly-α and metal lines (two at z ≥ 2 and two at z ≤ 0.2). We describe evolution of the observed Doppler parameters and absorbers separation and propose a model of the forest. We argue that all absorption lines are formed in gaseous caustics created in stable DM subclouds. The absorption lines are described by two local characteristics, the Doppler parameter and the column density of neutral hydrogen. We show that evolution of the Doppler parameter is very slow and its mean value increases by a factor ≤1.5 at redshifts 0 ≤ z ≤ 3. We show that absorbers separation increases as <dsep ∝ (1 + z)−2. We describe evolution of absorbers in the framework of a two component model: the first population represents absorbers with just one line created in compact stable DM clouds with random spatial distribution, and the second population includes absorbers with two, three and more absorption lines formed in more massive and extended random DM clouds. Slow evolution of the Doppler parameter indicates high stability of caustics and conditions within clouds. For absorbers of the second population relative velocity of lines slowly increases with time."
Polarization of Gravitational Waves in General Teleparallel Theories of Gravity,"We determine the possible gravitational wave polarizations in two general classes of teleparallel gravity theories, using the metric and symmetric teleparallel geometries. For this purpose we apply the Newman–Penrose formalism, and find that depending on the choice of parameters, the E(2) class of the theories is one of N2,N3, III5, II6, corresponding to two to six polarizations, where all of them include the two tensor polarizations known from general relativity. We also find classes of theories apart from general relativity which yield the same polarizations."

Cyclostationary Modeling of Surface Electromyography Signal During Gait Cycles and Its Application for Cerebral Palsy Diagnosis,"Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of permanent movement disorders that appear in early childhood. The electromyography (EMG) signal analysis and the gait analysis are two most commonly used methods in the clinic. In this paper, a cyclostationary model of the EMG signal is proposed. The model can combine the aforementioned two methods. The EMG signal acquired during the gait cycles is assumed to be cyclostationary due to the physiological characteristics of the EMG signal production. Then, the spectral correlation density is used to analyze the cyclic frequency (corresponding to the gait cycles) and spectral frequency (the frequency of EMG signal) in a waterfall representation of the two kinds of frequencies. The experiments show that the asymptomatic (normal) subjects and symptomatic subjects (with CP) can be distinguished from the spectral correlation density in a range of cyclic frequencies."
Performance Evaluation of Short Parabolic Trough Collectors Integrated with a Small-Scale Solar Power and Heating System,"An investigation is presented on the performance of a small-scale solar power and heating system with short parabolic trough collectors (PTCs). The steady-state model of the short PTCs is evaluated with outside experiments. The model mainly contains the heat loss of the receiver, the peak optical efficiency and the incident angle factor consisting of incident angle modifier and end loss. It is found that the end loss effect is essential in this model when the length of the PTCs is less than 48 m, especially in the winter. The standard deviation of the steady-state model is 1.4%. Moreover, the potential energy efficiency ratio of the solar power and heating system is considerably larger than the coefficient of performance (COP) of general air-source heat pumps, and increases with the decrease of the condensation temperature. An overall system efficiency of 49% can be reached. Lastly, the existence of a water storage tank improves the flexibility of heating the building, and the volume of the water storage tank decreases with the increase of the heating water temperature."
Study on Oxidation Activity of CuCeZrOx Doped with K for Diesel Engine Particles in NO/O2,"CuCeZrOx and KCuCeZrOx catalysts were synthesized and coated on the blank diesel particulate filter (DPF) substrate and a particulate matter (PM) loading apparatus was used for soot loading. The catalytic performances of soot oxidation were evaluated by temperature programmed combustion (TPC) test and characterization tests were conducted to investigate the physicochemical properties of the catalysts. The reaction mechanism in the oxidation process was analyzed with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that CuCeZrOx catalyst exhibited high activities of soot oxidation at low temperature and the best results have been attained with Cu0.9Ce0.05Zr0.05Ox over which the maximum soot oxidation rate decreased to 410 °C. Characterization tests have shown that catalysts containing 90% Cu have uniformly distributed grains and small particle sizes, which provide excellent oxidation activity by providing more active sites and forming a good bond between the catalyst and the soot. The low-temperature oxidation activity of soot could be further optimized due to the excellent elevated NO’s conversion rate by partially substituting Cu with K. The maximum particle oxidation rate can be easily realized at such a low temperature as 347°C."
Research on Spatially Adaptive High-Order Total Variation Model for Weak Fluorescence Image Restoration,"Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) has emerged as one of the most advanced fluorescence cell imaging techniques in the field of biomedicine. However, fluorescence cell imaging is limited by spatial blur and additive white noise induced by the excitation light. In this paper, a spatially adaptive high-order total variation (SA-HOTV) model for weak fluorescence image restoration is proposed to conduct image restoration. The method consists of two steps: optimizing the deconvolution model of the fluorescence image by the generalized Lagrange equation and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); using spatially adaptive parameters to balance the image fidelity and the staircase effect. Finally, an comparison of SA-HOTV model and Richardson-Lucy model with total variation (RL-TV model) indicates that the proposed method can preserve the image details ultimately, reduce the staircase effect substantially and further upgrade the quality of the restored weak fluorescence image."
Pressure-Based Approach to Estimating the Injection Start and End in Single and Split Common Rail Injection Processes,"Fuel injection timing is an important control parameter for engine combustion optimization and emissions control. However, the actual fuel injection timing is different from the nominal one commanded by the electronic control unit, due to the system hydraulic lag or the possible communication malfunction. In this study, a simple estimate approach based on the injector inlet pressure is proposed to capture four critical characteristic instants at the start and end of injection. The critical characteristic moments estimated using this pressure-based approach are validated against those determined by the actual injection rate profiles, in the context of different single or split injection processes. The comparison revealed that the characteristic injection moments estimated by the injector inlet pressures and those determined by the actual injection rate profiles have a satisfactory agreement, certifying the broad applicability and reliability of this pressure-based approach in the detection of the real fuel injection start and end time."
Catalytic Combustion of Lean Methane Assisted by Electric Field over Pd/Co3O4 Catalysts at Low Temperature,"A series of Pd/Co3O4 catalysts were prepared by Self-Propagating High-Temperature Synthesis (SHS) method in this study, and electric field was applied for catalytic combustion of lean methane over Pd/Co3O4 catalysts at low temperature. When electric field was applied, the catalytic combustion performance of Pd/Co3O4 catalysts was greatly improved, and the application of electric field could reduce the load of active element Pd to some extent while maintaining the same efficiency. Based on experimental tests and the analysis results of X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in-situ DRIFTS), the mechanism of catalytic oxidation of CH4 over Pd/Co3O4 catalysts in electric field was proposed. The catalytic combustion of CH4 occurs only when the temperature is higher than 250 °C normally, but when electric field was applied, the whole process of CH4 oxidation was promoted significantly and the reaction temperature was reduced. Electric field could promote the reduction of the support Co3O4 to release the lattice oxygen, resulting in the increase of PdOx and the surface chemisorbed oxygen, which could provide more active sites for the low-temperature oxidation of CH4. Furthermore, electric field could accelerate the dehydroxylation of CoOOH to further enhance the activity of the catalysts."
Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Turbofan Engine Using Hybrid Model Based on Autoencoder and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory,"Turbofan engine is a critical aircraft component with complex structure and high-reliability requirements. Effectively predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of turbofan engines has essential significance for developing maintenance strategies and reducing maintenance costs. Considering the characteristics of large sample size and high dimension of monitoring data, a hybrid health condition prediction model integrating the advantages of autoencoder and bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of RUL. Autoencoder is used as a feature extractor to compress condition monitoring data. BLSTM is designed to capture the bidirectional long-range dependencies of features. A hybrid deep learning prediction model of RUL is constructed. This model has been tested on a benchmark dataset. The results demonstrate that this autoencoder-BLSTM hybrid model has a better prediction accuracy than the existing methods, such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector regression (SVR), convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The proposed model can provide strong support for the health management and maintenance strategy development of turbofan engines."

This paper conducts health management for the turbine blades. Elman neural network, and improved Elman neural network, i.e., outputhidden feedback (OHF) Elman neural network are studied as the main research methods. The results verify the applicability of OHF Elman neural network."
Research on Morlet Wavelet Based Lamb Wave Spatial Sampling Signal Optimization Method,"In recent years, Lamb wave and piezoelectric transducers (PZTs) array based wavenumber filtering technique for damage estimation has been gradually studied. Compared with the time domain and frequency domain analysis of the Lamb wave signals, the wavenumber domain analysis is an effective approach to distinguish wave propagating direction and wave modes. However, the spatial resolution sampled by the PZTs is lower than that sampled by scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. As for the diameter of the PZT, it cannot be very small. In this paper, a new Lamb wave spatial sampling signal optimization method based on Morlet wavelet is proposed. Firstly, the frequency band parameter of the Morlet mother wavelet function is calculated by the Lamb wave excitation signal. Then, the sum of squared errors between the Lamb wave spatial sampling signal and the Morlet wavelet function fitting waveform at each scale factor and time factor is calculated. Finally, the scale factor and time factor corresponding to the least sum of squared errors can be judged to be the best match scale factor and time factor respectively, and the Morlet wavelet function fitting waveform in that scale factor and time factor can be seen as the optimized Lamb wave spatial sampling signal. The validation experiment performed on a glass fiber epoxy composite plate shows that the proposed method can improve the spatial resolution and length of the Lamb wave spatial sampling signal, and the sum of squared errors of this method is no more than 0.2."
“Carte du Ciel” Catalogs and Their Importance for Modern Astrometry,"Astronomical catalogs created as a result of the “Carte du Ciel” project are considered, including the work of K.V. Kuimov in this area, its methodological importance, and perspectives in the GAIA era. This paper is based on a presentation made at the conference “Modern Astrometry 2017,” dedicated to the memory of K.V. Kuimov (Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Moscow State University, October 23–25, 2017)."
Supernova Explosion Mechanism with the Neutrinos and the Collapse of the Rotation Core,"Most of the energy released in the gravitational collapse of the cores of massive stars is carried away by neutrinos. Neutrinos play a pivotal role in explaining core-collapse supernovae. In this work the multidimensional gas dynamics is used with neutrino transport in the flux-limited diffusion approximation to study the role of multi-dimensional effects. The possibility of large-scale convection is discussed, which is interesting both for explaining SNII and for setting up observations to register possible high-energy (≲10 MeV) neutrinos from the supernova. In compare with the previous work describing a new multidimensional gas dynamics method with neutrino transport we investigate the role of the rotation in the convection."
Observations of the Ly-α Forest,"We analyze four high resolution rich samples of Ly-α and metal lines (two at z ≥ 2 and two at z ≤ 0.2). We describe evolution of the observed Doppler parameters and absorbers separation and propose a model of the forest. We argue that all absorption lines are formed in gaseous caustics created in stable DM subclouds. The absorption lines are described by two local characteristics, the Doppler parameter and the column density of neutral hydrogen. We show that evolution of the Doppler parameter is very slow and its mean value increases by a factor ≤1.5 at redshifts 0 ≤ z ≤ 3. We show that absorbers separation increases as <dsep ∝ (1 + z)−2. We describe evolution of absorbers in the framework of a two component model: the first population represents absorbers with just one line created in compact stable DM clouds with random spatial distribution, and the second population includes absorbers with two, three and more absorption lines formed in more massive and extended random DM clouds. Slow evolution of the Doppler parameter indicates high stability of caustics and conditions within clouds. For absorbers of the second population relative velocity of lines slowly increases with time."
Polarization of Gravitational Waves in General Teleparallel Theories of Gravity,"We determine the possible gravitational wave polarizations in two general classes of teleparallel gravity theories, using the metric and symmetric teleparallel geometries. For this purpose we apply the Newman–Penrose formalism, and find that depending on the choice of parameters, the E(2) class of the theories is one of N2,N3, III5, II6, corresponding to two to six polarizations, where all of them include the two tensor polarizations known from general relativity. We also find classes of theories apart from general relativity which yield the same polarizations."

Characterization of GNSS observations from a Nexus 9 Android tablet,"Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) raw data were made available in the application programming interface (API) starting from version 7.0 of the Android operating system. This opens possibilities for precise positioning with Android devices, as externally generated GNSS corrections can now be included in the positioning estimation in a convenient way. The Nexus 9 tablet is a good candidate for an early assessment of the raw GNSS observables and the corresponding derived precise positions, as it also supports many of the optional features and observation types presented by the API, including carrier phase observations which play an important role in many precise positioning techniques. It is known from the previous studies that poor handling of multipath in smartphones and tablets is a big challenge when it comes to precise GNSS positioning with these kinds of devices. Hence, this study assesses the raw GNSS observations and the calculated precise positions of the Nexus 9 tablet in two experimental setups with different multipath impacts. In addition, various biases of the observations are determined, some of which is not present on high-grade geodetic receivers. The analysis is done for GPS and GLONASS, which are supported by the Nexus 9 tablet. The study shows that multipath plays an important role for the expected accuracy of the calculated precise positions, both due to the induced error on the measurements, and due to loss of lock of the GNSS signals, which significantly affects precise positioning from carrier-phase measurements. Position accuracy ranges from just below 1 m to a few decimeters between the experimental setups with moderate and low levels of multipath respectively, for positioning based on carrier-phase observations. It is, furthermore, demonstrated that consideration of code inter-system biases and code inter-frequency biases of the Nexus 9 tablet are crucial for differential GNSS with multiple GNSS systems and when GLONASS observations are used in the positioning solutions. Besides these expected biases, also other less expected behaviors were discovered in the Nexus 9 GNSS observations, including various drifts for the code and phase observations. This study also proposes some strategies to handle these."
BE-FLARE: a fluorescent reporter of base editing activity reveals editing characteristics of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B,"Base Editing is a precise genome editing method that uses a deaminase-Cas9 fusion protein to mutate cytidine to thymidine in target DNA in situ without the generation of a double-strand break. However, the efficient enrichment of genetically modified cells using this technique is limited by the ability to detect such events."
In vivo efficacy of tobramycin-loaded synthetic calcium phosphate beads in a rabbit model of staphylococcal osteomyelitis,"Osteomyelitis is an acute or chronic inflammatory process of the bone following infection with pyogenic organisms like Staphylococcus aureus.

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of tobramycin-loaded calcium phosphate beads (CPB) in a rabbit osteomyelitis model."
Towards optimised size distribution in commercial microfibrillated cellulose: a fractionation approach,"For the successful commercialisation of microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) it is of utmost importance to carefully characterise the constituent cellulose particles. This could for instance lead to the development of MFC grades with size distributions tailored for specific applications. Characterization of MFC is challenging due to the heterogeneous chemical and structural nature of MFC. This study describes a fractionation approach that combines two steps of physical sieving of larger particles and a final centrifugation step to separate out the smallest, colloidally stable particles, resulting in four distinctly different size fractions. The properties, such as size and charge, of each fraction were studied, as well as MFC filtration time, film formation, and film properties (mechanical and optical). It was found that virtually all surface charges, determined by polyelectrolyte adsorption, are located in the colloidally stable fraction of the MFC. In addition, the amount of available surface charges can be used as an estimate of the degree of fibrillation of the MFC. The partly fibrillated particles frequently displayed a branching, fringed morphology. Mechanical testing of films from the different fractions revealed that the removal of large particles may be more important for strength than achieving full fibrillation. Overall, this study demonstrates that by controlling the size distribution in MFC grades, property profiles including dewatering time to make films by filtration, rheology, film strength and optical transmittance could be optimised."
Anti-inflammatory effect of Chunkoongkeigi-tang on IL-1β-induced inflamed A549 by the inhibition of COX-2 expression,"Inflammatory lung disease can arise due to the immoderate expression of pro-inflammatory genes and the disharmony of complex cytokines. Chunkoongkeigi-tang (CKT) has been prescribed to patients with asthmatic symptoms in herbal medicine clinics. However, the effects of CKT on the inflamed human lung cell line A549 have yet to be revealed. Thus we investigate whether CKT can suppress inflammatory response on interleukin 1β (IL-1β)-induced inflamed A549."
Sumoylated α-synuclein translocates into the nucleus by karyopherin α6,α-Synuclein (α-SYN) is uniquely found in the brains of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients and it has been the major target of PD research for many years.

High accuracy monitoring system to estimate forest road surface degradation on horizontal curves,"Well-maintained pavements reduce occurring severe accidents on horizontal curves. For this reason, the monitoring and evaluation of pavement conditions are important. This study evaluates pavement conditions considering volumetric degradation or displacement on 11 horizontal curves in forest roads, depending on meteorological conditions, traffic effects, and curve parameters. Within this context, pavement displacement (degradation) was investigated and measured with terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) for a year on a monthly basis. In this study, two multiple regression models were developed to estimate the degradation values of a forest road. According to model 1, which was developed to estimate the loss volume values, the adjusted R2 was 0.658. For model 2, which was developed to estimate the gain volume values, the adjusted R2 was 0.490. Validations of models were evaluated with different statistical tests. In conclusion, volumetric degradation can be calculated with TLS-based data. Forest road designers should determine horizontal curve characteristics, taking into consideration the pavement degradation and traffic safety."
"Presence and distributions of POPS in soil, atmospheric deposition, and bioindicator samples in an industrial-agricultural area in Turkey","In this study, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were detected in the soil, lichen pine needle, and total deposition samples in the Meriç-Ergene Basin, which is one of the most important regions in terms of industrial and agricultural activities in Turkey. POP concentrations were measured in 192 samples selected to represent four seasons over a 1-year period across four different regions: an intensive industrial area, an industrial + residential area, an agricultural area, and a background area. Total PAH concentrations are found in the range of 69.6–887.6 ng/g, 74.6–1277.7 ng/g, 113.4–588.9 ng/g, and 0.00–937.8 ng/m2-day; total PCB concentrations are 9.98–62.9 ng/g, 6.8–68.1 ng/g, 11.3–32.7 ng/g, and 0.00–144.4 ng/m2-day; total OCPs concentrations are 5.9–83.2 ng/g, 7.3–85.6 ng/g, 9.9–97.1 ng/g, and 0.00–137.6 ng/m2-day respectively for soil, lichen, pine needles, and bulk samples. The data were evaluated according to pollutant groups and spatial and temporal changes. The highest PAH and PCB values were detected in lichen samples from industrial areas. The highest OCP values were detected for total deposition and soil samples and in the agricultural area. The results showed that two- to three-ring PAHs, hepta-PCBs, and cyclodienes were the most widespread pollutant groups. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the accumulation and indication properties of the matrices in the study for 0.05 significance level. The pollutant group in which matrices are most similar is PAHs. Total deposition samples showed the most different pattern in terms of indications, especially for PCBs. For OCP results, the concentration values obtained in soil samples were different from all other matrices. It was determined that the indication properties of the matrices identified as pollutant indicators differ markedly from the pollutant type, and this difference is at the lowest level for PAH pollutants."
"Morphological response to salinity, temperature, and pH changes by marine fungus Epicoccum nigrum","Epicoccum nigrum (strain LQRA39-P) was isolated from sediments collected in Chilean Patagonian fjords using microscopy and molecular techniques. We analyzed adaptive responses of cell wall morphology to salinity, temperature, and pH in order to explain the ability of E. nigrum to co-inhabit both marine and freshwater environments. For this purpose, E. nigrum was cultured in a series of media with variations in salinity (freshwater and seawater), pH (acidic, neutral, and basic), and temperature (5 to 25 °C). Changes were observed through transmission electron microscopy. A direct correlation between increased salinity and cell wall thickening (> 0.2 μm) was observed, along with a significant relationship between pH and the presence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on the outside of the cell wall. The observed morphological changes could confirm that an ubiquitous fungus such as E. nigrum requires adaptive responses to co-inhabit freshwater, marine, and terrestrial substrates."
Topsoil and urban dust pollution and toxicity in Taranto (southern Italy) industrial area and in a residential district,"Adverse environmental conditions in the Taranto area (southern Italy) were investigated in studies of air, marine sediment, and human health. The present study aimed at providing unprecedented information on soil pollution and toxicity in a set of sites around recognized pollution sources in the Taranto area, since previous studies were focused on marine or air pollution, or on human health effects. The investigated area included a steel foundry and a power plant, as well as some sites located in an adjacent neighborhood. Surface soil samples and urban dust were collected and submitted to inorganic and organic analyses and tested for toxicity in two invertebrate bioassay models; a sea urchin (Sphaerechinus granularis) and an annelid (Caenorhabditis elegans). Inorganic analysis was carried out using ICP-MS for elemental composition for a total of 34 elements, whose levels were evaluated as a function of bioassay data analyzed through principal component analysis (PCA). Other analyses included asbestos search by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and organic analysis for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and aliphatic compounds (C10–C40). Toxicity bioassays were carried out on a sea urchin (Sphaerechinus granularis), and an annelid (Caenorhabditis elegans). Sea urchin bioassays evaluated effects of topsoil or street dust sample exposures (0.1 to 0.5% dry wt/vol) on developing embryos and on sperm, and scored as (a) % developmental defects, (b) inhibition of fertilization success and offspring damage, and (c) frequencies of mitotic aberrations. C. elegans mortality assay displayed significant toxicity associated with soil samples. The overall effects of samples showed very high toxicity at four out of nine sites. These effects were consistent with the highest levels measured for metals and PAHs. Further studies of health effects related to dust exposures in residential areas are warranted."
Allocation of sanitary landfill in consortium: strategy for the Brazilian municipalities in the State of Amazonas,"One of the current problems faced by the Brazilian municipalities is the adequate disposal of municipal solid waste in landfills while considering the environmental dimension. In addition to the design and technical requirements, the analysis of possible sites is a process requiring an evaluation of different criteria. With the proposal to minimize and rationalize efforts for site selection, this paper presents a methodology to evaluate its suitability based on certain criteria (legal, technical, environmental). The selection of the most preferable areas for the installation of a landfill is in context of a model for municipal consortium proposed in the State Plan of Solid Waste of Amazonas which applies to the municipalities of Atalaia do Norte, Benjamin Constant, and Tabatinga. The Analytic Hierarchy Process method was combined with geoprocessing tools in order to determine the relative importance of the evaluation criteria while considering the inherent limitations of data availability for the area of study. Thus, based on the participation of expert groups an aptitude map was produced where 47 potential areas were identified as suitable for the installation of a landfill in those municipalities. Among them, the most suitable is located near the highway that connects the municipalities of Benjamin Constant and Atalaia do Norte."
"Drivers of urban expansion over the past three decades: a comparative study of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang","Urban expansion is influenced by various natural and anthropogenic factors. Understanding the driving forces of urban expansion is crucial for modeling the process of urban expansion as well as guiding urban planning and management. Here, we quantified and compared the effects of natural, socioeconomic, and neighboring factors on urban expansion and their temporal dynamics in three large cities in the Jing-Jin-Ji Urban Agglomeration: Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang. We used remote sensing imagery from six epochs (circa 1980, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010) integrated with GIS techniques and analyzed using binary logistic regression. The relative importance of the three types of driving forces was further decomposed using variance partitioning. We found that the direction and/or magnitude of effects on the drivers of urban expansion varied with both epoch and city. Natural factors placed significant constraints at early stages of urban expansion, but this constraint relaxed over time. As precursor drivers of urbanization, socioeconomic factors significantly influenced urban growth in most epochs for each city. Non-urban lands near existing urban areas were more likely to be urbanized, due to easier access to existing transportation infrastructure and other facility resources. Furthermore, with urbanization, individual effects of drivers tended to be replaced by joint effects, especially for the neighboring factors. Similarities and differences in the individual and joint effects of drivers on urban expansion across cities and through time will provide valuable information for adaptive urban development strategies in the national capital region of China."

Lipid metabolism of phenol-tolerant Rhodococcus opacus strains for lignin bioconversion,"Lignin is a recalcitrant aromatic polymer that is a potential feedstock for renewable fuel and chemical production. Rhodococcus opacus PD630 is a promising strain for the biological upgrading of lignin due to its ability to tolerate and utilize lignin-derived aromatic compounds. To enhance its aromatic tolerance, we recently applied adaptive evolution using phenol as a sole carbon source and characterized a phenol-adapted R. opacus strain (evol40) and the wild-type (WT) strain by whole genome and RNA sequencing. While this effort increased our understanding of the aromatic tolerance, the tolerance mechanisms were not completely elucidated."

Linkage disequilibrium between fitness QTLs and the sugary1 allele of maize,"Understanding how biological systems evolve across changing conditions has been a crucial focus of research. Mutations change the genetic context in which genes are expressed and yet the mechanisms underlying mutation fitness are still unclear. We use the sweet corn mutant sugary1 (su1) as a model for understanding the genetic regulation of mutant fitness, focusing on the mutant × genotype interaction across diverse environments. In a previous work, we identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting fitness in a mapping population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between field corn (B73) × sweet corn (P39 or IL14h) parents; however, the epistatic effects of these QTLs on su1 fitness were not investigated. In the present study, we estimated fitness for two seed production environments. Viability of su1 is under genetic and environmental controls, regulated by multiple genes with minor contributions, and these genes depend on the genotype into which the mutation is introduced and on the environment. Some QTLs were in linkage disequilibrium with the maize gene Su1 and had epistatic effects on su1 fitness. These QTLs could be used by sweet corn breeders by combining the most favorable alleles associated with su1 viability in breeding new genotypes from field × sweet corn crosses. These results also have implications for mutagenesis breeding or genome editing because the epistatic effects of the target genome on the new alleles generated by these techniques could affect the success of the breeding program."
Prediction of MicroRNAs in the Epstein–Barr Virus Reveals Potential Targets for the Viral Self-Regulation,"Studies involving miRNAs have opened discussions about their broad participation in viral infections. Regarding the Human gammaherpesvirus 4 or Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), miRNAs are important regulators of viral and cellular gene expression during the infectious process, promoting viral persistence and, in some cases, oncogenic processes. We identified 55 miRNAs of EBV type 2 and inferred the viral mRNA target to self-regulate. This data indicate that gene self-repression is an important strategy for maintenance of the viral latent phase. In addition, a protein network was constructed to establish essential proteins in the self-regulation process. We found ten proteins that work as hubs, highlighting BTRF1 and BSRF1 as the most important proteins in the network. These results open a new way to understand the infection by EBV type 2, where viral genes can be targeted for avoiding oncogenic processes, as well as new therapies to suppress and combat the persistent viral infection."
Study of the effect of green quantity and structure on thermal comfort and air quality in an urban-like residential district by ENVI-met modelling,"This study quantifies the influence of green spaces on microclimate and PM10 concentration in a typical residential district of Nanjing (China) by employing the CFD-based and microclimate model ENVI-met 4. Five green indices, related to quantity and structure of vegetation, are employed to investigate the impact of different types (grass, shrub and tree) and layouts of a green space located in the center of the residential district under an average Nanjing summer day. Results show that the thermal comfort (expressed by the mean radiant temperature MRT and the predicted mean vote PMV) is slightly enhanced with increasing green quantity, especially trees, even though more trees may increase the wind blocking effect with a consequent slight increase of pollutant concentration. In this regard, a single patch of trees located in the central part of the green space is preferable. The green indices are shown to be useful for studying the relationship between green space morphology, microclimate and air quality in cities."
Exploiting oleic acid to prepare two-dimensional assembly of Si@graphitic carbon yolk-shell nanoparticles for lithium-ion battery anodes,"Carbon coating has been a routine strategy for improving the performance of Si-based anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. The ability to tailor the thickness, homogeneity and graphitization degree of carbon-coating layers is essential for addressing issues that hamper the real applications of Si anodes. Herein, we report the construction of two-dimensional (2D) assemblies of interconnected Si@graphitic carbon yolk-shell nanoparticles (2D-Si@gC) from commercial Si powders by exploiting oleic acid (OA). The OA molecules act as both the surface-coating ligands for facilitating 2D nanoparticle assembly and the precursor for forming uniform and conformal graphitic shells as thin as 4 nm. The as-prepared 2D-Si@gC with rationally designed void space exhibits excellent rate capability and cycling stability when used as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, delivering a capacity of 1,150 mAh·g−1 at an ultrahigh current density of 10 A·g−1 and maintaining a stabilized capacity of 1,275 mAh·g−1 after 200 cycles at 4 A·g−1. The formation of yolk-shell nanoparticles confines the deposition of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) onto the outer carbon shell, while simultaneously providing sufficient space for volumetric expansion of Si nanoparticles. These attributes effectively mitigate the thickness variations of the entire electrode during repeated lithiation and delithiation, which combined with the unique 2D architecture and interconnected graphitic carbon shells of 2D-Si@gC contributes to its superior rate capability and cycling performance."
Nanorattle Au@PtAg encapsulated in ZIF-8 for enhancing CO2 photoreduction to CO,"Imidazolate-based ZIF-8 catalysts M@ZIF-8 (M = Au NR, Au@Ag NR, or Au@PtAg NRT; NR = nanorod, NRT = nanorattle), were assembled. Au NRs acted as the core for the epitaxial growth of the Ag shell, and oxidative etching of Au@Ag NRs led to Au@PtAg NRTs with K2PtCl4 aqueous solution. All metal nanorods (MNRs) and metal nanorattles (MNRTs) were well dispersed and fully encapsulated in ZIF-8. Au@PtAg NRTs encapsulated in ZIF-8 could lead to enhanced stability and selectivity for catalytic applications, combining the advantages of ZIF-8 (tailorable porosity) with the high surface area and improved optical sensitivity of rod-shaped NRTs. The catalyst Au@PtAg@ZIF-8 exhibited efficient catalytic activity and CO selectivity for the gas-phase photoreduction of CO2 with H2O."
An Ab Initio Study of Electronic Structure of Lithium Metaborate,"The electronic structure of lithium metaborate in monoclinic and tetragonal phases is studied using the density functional theory (DFT) method.

3D QSAR Modeling and Molecular Docking Studies on a Series of Triazole Analogues as Antibacterial Agents,"The 3D QSAR analysis using the comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) techniques is performed on novel nalidixic acid based 1,2,4-triazole derivatives suggested earlier as antibacterial agents. The CoMFA and CoMSIA models employed for a training set of 28 compounds gives reliable values of Q2 (0.53 and 0.52, respectively) and R2 (0.79 and 0.85, respectively). The contour maps produced by the CoMFA and CoMSIA models are used to determine a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship. Based on the 3D QSAR contours new molecules with high predicted activities are designed. In addition, surflex-docking is performed to confirm the stability of predicted molecules in the receptor."

Molecular Docking and 3D QSAR Research of Indolocarbazole Series as Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitors,"Fifty indolocarbazole series as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKs) are used to establish a threedimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D QSAR) model based on docking conformations resulting from the Topomer comparative molecular field analysis (Topomer CoMFA). The statistic parameters show that the cross-validation (q2), the multiple correlation coefficient of fitting (r2), and external validation statistic (Qext2) are 0.953, 0.968, and 0.954, respectively. It is demonstrated that this Topomer CoMFA model has good stability and prediction ability. The methodology of the fragment-based drug design (FBDD) was also used to virtually screen new CDKs by the Topomer Search technology. Four similar substitutional groups selected from the ZINC database were added to the basic scaffold. As a result, 18 new CDKs with high activities were obtained. The template molecule and new designed compounds are used to study the binding relationship between the ligands and the receptor protein with Surflex-Dock. The docking results suggest good binding interactions of the designed compounds with protein.

Green Synthesis Using Tragacanth Gum and Characterization of Ni–Cu–Zn Ferrite Nanoparticles as a Magnetically Separable Catalyst for the Synthesis of Hexabenzylhexaazaisowurtzitane Under Ultrasonic Irradiation,"In this work, we report the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic evaluation of Ni–Cu–Zn ferrite using tragacanth gum as a biotemplate and metal nitrates as the metal source by the sol-gel method without using any organic chemicals. The sample is characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). The powder XRD analysis reveals the formation of cubic-phase ferrite MNPs with an average particle size of 20 nm. The magnetic analysis reveals that the Ni–Cu–Zn ferrite nanoparticles have ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature with a saturation magnetization of 52.76 emu/g. The catalytic activity of Ni–Cu–Zn ferrite MNPs is evaluated for the synthesis of 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexabenzyl-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazatetracyclo [5.5.0.05,9.03,11]dodecane (HBIW) under ultrasonic irradiation.

Contributions of pore-throat size distribution to reservoir quality and fluid distribution from NMR and MIP in tight sandy conglomerate reservoirs,"Overall pore-throat size distribution is a critical foundation for evaluating tight sandy conglomerate reservoirs. However, the pore-throat size cannot be easily obtained from a single technic due to the complex microstructure. In this paper, a new method was introduced to characterize the microstructure by combining thin sections, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), pressure-controlled injected mercury (PMI), rate-controlled injected mercury (RMI), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Twenty-four tight sandy conglomerate cores from the Baikouquan Formation of the Mabei oil field, northwest China, were selected to conduct the series of experiments. Overall pore-throat size distribution (TRD) was reconstructed by combining mercury injection porosimetry (MIP) with NMR with pores that were equivalent to triangular cross-section; the radii of the inscribed spheres were obtained to weaken the influence of irregular shapes by RMI. Irreducible water saturation of the cores was achieved by nitrogen displacement, which decreases with increasing of micropore proportion. An ideal relationship between permeability, movable water saturation, and micropore percentages was constructed which indicates the effect of microstructure on reservoir quality and fluid distribution in tight sandy conglomerate reservoirs."
Paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental reconstruction at Tarfaya Atlantic coastal basin (Morocco) based on clay mineral records from Upper Cretaceous to Quaternary,"We generated clay mineral assemblage records on Late Cretaceous to Miocene-Pliocene rocks and on Holocene river sediments at Tarfaya Atlantic coastal basin in Morocco. Results show that illite, chlorite, kaolinite, smectite, and palygorskite originated from a continental source whereas corrensite formed within the basin. A very high kaolinite content and kaolinite/(illite+chlorite) ratio during the Turonian indicate a high chemical weathering which was coeval with a global weathering event during a warm and humid climate during that time. An increase in physical erosion during the Santonian as reflected by high (illite+chlorite) content and low kaolinite/(illite+chlorite) ratio was most likely associated with the early western Anti-Atlas uplift. Abundant (palygorskite+sepiolite) contents in Early Eocene rocks reflect the development of extremely dry and warm climatic conditions over the coastal regions of Tarfaya during that time. Dominant (illite+chlorite) and smectite clay minerals and a marked increase in sedimentation during the Miocene-Pliocene suggest an increase in physical erosion of the high-relief source region (western Anti-Atlas) which was mainly controlled by tectonic denudation. High kaolinite content and kaolinite/(illite+chlorite) ratio also occurred in the Holocene river sediments indicating warm and humid climate during that time. The abundant corrensite, however, indicates a basin depositional environment and suggests that oxic conditions were dominant in the Tarfaya basin during the Campanian and the Oligocene-Early Miocene."
Mechanical behaviors of bimsoils during triaxial deformation revealed using real-time ultrasonic detection and post-test CT image analysis,"Real-time ultrasonic experiments were conducted to investigate the mechanical responses of block-in-matrix soil (bimsoil) samples under triaxial deformation. Although the mechanical behaviors of bimrocks and bimsoils have been widely studied, the rock-soil (block-matrix) interface cracking, rock-soil interaction, block occlusion, and interlocking effects during triaxial deformation are still incompletely understood. This paper aims to investigate the effect of confining pressure and block proportion on ultrasonic and mechanical properties of bimsoils using ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV). Conventional compaction soil testing was adapted to produce cylindrical bimsoil samples of different rock block percentages (RBP) with various hammer counts, to ensure roughly the same compactness of soil matrix. The experimental results show that UPV reflects the complex mechanical behavior of bimosils during deformation. UPV measurements became more variable as samples deformed at the pre-peak and post-peak stages. It is suggested that the UPV is affected not only by stress level but also the meso-structures that develop during failure in bimsoils. Observation of macroscopic fracture morphology combined with image analysis of mesoscopic computed tomography (CT) scans reveals that multiple localized tortuous bands form during deformation due to the presence of rock blocks in bimsoils. The changes of UPV are mainly attributed to the interactions of soil matrix and rock block. The post-test CT images further confirm this result."

Co-combustion of municipal solid waste and coal gangue in a circulating fluidized bed combustor,"Mixed incineration of municipal solid waste (MSW) in existing coal gangue power plant is a potentially high-efficiency and low-cost MSW disposal way. In this paper, the co-combustion and pollutants emission characteristic of MSW and coal gangue was investigated in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustor. The effect of MSW blend ratio, bed temperature and excess air ratio was detailedly studied. The results show the NOx and HCl emission increases with the increasing MSW blend ratio and the SO2 emission decreases. With the increase of bed temperature, the CO emission decreases while the NOx and SO2 emission increases. The HCl emission is nearly stable in the temperature range of 850–950 °C. The increase of excess air ratio gradually increases the NOx emission but has no significant effect on the SO2 emission. The HCl emission firstly increases and then decreases with the increase of excess air ratio. For a typical CFB operating condition with excess air ratio of 1.4, bed temperature of 900 °C and MSW blend ratio of 10%, the original CO, NOx, SO2 and HCl emissions are 52, 181, 3373 and 58 mg/N m3 respectively."
The relationship between the leptin/ghrelin ratio and meals with various macronutrient contents in men with different nutritional status: a randomized crossover study,"Hormones, which influence satiety and hunger, play a significant role in body energy balance regulation. Ghrelin is a peptide that plays an important role in short-term appetite regulation, whereas leptin is a factor that controls long-term energy balance and is considered as a satiety hormone.

Carbon fibre/polyether ether ketone (CF/PEEK) implants in orthopaedic oncology,"Radiation therapy is an important therapeutic element in musculoskeletal tumours, especially when encountering multiple or painful lesions. In osteolytic lesions, a surgical stabilization with implants is often required. However, metallic implants not only complicate the CT-based planning of a subsequent radiation therapy, but also have an uncontrollable dose-modulating effect in adjuvant radiotherapy. In addition, follow-up imaging and the diagnosis of local recurrences are often obscured by metallic artefacts. Radiolucent implants consisting of carbon/polyether ether ketone (CF/PEEK) therefore facilitate adjuvant radiation therapy and follow-up imaging of bone lesions. We hereby present clinical cases with application of CF/PEEK implants in orthopaedic tumour surgery."

Development and validation of a high-performance thin layer chromatography method for the simultaneous quantitation of α- and γ-mangostins in Thai stingless bee propolis,"Stingless bees (Apoidea) are widely distributed and commercially cultivated in artificial hives in fruit gardens. Their propolis are commonly used in traditional medicine to treat various diseases (e.g., abscesses, inflammations, and toothaches) and as a constituent of numerous health products. Thus, this study aimed to (i) develop and validate a high-performance thin layer chromatography method for the quantitation of major active constituents (α- and γ-mangostins) in propolis produced by five stingless bee species (Tetragonula fuscobalteata Cameron, T. laeviceps Smith, T. pagdeni Schwarz, Lepidotrigona terminata Smith, and I. ventralis Smith) cultivated in Thai mangosteen orchards and (ii) determine an optimal extraction solvent. Separation was performed on a silica gel 60 F254 plate using toluene/ethyl acetate/formic acid (8:2:0.1, v/v/v) as a mobile phase, and the developed method was validated to assure its linearity, precision, accuracy, and limits of detection/quantitation. Propolis extract from T. fuscobalteata exhibited the highest mangostin content, and acetone was shown to be more a more effective extraction solvent than dichloromethane, ethanol, or methanol. Thus, the simplicity and reliability of the developed method make it well suited for the routine analysis (e.g., for quality control) of commercial products containing stingless bee propolis."

"Existence, uniqueness and comparison results for BSDEs with Lévy jumps in an extended monotonic generator setting","We show that the comparison results for a backward SDE with jumps established in Royer (Stoch. Process. Appl 116: 1358–1376, 2006) and Yin and Mao (J. Math. Anal. Appl 346: 345–358, 2008) hold under more simplified conditions. Moreover, we prove existence and uniqueness allowing the coefficients in the linear growth- and monotonicity-condition for the generator to be random and time-dependent. In the L2-case with linear growth, this also generalizes the results of Kruse and Popier (Stochastics 88: 491–539, 2016). For the proof of the comparison result, we introduce an approximation technique: Given a BSDE driven by Brownian motion and Poisson random measure, we approximate it by BSDEs where the Poisson random measure admits only jumps of size larger than 1/n."

Assessing the emergence of bioeconomy by the radical technology inquirer tool,"This paper reports research results from the application of the Radical Technology Inquirer (RTI) approach on the emergence of bioeconomy as part of the mega wave of socio-technical change that has taken off with the global financial crisis of ca. 2008 and is expected to peak around 2030. The appearance of bioeconomy-related phenomena on this wave was found to be strongly related on the one hand to eight Global Value-Producing Networks (GVNs), and on the other hand on 14 Radical Technological Solutions (RTS). A correlation of these two types of findings reveals an even smaller number of highly promising global value networks (on health, quality of life, and governance) and technological breakthroughs (on DNA research, biosensors, and industrial use of GMOs). The latter appear to follow mostly converging technological pathways, with the bio-info convergence pattern playing the dominant role."
A logistic regression investigation of the relationship between the Learning Assistant model and failure rates in introductory STEM courses,"Large introductory STEM courses historically have high failure rates, and failing such courses often leads students to change majors or even drop out of college. Instructional innovations such as the Learning Assistant model can influence this trend by changing institutional norms. In collaboration with faculty who teach large-enrollment introductory STEM courses, undergraduate learning assistants (LAs) use research-based instructional strategies designed to encourage active student engagement and elicit student thinking. These instructional innovations help students master the types of skills necessary for college success such as critical thinking and defending ideas. In this study, we use logistic regression with pre-existing institutional data to investigate the relationship between exposure to LA support in large introductory STEM courses and general failure rates in these same and other introductory courses at University of Colorado Boulder."

Cross-Sectional Characterization of Albumin Glycation State in Cerebrospinal Fluid and Plasma from Alzheimer’s Disease Patients,"We determined albumin post-translational modifications (PTMs) by mass spectrometry (MS) in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 31 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients (with 27 samples of paired plasma-CSF from the same patients). Results were cross-sectionally compared with healthy controls. For percentage of relative intensity of glycated isoforms, plasma albumin was globally more glycated in AD patients than in healthy controls (P<0.01). MS results in plasma were confirmed by a quantitative enzymatic assay (Lucica GA-L) for albumin early-glycation detection. In CSF there were no global glycation differences detected by MS, although a different pattern of glycated isoforms was observed. Oxidized+glycated and cysteinylated+glycated isoforms were increased in both plasma and CSF of AD patients in comparison with healthy controls (P<0.001). Furthermore, AD patients showed higher glycation in plasma than in CSF (P<0.01). Our data support the role of glycation and oxidative stress in AD."
Assessment of Clinical Meaningfulness of Endpoints in the Generation Program by the Insights to Model Alzheimer’s Progression in Real Life (iMAP) Study,"We are launching the Insights to Model Alzheimer’s Progression in Real Life study in parallel with the Alzheimer Prevention Initiative Generation Program.

The primary objective is to assess the ability of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Initiative Cognitive Composite Test Score and Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status to predict clinically meaningful outcomes such as diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease, and change in Clinical Dementia Rating–Global Score. This study is the first large-scale, prospective effort to establish the clinical meaningfulness of cognitive test scores that track longitudinal decline in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. This study is also expected to contribute to our understanding of the relationships among outcomes in different stages of Alzheimer’s disease as well as models of individual trajectories during the course of the disease."
Digital transformation in German higher education: student and teacher perceptions and usage of digital media,"Digitalization in Higher Education (HE) institutions is an issue that concerns many educational stakeholders. ICT skills are becoming increasingly relevant in every context, especially in the workplace, therefore one of the prime objectives for universities has become preparing future professionals to be able to deal with problems and search for solutions, including digital competence as a vital skill set. Different policies, initiatives and strategies are currently being proposed in Germany, addressing educational technology innovations in HE. The University of Oldenburg is presented as an example, in an endeavour to gain an understanding of what is being proposed and what is actually happening in teaching and learning in German university classrooms. Two datasets were examined regarding the use and perceptions of students (n = 200) and teachers (n = 381) on the use of digital tools. Findings reveal that both teachers and students use a limited number of digital technology for predominantly assimilative tasks, with the Learning Management System being perceived as the most useful tool. In order to support the broader use of educational technology for teaching and learning purposes, strategies for HE institutions are suggested."
The Small Field Parabolic Flow for Bosonic Many-body Models: Part 1—Main Results and Algebra,"This paper is a contribution to a program to see symmetry breaking in a weakly interacting many-Boson system on a three-dimensional lattice at low temperature. It is part of an analysis of the “small field” approximation to the “parabolic flow” which exhibits the formation of a “Mexican hat” potential well. Here we state the main result of this analysis, outline the strategy of the proof, which uses a renormalization group flow, and perform the first, algebraic, part of a renormalization group step."
Effect of foot reflexology adjunct to paced respiration on vasomotor symptoms during menopause: randomized-controlled trail,"The most common vasomotor symptoms (VMS) are hot flashes and night sweats, which occur in as many as 68.5% of women as a result of menopause. Symptoms caused by fluctuating levels of estrogen may be alleviated by hormone therapy (HT), but a marked global decline in its use has resulted from concerns about the risks and benefits of HT. Consequently, many women in the postmenopausal period search for alternative natural treatment options to manage menopause. As large numbers of women are choosing not to take HT, it is increasingly important to identify evidence-based foot reflexology with paced respiration that has the potential to reduce vasomotor menopausal symptoms."

"Multigene phylogenetics of Polycephalomyces (Ophiocordycipitaceae, Hypocreales), with two new species from Thailand","Polycephalomyces (Ophiocordycipitaceae) species are found in subtropical regions and are parasitic or hyperparasitic on insects. Two new species, P. aurantiacus and P. marginaliradians, parasitic on Ophiocordyceps barnesii and larva of Cossidae respectively, are introduced in this paper. Morphological comparison with extant species and DNA based phylogenies from analyses of a multigene dataset support the establishment of the new taxa. Polycephalomyces aurantiacus, exhibiting a hyperparasitic lifestyle on Ophiocordyceps barnesii, differs from other species in producing orange conidia in mass and have longer β-phialides in culture. Polycephalomyces marginaliradians differs from other Ophiocordyceps species by producing single stromata with a stipe, smaller perithecia and branched α-phialides and catenate α-conidia and is parasitic on Cossidae. A combined nrSSU, nrLSU, ITS, tef-1a, rpb1 and rpb2 sequence data was analysed phylogenetically including Ophiocordyceps and Polycephalomyces taxa. The new species described herein are clearly distinct from other species in Polycephalomyces. We provide a key to the species of Polycephalomyces and discuss relevant interspecies relationships."
The mineralocorticoid receptor is essential for stress axis regulation in zebrafish larvae,"The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in mammals mediates the effects of aldosterone in regulating fluid balance and potassium homeostasis. While MR signalling is essential for survival in mammals, there is no evidence that MR has any physiological role in ray-finned fish. Teleosts lack aldosterone and emerging evidence suggest that cortisol mediates ion and fluid regulation by activating glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signalling. Consequently, a physiological role for MR signalling, despite its conserved and ancient origin, is still lacking. We tested the hypothesis that a key physiological role for MR signalling in fish is the regulation of stress axis activation and function. Using either MR or GR knockout zebrafish, our results reveal distinct and complementary role for these receptors in stress axis function. GR−/− mutants were hypercortisolemic and failed to elicit a cortisol stress response, while MR−/− mutants showed a delayed, but sustained cortisol response post-stressor. Both these receptors are involved in stress-related behaviour, as the loss of either receptors abolished the glucocorticoid-mediated larval hyperactivity to a light stimulus. Overall, the results underscore a key physiological role for MR signalling in ray-finned fishes, and we propose that the regulation of the highly conserved stress axis as the original function of this receptor."
