Alginate-chitosan Hydrogel Patch with Beta-glucan Nanoemulsion for Antibacterial Applications,"Natural polymer materials have high biocompatibility and are not toxic because they can decompose into metabolites in the body; thus, they are widely used as medical polymer materials as well as porous support materials. As a biopolymer, alginate has a negative charge; in contrast, chitosan has a positive charge. Therefore, when the two substances are mixed, they form a relatively stable structure by ionic bonding. Beta-glucan is known to contribute to material stability and have high skin penetration, skin moisturizing and soothing effects, and burn and wound healing effects. In this study, antimicrobial activity was assessed by preparing alginate-chitosan hydrogel patches containing beta-glucan nanoemulsions. This could contribute to the development of wound dressings with antibacterial properties."
The Use of Fluorescently Labeled ARC1779 Aptamer for Assessing the Effect of H2O2 on von Willebrand Factor Exocytosis,"Here, we propose a new approach for quantitative estimation of von Willebrand factor (vWF) exposed on the surface of endothelial cells (ECs) using the ARC1779 aptamer that interacts with the vWF A1 domain. To visualize complex formation between vWF and the aptamer, the latter was conjugated with the Cy5 fluorescent label. Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were stained with the ARC1779-Cy5 conjugate and imaged with a fluorescence microscope. The images were analyzed with the CellProfiler software. vWF released from the Weibel–Palade bodies was observed as bright dot-like structures of round and irregular shape, the number of which increased several times after HUVEC exposure to histamine or thrombin. Staining with ARC1779-Cy5 also revealed long filamentous vWF structures on the surface of activated HUVEC. vWF secretion by ECs is activated by the second messengers cAMP and Ca2+. There is evidence that hydrogen peroxide also acts as a second messenger in ECs. In addition, exogenous H2O2 formed in leukocytes can enter ECs. The aim of our study was to determine the effect of H2O2 on the vWF exposure at the surface of HUVEC using the proposed method. It was shown that hydrogen peroxide at concentration 100 µM, which is lower than the cytotoxicity threshold of H2O2 for cultured HUVEC, increased several times the number of dot-like structures and total amount of vWF exposed on plasma membrane of HUVEC, which suggest that H2O2 acts as a mediator that activates exocytosis of Weibel–Palade bodies and vWF secretion in the vascular endothelium during inflammation and upon elevated generation of endogenous reactive oxygen species in ECs."

Characterization of gait variability in multiple system atrophy and Parkinson’s disease,Gait impairment is a pivotal feature of parkinsonian syndromes and increased gait variability is associated with postural instability and a higher risk of falls.
Public perception of air pollution sources across Europe,"Air pollution is one of the primary concerns of our society for its effect on human health and the environment. Among the policy measures that can be put in place to limit air pollutant emissions, end-of-pipe technologies and/or regulatory instruments may be implemented through legislative acts. Also, equally important are behavioural measures, requiring citizens’ active involvement. The success of any measure to limit pollutant emissions requires the acceptance by the citizens that, in turn, implies a correct perception of the main pollutant emission drivers. We present here the comparison between the public perception of air pollution sources and the real-world situation through a survey carried out in seven European countries and involving 16 101 respondents. Our study shows a dramatic underestimation of the contribution of the agri-food sector to air pollution. This result is common to all respondents in the seven countries examined and only to a small extent depends on gender, age and socio-economic status of the respondents."
State of the art in esophagectomy: robotic assistance in the abdominal phase,"Over the years, robot-assisted esophagectomy gained popularity. The current literature focused mainly on robotic assistance in the thoracic phase, whereas the implementation of robotic assistance in the abdominal phase is lagging behind. Advantages of adding a robotic system to the abdominal phase include robotic stapling and the increased surgeon’s independency. In terms of short-term outcomes and lymphadenectomy, robotic assistance is at least equal to laparoscopy. Yet high quality evidence to conclude on this topic remains scarce. This review focuses on the evidence of robotic assistance in the abdominal phase of esophagectomy."
"Calcium intake, calcium supplementation and cardiovascular disease and mortality in the British population: EPIC-norfolk prospective cohort study and meta-analysis","The role of dietary calcium in cardiovascular disease prevention is unclear. We aimed to determine the association between calcium intake and incident cardiovascular disease and mortality. Data were extracted from the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer, Norfolk (EPIC-Norfolk). Multivariable Cox regressions analysed associations between calcium intake (dietary and supplemental) and cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, aortic stenosis, peripheral vascular disease) and mortality (cardiovascular and all-cause). The results of this study were pooled with those from published prospective cohort studies in a meta-analsyis, stratifying by average calcium intake using a 700 mg/day threshold. A total of 17,968 participants aged 40–79 years were followed up for a median of 20.36 years (20.32–20.38). Compared to the first quintile of calcium intake (< 770 mg/day), intakes between 771 and 926 mg/day (second quintile) and 1074–1254 mg/day (fourth quintile) were associated with reduced all-cause mortality (HR 0.91 (0.83–0.99) and 0.85 (0.77–0.93), respectively) and cardiovascular mortality [HR 0.95 (0.87–1.04) and 0.93 (0.83-1.04)]. Compared to the first quintile of calcium intake, second, third, fourth, but not fifth quintiles were associated with fewer incident strokes: respective HR 0.84 (0.72–0.97), 0.83 (0.71–0.97), 0.78 (0.66–0.92) and 0.95 (0.78–1.15). The meta-analysis results suggest that high levels of calcium intake were associated with decreased all-cause mortality, but not cardiovascular mortality, regardless of average calcium intake. Calcium supplementation was associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality amongst women, but not men. Moderate dietary calcium intake may protect against cardiovascular and all-cause mortality and incident stroke. Calcium supplementation may reduce mortality in women."
Fine-grained management of I/O optimizations based on workload characteristics,"With the advent of new computing paradigms, parallel file systems serve not only traditional scientific computing applications but also non-scientific computing applications, such as financial computing, business, and public administration. Parallel file systems provide storage services for multiple applications. As a result, various requirements need to be met. However, parallel file systems usually provide a unified storage solution, which cannot meet specific application needs. In this paper, an extended file handle scheme is proposed to deal with this problem. The original file handle is extended to record I/O optimization information, which allows file systems to specify optimizations for a file or directory based on workload characteristics. Therefore, fine-grained management of I/O optimizations can be achieved. On the basis of the extended file handle scheme, data prefetching and small file optimization mechanisms are proposed for parallel file systems. The experimental results show that the proposed approach improves the aggregate throughput of the overall system by up to 189.75%."
Molecular surveillance and temporal monitoring of malaria parasites in focal Vietnamese provinces,"While the World Health Organization (WHO) Southeast Asia region has the second highest incidence of malaria worldwide, malaria in Vietnam is focal to few provinces, where delayed parasite clearance to anti-malarial drugs is documented. This study aims to understand Plasmodium species distribution and the genetic diversity of msp1 and msp2 of parasite populations using molecular tools."
Real world analysis of high-cut-off (HCO) hemodialysis with bortezomib-based backbone therapy in patients with multiple myeloma and acute kidney injury,"In patients with multiple myeloma (MM) free light chain-induced cast nephropathy is a serious complication associated with poor survival. High-cut-off (HCO) hemodialysis can reduce the amount of serum free light chains (sFLC), but data on its impact on clinical outcome is limited and contradictory. To gain further insights we collected real world data from two major myeloma and nephrology centers in Austria and the Czech Republic."
Effect of sodium bicarbonate supplementation on the renin-angiotensin system in patients with chronic kidney disease and acidosis: a randomized clinical trial,"Acidosis-induced kidney injury is mediated by the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system, for which urinary renin is a potential marker. Therefore, we hypothesized that sodium bicarbonate supplementation reduces urinary renin excretion in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and metabolic acidosis."
Freeze-in dark matter from secret neutrino interactions,"We investigate a simplified freeze-in dark-matter model in which the dark matter only interacts with the standard-model neutrinos via a light scalar. The extremely small coupling for the freeze-in mechanism is naturally realized in several neutrino-portal scenarios with the secret neutrino interactions. We study possible evolution history of the hidden sector: the dark sector would undergo pure freeze-in production if the interactions between the dark-sector particles are negligible, while thermal equilibrium within the dark sector could occur if the reannihilation of the dark matter and the scalar mediator is rapid enough. We investigate the relic abundance in the freeze-in and dark freeze-out regimes, calculate evolution of the dark temperature, and study its phenomenological aspects on BBN and CMB constraints, the indirect-detection signature, as well as the potential to solve the small scale structure problem."
Large p explorations. From SUGRA to big STRINGS in Mellin space,"We explore a new way of probing scattering of closed strings in AdS5 × S5, which we call ‘the large p limit’. It consists of studying four-point correlators of single-particle operators in \( \mathcal{N} \) = 4 SYM at large N and large ’t Hooft coupling λ, by looking at the regime in which the dual KK modes become short massive strings. In this regime the charge of the single-particle operators is order λ1/4 and the dual KK modes are in between fields and strings. Starting from SUGRA we compute the large p limit of the correlators by introducing an improved AdS5 × S5 Mellin space amplitude, and we show that the correlator is dominated by a saddle point. Our results are consistent with the picture of four geodesics shooting from the boundary of AdS5 × S5 towards a common bulk point, where they scatter as if they were in flat space. The Mandelstam invariants are put in correspondence with the Mellin variables and in turn with certain combinations of cross ratios. At the saddle point the dynamics of the correlator is directly related to the bulk Mellin amplitude, which in the process of taking large p becomes the flat space ten-dimensional S-matrix. We thus learn how to embed the full type IIB S-matrix in the AdS5 × S5 Mellin amplitude, and how to stratify the latter in a large p expansion. We compute the large p limit of all genus zero data currently available, pointing out additional hidden simplicity of known results. We then show that the genus zero resummation at large p naturally leads to the Gross-Mende phase for the minimal area surface around the bulk point. At one-loop, we first uncover a novel and finite Mellin amplitude, and then we show that the large p limit beautifully asymptotes the gravitational S-matrix."
Targeted methods for epigenetic age predictions in mice,"Age-associated DNA methylation reflects aspect of biological aging—therefore epigenetic clocks for mice can elucidate how the aging process in this model organism is affected by specific treatments or genetic background. Initially, age-predictors for mice were trained for genome-wide DNA methylation profiles and we have recently described a targeted assay based on pyrosequencing of DNA methylation at only three age-associated genomic regions. Here, we established alternative approaches using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and barcoded bisulfite amplicon sequencing (BBA-seq). At individual CG dinucleotides (CpGs) the correlation of DNA methylation with chronological age was slightly higher for pyrosequencing and ddPCR as compared to BBA-seq. On the other hand, BBA-seq revealed that neighboring CpGs tend to be stochastically modified at murine age-associated regions. Furthermore, the binary sequel of methylated and non-methylated CpGs in individual reads can be used for single-read predictions, which may reflect heterogeneity in epigenetic aging. In comparison to C57BL/6 mice the single-read age-predictions using BBA-seq were also accelerated in the shorter-lived DBA/2 mice, and in C57BL/6 mice with a lifespan quantitative trait locus of DBA/2 mice. Taken together, we describe alternative targeted methods for epigenetic age predictions that provide new perspectives for aging-intervention studies in mice."
Neurophysiological markers of ADHD symptoms in typically-developing children,"Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Neurophysiological correlates of ADHD include changes in the P3 component of event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Motivated by recent advances towards a more dimensional understanding of ADHD, we investigate whether ADHD-related ERP markers relate to continuous variations in attention and executive functioning also in typically-developing children. ERPs were measured while 31 school children (9–11 years) completed an adapted version of the Continuous Performance Task that additionally to inhibitory processes also isolates effects of physical stimulus salience. Children with higher levels of parent-reported ADHD symptoms did not differ in task performance, but exhibited smaller P3 amplitudes related to stimulus salience. Furthermore, ADHD symptoms were associated with the variability of neural responses over time: Children with higher levels of ADHD symptoms demonstrated lower variability in inhibition- and salience-related P3 amplitudes. No effects were observed for ERP latencies and the salience-related N2. By demonstrating that ADHD-associated neurophysiological mechanisms of inhibition and salience processing covary with attention and executive functioning in a children community sample, our study provides neurophysiological support for dimensional models of ADHD. Also, temporal variability in event-related potentials is highlighted as additional indicator of ADHD requiring further investigation."
Reliance on model-based and model-free control in obesity,"Consuming more energy than is expended may reflect a failure of control over eating behaviour in obesity. Behavioural control arises from a balance between two dissociable strategies of reinforcement learning: model-free and model-based. We hypothesized that weight status relates to an imbalance in reliance on model-based and model-free control, and that it may do so in a linear or quadratic manner. To test this, 90 healthy participants in a wide BMI range [normal-weight (n = 31), overweight (n = 29), obese (n = 30)] performed a sequential decision-making task. The primary analysis indicated that obese participants relied less on model-based control than overweight and normal-weight participants, with no difference between overweight and normal-weight participants. In line, secondary continuous analyses revealed a negative linear, but not quadratic, relationship between BMI and model-based control. Computational modelling of choice behaviour suggested that a mixture of both strategies was shifted towards less model-based control in obese participants. Our findings suggest that obesity may indeed be related to an imbalance in behavioural control as expressed in a phenotype of less model-based control potentially resulting from enhanced reliance on model-free computations."
The implication of the air quality pattern in South Korea after the COVID-19 outbreak,"By using multiple satellite measurements, the changes of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over South Korea were investigated from January to March 2020 to evaluate the COVID-19 effect on the regional air quality. The NO2 decrease in South Korea was found but not significant, which indicates the effects of spontaneous social distancing under the maintenance of ordinary life. The AODs in 2020 were normally high in January, but they became lower starting from February. Since the atmosphere over Eastern Asia was unusually stagnant in January and February 2020, the AOD decrease in February 2020 clearly reveals the positive effect of the COVID-19. Considering the insignificant NO2 decrease in South Korea and the relatively long lifetime of aerosols, the AOD decrease in South Korea may be more attributed to the improvement of the air quality in neighboring countries. In March, regional atmosphere became well mixed and ventilated over South Korea, contributing to large enhancement of air quality. While the social activity was reduced after the COVID-19 outbreak, the regional meteorology should be also examined significantly to avoid the biased evaluation of the social impact on the change of the regional air quality."

Left hemispheric deficit in the sustained neuromagnetic response to periodic click trains in children with ASD,"Deficits in perception and production of vocal pitch are often observed in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the neural basis of these deficits is unknown. In magnetoencephalogram (MEG), spectrally complex periodic sounds trigger two continuous neural responses—the auditory steady state response (ASSR) and the sustained field (SF). It has been shown that the SF in neurotypical individuals is associated with low-level analysis of pitch in the ‘pitch processing center’ of the Heschl’s gyrus. Therefore, alternations in this auditory response may reflect atypical processing of vocal pitch. The SF, however, has never been studied in people with ASD."
The Evidential Conditional,"This paper outlines an account of conditionals, the evidential account, which rests on the idea that a conditional is true just in case its antecedent supports its consequent. As we will show, the evidential account exhibits some distinctive logical features that deserve careful consideration. On the one hand, it departs from the material reading of ‘if then’ exactly in the way we would like it to depart from that reading. On the other, it significantly differs from the non-material accounts which hinge on the Ramsey Test, advocated by Adams, Stalnaker, Lewis, and others."
Field-tuned magnetic structure and phase diagram of the honeycomb magnet YbCl3,"We report thermodynamic and neutron diffraction measurements on the magnetic ordering properties of the honeycomb lattice magnet YbCl3. We find YbCl3 exhibits a Néel type long-range magnetic order at the wavevector (0, 0, 0) below TN = 600 mK. This magnetic order is associated with a small sharp peak in heat capacity and most magnetic entropy release occurs above the magnetic ordering temperature. The magnetic moment lies in-plane, parallel to the monoclinic a-axis, whose magnitude mYb = 0.86(3) μB is considerably smaller than the expected fully ordered moment of 2.24 μB for the doublet crystal-field ground state. The magnetic ordering moment gradually increases with increasing magnetic field perpendicular to the ab-plane, reaching a maximum value of 1.6(2) μB at 4 T, before it is completely suppressed above ∼ 9 T. These results indicate the presence of strong quantum fluctuations in YbCl3."
Energy and economic analysis of a point-focus concentrating photovoltaic system when its installation site varies,"The concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) systems are a promising technology to obtain clean energy. However, these systems are not equally convenient worldwide due to different climatic conditions. The main aim of this paper is to analyze energy and economic performances of a point-focus CPV system for a residential user when its installation site varies. Three locations, Riyadh, Copenhagen, and Palermo, characterized by very different weather conditions are chosen. A model that links the electrical power of a triple-junction (TJ) cell with its temperature and concentrated radiation incident on it is experimentally developed to evaluate the energy performance of the CPV system. A comparison of the three localities for typical winter and summer sunny days indicates that the higher values of the TJ cell temperature are reached in summer, over 70°C at Riyadh, and its electrical power is reduced compared to a winter day. In winter, a TJ cell in Riyadh supplies an electric power of about 20% higher than that in other two cities, while in summer, the maximum power is observed at Copenhagen. On the contrary, the electrical producibility also depends on the sunlight daily hours number during the year. Hence, considering the real distribution of direct normal irradiance (DNI) and the environmental temperature for each locality, a CPV system composed of modules of 90 cells adopted for a residential user is sized. The electric producibility of the CPV system, by varying its module number, is evaluated for different localities together with the optimal number of the modules which is able to maximize the investment profitability."
Comparison of Crude Population-Level Indicators of Opioid Use and Related Harm in New Zealand and Ontario (Canada),"North America and select other Commonwealth jurisdictions have been experiencing unprecedented opioid epidemics characterized by excessive and persistently high levels of opioid misuse, morbidity and mortality, and related disease burden. Recent discussions have considered whether New Zealand might undergo or needs to expect a similar ‘opioid crisis’. Towards further informing these considerations, we examine and compare essential, publicly available indicators of opioid utilization and harms (mortality) from New Zealand and the Canadian province of Ontario, due to the fact that both operate public health care systems in similar socio-cultural settings. We find that the two jurisdictions have featured vastly different population levels of opioid exposure, opioid consumption patterns (e.g., high-dose/long-term/high-risk prescribing) known as key predictors of adverse outcomes, and levels of opioid mortality as evidenced by concrete epidemiological indicators and data. Specifically for opioid-related death rates, these were already approximately threefold higher in Ontario compared to New Zealand based on most recent comparison data (e.g., 2012); these differentials have likely further grown more recently given major and distinct changes in population-level opioid exposure and risks, and subsequent opioid-related deaths since then in Ontario. Based on the present data and related evidence, New Zealand does not seem to need to anticipate an opioid mortality epidemic similar to that experienced in North America; however, it would be of interest to establish more comprehensive and timely surveillance of key system-level indicators of opioid use and harms as are standard in North America. As such, this inter-jurisdictional comparison makes for a case study in starkly contrasting scenarios of opioid use and harms, the drivers behind which deserve further systematic examination."
Mkhitar Djrbashian and His Contribution to Fractional Calculus,"This survey paper is devoted to the description of the results by M.M. Djrbashian related to the modern theory of Fractional Calculus. M.M. Djrbashian (1918-1994) is a well-known expert in complex analysis, harmonic analysis and approximation theory. Anyway, his contributions to fractional calculus, to boundary value problems for fractional order operators, to the investigation of properties of the Queen function of Fractional Calculus (the Mittag-Leffler function), to integral transforms’ theory has to be understood on a better level. Unfortunately, most of his works are not enough popular as in that time were published in Russian. The aim of this survey is to fill in the gap in the clear recognition of M.M. Djrbashian’s results in these areas."

Critically Charged Superfluid 4He Surface in Inhomogeneous Electric Fields,"We have studied the spatial distribution of charges trapped at the surface of superfluid helium in the inhomogeneous electric field of a metallic tip close to the liquid surface. The electrostatic pressure of the charges generates a deformation of the liquid surface, leading to a “hillock” (called “Taylor cone”) or “dimple”, depending on whether the tip is placed above or below the surface. We use finite element simulations for calculating the surface profile and the corresponding charge density in the vicinity of the tip. Typical electric fields E are in the range of a few kV/cm, the maximum equilibrium surface deformations have a height on the order of (but somewhat smaller than) the capillary length of liquid 4He (0.5 mm), and the maximum number density of elementary charges in a hillock or dimple, limited by an electrohydrodynamic instability, is some 1013 m−2. These results can be used to determine the charge density at a liquid helium surface from the measured surface profile. They also imply that inhomogeneous electric fields at a bulk helium surface do not allow one to increase the electron density substantially beyond the limit for a homogeneous field, and are therefore not feasible for reaching a density regime where surface state electrons are expected to show deviations from the classical behavior. Some alternative solutions are discussed."

Deposition distribution of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in the human airways upon exposure to cough-generated droplets and aerosol particles,"The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been emerged as a rapidly spreading pandemic. The disease is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry. Although the majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the acinar airways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the acinar airways. While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid to how SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells. The aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated droplets and aerosol particles. For this purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Particle size distribution, breathing parameters supposing normal breathing through the nose, and viral loads were taken from the literature. We found that the probability of direct infection of the acinar airways due to inhalation of particles emitted by a bystander cough is very low. As the number of viruses deposited in the extrathoracic airways is about 7 times higher than in the acinar airways, we concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. Our results suggest that without the enhancement of viral load in the upper airways, COVID-19 would be much less dangerous. The period between the onset of initial symptoms and the potential clinical deterioration could provide an opportunity for prevention of pneumonia by blocking or significantly reducing the transport of viruses towards the acinar airways. Therefore, even non-specific treatment forms like disinfection of the throat and nasal and oral mucosa may effectively keep the viral load of the upper airways low enough to avoid or prolong the progression of the disease. In addition, using a tissue or cloth in order to absorb droplets and aerosol particles emitted by own coughs of infected patients before re-inhalation is highly recommended even if they are alone in quarantine."
TW-SIR: time-window based SIR for COVID-19 forecasts,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many COVID-19 research studies have proposed different models for predicting the trend of COVID-19. Among them, the prediction model based on mathematical epidemiology (SIR) is the most widely used, but most of these models are adapted in special situations based on various assumptions. In this study, a general adapted time-window based SIR prediction model is proposed, which is characterized by introducing a time window mechanism for dynamic data analysis and using machine learning method predicts the basic reproduction number and the exponential growth rate of the epidemic. We analyzed COVID-19 data from February to July 2020 in seven countries–––China, South Korea, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Germany and France, and the numerical results showed that the framework can effectively measure the real-time changes of the parameters during the epidemic, and error rate of predicting the number of COVID-19 infections in a single day is within 5%."
The transbasal approach to the anterior skull base: surgical outcome of a single-centre case series,"A variety of sinonasal tumours, meningiomas or other lesions of the anterior skull base involve the paranasal sinuses and the periorbital area. The transbasal approach (TBA) has turned out to be a feasible technique to reach those lesions. A retrospective review at a neurosurgical university department between November 2007 and January 2020 with adult patients who underwent resection of oncologic pathologies through TBA. Surgical technique, extent of resection (EOR), clinical outcome and postoperative complications were analysed. 18 TBAs between November 2007 and January 2020 were performed. Median age was 62 (range 25–83), 7 female and 11 male patients. Gross total resection rate was 85.8% throughout all entities. Four (22.2%) patients suffered from WHO°I meningiomas and 14 (77.7%) from other extra-axial lesions. Preoperative Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPSS) was 80% (range 40–90), postoperative KPSS 80% (range 20–100). Rate of postoperative complications requiring intervention was 16.7%. Median follow-up was 9.8 (range 1.2–71.8) months. Modifications and extensions of the classic TBA are not mandatory. Complete resection can be performed under functional and cosmetic-preserving aspects. Second-step procedures such as transnasal approaches may be performed to avoid high morbidity of more aggressive TBAs, if necessary.

The serine protease HtrA plays a key role in heat-induced dispersal of pneumococcal biofilms,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) colonizes the human nasopharynx by forming multicellular biofilms. Due to the high level of asymptomatic carriage, transition to infections, such as otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis, occurs often enough that the pneumococcus remains a major cause of disease and death globally. Virus infection and virus-induced responses, such as increased temperature (fever), trigger release of virulent bacteria from colonizing biofilms. The exact mechanisms involved in pneumococcal egress during biofilm dispersal remain unknown, although we hypothesize that disruption of the biofilm matrix encasing the bacteria is necessary. Here, we utilized established in vitro biofilm dispersal models to investigate the involvement of proteases in bacterial egress from pneumococcal biofilms. We demonstrate the importance of protease activity, both through increased bacterial release following addition of proteases and reduced heat-induced biofilm dispersal in the presence of protease inhibitors. We identify a key role for the surface-exposed serine protease HtrA, but not PrtA, in heat-induced biofilm dispersal. Bacterial release from htrA-negative biofilms was significantly reduced compared to wild-type isogenic strains but was restored and increased above wild-type levels following addition of recombinant HtrA. Understanding the specific mechanisms involved in bacterial egress may provide novel targets for future strategies aimed to specifically interfere with disease progression without disturbing nasopharyngeal biofilm colonization."
Fecal short chain fatty acids in children living on farms and a link between valeric acid and protection from eczema,"Children growing up on farms have low rates of allergy, but the mechanism for this protective effect has not been fully elucidated. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by the gut microbiota may play a role in protection from allergy. We measured fecal SCFA levels in samples collected from 28 farming and 37 control children over the first 3 years of life using gas chromatography. Data on diet and other host factors were recorded and allergy was diagnosed at 8 years of age. Among all children, median propionic and butyric acid concentration increased over the first 3 years, and longer SCFAs typically appeared by 1 year of age. Farm children had higher levels of iso-butyric, iso-valeric and valeric acid at 3 years of age than rural controls. In addition, children with elder siblings had higher levels of valeric acid at 3 years of age, and dietary factors also affected SCFA pattern. High levels of valeric acid at 3 years of age were associated with low rate of eczema at 8 years of age. The fecal SCFA pattern in farm children suggests a more rapid maturation of the gut microbiota. Valeric acid or associated microbes may have protective potential against eczema."
"Swedish intrauterine growth reference ranges of biometric measurements of fetal head, abdomen and femur","Ultrasonic assessment of fetal growth is an important part of obstetric care to prevent adverse pregnancy outcome. However, lack of reliable reference ranges is a major barrier for accurate interpretation of the examinations. The aim of this study was to create updated Swedish national reference ranges for intrauterine size and growth of the fetal head, abdomen and femur from gestational week 12 to 42. This prospective longitudinal multicentre study included 583 healthy pregnant women with low risk of aberrant fetal growth. Each woman was examined up to five times with ultrasound from gestational week 12 + 3 to 41 + 6. The assessed intrauterine fetal biometric measurements were biparietal diameter (outer–inner), head circumference, mean abdominal diameter, abdominal circumference and femur length. A two-level hierarchical regression model was employed to account for the individual measurements of the fetus and the number of repeated visits for measurements while accounting for the random effect of the identified parameterization of gestational age. The expected median and variance, expressed in both standard deviations and percentiles, for each individual biometric measurement was calculated. The presented national reference ranges can be used for assessment of intrauterine size and growth of the fetal head, abdomen and femur in the second and third trimester of pregnancy."
Divided attention does not affect the acquisition and consolidation of transitional probabilities,"Statistical learning facilitates the efficient processing and prediction of environmental events and contributes to the acquisition of automatic behaviors. Whereas a minimal level of attention seems to be required for learning to occur, it is still unclear how acquisition and consolidation of statistical knowledge are affected when attention is divided during learning. To test the effect of divided attention on statistical learning and consolidation, ninety-six healthy young adults performed the Alternating Serial Reaction Time task in which they incidentally acquired second-order transitional probabilities. Half of the participants completed the task with a concurrent secondary intentional sequence learning task that was applied to the same stimulus stream. The other half of the participants performed the task without any attention manipulation. Performance was retested after a 12-h post-learning offline period. Half of each group slept during the delay, while the other half had normal daily activity, enabling us to test the effect of delay activity (sleep vs. wake) on the consolidation of statistical knowledge. Divided attention had no effect on statistical learning: The acquisition of second-order transitional probabilities was comparable with and without the secondary task. Consolidation was neither affected by divided attention: Statistical knowledge was similarly retained over the 12-h delay, irrespective of the delay activity. Our findings can contribute to a better understanding of the role of attentional processes in and the robustness of visuomotor statistical learning and consolidation."
Revealing nutritional requirements of MICP-relevant Sporosarcina pasteurii DSM33 for growth improvement in chemically defined and complex media,"Microbial induced calcite precipitation (MICP) based on ureolysis has a high potential for many applications, e.g. restoration of construction materials. The gram-positive bacterium Sporosarcina pasteurii is the most commonly used microorganism for MICP due to its high ureolytic activity. However, Sporosarcina pasteurii is so far cultivated almost exclusively in complex media, which only results in moderate biomass concentrations at the best. Cultivation of Sporosarcina pasteurii must be strongly improved in order to make technological application of MICP economically feasible. The growth of Sporosarcina pasteurii DSM 33 was boosted by detecting auxotrophic deficiencies (L-methionine, L-cysteine, thiamine, nicotinic acid), nutritional requirements (phosphate, trace elements) and useful carbon sources (glucose, maltose, lactose, fructose, sucrose, acetate, L-proline, L-alanine). These were determined by microplate cultivations with online monitoring of biomass in a chemically defined medium and systematically omitting or substituting medium components. Persisting growth limitations were also detected, allowing further improvement of the chemically defined medium by the addition of glutamate group amino acids. Common complex media based on peptone and yeast extract were supplemented based on these findings. Optical density at the end of each cultivation of the improved peptone and yeast extract media roughly increased fivefold respectively. A maximum OD600 of 26.6 ± 0.7 (CDW: 17.1 ± 0.5 g/L) was reached with the improved yeast extract medium. Finally, culture performance and media improvement was analysed by measuring the oxygen transfer rate as well as the backscatter during shake flask cultivation."
Averaging sleep spindle occurrence in dogs predicts learning performance better than single measures,"Although a positive link between sleep spindle occurrence and measures of post-sleep recall (learning success) is often reported for humans and replicated across species, the test–retest reliability of the effect is sometimes questioned. The largest to date study could not confirm the association, however methods for automatic spindle detection diverge in their estimates and vary between studies. Here we report that in dogs using the same detection method across different learning tasks is associated with observing a positive association between sleep spindle density (spindles/minute) and learning success. Our results suggest that reducing measurement error by averaging across measurements of density and learning can increase the visibility of this effect, implying that trait density (estimated through averaged occurrence) is a more reliable predictor of cognitive performance than estimates based on single measures."
Reanalysis datasets outperform other gridded climate products in vegetation change analysis in peripheral conservation areas of Central Asia,"Global environmental research requires long-term climate data. Yet, meteorological infrastructure is missing in the vast majority of the world’s protected areas. Therefore, gridded products are frequently used as the only available climate data source in peripheral regions. However, associated evaluations are commonly biased towards well observed areas and consequently, station-based datasets. As evaluations on vegetation monitoring abilities are lacking for regions with poor data availability, we analyzed the potential of several state-of-the-art climate datasets (CHIRPS, CRU, ERA5-Land, GPCC-Monitoring-Product, IMERG-GPM, MERRA-2, MODIS-MOD10A1) for assessing NDVI anomalies (MODIS-MOD13Q1) in two particularly suitable remote conservation areas. We calculated anomalies of 156 climate variables and seasonal periods during 2001–2018, correlated these with vegetation anomalies while taking the multiple comparison problem into consideration, and computed their spatial performance to derive suitable parameters. Our results showed that four datasets (MERRA-2, ERA5-Land, MOD10A1, CRU) were suitable for vegetation analysis in both regions, by showing significant correlations controlled at a false discovery rate < 5% and in more than half of the analyzed areas. Cross-validated variable selection and importance assessment based on the Boruta algorithm indicated high importance of the reanalysis datasets ERA5-Land and MERRA-2 in both areas but higher differences and variability between the regions with all other products. CHIRPS, GPCC and the bias-corrected version of MERRA-2 were unsuitable and not important in both regions. We provide evidence that reanalysis datasets are most suitable for spatiotemporally consistent environmental analysis whereas gauge- or satellite-based products and their combinations are highly variable and may not be applicable in peripheral areas."
Energy and economic analysis of a point-focus concentrating photovoltaic system when its installation site varies,"The concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) systems are a promising technology to obtain clean energy. However, these systems are not equally convenient worldwide due to different climatic conditions. The main aim of this paper is to analyze energy and economic performances of a point-focus CPV system for a residential user when its installation site varies. Three locations, Riyadh, Copenhagen, and Palermo, characterized by very different weather conditions are chosen. A model that links the electrical power of a triple-junction (TJ) cell with its temperature and concentrated radiation incident on it is experimentally developed to evaluate the energy performance of the CPV system. A comparison of the three localities for typical winter and summer sunny days indicates that the higher values of the TJ cell temperature are reached in summer, over 70°C at Riyadh, and its electrical power is reduced compared to a winter day. In winter, a TJ cell in Riyadh supplies an electric power of about 20% higher than that in other two cities, while in summer, the maximum power is observed at Copenhagen. On the contrary, the electrical producibility also depends on the sunlight daily hours number during the year. Hence, considering the real distribution of direct normal irradiance (DNI) and the environmental temperature for each locality, a CPV system composed of modules of 90 cells adopted for a residential user is sized. The electric producibility of the CPV system, by varying its module number, is evaluated for different localities together with the optimal number of the modules which is able to maximize the investment profitability."

Beneficial effect of retigabine on memory in rats receiving ethanol,"Retigabine belongs to the novel generation of antiepileptic drugs but its complex mechanism of action causes that the drug might be effective in other diseases, for instance, alcohol dependence. It is known that ethanol abuse impaired the function of brain structures associated with memory and learning such as the hippocampus. In our previous study, retigabine reduced hippocampal changes induced by ethanol in the EEG rhythms in rabbits. This study is focused on the impact of retigabine on memory processes in male rats receiving alcohol."
Competition among coalitions in a cournot industry: a validation of the porter hypothesis,"We determine the emergence of the Porter hypothesis in a large oligopoly setting where the industry-wide adoption of green technologies is endogenously determined as a result of competition among coalitions. We examine a framework where firms decide whether to be “brown” or “green” and compete in quantities. We find that the Porter hypothesis may emerge as a market configuration with all green firms spurred by environmental regulation, even if consumers are not environmentally concerned. We also single out the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the green grand coalition is socially optimal and therefore yields a win–win outcome. Then, we show that, if the environmental externality is steep enough, the tax rate maximising welfare in the initial industry configuration is a driver of the win–win solution. Finally, the analysis is extended in several directions."
Fractional Nonlinear Stochastic Heat Equation with Variable Thermal Conductivity,"We consider a nonlinear stochastic heat equation with Riesz spacefractional derivative and variable thermal conductivity, on infinite domain. First we approximate the original problem by regularizing the Riesz spacefractional derivative. Then we prove that the approximate problem has almost surely a unique solution within a Colombeau generalized stochastic process space. In our solving procedure we use the theory of Colombeau generalized uniformly continuous semigroups of operators. At the end, we study the relation of the original and the approximate problem and prove that, under certain conditions, the derivative operators appearing in these two problems are associated. Even more, we prove that under some additional conditions, solutions of the original and the approximate problem are almost certainly associated as well (assuming that the first one almost surely exists)."
Multidimensional van der Corput-Type Estimates Involving Mittag-Leffler Functions,"The paper is devoted to study multidimensional van der Corput-type estimates for the intergrals involving Mittag-Leffler functions. The generalisation is that we replace the exponential function with the Mittag-Lefflertype function, to study multidimensional oscillatory integrals appearing in the analysis of time-fractional evolution equations. More specifically, we study two types of integrals with functions Eα,β (iλφ(x)), x ∈ RN and Eα,β (iαλφ(x)), x ∈ RN for the various range of α and β. Several generalisations of the van der Corput-type estimates are proved. As an application of the above results, the Cauchy problem for the multidimensional time-fractional Klein-Gordon and time-fractional Schrödinger equations are considered."
Determination of Time-Dependent Sources and Parameters of Nonlocal Diffusion and Wave Equations from Final Data,"Two inverse problems with final overdetermination for diffusion and wave equations containing the Caputo fractional time derivative and a fractional Laplacian of distributed order are considered. They are: 1) the problem to reconstruct a time-dependent source term; 2) the problem to recover simultaneously the source term, the order of the time derivative and the fractional Laplacian. Uniqueness of solutions of these problems is proved. Sufficient conditions for the uniqueness are stricter for the 2nd problem than for the 1st problem."
Large-area periodic lead halide perovskite nanostructures for lenticular printing laser displays,"Lenticular printing technique provides a promising way to realize stereoscopic displays, especially, when microscopic optical structures are integrated into light-emitting materials/devices. Here, we fabricated large-area periodic structures with a spatial resolution at a wavelength scale from hybrid perovskite materials via a space-confined solution growth method. It takes advantages of both high refractive index contrast and high luminescence brightness, which allows the optical modulation on not only the reflection of illumination, but also the light emission from hybrid perovskites. The distributed feedback within these periodic structures significantly improves the degree of polarization and directionality of laser actions while their threshold is also reduced. These findings enable us to present a prototype of lenticular printing laser displays that vary emission colors at different view angles, which may find applications in creating high-resolution and high-contrast holographical images."
Practical age estimation using deep label distribution learning,"Age estimation plays an important role in humancomputer interaction system. The lack of large number of facial images with definite age label makes age estimation algorithms inefficient. Deep label distribution learning (DLDL) which employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) and label distribution learning to learn ambiguity from ground-truth age and adjacent ages, has been proven to outperform current state-of-the-art framework. However, DLDL assumes a rough label distribution which covers all ages for any given age label. In this paper, a more practical label distribution paradigm is proposed: we limit age label distribution that only covers a reasonable number of neighboring ages. In addition, we explore different label distributions to improve the performance of the proposed learning model. We employ CNN and the improved label distribution learning to estimate age. Experimental results show that compared to the DLDL, our method is more effective for facial age recognition."
Tile selection method based on error minimization for photomosaic image creation,"Photomosaic images are composite images composed of many small images called tiles. In its overall visual effect, a photomosaic image is similar to the target image, and photomosaics are also called “montage art”. Noisy blocks and the loss of local information are the major obstacles in most methods or programs that create photomosaic images. To solve these problems and generate a photomosaic image in this study, we propose a tile selection method based on error minimization. A photomosaic image can be generated by partitioning the target image in a rectangular pattern, selecting appropriate tile images, and then adding them with a weight coefficient. Based on the principles of montage art, the quality of the generated photomosaic image can be evaluated by both global and local error. Under the proposed framework, via an error function analysis, the results show that selecting a tile image using a global minimum distance minimizes both the global error and the local error simultaneously. Moreover, the weight coefficient of the image superposition can be used to adjust the ratio of the global and local errors. Finally, to verify the proposed method, we built a new photomosaic creation dataset during this study. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a low mean absolute error and that the generated photomosaic images have a more artistic effect than do the existing approaches."
Physical layer authentication for automotive cyber physical systems based on modified HB protocol,"Automotive cyber physical systems (CPSs) are ever more utilizing wireless technology for V2X communication as a potential way out for challenges regarding collision detection, wire strap up troubles and collision avoidance. However, security is constrained as a result of the energy and performance limitations of modern wireless systems. Accordingly, the need for efficient secret key generation and management mechanism for secured communication among computationally weak wireless devices has motivated the introduction of new authentication protocols. Recently, there has been a great interest in physical layer based secret key generation schemes by utilizing channel reciprocity. Consequently, it is observed that the sequence generated by two communicating parties contain mismatched bits which need to be reconciled by exchanging information over a public channel. This can be an immense security threat as it may let an adversary attain and recover segments of the key in known channel conditions. We proposed Hopper-Blum based physical layer (HB-PL) authentication scheme in which an enhanced physical layer key generation method integrates the Hopper-Blum (HB) authentication protocol. The information collected from the shared channel is used as secret keys for the HB protocol and the mismatched bits are used as the induced noise for learning parity with noise (LPN) problem. The proposed scheme aims to provide a way out for bit reconciliation process without leakage of information over a public channel. Moreover, HB protocol is computationally efficient and simple which helps to reduce the number of exchange messages during the authentication process. We have performed several experiments which show that our proposed design can generate secret keys with improved security strength and high performance in comparison to the current authentication techniques. Our scheme requires less than 55 exchange messages to achieve more than 95% of correct authentication."
Compositional metric learning for multi-label classification,"Multi-label classification aims to assign a set of proper labels for each instance, where distance metric learning can help improve the generalization ability of instance-based multi-label classification models. Existing multi-label metric learning techniques work by utilizing pairwise constraints to enforce that examples with similar label assignments should have close distance in the embedded feature space. In this paper, a novel distance metric learning approach for multi-label classification is proposed by modeling structural interactions between instance space and label space. On one hand, compositional distance metric is employed which adopts the representation of a weighted sum of rank-1 PSD matrices based on component bases. On the other hand, compositional weights are optimized by exploiting triplet similarity constraints derived from both instance and label spaces. Due to the compositional nature of employed distance metric, the resulting problem admits quadratic programming formulation with linear optimization complexity w.r.t. the number of training examples. We also derive the generalization bound for the proposed approach based on algorithmic robustness analysis of the compositional metric. Extensive experiments on sixteen benchmark data sets clearly validate the usefulness of compositional metric in yielding effective distance metric for multi-label classification."
A novel DNA-inspired encryption strategy for concealing cloud storage,"Over the last few years, the need of a cloud environment with the ability to detect illegal behaviours along with a secured data storage capability has increased largely. This study presents such a secured cloud storage framework comprising of a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) based encryption key which has been generated to make the framework unbreakable, thus ensuring a better and secured distributed cloud storage environment. Furthermore, this work proposes a novel DNA-based encryption technique inspired by the biological characteristics of DNA and the protein synthesis mechanism. The introduced DNA based model also has an additional advantage of being able to decide on selecting suitable storage servers from an existing pool of storage servers on which the data must be stored. A fuzzy-based technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) multi-criteria decisionmaking (MCDM) model has been employed to achieve the above-mentioned goal. This can decide the set of suitable storage servers and also results in a reduction in execution time by keeping up the level of security to an improved grade. This study also investigates and analyzes the strength of the proposed S-Box and encryption technique against some standard criteria and benchmarks, such as avalanche effect, correlation coefficient, information entropy, linear probability, and differential probability etc. After the avalanche effect analysis, the average change in cipher-text has been found to be 51.85%. Moreover, thorough security, sensitivity and functionality analysis show that the proposed scheme guarantees high security with robustness."

Urban street tree biodiversity and antidepressant prescriptions,"Growing urbanisation is a threat to both mental health and biodiversity. Street trees are an important biodiversity component of urban greenspace, but little is known about their effects on mental health. Here, we analysed the association of street tree density and species richness with antidepressant prescribing for 9751 inhabitants of Leipzig, Germany. We examined spatial scale effects of street trees at different distances around participant’s homes, using Euclidean buffers of 100, 300, 500, and 1000 m. Employing generalised additive models, we found a lower rate of antidepressant prescriptions for people living within 100 m of higher density of street trees—although this relationship was marginally significant (p = 0.057) when confounding factors were considered. Density of street trees at further spatial distances, and species richness of street trees at any distance, were not associated with antidepressant prescriptions. However, for individuals with low socio-economic status, high density of street trees at 100 m around the home significantly reduced the probability of being prescribed antidepressants. The study suggests that unintentional daily contact to nature through street trees close to the home may reduce the risk of depression, especially for individuals in deprived groups. This has important implications for urban planning and nature-based health interventions in cities."
Magnetic spatiotemporal control of SOS1 coupled nanoparticles for guided neurite growth in dopaminergic single cells,"The axon regeneration of neurons in the brain can be enhanced by activating intracellular signaling pathways such as those triggered by the membrane-anchored Rat sarcoma (RAS) proto-oncogene. Here we demonstrate the induction of neurite growth by expressing tagged permanently active Harvey-RAS protein or the RAS-activating catalytic domain of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (SOS1cat), in secondary dopaminergic cells. Due to the tag, the expressed fusion protein is captured by functionalized magnetic nanoparticles in the cytoplasm of the cell. We use magnetic tips for remote translocation of the SOS1cat-loaded magnetic nanoparticles from the cytoplasm towards the inner face of the plasma membrane where the endogenous Harvey-RAS protein is located. Furthermore, we show the magnetic transport of SOS1cat-bound nanoparticles from the cytoplasm into the neurite until they accumulate at its tip on a time scale of minutes. In order to scale-up from single cells, we show the cytoplasmic delivery of the magnetic nanoparticles into large numbers of cells without changing the cellular response to nerve growth factor. These results will serve as an initial step to develop tools for refining cell replacement therapies based on grafted human induced dopaminergic neurons loaded with functionalized magnetic nanoparticles in Parkinson model systems."
Defining eligible patients for allele-selective chemotherapies targeting NAT2 in colorectal cancer,"Therapies targeting somatic bystander genetic events represent a new avenue for cancer treatment. We recently identified a subset of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients who are heterozygous for a wild-type and a low activity allele (NAT2*6) but lack the wild-type allele in their tumors due to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 8p22. These tumors were sensitive to treatment with a cytotoxic substrate of NAT2 (6-(4-aminophenyl)-N-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)pyrazin-2-amine, APA), and pointed to NAT2 loss being a therapeutically exploitable vulnerability of CRC tumors. To better estimate the total number of treatable CRC patients, we here determined whether tumor cells retaining also other NAT2 low activity variants after LOH respond to APA treatment. The prevalent low activity alleles NAT2*5 and NAT2*14, but not NAT2*7, were found to be low metabolizers with high sensitivity to APA. By analysis of two different CRC patient cohorts, we detected heterozygosity for NAT2 alleles targetable by APA, along with allelic imbalances pointing to LOH, in ~ 24% of tumors. Finally, to haplotype the NAT2 locus in tumor and patient-matched normal samples in a clinical setting, we develop and demonstrate a long-read sequencing based assay. In total, > 79.000 CRC patients per year fulfil genetic criteria for high sensitivity to a NAT2 LOH therapy and their eligibility can be assessed by clinical sequencing."
Impact of the COVID-19 lockdown period on adult musculoskeletal injuries and surgical management: a retrospective monocentric study,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the worldwide implementation of unprecedented public protection measures. On the 17th of March, the French government announced a lockdown of the population for 8 weeks. This monocentric study assessed the impact of this lockdown on the musculoskeletal injuries treated at the emergency department as well as the surgical indications. We carried out a retrospective study in the Emergency Department and the Surgery Department of Nantes University Hospital from 18 February to 11 May 2020. We collected data pertaining to the demographics, the mechanism, the type, the severity, and inter-hospital transfer for musculoskeletal injuries from our institution. We compared the 4-week pre-lockdown period and the 8-week lockdown period divided into two 4-week periods: early lockdown and late lockdown. There was a 52.1% decrease in musculoskeletal injuries among patients presenting to the Emergency Department between the pre-lockdown and the lockdown period (weekly incidence: 415.3 ± 44.2 vs. 198.5 ± 46.0, respectively, p < .001). The number of patients with surgical indications decreased by 33.4% (weekly incidence: 44.3 ± 3.8 vs. 28.5 ± 10.2, p = .048). The policy for inter-hospital transfers to private entities resulted in 64 transfers (29.4%) during the lockdown period. There was an increase in the incidence of surgical high severity trauma (Injury Severity Score > 16) between the pre-lockdown and the early lockdown period (2 (1.1%) vs. 7 (7.2%), respectively, p = .010) as well as between the pre-lockdown and the late lockdown period (2 (1.1%) vs. 10 (8.3%), respectively, p = .004). We observed a significant increase in the weekly emergency department patient admissions between the early and the late lockdown period (161.5 ± 22.9, 235.5 ± 27.7, respectively, p = .028). A pronounced decrease in the incidence of musculoskeletal injuries was observed secondary to the lockdown measures, with emergency department patient admissions being halved and surgical indications being reduced by a third. The increase in musculoskeletal injuries during the late confinement period and the higher incidence of severe trauma highlights the importance of maintaining a functional trauma center organization with an inter-hospital transfer policy in case of a COVID-19s wave lockdown."
A glimpse of antimicrobial resistance gene diversity in kefir and yoghurt,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat gaining more and more practical significance every year. The main determinants of AMR are the antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). Since bacteria can share genetic components via horizontal gene transfer, even non-pathogenic bacteria may provide ARG to any pathogens which they become physically close to (e.g. in the human gut). In addition, fermented food naturally contains bacteria in high amounts. In this study, we examined the diversity of ARG content in various kefir and yoghurt samples (products, grains, bacterial strains) using a unified metagenomic approach. We found numerous ARGs of commonly used fermenting bacteria. Even with the strictest filter restrictions, we identified ARGs undermining the efficacy of aminocoumarins, aminoglycosides, carbapenems, cephalosporins, cephamycins, diaminopyrimidines, elfamycins, fluoroquinolones, fosfomycins, glycylcyclines, lincosamides, macrolides, monobactams, nitrofurans, nitroimidazoles, penams, penems, peptides, phenicols, rifamycins, tetracyclines and triclosan. In the case of gene lmrD, we detected genetic environment providing mobility of this ARG. Our findings support the theory that during the fermentation process, the ARG content of foods can grow due to bacterial multiplication. The results presented suggest that the starting culture strains of fermented foods should be monitored and selected in order to decrease the intake of ARGs via foods."
Maternal separation in rats induces neurobiological and behavioral changes on the maternal side,"The time after parturition is a sensitive period for mothers where they are prone to develop psychopathological symptoms. Studies investigating dams after separation from their pups (maternal separation, MS) showed that MS induces alterations similar to postpartum depression. This study aims to give further details on affected behavior and neurobiology of dams after MS. MS in rats from postnatal day 2–20 over four hours daily was performed. Upon reunion, maternal behavior, and ultrasonic vocalization (USV) of dams were measured. On the day of weaning, dams were tested for anxiety-like behavior in the elevated-plus-maze and marble burying test. Then Morc1 mRNA in the medial prefrontal cortex and Nr3c1 encoding the glucocorticoid receptor mRNA in the hippocampus were measured using real-time PCR to examine possible neurobiological correlates in psychopathology and social behavior. GABA and glutamate serum levels were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography as peripheral markers for stress-induced psychopathology. MS in dams increased maternal care towards pups even though both groups show high levels of maternal behavior even in late lactation. Furthermore, the emission of 50-kHz and 22-kHz USVs increased significantly. No differences in anxiety-like behavior were detected. MS further reduced Morc1 but not Nr3c1 expression. Serum GABA but not glutamate levels were significantly increased in separated dams. This study reinforces the benefit of investigating dams after MS for studying postpartum stress. Subclinical markers mainly connected to depression, namely Morc1 and GABA, proved to be useful allowing for earlier detection of symptoms of critical postpartum stress."
Elevated levels of cortisol in hair precede acute myocardial infarction,"Long term stress exposure is typical for modern societies and might trigger different diseases. This case–control study reveals that persons who had suffered an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) had elevated cortisol concentrations in the month before the acute event. Middle-aged patients admitted to cardiology clinics with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (n = 174) were compared to 3156 controls from a population-based cohort in southeast Sweden. The median Hair Cortisol Concentrations (HCC) for those who had suffered an AMI was 53.2 pg/mg compared to 22.2 pg/mg for the control group (p < 0.001). In bivariate analysis, higher levels of HCC were strongly (OR = 5.69) and statistically significantly associated with current AMI status. The discrimination of cases with AMI from controls remained statistically significant (OR = 5.04) even after controlling for established cardiovascular risk factors in a multivariate analysis. Middle-aged persons with acute myocardial infarction had significantly elevated cortisol levels during the month before the cardiac event. This was evident for both men and women. The biomarker cortisol concentration was independently and statistically significantly related to AMI. Chronic stress seems to be a new promising risk factor for AMI."
Venous thromboembolism in patients hospitalized for knee joint replacement surgery,"Patients undergoing knee joint replacement (KJR) are at high risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE), but data on the time trends of VTE rate in this population are sparse. In this analysis of the German nationwide inpatient sample, we included all hospitalizations for elective primary KJR in Germany 2005–2016. Overall, 1,804,496 hospitalized patients with elective primary KJR (65.1% women, 70.0 years [IQR 63.0–76.0]) were included in the analysis. During hospitalization, VTE was documented in 23,297 (1.3%) patients. Total numbers of primary KJR increased from 129,832 in 2005 to 167,881 in 2016 (β-(slope)-estimate 1,978 [95% CI 1,951 to 2,004], P < 0.001). In-hospital VTE decreased from 2,429 (1.9% of all hospitalizations for KJR) to 1,548 (0.9%) cases (β-estimate − 0.77 [95% CI − 0.81 to − 0.72], P < 0.001), and in-hospital death rate from 0.14% (184 deaths) to 0.09% (146 deaths) (β-estimate − 0.44 deaths per year [95% CI − 0.59 to − 0.30], P < 0.001). Infections during hospitalization were associated with a higher VTE risk. VTE events were independently associated with in-hospital death (OR 20.86 [95% CI 18.78–23.15], P < 0.001). Annual number of KJR performed in Germany increased by almost 30% between 2005 and 2016. In parallel, in-hospital VTE rates decreased from 1.9 to 0.9%. Perioperative infections were associated with higher risk for VTE. Patients who developed VTE had a 21-fold increased risk of in-hospital death."
Understanding adherence to the recording of ecological momentary assessments in the example of tinnitus monitoring,"The recording of Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) can assist people with chronic diseases in monitoring their health state. However, many users quickly lose interest in their respective EMA platforms. Therefore, we studied the adherence of users of the mHealth app TrackYourTinnitus (TYT). The app is used to record EMA in people with tinnitus. 1292 users, who interacted with the app between April 2014 and February 2017, were analyzed in this work. We defined “adherence” based on the dimensions of interaction duration and interaction continuity. We propose methods that are able to predict the (dis)continuation of interaction with the app and identify user segments that are characterized by similar patterns of adherence. For the prediction task we used the data of the questionnaires MiniTF and TSCHQ, which are filled in when the users enter TYT for the first time. Additionally, time series of the eight items of the daily EMA questionnaire were used. The distribution of user activity pertaining to the adherence dimension of interaction duration revealed a very skewed distribution, with most users giving up after only 1 day of interaction. However, many users returned after interrupting for some time. Some of the MiniTF items indicated that the worries of users might have lead to an increased likelihood of returning back to the app. The MiniTF score itself was not predictive, though. The answers to the TSCHQ items, in turn, pointed to user strata (more than 65 years of age at registration), which tended towards higher interaction continuity. As the registration questionnaires predicted adherence only to a limited extent, it is promising to study the activities of the users in the very first days of interaction more deeply. It turned out in this context that the effects of interaction stimulants like personalized and non-personalized tips, pointers to information sources, and mechanisms used in online treatments for tinnitus (e.g., in iCBT) should be further investigated."
Long-term effects of cerebellar anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the acquisition and extinction of conditioned eyeblink responses,"Cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been reported to enhance the acquisition of conditioned eyeblink responses (CR), a form of associative motor learning. The aim of the present study was to determine possible long-term effects of cerebellar tDCS on the acquisition and extinction of CRs. Delay eyeblink conditioning was performed in 40 young and healthy human participants. On day 1, 100 paired CS (conditioned stimulus)–US (unconditioned stimulus) trials were applied. During the first 50 paired CS–US trials, 20 participants received anodal cerebellar tDCS, and 20 participants received sham stimulation. On days 2, 8 and 29, 50 paired CS–US trials were applied, followed by 30 CS-only extinction trials on day 29. CR acquisition was not significantly different between anodal and sham groups. During extinction, CR incidences were significantly reduced in the anodal group compared to sham, indicating reduced retention. In the anodal group, learning related increase of CR magnitude tended to be reduced, and timing of CRs tended to be delayed. The present data do not confirm previous findings of enhanced acquisition of CRs induced by anodal cerebellar tDCS. Rather, the present findings suggest a detrimental effect of anodal cerebellar tDCS on CR retention and possibly CR performance."
Sensory capability and information integration independently explain the cognitive status of healthy older adults,"While there is evidence that sensory processing and multisensory integration change with age, links between these alterations and their relation to cognitive status remain unclear. In this study, we assessed sensory thresholds and performance of healthy younger and older adults in a visuotactile delayed match-to-sample task. Using Bayesian structural equation modelling (BSEM), we explored the factors explaining cognitive status in the group of older adults. Additionally, we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to a parieto-central network found to underlie visuotactile interactions and working memory matching in our previous work. Response times and signal detection measures indicated enhanced multisensory integration and enhanced benefit from successful working memory matching in older adults. Further, tACS caused a frequency-specific speeding (20 Hz) and delaying (70 Hz) of responses. Data exploration suggested distinct underlying factors for sensory acuity and sensitivity d’ on the one side, and multisensory and working memory enhancement on the other side. Finally, BSEM showed that these two factors labelled ‘sensory capability’ and ‘information integration’ independently explained cognitive status. We conclude that sensory decline and enhanced information integration might relate to distinct processes of ageing and discuss a potential role of the parietal cortex in mediating augmented integration in older adults."
Reduced insulin clearance is linked to subclinical atherosclerosis in individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance contribute to vascular damage and are regulated by different pathophysiological processes. The aim of the study was to systematically investigate the relative contributions of multiple fasting state- and oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT)-derived glycemic traits to carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), a surrogate parameter of subclinical atherosclerosis, in individuals with increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). 667 volunteers (417 women and 250 men, mean age 44.1 years), who were free of cardiovascular disease (CVD), were included in this cross-sectional study. Glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion and insulin clearance were assessed by frequently sampled 75 g oGTT. CIMT was measured by high-resolution ultrasound. Insulin clearance was associated with cIMT in univariate analysis (ßst = − 0.17, p < 0.0001) and in a stepwise regression analysis on 15 variables possibly affecting cIMT, age (r2 = 0.3923, p < 0.0001), insulin clearance (r2 = 0.4564, p < 0.0001), systolic blood pressure (r2 = 0.4733, p < 0.0001), body mass index (BMI) (r2 = 0.4804, p = 0.002), gender (r2 = 0.4831, p = 0.013), and fasting insulin clearance (r2 = 0.4857, p = 0.030) turned out to be significant determinants of cIMT. In a cross-validated model resulting from this analysis, insulin clearance was found to be an independent determinant of cIMT (ßst = − 0.16, p < 0.0001) even after adjusting for traditional CVD risk factors. Reduced insulin clearance may be an early marker of damage on the vasculature, independent of classical CVD risk factors. Reduced insulin clearance should be considered with regard to vascular insulin resistance."
Epidemic area contact history and sleep quality associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms in the first phase of COVID-19 outbreak in China,"The impact of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak on mental health was of widespread concern recently. The present study aimed to exam sleep quality and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and potential influence factors in the first phases of COVID-19 massive outbreak in China. A snowball sampling technique was used and a total of 2027 Chinese participated in the present study. Demographic information, epidemic area contact history, sleep quality and PTSS data were collected with an internet-based cross-sectional survey. Results suggested that 59.7% participants were not fully satisfied with their sleep quality, and 50.9% participants had various degrees of short sleep duration problems. 44.1% and 33.0% participants had sleep disturbance and sleep onset latency problems. Also, the prevalence of PTSS reached 4.7% in the self-rating survey. Epidemic area contact history affected PTSS and latency onset of sleep under the influence of COVID-19. Epidemic area contact history and sleep quality had interaction effects on PTSS. The present study was one of the first to evaluate acute psychological responses and possible risk factors during the peak of COVID-19 in China and results indicate that keeping good sleep quality in individuals with pandemic exposure experiences is a way to prevent PTSS."
Large-area periodic lead halide perovskite nanostructures for lenticular printing laser displays,"Lenticular printing technique provides a promising way to realize stereoscopic displays, especially, when microscopic optical structures are integrated into light-emitting materials/devices. Here, we fabricated large-area periodic structures with a spatial resolution at a wavelength scale from hybrid perovskite materials via a space-confined solution growth method. It takes advantages of both high refractive index contrast and high luminescence brightness, which allows the optical modulation on not only the reflection of illumination, but also the light emission from hybrid perovskites. The distributed feedback within these periodic structures significantly improves the degree of polarization and directionality of laser actions while their threshold is also reduced. These findings enable us to present a prototype of lenticular printing laser displays that vary emission colors at different view angles, which may find applications in creating high-resolution and high-contrast holographical images."
Elucidation of genomic organizations of transgenic soybean plants through de novo genome assembly with short paired-end reads,"Elucidation of the genomic organizations of transgene insertion sites is essential for the genetic studies of transgenic plants. Herein, we establish an analysis pipeline that identifies the transgene insertion sites as well as the presence of vector backbones, through de novo genome assembly with high-throughput sequencing data in two transgenic soybean lines, AtYUCCA6-#5 and 35S-UGT72E3/2-#7. Sequencing data of approximately 28× and 29× genome coverages for each line generated by high-throughput sequencing were de novo assembled. The databases generated from the de novo assembled sequences were used to search contigs that contained putative insertion sites and their flanking sequences (integration sites) of transgene fragments using transgenic vector sequences as queries. The predicted integration site sequences, which are located at three annotated genes that might regulate plant development or confer disease resistance, were then confirmed by local alignment against the soybean reference genome and PCR amplification. As results, we revealed the precise transgene-flanking sequences and sequence rearrangements at insertion sites in both the transgenic lines, as well as the aberrant insertion of a transgene fragment. Consequently, relative to experimental or enrichment technologies, our approach is straightforward and time-effective, providing an alternative method for the identification of insertion sites in transgenic plants."
Deciphering the genetic and epidemiological landscape of mitochondrial DNA abundance,"Mitochondrial (MT) dysfunction is a hallmark of aging and has been associated with most aging-related diseases as well as immunological processes. However, little is known about aging, lifestyle and genetic factors influencing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) abundance. In this study, mtDNA abundance was estimated from the weighted intensities of probes mapping to the MT genome in 295,150 participants from the UK Biobank. We found that the abundance of mtDNA was significantly elevated in women compared to men, was negatively correlated with advanced age, higher smoking exposure, greater body-mass index, higher frailty index as well as elevated red and white blood cell count and lower mortality. In addition, several biochemistry markers in blood-related to cholesterol metabolism, ion homeostasis and kidney function were found to be significantly associated with mtDNA abundance. By performing a genome-wide association study, we identified 50 independent regions genome-wide significantly associated with mtDNA abundance which harbour multiple genes involved in the immune system, cancer as well as mitochondrial function. Using mixed effects models, we estimated the SNP-heritability of mtDNA abundance to be around 8%. To investigate the consequence of altered mtDNA abundance, we performed a phenome-wide association study and found that mtDNA abundance is involved in risk for leukaemia, hematologic diseases as well as hypertension. Thus, estimating mtDNA abundance from genotyping arrays has the potential to provide novel insights into age- and disease-relevant processes, particularly those related to immunity and established mitochondrial functions."
A novel DNA-inspired encryption strategy for concealing cloud storage,"Over the last few years, the need of a cloud environment with the ability to detect illegal behaviours along with a secured data storage capability has increased largely. This study presents such a secured cloud storage framework comprising of a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) based encryption key which has been generated to make the framework unbreakable, thus ensuring a better and secured distributed cloud storage environment. Furthermore, this work proposes a novel DNA-based encryption technique inspired by the biological characteristics of DNA and the protein synthesis mechanism. The introduced DNA based model also has an additional advantage of being able to decide on selecting suitable storage servers from an existing pool of storage servers on which the data must be stored. A fuzzy-based technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) multi-criteria decisionmaking (MCDM) model has been employed to achieve the above-mentioned goal. This can decide the set of suitable storage servers and also results in a reduction in execution time by keeping up the level of security to an improved grade. This study also investigates and analyzes the strength of the proposed S-Box and encryption technique against some standard criteria and benchmarks, such as avalanche effect, correlation coefficient, information entropy, linear probability, and differential probability etc. After the avalanche effect analysis, the average change in cipher-text has been found to be 51.85%. Moreover, thorough security, sensitivity and functionality analysis show that the proposed scheme guarantees high security with robustness."
Compositional metric learning for multi-label classification,"Multi-label classification aims to assign a set of proper labels for each instance, where distance metric learning can help improve the generalization ability of instance-based multi-label classification models. Existing multi-label metric learning techniques work by utilizing pairwise constraints to enforce that examples with similar label assignments should have close distance in the embedded feature space. In this paper, a novel distance metric learning approach for multi-label classification is proposed by modeling structural interactions between instance space and label space. On one hand, compositional distance metric is employed which adopts the representation of a weighted sum of rank-1 PSD matrices based on component bases. On the other hand, compositional weights are optimized by exploiting triplet similarity constraints derived from both instance and label spaces. Due to the compositional nature of employed distance metric, the resulting problem admits quadratic programming formulation with linear optimization complexity w.r.t. the number of training examples. We also derive the generalization bound for the proposed approach based on algorithmic robustness analysis of the compositional metric. Extensive experiments on sixteen benchmark data sets clearly validate the usefulness of compositional metric in yielding effective distance metric for multi-label classification."
Reflections on key methodological decisions in national burden of disease assessments,Summary measures of population health are increasingly used in different public health reporting systems for setting priorities for health care and social service delivery and planning.
Multidimensional van der Corput-Type Estimates Involving Mittag-Leffler Functions,"The paper is devoted to study multidimensional van der Corput-type estimates for the intergrals involving Mittag-Leffler functions. The generalisation is that we replace the exponential function with the Mittag-Lefflertype function, to study multidimensional oscillatory integrals appearing in the analysis of time-fractional evolution equations. More specifically, we study two types of integrals with functions Eα,β (iλφ(x)), x ∈ RN and Eα,β (iαλφ(x)), x ∈ RN for the various range of α and β. Several generalisations of the van der Corput-type estimates are proved. As an application of the above results, the Cauchy problem for the multidimensional time-fractional Klein-Gordon and time-fractional Schrödinger equations are considered."
Fractional Nonlinear Stochastic Heat Equation with Variable Thermal Conductivity,"We consider a nonlinear stochastic heat equation with Riesz spacefractional derivative and variable thermal conductivity, on infinite domain. First we approximate the original problem by regularizing the Riesz spacefractional derivative. Then we prove that the approximate problem has almost surely a unique solution within a Colombeau generalized stochastic process space. In our solving procedure we use the theory of Colombeau generalized uniformly continuous semigroups of operators. At the end, we study the relation of the original and the approximate problem and prove that, under certain conditions, the derivative operators appearing in these two problems are associated. Even more, we prove that under some additional conditions, solutions of the original and the approximate problem are almost certainly associated as well (assuming that the first one almost surely exists)."
Determination of Time-Dependent Sources and Parameters of Nonlocal Diffusion and Wave Equations from Final Data,"Two inverse problems with final overdetermination for diffusion and wave equations containing the Caputo fractional time derivative and a fractional Laplacian of distributed order are considered. They are: 1) the problem to reconstruct a time-dependent source term; 2) the problem to recover simultaneously the source term, the order of the time derivative and the fractional Laplacian. Uniqueness of solutions of these problems is proved. Sufficient conditions for the uniqueness are stricter for the 2nd problem than for the 1st problem."
Derivative NMR Spectroscopy for J-Coupled Multiplet Resonances using Short Time Signals (0.5KB) Encoded at Low Magnetic Field Strengths (1.5T). Part II: Water Unsuppressed,"The topic of this work is on reliable resolving of J-coupled resonances in spectral envelopes from proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These resonances appear as multiplets that none of the conventional nonderivative shape estimators can disentangle. However, the recently formulated nonconventional shape estimator, the derivative fast Padé transform (dFPT), has a chance to meet this challenge. In the preceding article with a polyethylene phantom, using the time signals encoded with water suppressed, the nonparametric dFPT was shown to be able to split apart the compound resonances that contain the known J-coupled multiplets. In the present work, we address the same proton NMR theme, but with sharply different initial conditions from encodings. The goal within the nonparametric dFPT is again to accurately resolve the J-coupled resonances with the same polyethylene phantom, but using raw time signals encoded without water suppression. The parallel work on the same problem employing two startlingly unequal time signals, encoded with and without water suppression in the preceding and the current articles, respectively, can offer an answer to a question of utmost practical significance. How much does water suppression during encoding time signals actually perturb the resonances near and farther away from the dominant water peak? This is why it is important to apply the same dFPT estimator to the time signals encoded without water suppression to complement the findings with water suppression. A notable practical side of this inquiry is in challenging the common wisdom, which invariably takes for granted that it is absolutely necessary to subtract water from the encoded time signals in order to extract meaningful information by way of NMR spectroscopy."
Risk arbitrage and hedging to acceptability under transaction costs,"The classical discrete-time model of proportional transaction costs relies on the assumption that a feasible portfolio process has solvent increments at each step. We extend this setting in two directions, allowing convex transaction costs and assuming that increments of the portfolio process belong to the sum of a solvency set and a family of multivariate acceptable positions, e.g. with respect to a dynamic risk measure. We describe the sets of superhedging prices, formulate several no (risk) arbitrage conditions and explore connections between them. In the special case when multivariate positions are converted into a single fixed asset, our framework turns into the no-good-deals setting. However, in general, the possibilities of assessing the risk with respect to any asset or a basket of assets lead to a decrease of superhedging prices and the no-arbitrage conditions become stronger. The mathematical techniques rely on results for unbounded and possibly non-closed random sets in Euclidean space."
Automated Isoform Diversity Detector (AIDD): a pipeline for investigating transcriptome diversity of RNA-seq data,"As the number of RNA-seq datasets that become available to explore transcriptome diversity increases, so does the need for easy-to-use comprehensive computational workflows. Many available tools facilitate analyses of one of the two major mechanisms of transcriptome diversity, namely, differential expression of isoforms due to alternative splicing, while the second major mechanism—RNA editing due to post-transcriptional changes of individual nucleotides—remains under-appreciated. Both these mechanisms play an essential role in physiological and diseases processes, including cancer and neurological disorders. However, elucidation of RNA editing events at transcriptome-wide level requires increasingly complex computational tools, in turn resulting in a steep entrance barrier for labs who are interested in high-throughput variant calling applications on a large scale but lack the manpower and/or computational expertise."
Convex hulls in hamming space enable efficient search for similarity and clustering of genomic sequences,"In molecular epidemiology, comparison of intra-host viral variants among infected persons is frequently used for tracing transmissions in human population and detecting viral infection outbreaks. Application of Ultra-Deep Sequencing (UDS) immensely increases the sensitivity of transmission detection but brings considerable computational challenges when comparing all pairs of sequences. We developed a new population comparison method based on convex hulls in hamming space. We applied this method to a large set of UDS samples obtained from unrelated cases infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and compared its performance with three previously published methods."
Community influence as an explanatory factor why Roma children get little schooling,"Parents who experience poverty and who want to provide their children with an escape route can be expected to encourage and support their progeny’s education. The evidence that Roma parents behave differently is unsettling. In this paper we test empirically an explanation for that behavior. The explanation is based on a theory (Stark et al. 2018) that can be “borrowed” to rationalize the enforcement of norms of little formal education in underprivileged communities. An analysis of survey data collected in Roma communities in four Central and Eastern European countries lends support to the explanation. The analysis reveals a strong negative correlation between the influence of the Roma community on an individual member’s life and the importance accorded by the individual to formal schooling for children. The correlation is robust to controlling for standard determinants of attitudes towards schooling, such as poverty, unemployment, labor market discrimination, and parents’ educational attainment. The analysis suggests that policy interventions aiming to increase the formal education of Roma children need to reckon with the influence of Roma community norms on individual choices."
Corrigendum to a Paper by Charak and Laine,"This is a corrigendum to our paper, “On a class of prime entire functions”, published in Acta Math. Sin., Engl. Ser., 25, 1647–1652 (2009)."
Inference for Spatial Autoregressive Models with Infinite Variance Noises,"A self-weighted quantile procedure is proposed to study the inference for a spatial unilateral autoregressive model with independent and identically distributed innovations belonging to the domain of attraction of a stable law with index of stability α, α ∈ (0, 2]. It is shown that when the model is stationary, the self-weighted quantile estimate of the parameter has a closed form and converges to a normal limiting distribution, which avoids the difficulty of Roknossadati and Zarepour (2010) in deriving their limiting distribution for an M-estimate. On the contrary, we show that when the model is not stationary, the proposed estimates have the same limiting distributions as those of Roknossadati and Zarepour. Furthermore, a Wald test statistic is proposed to consider the test for a linear restriction on the parameter, and it is shown that under a local alternative, the Wald statistic has a non-central chisquared distribution. Simulations and a real data example are also reported to assess the performance of the proposed method."
Factors influencing the occurrence of fall armyworm parasitoids in Zambia,"Invasive alien species have environmental, economic and social impacts, disproportionally threatening livelihood and food security of smallholder farmers in low- and medium-income countries. Fall armyworm (FAW) (Spodoptera frugiperda), an invasive insect pest from the Americas, causes considerable losses on maize to smallholder farmers in Africa since 2016. The increased use of pesticides to control FAW in Africa raises concerns for health and environmental risks resulting in a growing interest in research on biological control options for smallholder farmers. In order to evaluate the occurrence of local natural enemies attacking FAW, we collected on a weekly basis FAW eggs and larvae during a maize crop cycle in the rainy season of 2018–2019 at four locations in the Lusaka and Central provinces in Zambia. A total of 4373 larvae and 162 egg masses were collected. For each location and date of collection, crop stage, the number of plants checked and amount of damage were recorded to analyse which factors best explain the occurrence of the natural enemy species on maize. Overall parasitism rates from local natural enemies at each location varied between 8.45% and 33.11%. We identified 12 different egg-larval, larval and larval-pupal parasitoid species. Location, maize growth stage, pest density and larval stage significantly affected parasitoid species occurrence. Our findings indicate that there is potential for increasing local populations of natural enemies of FAW through conservation biological control programmes and develop safe and practical control methods for smallholder farmers."
Compact Objects and Black Holes,"The Nobel Prize in Physics 2020 has been divided, one half awarded to Roger Penrose for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity, and the other half jointly to Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy. Here, we describe their work and put it in historical context and discuss specific advances that have been rewarded."
Use of Information Technologies for the Integration of an Enterprise Quality Management System with the Requirements of the Related Standards,"The modern production of quality products is based on advanced technologies, modern equipment, qualified personnel, and careful control of processes and products. These are necessary but not sufficient conditions. The competitiveness of an enterprise is largely determined by an effective quality management system (QMS) and the organization of production and management. The problem of combining the capabilities of all control systems of the enterprise is challenging. The existing integrated management systems require optimization, which is impossible without modern information technologies. The specific features of the integration of QMS with the related standards using machine learning methods are considered."
Development of a Binder System for the Powder Injection Molding of Titanium: Foreign and Russian Experience. Part 1,"The basic requirements imposed on the composition of a mixture of polymer components are justified, and a method for optimizing the composition of the binder system used in casting shaped metal-powder parts is considered."
Effect of Plasma Treatment of a Carbon Tape before the Deposition of a Metallic Coating onto It,"The adhesion of a metallic coating to a carbon tape after its treatment with cold plasma under various conditions is experimentally studied, and the optimum conditions are selected. Plasma treatment is found to increase the adhesion strength estimated by adhesive tape testing by several times. A metallic coating is deposited onto a carbon tape after plasma treatment by magnetron sputtering. A carbon tape with a metallic coating is used to fabricate carbon-fiber reinforced plastics (CFRPs) with an epoxy binder, and the plastics are molded using vacuum infusion. A metallic coating made of stainless steel on a carbon tape is found to increase the interlayer shear strength of CFRPs by 40%; a titanium coating, by 30%; and a copper coating, by 13%."
Mathematical Model for the Electric and Temperature Fields in the Heat-Affected Zone during Electrocontact Welding,"The mechanism of formation of softened zones during electrocontact welding is considered. A calculation method is proposed, and the influence of the main electrocontact welding parameters on the surface and subsurface softened zone sizes and the decrease in the hardness of the metal in these zones is investigated."
Fluxes for the Slag Melting of Metallic Radioactive Wastes to Return Fissionable Materials to a Nuclear Fuel Cycle,"The possibility of flux fabrication for processing metallurgical radioactive wastes by melting the components into a slag agglomerate aimed at returning fissionable materials to a nuclear fuel cycle is shown. The proposed compositions contain no components used in nonferrous and ferrous metallurgy, namely, silica, fluorides, and boron compounds. Fluxes based on the systems Al2O3–MnO, Al2O3–MnO–Na2O, Al2O3–MnO–CaO, and Al2O3–MgO–CaO–Fe2O3 are synthesized by cold crucible induction melting. Their thermochemical properties and phase compositions are studied."
Laser Alloying of the Surface Layers of Aluminum Alloys for Improving Their Wear Resistance,"The possibility of increasing the wear resistance of components made from AL25 and D16 aluminum alloys via surface alloying of the functional surfaces of the components is considered theoretically and experimentally. The mass transfer within the surface laser alloying (SLA) zone is a complex process due to the following three simultaneously occurring phenomena: the diffusion, thermocapillary convection, and incorporation of coating particle conglomerates into the melt zone during the fast evaporation of their surface layers in the field of power laser radiation. Various experimental schemes are selected using a theoretical analysis. Qualitative, quantitative, and physical studies of the process are performed. Recommendations for the selection of laser treatment conditions are given. The role of the alloying powder particle size is analyzed."
Decreasing the Specific Amount of Metal in the Working Equipment of Road Machines Using of Polymer Composite Materials with a Honeycomb Filler,"The problems of manufacturing the working equipment of road machines from polymer composite materials (PCMs) are considered. The design of a bulldozer blade made of carbon-filled plastic with a honeycomb filler is proposed. The use of PCM with a honeycomb filler in its design is shown to decrease the specific amount of metal per product and to provide adaptation of the working bodies to various categories of developed soils, which significantly increases the productivity of machines. A list and range of changing the adaptable blade parameters, which affect the resistance of the soil to digging and dragging, are given."
Effect of the Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation Time of an ML10 Alloy in a Silicate–Phosphate Electrolyte on the Structure and Properties of the Coating,"The results of a comparative analysis of the structure and properties of the plasma electrolytic coating formed in a silicate–phosphate electrolyte with the time varied from 10 to 60 min are considered. The structure of the protective nonmetallic inorganic coating is studied by scanning electron microscopy, and structural changes are revealed and compared. The change in the chemical composition with the oxidation time is examined, and the distribution of chemical elements over the coating depth is established. The layered state of the coating fabricated by plasma electrolytic oxidation is confirmed. The changes in the protective properties of the coatings are evaluated."
Thermal Conductivity of the Materials Based on Silicon Carbide and Silicon Nitride,"The temperature dependences of the thermal conductivity of silicon carbide- and silicon nitride-based materials prepared by various methods are presented. The thermal conductivity of silicon carbide–based materials prepared by reaction (SiSiC) and liquid-phase (LPSSiC) sintering and silicon nitride-based materials prepared by liquid phase sintering (SSN) is studied. The dependences of the thermal conductivity on the density, porosity, and content of oxide addition (for the LPSSiC and SSN materials) are presented."
A sustainable urban regeneration project to protect biodiversity,"The sustainable urban redevelopment project to protect biodiversity was developed to regenerate the external spaces of an ancient rural farmhouse, Villa Framarino, in the regional Natural Park of Lama Balice, a shallow erosive furrow (lama) rich in biodiversity, between two suburbs of the city of Bari (Apulia, Italy) and close to the city airport. This work includes a complex system of activities aimed not only at a spatial revaluation, necessary to relaunch the urban image, but it is accompanied by interventions of a cultural, social, economic, environmental and landscape nature, aimed at increasing the quality of life, in compliance with the principles of sustainability and social participation. One of the means to revitalize a territory subject to redevelopment is the planning of events and activities of socio-cultural value that involve the population to revive the sense of belonging to the territory and the community and at the same time to protect the biodiversity of the urban park of the protected natural area."

Kinematic Properties of Young Intermediate- and Low-Mass Stars from the Gaia DR2 Catalogue,"We have studied the kinematic properties of young pre-main-sequence stars. We have selected these stars based on data from the Gaia DR2 catalogue by invoking a number of photometric infrared surveys. Using 4564 stars with parallax errors less than 20%, we have found the following parameters of the angular velocity of Galactic rotation: \({{\Omega }_{0}} = 28.84 \pm 0.10\) km s–1 kpc–1, \(\Omega _{0}^{'} = - 4.063 \pm 0.029\) km s–1 kpc–2, and \(\Omega _{0}^{{''}} = 0.766 \pm 0.020\) km s–1 kpc–3, where the Oort constants are \(A = 16.25 \pm 0.33\) km s–1 kpc–1 and \(B = - 12.58 \pm 0.34\) km s–1 kpc–1. The circular rotation velocity of the solar neighborhood around the Galactic center is \({{V}_{0}} = 230.7 \pm 4.4\) km s–1 for the adopted Galactocentric distance of the Sun \({{R}_{0}} = 8.0 \pm 0.15\) kpc. The residual velocity dispersion for the stars considered is shown to be low, suggesting that they are extremely young. The residual velocity dispersion averaged over three coordinates is ~11 km s–1 for Herbig Ae/Be stars and ~7 km s–1 for T Tauri stars."
Lunar-Based Measurements of the Moon’s Physical Libration: Methods and Accuracy Estimates,"Computer simulation results are reported for planned lunar-based observations to be conducted using an automated zenith telescope that can be placed at any lunar latitude. Benefits of lunar-based observations are shown, in comparison with lunar laser ranging. It is investigated whether, and how effectively, these observations can be used to determine the lunar rotation parameters (physical libration). The accuracy requirements for these observations are analyzed in view of the accuracy requirements for determining the lunar rotation parameters. The necessary number of telescopes, as well as their optimal locations, is assessed."
The κ-Cygnid Meteor Shower and Its Relationship with Near-Earth Asteroids,"This study is focused on the relationships between the κ-Cygnid meteor shower and different groups of asteroids crossing the Earth’s orbit (the so-called near-Earth objects (NEOs)). The analysis is based on the visible structure of the meteor shower and a comprehensive strategy for estimating the proximity of orbits of two bodies. The κ-Cygnid meteor shower (abbreviated as KCG) is observed from August 3 to August 25 every year; it is classified as a minor shower, and the size of its mean orbit is around 3.2 AU, while the geocentric velocity is 20.9 km/s. No parent body (PB) of the shower has been found among comets so far. Relationships between the shower and asteroids, as potential PBs of the shower, are under active examination; some hypotheses on this subject can be found on the website of the Meteor Data Center (MDC) of the International Astronomical Union (IAU)."
Solution of Kepler’s Equation with Machine Precision,An algorithm for the numerical solution of Kepler’s equation with machine precision is presented. The convergence of the iterative sequence of Newton’s method is proved for the indicated initial approximation. The problem of finding a numerical solution to Kepler’s equation as a floating point number is formulated. Aspects related to computations near machine zero are taken into account. We analyzed the accuracy of the possible result. A problem is identified that arises when tending for the highest possible accuracy and a solution is proposed. An estimate is given of the computer time required to solve Kepler’s equation by this method.
Strong Shock in the Uniformly Expanding Universe with a Spherical Void,"Propagation of a strong shock wave in the expanding universe is studied using approximate analytic and exact numerical solution of self-similar equations. Both solutions have similar properties, which change qualitatively, depending on the adiabatic powers γ. In the interval \(1 < \gamma < {{\gamma }_{{{\text{cr}}}}} \sim 1.16\) analytic and numeric solutions fill all the space without any voids and they are rather close to each other. At larger \(\gamma > {{\gamma }_{{{\text{cr}}}}}\) a pressure becomes zero at finite radius, and a spherical void appears around the origin in both solutions. All matter is collected in thin layer behind the shock wave front. The structure of this layer qualitatively depends on γ. At the inner edge of the layer the pressure is always zero, but the density at this edge is jumping from zero to infinity at \(\gamma \approx 1.4\) in both solutions."
Changing Looks of the Nucleus of Seyfert Galaxy NGC 3516 during 2016–2020,"The results of spectral observations of NGC 3516 with the 2-m telescope of the Shamakhy Astrophysical Observatory during 2016–2019 are presented. In the first half of 2016, the intensive broad component H\(\beta \) was found, which indicates a spectral type change compared to 2014, when the broad component was almost invisible. In the second half of 2016, the broad component H\(\beta \) again was weakened and was practically not observed, remaining weak until the end of 2019. At the end of 2019, the broad component H\(\beta \) strengthened again, and in May 2020 reached a typical level for the high state of the object. During 2016–2020 we observed several changing looks of NGC 3516."
The Change of Period and Obliquity Angle of Pulsar under Braking of Magnetic Dipolar Radiation and Magnetic Decay,"The change of pulsar period and inclination angle under the braking of magnetic radiation and magnetic decay is studied. The system of equations for evolution of period and inclination angle with time is given and solved. The solution shows that the period increases, and the inclination angle decreases with time under the braking of magnetic radiation and decay. The numerical results for the change of period and inclination angle of PSRB0525+21 are given. The conclusions are drawn."
On the Influence of Angular Momentum and Dynamical Friction on Structure Formation,"In this paper we extended the spherical collapse model to take account of angular momentum and dynamical friction and studied how the accreted mass, the threshold of collapse, the virial overdensity, and the mass function change. Solving the equation of motion we got the relationships between mass, M, and the turn-around radius, \({{R}_{0}}\). This relation is important because knowing \({{R}_{0}}\) one can obtain the mass accreted by the structure. We see that moving from the simple spherical collapse to that accounting for angular momentum and dynamical friction leads to the increase of acquired mass. Then, we showed how angular momentum, and dynamical friction change the threshold of collapse with mass, and also with redshift for different dark energy models. We repeated the calculation for the virial overdensity, and the mass function, founding noteworthy differences with the case of the simple spherical collapse."
The Relic Neutrino Composition as Seen from Earth,"Being generated, the relic neutrino background contained equal fractions of electron \({{\nu }_{e}}\), muon \({{\nu }_{\mu }}\), and taon \({{\nu }_{\tau }}\) neutrinos. We show that the gravitational field of our Galaxy and other nearby cosmic objects changes this composition near the Solar System. As a result, the relic background becomes enriched with taon and particularly muon neutrinos. The electron relic neutrinos are the rarest for a terrestrial observer."
2S and 3S State Masses and decay constants of heavy-flavour mesons in a non-relativistic QCD potential model with three-loop effects in V-scheme,"We make an analysis of three -loop effects of the strong coupling constant in the study of masses and decay constants of the heavy-flavour pseudo-scalar mesons (PSM) D, \(D_s\) , B, \(B_s,\) \(B_c\), \(\eta _c\) and \(\eta _b\) in a non-relativistic QCD potential model using Dalgarno’s perturbation theory (DPT). The first order mesonic wavefunction is obtained using Dalgarno’s perturbation theory. The three-loop effects of strong coupling constant are included in the wave function in co-ordinate space and then used to examine the static and dynamic properties of the heavy-flavour mesons for 2S and 3S higher states. The results are compared with the other models available and are found to be compatible with available experimental values. In V-scheme, the three-loop effects on masses and decay constants of heavy-flavour mesons show a significant result."
Labellum and gynostemium micromorphology in Polystachya (Orchidaceae),"Polystachya is a large, pantropical orchid genus of 200 species, most of which occur as epiphytes in sub-saharan Africa. The three-lobed labellum of most Polystachya species possesses a fleshy callus and various types of trichomes and papillae. In this paper, we present the results of micromorphological studies on the labellum of 20 species, representing eight of the 13 sections in the genus, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our results show the scale of infrageneric diversity of trichomes and papillae relative to the sampled sections. They also demonstrate the taxonomic value of labellar micromorphology at the sectional level. The study revealed seven types of papillae and five types of trichomes (uni- and multi-cellular) in Polystachya, some of which, are described here for the first time. Clavate trichomes are the most common and are present in 60% of the species studied. Moniliform trichomes mainly occur in sect. Polystachya and are strongly characteristic of the section. Pseudopollen is formed by fragmentation of moniliform trichomes or the detachment of other trichomes as bicellular units. We provide, for the first time, evidence for the detachment of the terminal cells of capitate trichomes."
Convex hulls in hamming space enable efficient search for similarity and clustering of genomic sequences,"In molecular epidemiology, comparison of intra-host viral variants among infected persons is frequently used for tracing transmissions in human population and detecting viral infection outbreaks. Application of Ultra-Deep Sequencing (UDS) immensely increases the sensitivity of transmission detection but brings considerable computational challenges when comparing all pairs of sequences. We developed a new population comparison method based on convex hulls in hamming space. We applied this method to a large set of UDS samples obtained from unrelated cases infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and compared its performance with three previously published methods."
Automated Isoform Diversity Detector (AIDD): a pipeline for investigating transcriptome diversity of RNA-seq data,"As the number of RNA-seq datasets that become available to explore transcriptome diversity increases, so does the need for easy-to-use comprehensive computational workflows. Many available tools facilitate analyses of one of the two major mechanisms of transcriptome diversity, namely, differential expression of isoforms due to alternative splicing, while the second major mechanism—RNA editing due to post-transcriptional changes of individual nucleotides—remains under-appreciated. Both these mechanisms play an essential role in physiological and diseases processes, including cancer and neurological disorders. However, elucidation of RNA editing events at transcriptome-wide level requires increasingly complex computational tools, in turn resulting in a steep entrance barrier for labs who are interested in high-throughput variant calling applications on a large scale but lack the manpower and/or computational expertise."
"Effects of 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone on Lipid Isoprenoid and Rho Protein Levels in Brains of Aged C57BL/6 Mice","Synaptic impairment may be the main cause of cognitive dysfunction in brain aging that is probably due to a reduction in synaptic contact between the axonal buttons and dendritic spines. Rho proteins including the small GTPase Rac1 have become key regulators of neuronal morphogenesis that supports synaptic plasticity. Small Rho- and Ras-GTPases are post-translationally modified by the isoprenoids geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), respectively. For all GTPases, anchoring in the plasma membrane is essential for their activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Rac1-specific GEFs include the protein T lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (Tiam1). Tiam1 interacts with the TrkB receptor to mediate the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced activation of Rac1, resulting in cytoskeletal rearrangement and changes in cellular morphology. The flavonoid 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) acts as a highly affine-selective TrkB receptor agonist and causes the dimerization and autophosphorylation of the TrkB receptor and thus the activation of downstream signaling pathways. In the current study, we investigated the effects of 7,8-DHF on cerebral lipid isoprenoid and Rho protein levels in male C57BL/6 mice aged 3 and 23 months. Aged mice were daily treated with 100 mg/kg b.w. 7,8-DHF by oral gavage for 21 days. FPP, GGPP, and cholesterol levels were determined in brain tissue. In the same tissue, the protein content of Tiam1 and TrkB in was measured. The cellular localization of the small Rho-GTPase Rac1 and small Rab-GTPase Rab3A was studied in total brain homogenates and membrane preparations. We report the novel finding that 7,8-DHF restored levels of the Rho proteins Rac1 and Rab3A in membrane preparations isolated from brains of treated aged mice. The selective TrkB agonist 7,8-DHF did not affect BDNF and TrkB levels, but restored Tiam1 levels that were found to be reduced in brains of aged mice. FPP, GGPP, and cholesterol levels were significantly elevated in brains of aged mice but not changed by 7,8-DHF treatment. Hence, 7,8-DHF may be useful as pharmacological tool to treat age-related cognitive dysfunction although the underlying mechanisms need to be elucidated in detail."
"Graphene Oxide: Structure, Properties, Synthesis, and Reduction (A Review)","We review state-of-the-art progress in the field of graphene oxide, a material that has a wide range of applications due to its unique properties, for example, the dielectric properties of graphene oxide can be used in memristors, the use of different degrees of reduction allows creating multipolar electrodes of lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors, various oxygen-containing functional groups contained on the surface of graphene oxide can be a substrate for the formation of transition metal nanoparticles and the creation of photocatalysts or chemical and biological sensors based on such a composite, graphene oxide membranes are capable of selective separation of gases and metal ions.

Community influence as an explanatory factor why Roma children get little schooling,"Parents who experience poverty and who want to provide their children with an escape route can be expected to encourage and support their progeny’s education. The evidence that Roma parents behave differently is unsettling. In this paper we test empirically an explanation for that behavior. The explanation is based on a theory (Stark et al. 2018) that can be “borrowed” to rationalize the enforcement of norms of little formal education in underprivileged communities. An analysis of survey data collected in Roma communities in four Central and Eastern European countries lends support to the explanation. The analysis reveals a strong negative correlation between the influence of the Roma community on an individual member’s life and the importance accorded by the individual to formal schooling for children. The correlation is robust to controlling for standard determinants of attitudes towards schooling, such as poverty, unemployment, labor market discrimination, and parents’ educational attainment. The analysis suggests that policy interventions aiming to increase the formal education of Roma children need to reckon with the influence of Roma community norms on individual choices."

Improving the Reliability of the Corrosion Protection of Steel Products with Zinc Coatings by Nitriding,"A method is proposed to improve the service properties of the zinc coatings on steels formed by cold galvanizing in order to increase their reliability and durability. As a result of annealing a zinc coating in an ammonia medium, the formation of a hardened modified layer due to diffusion processes in both a steel substrate and a zinc coating is experimentally established. The structure of the hardened layer provides an increase in the wear resistance of the nitrided zinc coating and an increase in the adhesion of the coating to the substrate. The corrosion resistance of the nitrided zinc coatings in various media, namely, a saline solution, a weakly acidic medium, seawater, and salt fog, is shown to increase due to a combination of cathodic and barrier protection mechanisms."

Active Control of the Inside Diameter of Diesel Engine Cylinder Liners during Their Honing,"The changes in the inside diameter of liners during honing without active control means and with their use are studied. The inner surface of the liner is shown to wear out to a greater extent in its upper part. The causes of wear are indicated. The most common method for restoring a liner is mechanical treatment of the inner surface to an increased size. After boring to an oversize, honing process is shown to be applied. The pneumatic active control system used for honing is described. The method of evaluating the accuracy of the liner processing using the active control system is described. The inner surfaces of the liners processed with and without the active control means are measured. The use of the active control system during honing found to decrease the reject of exceeding the inner size tolerance of the cylinder liner from 45 to 1–2%. The active control system for honing cylinder liners is concluded to increase the processing efficiency by 15% due to the absence of measurement time with stopping processing and to decrease the reject in the inner surface size of the liners to 40%."
Effect of Plasma Treatment of a Carbon Tape before the Deposition of a Metallic Coating onto It,"The adhesion of a metallic coating to a carbon tape after its treatment with cold plasma under various conditions is experimentally studied, and the optimum conditions are selected.

Improve titanate reduction by electro-deoxidation of Ca3Ti2O7 precursor in molten CaCl2,"The low O2− diffusion rate in the electro-deoxidation of titanium containing compounds by either the OS process or the FFC process leads to a low reaction speed and a low current efficiency. In this study, Ca3Ti2O7 was used as a precursor to improve the reduction speed of titanium. Because of the greater number of “diffusion channels” created in cathode as Ca2+ liberates from Ca3Ti2O7 precursor in the electro-deoxidation process, the O2− diffusion rate was improved significantly by using Ca3Ti2O7 instead of CaTiO3 as precursor. Parallel constant voltage electrolysis (3.2 V) confirms that Ca3Ti2O7 and CaTiO3 are reduced simultaneously because of their similar crystal structures. However, the reduction area of Ca3Ti2O7 spreads much faster than that of CaTiO3, indicating a difference in the O2− diffusion rate. Constant voltage cyclic voltammetry (CV) and theoretical analysis of the crystal structure were also conducted to compare the differences between Ca3Ti2O7 and CaTiO3. The results indicate that using a precursor with a greater number of soluble cations, titanium reduction speed can be greatly improved in the electro-deoxidation process. Finally, a new electrolysis method for converting and recycling excess CaO from the Ca3Ti2O7 precursor was proposed."
Electrochemical preparation of the Fe-Ni36 Invar alloy from a mixed oxides precursor in molten carbonates,"The Fe-Ni36 alloy was prepared via the one-step electrolysis of a mixed oxides precursor in a molten Na2CO3-K2CO3 eutectic melt at 750°C, where porous Fe2O3-NiO pellets served as the cathode and the Ni10Cu11Fe alloy was an inert anode. During the electrolysis, NiO was preferentially electro-reduced to Ni, then Fe2O3 was reduced and simultaneously alloyed with nickel to form the Fe-Ni36 alloy. Different cell voltages were applied to optimize the electrolytic conditions, and a relatively low energy consumption of 2.48 kWhkg−1 for production of FeNi36 alloy was achieved under 1.9 V with a high current efficiency of 94.6%. The particle size of the alloy was found to be much smaller than that of the individual metal. This process provides a low-carbon technology for preparing the Fe-Ni36 alloy via molten carbonates electrolysis."

Epidemiology of Blastocystis infection from 1990 to 2019 in China,"Blastocystis is ubiquitous presence in animals and humans worldwide and has a high level genetic diversity.

RAD50 deficiency is a predictor of platinum sensitivity in sporadic epithelial ovarian cancers,"Intrinsic or acquired resistance seriously limits the use of platinating agents in advanced epithelial ovarian cancers. Increased DNA repair capacity is a key route to platinum resistance. RAD50 is a critical component of the MRN complex, a ‘first responder’ to DNA damage and essential for the repair of DSBs and stalled replication forks. We hypothesised a role for RAD50 in ovarian cancer pathogenesis and therapeutics. Clinicopathological significance of RAD50 expression was evaluated in clinical cohorts of ovarian cancer at the protein level (n = 331) and at the transcriptomic level (n = 1259). Sub-cellular localization of RAD50 at baseline and following cisplatin therapy was tested in platinum resistant (A2780cis, PEO4) and sensitive (A2780, PEO1) ovarian cancer cells. RAD50 was depleted and cisplatin sensitivity was investigated in A2780cis and PEO4 cells. RAD50 deficiency was associated with better progression free survival (PFS) at the protein (p = 0.006) and transcriptomic level (p < 0.001). Basal level of RAD50 was higher in platinum resistant cells. Following cisplatin treatment, increased nuclear localization of RAD50 was evident in A2780cis and PEO4 compared to A2780 and PEO1 cells. RAD50 depletion using siRNAs in A2780cis and PEO4 cells increased cisplatin cytotoxicity, which was associated with accumulation of DSBs, S-phase cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis. We provide evidence that RAD50 deficiency is a predictor of platinum sensitivity. RAD50 expression-based stratification and personalization could be viable clinical strategy in ovarian cancers."
Parathyroid hormone increases alveolar bone homoeostasis during orthodontic tooth movement in rats with periodontitis via crosstalk between STAT3 and β-catenin,"Periodontitis patients are at risk of alveolar bone loss during orthodontic treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate whether intermittent parathyroid hormone (1–34) treatment (iPTH) could reduce alveolar bone loss during orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) in individuals with periodontitis and the underlying mechanism. A rat model of OTM in the context of periodontitis was established and alveolar bone loss was observed. The control, iPTH and iPTH + stattic groups received injections of vehicle, PTH and vehicle, or PTH and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitor stattic, respectively. iPTH prevented alveolar bone loss by enhancing osteogenesis and suppressing bone resorption in the alveolar bone during OTM in rats with periodontitis. This effect of iPTH was along with STAT3 activation and reduced by a local injection of stattic. iPTH promoted osteoblastic differentiation and might further regulate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in a STAT3-dependent manner. The findings of this study suggest that iPTH might reduce alveolar bone loss during OTM in rats with periodontitis through STAT3/β-catenin crosstalk."
Surface treatment on cobalt and titanium alloys using picosecond laser pulses in burst mode,"The authors report on the results of surface treatment experiments using a solid-state amplified laser source emitting laser pulses with a pulse duration of 10 ps. The laser source allows the generation of pulse trains (bursts) with an intra-burst pulse repetition rate of 80 MHz (pulse-to-pulse time interval about 12.5 ns) with up to eight pulses per burst. In this study a wavelength of 1064 nm was used to investigate both ablation of material and laser-induced surface modifications occuring in metallic implant alloys CoCrMo (cobalt-chromium-molybdenum) and TiAlV (titanium-aluminum-vanadium) in dependence of the number of pulses and fluences per pulse in the burst. By using the burst mode, a smoothing effect occurs in a certain parameter range, resulting in very low surface roughness of the generated microstructures. It is demonstrated that at fluences per pulse which are smaller than the material-specific ablation threshold, a self-organized pore formation takes place if a defined number of pulses per burst is used. Thus, the advantage of the MHz burst mode in terms of a possible surface modification is established."
A sustainable urban regeneration project to protect biodiversity,"The sustainable urban redevelopment project to protect biodiversity was developed to regenerate the external spaces of an ancient rural farmhouse, Villa Framarino, in the regional Natural Park of Lama Balice, a shallow erosive furrow (lama) rich in biodiversity, between two suburbs of the city of Bari (Apulia, Italy) and close to the city airport. This work includes a complex system of activities aimed not only at a spatial revaluation, necessary to relaunch the urban image, but it is accompanied by interventions of a cultural, social, economic, environmental and landscape nature, aimed at increasing the quality of life, in compliance with the principles of sustainability and social participation. One of the means to revitalize a territory subject to redevelopment is the planning of events and activities of socio-cultural value that involve the population to revive the sense of belonging to the territory and the community and at the same time to protect the biodiversity of the urban park of the protected natural area."
High-value utilization of CO2 to synthesize sulfur-doped carbon nanofibers with excellent capacitive performance,"Carbon nanofiber (CNF) is considered a promising material due to its excellent physical and chemical properties. This paper proposes a novel way to transform CO2 into heteroatom-doped CNFs, with the introduction of Fe, Co, and Ni as catalysts. When the electrolyte containing NiO, Co2O3, and Fe2O3 was employed, sulfur-doped CNFs in various diameters were obtained. With the introduction of Fe catalyst, the obtained sulfur-doped CNFs showed the smallest and tightest diameter distributions. The obtained sulfur-doped CNFs had high gravimetric capacitance (achieved by SDG-Fe) that could reach 348.5 F/g at 0.5 A/g, excellent cycling stability, and good rate performance. For comparison purposes, both Fe and nickel cathodes were tested, where the active metal atom at their surface could act as catalyst. In these two situations, sulfur-doped graphite sheet and sulfur-doped graphite quasi-sphere were the main products."
"Electrochemical behavior and underpotential deposition of Sm on reactive electrodes (Al, Ni, Cu and Zn) in a LiCl-KCl melt","Sm extraction from a LiCl-KCl melt was carried out by forming alloys on various electrodes, including Al, Ni, Cu, and liquid Zn, and the electrochemical behaviors of the resultant metal products were investigated using different electrochemical techniques. While Sm metal deposition via the conventional two-step reaction process was not noted on the inert electrode, underpotential deposition was observed on the reactive electrodes because of the latter’s depolarization effect. The depolarization effects of the reactive electrodes on Sm showed the order Zn > Al > Ni > Cu. Sm-M (M = Al, Ni, Cu, Zn) alloys were deposited by galvanostatic and potentiostatic electrolysis. The products were fully characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and the stability of the obtained M-rich compounds was determined. Finally, the relationship between the electrode potential and type of Sm-M intermetallic compounds formed was assessed on the basis of the observed electrochemical properties and electrodeposits."
Improve titanate reduction by electro-deoxidation of Ca3Ti2O7 precursor in molten CaCl2,"The low O2− diffusion rate in the electro-deoxidation of titanium containing compounds by either the OS process or the FFC process leads to a low reaction speed and a low current efficiency. In this study, Ca3Ti2O7 was used as a precursor to improve the reduction speed of titanium. Because of the greater number of “diffusion channels” created in cathode as Ca2+ liberates from Ca3Ti2O7 precursor in the electro-deoxidation process, the O2− diffusion rate was improved significantly by using Ca3Ti2O7 instead of CaTiO3 as precursor. Parallel constant voltage electrolysis (3.2 V) confirms that Ca3Ti2O7 and CaTiO3 are reduced simultaneously because of their similar crystal structures. However, the reduction area of Ca3Ti2O7 spreads much faster than that of CaTiO3, indicating a difference in the O2− diffusion rate. Constant voltage cyclic voltammetry (CV) and theoretical analysis of the crystal structure were also conducted to compare the differences between Ca3Ti2O7 and CaTiO3. The results indicate that using a precursor with a greater number of soluble cations, titanium reduction speed can be greatly improved in the electro-deoxidation process. Finally, a new electrolysis method for converting and recycling excess CaO from the Ca3Ti2O7 precursor was proposed."
Electrochemical preparation of the Fe-Ni36 Invar alloy from a mixed oxides precursor in molten carbonates,"The Fe-Ni36 alloy was prepared via the one-step electrolysis of a mixed oxides precursor in a molten Na2CO3-K2CO3 eutectic melt at 750°C, where porous Fe2O3-NiO pellets served as the cathode and the Ni10Cu11Fe alloy was an inert anode. During the electrolysis, NiO was preferentially electro-reduced to Ni, then Fe2O3 was reduced and simultaneously alloyed with nickel to form the Fe-Ni36 alloy. Different cell voltages were applied to optimize the electrolytic conditions, and a relatively low energy consumption of 2.48 kWhkg−1 for production of FeNi36 alloy was achieved under 1.9 V with a high current efficiency of 94.6%. The particle size of the alloy was found to be much smaller than that of the individual metal. This process provides a low-carbon technology for preparing the Fe-Ni36 alloy via molten carbonates electrolysis."
Nanosheet-stacked flake graphite for high-performance Al storage in inorganic molten AlCl3–NaCl salt,"Aluminum storage systems with graphite cathode have been greatly promoting the development of state-of-the-art rechargeable aluminum batteries over the last five years; this is due to the ultra-stable cycling, high capacity, and good safety of the systems. This study discussed the change of electrochemical behaviors caused by the structural difference between flake graphite and expandable graphite, the effects of temperature on the electrochemical performance of graphite in low-cost AlCl3–NaCl inorganic molten salt, and the reaction mechanisms of aluminum complex ions in both graphite materials by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements. It was found that flake graphite stacked with noticeably small and thin graphene nanosheets exhibited high capacity and fairly good rate capability. The battery could achieve a high capacity of ∼219 mA hg−1 over 1200 cycles at a high current density of 5 Ag−1, with Coulombic efficiency of 94.1%. Moreover, the reaction mechanisms are clarified: For the flake graphite with small and thin graphene nanosheets and high mesopore structures, the reaction mechanism consisted of not only the intercalation of \({\rm{AlCl}}_4^ - \) anions between graphene layers but also the adsorption of \({\rm{AlCl}}_4^ - \) anions within mesopores; however, for the well-stacked and highly parallel layered large-size expandable graphite, the reaction mechanism mainly involved the intercalation of \({\rm{AlCl}}_4^ - \) anions."
The fate of calcium in temperate forest soils: a Ca K-edge XANES study,"Calcium (Ca) plays a crucial role for plant nutrition, soil aggregation, and soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization. Turnover and ecological functions of Ca in soils depend on soil Ca speciation. For the first time, we used synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy at the Ca K-edge (4038 eV) to investigate Ca speciation in soils. We present Ca K-edge XANES spectra of standard compounds with relevance in soils (e.g. calcite, dolomite, hydroxyapatite, anorthite, clay mineral-adsorbed Ca; Ca oxalate, formate, acetate, citrate, pectate, phytate). Calcium XANES spectra with good signal-to-noise ratios were acquired in fluorescence mode for Ca concentrations between 1 and 10 mg g−1. Most standard spectra differed markedly among each other, allowing the identification of different Ca species in soils and other environmental samples as well as Ca speciation by linear combination fitting. Calcium XANES spectra obtained for samples from different horizons of twelve temperate forest soils revealed a change from dominating lithogenic Ca to clay mineral-bound and/or organically bound Ca with advancing pedogenesis. O layer Ca was almost exclusively organically bound. With increasing SOM decomposition, shares of oxalate-bound Ca decreased. Oxalate-bound Ca was absent in calcareous, but not in silicate subsoil horizons, which can be explained by microbial decomposition in the former vs. stabilization by association to pedogenic minerals in the latter soils. Synchrotron-based Ca XANES spectroscopy is a promising novel tool to investigate the fate of Ca during pedogenesis and—when performed with high spatial resolution (µ-XANES), to study aggregation and SOM stabilization mechanisms produced by Ca."
A Role for Conscious Accessibility in Skilled Action,"Skilled sportsmen or musicians—more generally, skilled agents—often fill us with awe with the way they perform their actions. One question we may ask ourselves is whether they intended to perform some awe-inspiring aspects of their actions. This question becomes all the more pressing as it often turns out that these agents were not conscious of some of those aspects at the time of performance. As I shall argue, there are reasons for suspecting lack of conscious access to an aspect of one’s action to be incompatible with intending to perform that aspect of one’s action. Subsequently, though, I will also argue that, in some cases, the incompatibility is only prima facie, and can be dispelled by drawing the following distinction: that between aspects of one’s action that are merely temporarily not consciously accessed, versus aspects of one’s action that are permanently inaccessible to consciousness. I will thus remove an obstacle towards saying that skilled agents intended to perform certain aspects of their actions, despite lack of conscious access to those aspects at the time of performance."
Hydrogel particles improve detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from multiple sample types,"Here we present a rapid and versatile method for capturing and concentrating SARS-CoV-2 from contrived transport medium and saliva samples using affinity-capture magnetic hydrogel particles. We demonstrate that the method concentrates virus from 1 mL samples prior to RNA extraction, substantially improving detection of virus using real-time RT-PCR across a range of viral titers (100–1,000,000 viral copies/mL) and enabling detection of virus using the 2019 nCoV CDC EUA Kit down to 100 viral copies/mL. This method is compatible with commercially available nucleic acid extraction kits (i.e., from Qiagen) and a simple heat and detergent method that extracts viral RNA directly off the particle, allowing a sample processing time of 10 min. We furthermore tested our method in transport medium diagnostic remnant samples that previously had been tested for SARS-CoV-2, showing that our method not only correctly identified all positive samples but also substantially improved detection of the virus in low viral load samples. The average improvement in cycle threshold value across all viral titers tested was 3.1. Finally, we illustrate that our method could potentially be used to enable pooled testing, as we observed considerable improvement in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from sample volumes of up to 10 mL."
State-specific projection of COVID-19 infection in the United States and evaluation of three major control measures,"Most models of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States do not consider geographic variation and spatial interaction. In this research, we developed a travel-network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical compartmental model system that characterizes infections by state and incorporates inflows and outflows of interstate travelers. Modeling reveals that curbing interstate travel when the disease is already widespread will make little difference. Meanwhile, increased testing capacity (facilitating early identification of infected people and quick isolation) and strict social-distancing and self-quarantine rules are most effective in abating the outbreak. The modeling has also produced state-specific information. For example, for New York and Michigan, isolation of persons exposed to the virus needs to be imposed within 2 days to prevent a broad outbreak, whereas for other states this period can be 3.6 days. This model could be used to determine resources needed before safely lifting state policies on social distancing."
Fluid dynamics of COVID-19 airborne infection suggests urgent data for a scientific design of social distancing,"The COVID-19 pandemic is largely caused by airborne transmission, a phenomenon that rapidly gained the attention of the scientific community. Social distancing is of paramount importance to limit the spread of the disease, but to design social distancing rules on a scientific basis the process of dispersal of virus-containing respiratory droplets must be understood. Here, we demonstrate that available knowledge is largely inadequate to make predictions on the reach of infectious droplets emitted during a cough and on their infectious potential. We follow the position and evaporation of thousands of respiratory droplets by massive state-of-the-art numerical simulations of the airflow caused by a typical cough. We find that different initial distributions of droplet size taken from literature and different ambient relative humidity lead to opposite conclusions: (1) most versus none of the viral content settles in the first 1–2 m; (2) viruses are carried entirely on dry nuclei versus on liquid droplets; (3) small droplets travel less than \(2.5\,{\mathrm{m}}\) versus more than \(7.5\,{\mathrm{m}}\). We point to two key issues that need to be addressed urgently in order to provide a scientific foundation to social distancing rules: (I1) a careful characterisation of the initial distribution of droplet sizes; (I2) the infectious potential of viruses carried on dry nuclei versus liquid droplets."
Labellum and gynostemium micromorphology in Polystachya (Orchidaceae),"Polystachya is a large, pantropical orchid genus of 200 species, most of which occur as epiphytes in sub-saharan Africa. The three-lobed labellum of most Polystachya species possesses a fleshy callus and various types of trichomes and papillae. In this paper, we present the results of micromorphological studies on the labellum of 20 species, representing eight of the 13 sections in the genus, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our results show the scale of infrageneric diversity of trichomes and papillae relative to the sampled sections. They also demonstrate the taxonomic value of labellar micromorphology at the sectional level. The study revealed seven types of papillae and five types of trichomes (uni- and multi-cellular) in Polystachya, some of which, are described here for the first time. Clavate trichomes are the most common and are present in 60% of the species studied. Moniliform trichomes mainly occur in sect. Polystachya and are strongly characteristic of the section. Pseudopollen is formed by fragmentation of moniliform trichomes or the detachment of other trichomes as bicellular units. We provide, for the first time, evidence for the detachment of the terminal cells of capitate trichomes."
Combination of anti-PD-1 antibody with P-GEMOX as a potentially effective immunochemotherapy for advanced natural killer/T cell lymphoma,"Advanced natural killer/T cell lymphoma (NKTL) has demonstrated poor prognosis with currently available therapies. Here, we report the efficacy of anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibody with the P-GEMOX (pegaspargase, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin) regimen in advanced NKTL. Nine patients underwent six 21-day cycles of anti-PD-1 antibody (day 1), pegaspargase 2000 U/m2 (day 1), gemcitabine 1 g/m2 (days 1 and 8) and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 (day 1), followed by anti-PD-1 antibody maintenance every 3 weeks. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and genetic alterations were determined in paraffin-embedded pretreatment tissue samples using immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. Responses were assessed using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Eight patients exhibited significant responses, comprising of seven complete remissions and one partial remission (overall response rate: 88.9%). After a median follow-up of 10.6 months, 6/9 patients (66.7%) remained in complete remission. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were anemia (33.3%), neutropenia (33.3%), and thrombocytopenia (33.3%); all of which were manageable and resolved. Immunochemotherapy produced a high response rate in patients with positive PD-L1 expression (5/6, 83.3%). NGS analysis suggested that STAT3/JAK3/PD-L1 alterations and ARID1A mutation were associated with immunochemotherapy efficacy. Mutation in DDX3X and alteration in epigenetic modifiers of KMT2D, TET2, and BCORL1 might indicate a poor response to immunochemotherapy. In conclusion, the anti-PD-1 antibody plus P-GEMOX regimen demonstrated promising efficacy in advanced NKTL. PD-L1 expression combined with specific genetic alterations could be used as potential biomarkers to predict therapeutic responses to immunochemotherapy."
Grain boundary segregation and relaxation in nano-grained polycrystalline alloys,"The present study carries out systematic thermodynamics analysis of Grain Boundary (GB) segregation and relaxation in Nano-Grained (NG) polycrystalline alloys. GB segregation and relaxation is an internal process towards thermodynamic equilibrium, which occurs naturally in NG alloys without any applied loads, causes deformation and generates internal stresses. The analysis comprehensively investigates the multiple coupling effects among chemical concentrations and mechanical stresses in GBs and grains. A hybrid approach of eigenstress and eigenstrain is developed herein to solve the multiple coupling problem. The analysis results indicate that the GB stress and grain stress induced by GB segregation and relaxation can be extremely high in NG alloys, reaching the GPa level, which play an important role in the thermal stability of NG alloys, especially via the coupling terms between stress and concentration. The present theoretic analysis proposes a novel criterion of thermal stability for NG alloys, which is determined by the difference in molar free energy between a NG alloy and its reference single crystal with the same nominal chemical composition. If the difference at a temperature is negative or zero, the NG alloy is thermal stable at that temperature, otherwise unstable."
Mammographic density as an image-based biomarker of therapy response in neoadjuvant-treated breast cancer patients,"Personalized cancer treatment requires predictive biomarkers, including image-based biomarkers. Breast cancer (BC) patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) are in a clinically vulnerable situation with the tumor present. This study investigated whether mammographic density (MD), assessed pre-NACT, is predictive of pathological complete response (pCR)."
Multi-utility representations of incomplete preferences induced by set-valued risk measures,"We establish a variety of numerical representations of preference relations induced by set-valued risk measures. Because of the general incompleteness of such preferences, we have to deal with multi-utility representations. We look for representations that are both parsimonious (the family of representing functionals is indexed by a tractable set of parameters) and well behaved (the representing functionals satisfy nice regularity properties with respect to the structure of the underlying space of alternatives). The key to our results is a general dual representation of set-valued risk measures that unifies the existing dual representations in the literature and highlights their link with duality results for scalar risk measures."
Nonlinear expectations of random sets,"Sublinear functionals of random variables are known as sublinear expectations; they are convex homogeneous functionals on infinite-dimensional linear spaces. We extend this concept for set-valued functionals defined on measurable set-valued functions (which form a nonlinear space) or, equivalently, on random closed sets. This calls for a separate study of sublinear and superlinear expectations, since a change of sign does not alter the direction of the inclusion in the set-valued setting."
On a multi-asset version of the Kusuoka limit theorem of option superreplication under transaction costs,"We consider, using the geometric description, a sequence of models of multi-asset financial markets with proportional transaction costs vanishing in the limit. We assume that the price processes are He-type multinomial approximations of a process whose components are correlated geometric Brownian motions. For a given vector-valued contingent claim, defined as a continuous function of the price trajectories, we consider for each model the hedging set, that is, the set of all vector-valued initial endowments permitting to superreplicate the contingent claim by the final position of a self-financing portfolio. We calculate the limit of the hedging sets in the closed topology, obtaining in this way a set-valued version of the Kusuoka limit theorem."
Elicitability and identifiability of set-valued measures of systemic risk,"Identification and scoring functions are statistical tools to assess the calibration of risk measure estimates and to compare their performance with other estimates, e.g. in backtesting. A risk measure is called identifiable (elicitable) if it admits a strict identification function (strictly consistent scoring function). We consider measures of systemic risk introduced in Feinstein et al. (SIAM J. Financial Math. 8:672–708, 2017). Since these are set-valued, we work within the theoretical framework of Fissler et al. (preprint, available online at arXiv:1910.07912v2, 2020) for forecast evaluation of set-valued functionals. We construct oriented selective identification functions, which induce a mixture representation of (strictly) consistent scoring functions. Their applicability is demonstrated with a comprehensive simulation study."
Ferumoxytol-enhanced MR imaging for differentiating intrapancreatic splenules from other tumors,Ferumoxytol is an ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) agent that is taken up by splenic tissue. This study describes our initial institutional experience of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI (feMRI) for differentiating intrapancreatic splenules (IPS) from other pancreatic lesions.
Semi-supervised learning for somatic variant calling and peptide identification in personalized cancer immunotherapy,"Personalized cancer vaccines are emerging as one of the most promising approaches to immunotherapy of advanced cancers. However, only a small proportion of the neoepitopes generated by somatic DNA mutations in cancer cells lead to tumor rejection. Since it is impractical to experimentally assess all candidate neoepitopes prior to vaccination, developing accurate methods for predicting tumor-rejection mediating neoepitopes (TRMNs) is critical for enabling routine clinical use of cancer vaccines."
Analysis of associations between emotions and activities of drug users and their addiction recovery tendencies from social media posts using structural equation modeling,"Addiction to drugs and alcohol constitutes one of the significant factors underlying the decline in life expectancy in the US. Several context-specific reasons influence drug use and recovery. In particular emotional distress, physical pain, relationships, and self-development efforts are known to be some of the factors associated with addiction recovery. Unfortunately, many of these factors are not directly observable and quantifying, and assessing their impact can be difficult. Based on social media posts of users engaged in substance use and recovery on the forum Reddit, we employed two psycholinguistic tools, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count and Empath and activities of substance users on various Reddit sub-forums to analyze behavior underlining addiction recovery and relapse. We then employed a statistical analysis technique called structural equation modeling to assess the effects of these latent factors on recovery and relapse."
Schreibcoaching und Schreibberatung – der Versuch einer Abgrenzung,"Klickt man sich durch die Websiten von Kolleg*innen „aus der Schreibszene“, findet man viele unterschiedliche Namen für deren Angebote: Schreibtraining, Schreibwerkstätten, Schreibworkshops, Schreibberatung, Schreibcoaching … Dabei wirkt es so, also ob sich Schreibtraining, Schreibwerkstätten und Schreibworkshops eher auf die Arbeit mit Gruppen  beziehen, während Schreibberatung und Schreibcoaching für Einzelsettings gebräuchlicher zu sein scheinen. Der Unterschied bzw. die Ähnlichkeit von Schreibcoaching und Schreibberatung bleibt dabei oftmals unklar, was nicht zuletzt bei den Ratsuchenden (aber auch bei den Anbieter*innen selbst) für Verwirrung sorgen kann."

German Culex pipiens biotype molestus and Culex torrentium are vector-competent for Usutu virus,"Usutu virus (USUV) is a rapidly spreading zoonotic arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus) and a considerable threat to the global avifauna and in isolated cases to human health. It is maintained in an enzootic cycle involving ornithophilic mosquitoes as vectors and birds as reservoir hosts. Despite massive die-offs in wild bird populations and the detection of severe neurological symptoms in infected humans, little is known about which mosquito species are involved in the propagation of USUV."
Endocarditis due to Staphylococcus lugdunensis—a retrospective national registry–based study,"We present characteristics of infective endocarditis (IE) caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis and compare with IE caused by Staphylococcus aureus and other CoNS, in the National Swedish Registry of IE (2008–2018). Thirty episodes of S. lugdunensis IE were registered, of which 21 cases affected native valves, and 7 patients were subjected to surgery. The mortality rate at 30 days was significantly higher for S. lugdunensis IE (20%, n = 6), than for IE caused by other CoNS (7%) or S. aureus (9%) p = 0.016. Septic embolisation was only reported in two cases (7%). The most common treatment was isoxazolyl penicillin (n = 18)."
Neighbor Sum Distinguishing Total Choice Number of Planar Graphs without 6-cycles,"Pilsniak and Woźniak put forward the concept of neighbor sum distinguishing (NSD) total coloring and conjectured that any graph with maximum degree Δ admits an NSD total (Δ + 3)-coloring in 2015. In 2016, Qu et al. showed that the list version of the conjecture holds for any planar graph with Δ ≥ 13. In this paper, we prove that any planar graph with Δ Δ 7 but without 6-cycles satisfies the list version of the conjecture."
Free SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein S1 Particles May Play a Role in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 Infection,"The imbalance of the renin-angiotensin system is currently considered as a potentially important factor of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease. It has been shown previously in the murine model, that the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface is downregulated in response to the infection by SARS-CoV virus or recombinant spike protein (S protein) alone. In the case of natural infection, circulation of the S protein in a soluble form is unlikely. However, in SARS-CoV-2, a large fraction of S protein trimers is pre-processed during virion morphogenesis due to the presence of furin protease cleavage site between the S1 and S2 subunits. Therefore, S protein transition into the fusion conformation may be accompanied by the separation of the S1 subunits carrying the receptor-binding domains from the membrane-bound S2 subunits. The fate of the S1 particles shed due to the spontaneous “firing” of some S protein trimers exposed on the virions and on the surface of infected cells has been never investigated. We hypothesize that the soluble S1 subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein shed from the infected cells and from the virions in vivo may bind to the ACE2 and downregulate cell surface expression of this protein. The decrease in the ACE2 activity on the background of constant or increased ACE activity in the lungs may lead to the prevalence of angiotensin II effects over those of angiotensin (1-7), thus promoting thrombosis, inflammation, and pulmonary damage. This hypothesis also suggests the association between less pronounced shedding of the S1 particles reported for the S protein carrying the D614G mutation (vs. the wild type D614 protein), and lack of increased severity of the COVID-19 infection caused by the mutant (D614G) SARS-CoV-2 strain, despite its higher infectivity and higher in vivo viral load."
Structural Features of Mononuclear Monooxo-Tantalum(V) Complexes (A Review),"Structural features of 16 mononuclear monooxotantalum complexes have been considered. In eleven compounds (I–XI), the Та(V) atoms have different coordination polyhedra with CNTa from four and seven: a tetrahedron, octahedron, pentagonal bipyramid, and monocapped trigonal prism. Five TaO compounds (XII–XVI) contain pentahapto-bonded η5-С5Ме5 (η5-Ср*) and η5-С5Н4SiМе3 ligands. In complexes II–X, double bonded O(oxo) ligands are trans to О(Ln) or N(Ln) atoms."
Thermodynamics of the Oxygen Solutions in Carbon-Containing Ni–Co Melts,"A thermodynamic analysis of the oxygen solutions in the carbon-containing Ni–Co melts is performed. The equilibrium constants of the reaction of carbon with oxygen, the activity coefficients at infinite dilution, and interaction parameters for melts differing in composition are determined at 1873 K. The dependences of the oxygen solubility in the nickel–cobalt melts on the cobalt and carbon contents are calculated. The contents of carbon monoxide (CO) and dioxide (CO2) in the gas phase over the melts are calculated."
"Structure, Phase Composition, and Mechanical Properties of a Boron-Containing High-Nitrogen Austenitic Steel Made by Induction Melting","The structure and the mechanical properties of a cast high-nitrogen austenitic steel are studied after hot and cold deformation. The as-cast steel contains the FeCrB and BN phases. During hot deformation, the B13N13C74 phase forms. This phase has a layered structure and is easily deformed during hot or cold rolling. The existence of the B13N13C74 phase only slightly changes the strength and the ductility, but it substantially decreases the impact toughness of the steel as compared to that of similar boron-free Cr–Mn–Ni high-nitrogen austenitic steels."
Possibilities for the Integration of Quality Management Tools and Methods with Digital Technologies,"Quality management was born along with the development of the production of various products. The appearance in the twentieth century of serial and mass production in mechanical engineering, metallurgy and other industries required the development of specialized tools based on statistical methods—control charts, charts, histograms, etc. Specialized methods and tools of quality management appeared—FMEA, QFD, TPM, Kaizen, etc. The quality management methodology developed—TQM, lean manufacturing, 6 sigma, quality management systems. Currently, there is a large-scale digitalization of all types of activities, including quality management. Possible ways of development of existing and creation of new means and methods of quality management using digital technologies are shown."
Effect of the Main Parameters of Transverse Rolling Straightening by Smooth Plates on the Quality of Cylindrical Parts,"The quality of low-rigidity cylindrical parts after straightening by transverse rolling with smooth plates is considered. To simulate the straightening process, the ANSYS Workbench software package is used. The calculation results demonstrate that the quality of cylindrical parts after straightening depends mainly on the relative reduction."
State of Stress in the Near-Contact Region of a Semiconductor during Metallization Track Electrodegradation,"Heating of a thin metal film on a semiconductor surface and the corresponding state of stress of the near-contact region are considered. The stress estimation procedure in case of the local pulsed heating of a metallized region on the semiconductor surface is described. The theoretical and experimental sizes of the deformed silicon substrate region are compared with each other. An experiment is carried out using rectangular current pulses. The stress–strain region, which depends on the electric pulse duration and amplitude, is estimated. Experimental evidence shows a strong heterogeneity of the metallization track after pulse passage."
Nature of Purely Stellar Rings in Lenticular Galaxies,"The origin of several rings in lenticular galaxies with no signs of ongoing or recent star formation (without emission lines and a signal in the ultraviolet spectral range) is investigated. Stellar population parameters—the average age and the magnesium–iron ratio—are measured; structural features are analyzed. It is concluded that the rings in all the galaxies have a different history of formation and a different nature; i.e., for only two of the four rings does the resonance origin associated with the dynamics of the central triaxial structure (bar) seem preferable."
Physical Libration of the Moon: An Extended Problem,"The work is devoted to the study of the physical libration of the Moon. Interest in the traditional topic related to the rotation of the Moon is stirred up by the activity of many countries regarding the development of circumlunar space. Scientifically, the main agenda is to consider the viscosity of the core. At this stage of the theory development, such effects as indirect and direct perturbations from the planets were considered, the 4th order harmonic was included in the gravitational potential of the Moon, and the mean tidal potential was also considered. The inclusion of the described effects in the equations of the Moon’s rotation led to a significant improvement in the solution when compared with the corresponding data from the DE421 theory, although the residual differences still remain greater than the 1 ms accuracy required by the theory. The influence of the direct effect from the planets was milliseconds. The influence of the 4th harmonic manifested itself as a systematic shift of the order of 0.85\('' \) in the residual differences in libration in longitude. Considering the tide made it possible to reduce the residual differences in latitude by almost an order of magnitude. In this case, the main factor that reduces the residual differences is changes in the second-order Stokes coefficients. The calculations were carried out using the DE421 ephemeris built at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory."
Enantioselective C(sp3)–C(sp3) cross-coupling of non-activated alkyl electrophiles via nickel hydride catalysis,"Cross-coupling of two alkyl fragments is an efficient method to produce organic molecules rich in sp3-hybridized carbon centres, which are attractive candidate compounds in drug discovery. Enantioselective C(sp3)–C(sp3) coupling is challenging, especially of alkyl electrophiles without an activating group (aryl, vinyl, carbonyl). Here, we report a strategy based on nickel hydride addition to internal olefins followed by nickel-catalysed alkyl–alkyl coupling. This strategy enables the enantioselective cross-coupling of non-activated alkyl halides with alkenyl boronates to produce chiral alkyl boronates. Employing readily available and stable olefins as pro-chiral nucleophiles, the coupling proceeds under mild conditions and exhibits broad scope and high functional-group tolerance. Applications for the functionalization of natural products and drug molecules, as well as the synthesis of chiral building blocks and a key intermediate to (S)-(+)-pregabalin, are demonstrated."

"Diversity and sexual dimorphism in the head lateral line system in North Sea populations of threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus (Teleostei: Gasterosteidae)","The mechanosensory lateral line of fishes is a flow sensing system and supports a number of behaviors, e.g. prey detection, schooling or position holding in water currents. Differences in the neuromast pattern of this sensory system reflect adaptation to divergent ecological constraints. The threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, is known for its ecological plasticity resulting in three major ecotypes, a marine type, a migrating anadromous type and a resident freshwater type. We provide the first comparative study of the pattern of the head lateral line system of North Sea populations representing these three ecotypes including a brackish spawning population. We found no distinct difference in the pattern of the head lateral line system between the three ecotypes but significant differences in neuromast numbers. The anadromous and the brackish populations had distinctly less neuromasts than their freshwater and marine conspecifics. This difference in neuromast number between marine and anadromous threespine stickleback points to differences in swimming behavior. We also found sexual dimorphism in neuromast number with males having more neuromasts than females in the anadromous, brackish and the freshwater populations. But no such dimorphism occurred in the marine population. Our results suggest that the head lateral line of the three ecotypes is under divergent hydrodynamic constraints. Additionally, sexual dimorphism points to divergent niche partitioning of males and females in the anadromous and freshwater but not in the marine populations. Our findings imply careful sampling as an important prerequisite to discern especially between anadromous and marine threespine sticklebacks."
Mixed NNLO QCD×electroweak corrections of \( \mathcal{O} \)(Nfαsα) to single-W/Z production at the LHC,"First results on the radiative corrections of order \( \mathcal{O} \)(Nfαsα) are presented for the off-shell production of W or Z bosons at the LHC, where Nf is the number of fermion flavours. These corrections comprise all diagrams at \( \mathcal{O} \)(αsα) with closed fermion loops, form a gauge-invariant part of the next-to-next-to-leading-order corrections of mixed QCD×electroweak type, and are the ones that concern the issue of mass renormalization of the W and Z resonances. The occurring irreducible two-loop diagrams, which involve only self-energy insertions, are calculated with current standard techniques, and explicit analytical results on the electroweak gauge-boson self-energies at \( \mathcal{O} \)(αsα) are given. Moreover, the generalization of the complex-mass scheme for a gauge-invariant treatment of the W/Z resonances is described for the order \( \mathcal{O} \)(αsα). While the corrections, which are implemented in the Monte Carlo program Rady, are negligible for observables that are dominated by resonant W/Z bosons, they affect invariant-mass distributions at the level of up to 2% for invariant masses of ≳ 500 GeV and are, thus, phenomenologically relevant. The impact on transverse-momentum distributions is similar, taking into account that leading-order predictions to those distributions underestimate the spectrum."
Contribution of the Darwin operator to non-leptonic decays of heavy quarks,"We compute the Darwin operator contribution (\( 1/{m}_b^3 \) correction) to the width of the inclusive non-leptonic decay of a B meson (B+, Bd or Bs), stemming from the quark flavour-changing transition b → \( {q}_1{\overline{q}}_2{q}_3 \), where q1, q2 = u, c and q3 = d, s. The key ideas of the computation are the local expansion of the quark propagator in the external gluon field including terms with a covariant derivative of the gluon field strength tensor and the standard technique of the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE). We confirm the previously known expressions of the \( 1/{m}_b^3 \) contributions to the semi-leptonic decay b → \( {q}_1\mathrm{\ell}{\overline{\nu}}_{\mathrm{\ell}} \), with ℓ = e, μ, τ and of the \( 1/{m}_b^2 \) contributions to the non-leptonic modes. We find that this new term can give a sizeable correction of about −4 % to the non-leptonic decay width of a B meson. For Bd and Bs mesons this turns out to be the dominant correction to the free b-quark decay, while for the B+ meson the Darwin term gives the second most important correction — roughly 1/2 to 1/3 of the phase space enhanced Pauli interference contribution. Due to the tiny experimental uncertainties in lifetime measurements the incorporation of the Darwin term contribution is crucial for precision tests of the Standard Model."
Shedding new light on sterile neutrinos from XENON1T experiment,"The XENON1T collaboration recently reported the excess of events from recoil electrons, possibly giving an insight into new area beyond the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. We try to explain this excess by considering effective interactions between the sterile neutrinos and the SM particles. In this paper, we present an effective model based on one-particle-irreducible interaction vertices at low energies that are induced from the SM gauge symmetric four-fermion operators at high energies. The effective interaction strength is constrained by the SM precision measurements, astrophysical and cosmological observations. We introduce a novel effective electromagnetic interaction between sterile neutrinos and SM neutrinos, which can successfully explain the XENON1T event rate through inelastic scattering of the sterile neutrino dark matter from Xenon electrons. We find that sterile neutrinos with masses around 90 keV and specific effective coupling can fit well with the XENON1T data where the best fit points preserving DM constraints and possibly describe the anomalies in other experiments."
Rapid and complete inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by ultraviolet-C irradiation,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has devastated global public health systems and economies, with over 52 million people infected, millions of jobs and businesses lost, and more than 1 million deaths recorded to date. Contact with surfaces contaminated with droplets generated by infected persons through exhaling, talking, coughing and sneezing is a major driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, with the virus being able to survive on surfaces for extended periods of time. To interrupt these chains of transmission, there is an urgent need for devices that can be deployed to inactivate the virus on both recently and existing contaminated surfaces. Here, we describe the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in both wet and dry format using radiation generated by a commercially available Signify ultraviolet (UV)-C light source at 254 nm. We show that for contaminated surfaces, only seconds of exposure is required for complete inactivation, allowing for easy implementation in decontamination workflows."
Root-associated entomopathogenic fungi manipulate host plants to attract herbivorous insects,"Root-associated entomopathogenic fungi (R-AEF) indirectly influence herbivorous insect performance. However, host plant-R-AEF interactions and R-AEF as biological control agents have been studied independently and without much attention to the potential synergy between these functional traits. In this study, we evaluated behavioral responses of cabbage root flies [Delia radicum L. (Diptera: Anthomyiidae)] to a host plant (white cabbage cabbage Brassica oleracea var. capitata f. alba cv. Castello L.) with and without the R-AEF Metarhizium brunneum (Petch). We performed experiments on leaf reflectance, phytohormonal composition and host plant location behavior (behavioral processes that contribute to locating and selecting an adequate host plant in the environment). Compared to control host plants, R-AEF inoculation caused, on one hand, a decrease in reflectance of host plant leaves in the near-infrared portion of the radiometric spectrum and, on the other, an increase in the production of jasmonic, (+)-7-iso-jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine and salicylic acid in certain parts of the host plant. Under both greenhouse and field settings, landing and oviposition by cabbage root fly females were positively affected by R-AEF inoculation of host plants. The fungal-induced change in leaf reflectance may have altered visual cues used by the cabbage root flies in their host plant selection. This is the first study providing evidence for the hypothesis that R-AEF manipulate the suitability of their host plant to attract herbivorous insects."
Grand-potential based phase-field model for systems with interstitial sites,"Existing grand-potential based multicomponent phase-field model is extended to handle systems with interstitial sublattice. This is achieved by treating the concentration of alloying elements in site-fraction. Correspondingly, the chemical species are distinguished based on their lattice positions, and their mode of diffusion, interstitial or substitutional, is appropriately realised. An approach to incorporate quantitative driving-force, through parabolic approximation of CALPHAD data, is introduced. By modelling austenite decomposition in ternary Fe–C–Mn, albeit in a representative microstructure, the ability of the current formalism to handle phases with interstitial components, and to distinguish interstitial diffusion from substitutional in grand-potential framework is elucidated. Furthermore, phase transformation under paraequilibrium is modelled to demonstrate the limitation of adopting mole-fraction based formulation to treat multicomponent systems."
Wettability control of polymeric microstructures replicated from laser-patterned stamps,"In this study, two-step approaches to fabricate periodic microstructures on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrates are presented to control the wettability of polymeric surfaces. Micropillar arrays with periods between 1.6 and 4.6 µm are patterned by plate-to-plate hot embossing using chromium stamps structured by four-beam Direct Laser Interference Patterning (DLIP). By varying the laser parameters, the shape, spatial period, and structure height of the laser-induced topography on Cr stamps are controlled. After that, the wettability properties, namely the static, advancing/receding contact angles (CAs), and contact angle hysteresis were characterized on the patterned PET and PMMA surfaces. The results indicate that the micropillar arrays induced a hydrophobic state in both polymers with CAs up to 140° in the case of PET, without modifying the surface chemistry. However, the structured surfaces show high adhesion to water, as the droplets stick to the surfaces and do not roll down even upon turning the substrates upside down. To investigate the wetting state on the structured polymers, theoretical CAs predicted by Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter models for selected structured samples with different topographical characteristics are also calculated and compared with the experimental data."
A survey on composition operators on some function spaces,"We investigate some types of composition operators, linear and not, and conditions for some spaces to be mapped into themselves and for the operators to satisfy some good properties."
Annotation and extraction of age and temporally-related events from clinical histories,"Age and time information stored within the histories of clinical notes can provide valuable insights for assessing a patient’s disease risk, understanding disease progression, and studying therapeutic outcomes. However, details of age and temporally-specified clinical events are not well captured, consistently codified, and readily available to research databases for study."
Natural language processing (NLP) tools in extracting biomedical concepts from research articles: a case study on autism spectrum disorder,"Natural language processing (NLP) tools can facilitate the extraction of biomedical concepts from unstructured free texts, such as research articles or clinical notes. The NLP software tools CLAMP, cTAKES, and MetaMap are among the most widely used tools to extract biomedical concept entities. However, their performance in extracting disease-specific terminology from literature has not been compared extensively, especially for complex neuropsychiatric disorders with a diverse set of phenotypic and clinical manifestations."
"Cerebral oxygenation in 45-degree trendelenburg position for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a single-center, open, controlled pilot study","Within the last decade, robotically-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) has become the standard for treating localized prostate cancer, causing a revival of the 45° Trendelenburg position. In this pilot study we investigated effects of Trendelenburg position on hemodynamics and cerebral oxygenation in patients undergoing RALP."
"Towards a sustainable technology for production of extra-pure Ti metal: Electrolysis of sulfurized Ti(C,N) in molten CaCl2","A new concept for producing highly pure Ti metal powder from ilmenite (FeTiO3) is proposed in this article. Titanium nitride (TiN) or titanium oxycarbonitride (TiOxCyNz) could be synthesized in the first step via the simultaneous carbothermal reduction and nitridation (CTRN) of FeTiO3 to remove oxygen roughly. To separate oxygen completely, high-quality TiS2 samples were then synthesized from TiN and TiC using S2 gas, and the clean sulfides were finally reduced to α-Ti powders with spherical morphology using electrolysis in molten CaCl2. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in conjunction with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and elemental LECO analysis were used to study the phases and microstructures of the sulfides and the electrochemically reduced powders. The Ti powder showed no carbon contamination and consisted of high-purity foil-like Ti sheets with very low oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen contents of less than 0.15wt% O, 0.02wt% C, and 0.003wt% N, respectively. The quality of the Ti powder was much higher than that of the powder obtained using the conventional OS process (proposed by K. Ono and R.O. Suzuki) starting directly from the oxides."
Electrochemical properties of Ca–Pb electrode for calcium-based liquid metal batteries,"The Ca–Pb electrode couple is considered to be one of the least expensive (∼36 $/(kW h)) among various optional materials for liquid–metal batteries (LMBs). The electrochemical properties of Ca–Pb alloy in a Ca∣LiCl–NaCl–CaCl2∣Pb cell were investigated in this paper. The electrode potential maintained a linear relationship in the current density range of 50–200 mA cm-2, which indicates that the alloying and dealloying processes of Ca with Pb attained rapid charge transfer and mass transport in the interface between the liquid electrode and electrolyte. The Ca–Pb electrode exhibited remarkable properties with a high discharge voltage of 0.6 V, a small self-discharge current density (<2 mA cm-2 at 600°C), and a high coulombic efficiency (>98.84%). The postmortem analysis showed that intermetallics CaPb3 and CaPb were uniformly distributed in the electrode with different molar fractions of Ca, which indicates that the nucleation of solid intermetallics did not hinder the diffusion of Ca in the electrode. This investigation on Ca–Pb electrode sheds light on the further research and the design of electrodes for Ca-based LMBs."
Recovery and separation of Fe and Mn from simulated chlorinated vanadium slag by molten salt electrolysis,"Tailings from the vanadium extraction process are discarded each year as waste, which contain approximately 30wt% of Fe. In our previous work, we extracted Fe and Mn from vanadium slag, and Fe and Mn existed in the form of FeCl2 and MnCl2 after chlorination by NH4Cl to achieve effective and green usage of waste containing Fe and Mn. In this work, square wave voltammetry (SWV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were applied to investigate the electrochemical behaviors of Fe2+ and Mn2+ in NaCl-KCl melt at 800°C. The reduction processes of Fe2+ and Mn2+ were found to involve one step. The diffusion coefficients of FeCl2 and MnCl2 in molten salt of eutectic mixtures NaCl-KCl molten salt were measured. The electrodeposition of Fe and Mn were performed using two electrodes at a constant cell voltage. The Mn/Fe mass ratio of the electrodeposited product in NaCl-KCl-2.13wt%FeCl2-1.07wt%MnCl2 was 0.0625 at 2.3 V. After the electrolysis of NaCl-KCl-2.13wt%FeCl2-1.07wt%MnCl2 melted at 2.3 V, the electrolysis was again started under 3.0 V and the Mn/Fe mass ratio of the electrodeposited product was 36.4. This process provides a novel method to effectively separate Fe and Mn from simulated chlorinated vanadium slag."
A framework for monitoring multiple databases in industries using OPC UA,"Database management and monitoring is an inseparable part of any industry. A uniform scheme of monitoring relational databases without explicit user access to database servers is not much explored outside the database environment. In this paper, we present an information distribution scheme related to databases using Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) servers to clients when multiple databases are involved in a factory. The aim is for external, but relevant clients, to be able to monitor this information mesh independent of explicit access to user schemas. A methodology to dispense data from, as well as check changes in databases using SQL queries and events is outlined and implemented using OPC UA servers. The structure can be used as a remote viewing application for multiple databases in one address space of an OPC UA server."
The Idea of a Lax Pair—Part I,"Conserved quantities can help to understand and solve the equations of motion of various dynamical systems. Lax pairs are a useful tool to find conserved quantities of some dynamical systems. We give a motivated introduction to the idea of a Lax pair using examples such as the linear harmonic oscillator, Toda chain and Eulerian rigid body. A key step is to write the equations in ‘Lax form’, which makes it easy to read off conserved quantities. In Part II, these ideas will be extended from systems of particles to continuum systems of fields and also given a geometric interpretation in terms of curvature."
Chua’s Circuit,"The study of chaotic systems is one of the vital and novel areas of physics. Chaotic systems can be built in the laboratory with electronic components, and one such circuit was proposed by Leon O. Chua. Here, we demonstrate how to simulate Chua’s circuit with LTspice software and obtain different dynamical patterns by changing the resistance parameter in the circuit. All the essential characteristics of a chaotic system are observed in the LTspice simulations of Chua’s circuit in an easy, inexpensive manner, and this greatly helps students explore this new and exciting area of physics."
The Physical Meaning of Entropy—1,The article explains the physical significance of ‘entropy’ based on the definition of entropy in statistical thermodynamics. The effect of temperature on entropy will be discussed in the next article.
Neuropeptides: The Slower Neurotransmitters,"Neuropeptides, as the name suggests, are small peptides released by neurons that allow them to communicate with each other. These small peptides modulate the activity of neurons, in turn, allowing the modulation of multiple behaviors. Here, we describe how neuropeptides are made and go on to discuss how these peptides function in an organism. We also highlight the specific roles of neuropeptides in modulating the locomotory behavior of the free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans."
Discovery of Hepatitis C Virus,"The 2020 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to Harvey J. Alter of the National Institute of Health (NTH), Michael Houghton of the University of Alberta and, Charles M. Rice of Rockefeller University. The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute has awarded them the Nobel Prize for the discovery of Hepatitis C virus (HCV)."
Magic Vertex-Labeling of a Half-Cube,"A cube is sliced in half by a plane cut orthogonal to a diagonal. We want to label the ten vertices of the half-cube with digits 0 through 9 so that the sum of the labels around each triangle is a constant, and the sum of the labels around each pentagon is another constant. We count all such labels."
Nature of Science,"Since time immemorial, science has been evolving, playing an immense role from being a philosophy to a discipline and career. Its nature and categorization into many dimensions render it unique amongst all disciplines. Though the tenets, philosophy, and scientific methods of searching for the truth of the physical world make science stand apart within its realm, it encounters heaps of debates. The article focuses on the nature of science while navigating through its evolutionary journey until the present, and the way it emerged as a versatile enterprise holding hierarchical and diagonal relationships among its distinctions. Capturing the veiled philosophical and psychological realities in an exploratory fashion, the article thus tries to bring out the real nature of science concealed within the debates of science."
Schulsozialarbeit in der „neuen Normalität“,"Der mit der Covid-19 Pandemie verbundene Lockdown hat nahezu alle Bereiche des gesellschaftlichen Lebens vor große Herausforderungen gestellt. In Zeiten, in denen Schulen über Wochen hinweg geschlossen blieben, stellt sich in verschiedenen fachlichen und politischen Kontexten die Frage nach der Rolle der Schulsozialarbeit während des Lockdowns und in der „neuen Normalität“. Mit diesem Beitrag sollen verschiedene fachliche Überlegungen dazu angestellt werden, wie die Erfahrungen der Krise als Chance für eine stärkere Profilierung der Schulsozialarbeit genutzt werden können und sollten, und weshalb haushalterische Legitimationsdebatten an der Lebenswirklichkeit junger Menschen vorbeigehen."
Heating of the Hollow Cathodes of Vacuum Plasma Generators,The control characteristics of vacuum plasma generators are experimentally studied under glow discharge conditions with transition to the conditions of anomalous glow discharge and arc discharge. The use of a high-frequency current source in parallel to a dc source is shown to increase the ionic current and to decrease the time of starting conditions. A method for heating the bulk hollow cathodes of plasma generators is considered.
Technological Properties of Metallized Carbon Cloth,"The results of studying the properties of carbon cloth with a metallic coating and the related coal plastics prepared by a vacuum infusion technology are presented. It is experimentally found that the metallic coating affects the porosity of the cloth, decreasing it by 17% at a coating thickness of 30 nm. The deposition of the metallic coating on the carbon cloth weakly affects on the total impregnation time, decreasing it only by 3.6–4.1%. A comparative analysis of the two technologies by a standard method with the manual fabrication of a vacuum sack and using a test bench with an elastic membrane shows that the use of the test bench makes it possible to accelerate the impregnation process, to decrease the consumption of a binder, and to level the motion front of the binder."
Optimum Deoxidation of a Kh65NVFT Chromium–Nickel Alloy Containing Refractory Metals,"Various versions of deoxidation and optimization of melting a chromium–nickel Kh65NVFT alloy containing refractory metals under the conditions of AO Kompozit are analyzed. Thermodynamic calculations show that low oxygen concentrations in the Cr–32Ni–2W melts can be achieved by deoxidizing the metal with magnesium, hafnium, and zirconium in vacuum. It is experimentally confirmed that the deoxidation of such alloys makes it possible to achieve an oxygen concentration of 45 ± 5 ppm in the metal and to ensure the optimum morphology and concentration of oxide inclusions."
Effect of the Technological Heredity Factors on the Quality Indicators of Adhesive and Weld-Bonded Joints Performed under Various Temperature Conditions,The structures of technological processes for creating adhesive and weld-bonded joints at room and negative temperatures are considered. The factors leading to the formation of technological errors are analyzed. The causes of technological errors are considered and schemes for the transmission of inherited information are proposed. It is advisable to use deterministic systems to describe the laws of inheritance of technological errors during a technical process at room temperature and to use probabilistic systems to estimate the same factors at negative temperatures.
Effect of Chromium Carbide Introduced into a Flux Cored Wire Charge on the Structure and Properties of the Hardfacing Deposit,"The effect of chromium carbide introduced into the charge of a flux cored wire on the structure and properties of the hardfacing deposit is considered. Hardfacing is performed in a shielding gas atmosphere using a flux cored wire. The composition of the flux cored wire is selected so that the iron-based hardfacing deposit alloyed with the Cr–B–Nb–C system is achieved. In hardfacing, chromium carbide decomposes and alloys the hardfacing deposit with chromium and carbon; this leads to the formation of chromium carbides in the hardfacing deposit and to an increase in its hardness. On average, the presence of chromium carbide in the charge of a flux cored wire leads to an increase in the wear resistance of the hardfacing deposit."
Piercing of a Billet in a Mill with Guide Disks,"The piercing of billets in a helical rolling mill with guide disks is considered. The resulting sleeve sizes are shown to differ significantly from the sizes of the sleeves produced using other piercing schemes because of severe tangential deformation. As a result, the energy–force parameters of piercing are different and the results of their calculations according to the generally accepted empirical dependences are inadequate. The results of piercing simulation with the QFORM 3D software package are presented."
Use of Carbon Nanotubes for Modifying the Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Al–Mg Alloys,"A technology of metal modification with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is developed using electric arc surfacing. It involves the use of extruded metal rods containing CNTs as a deposited material. This technology is used to modify an AMg5 alloy. A comparison of the macro- and microstructures of the metal modified by the developed technology by adding CNTs and the corresponding unmodified metal does not reveal a significant difference. However, CNTs are detected in the modified metal using scanning electron microscopy, and microhardness analysis shows that the addition of CNTs increases the microhardness of the upper layers of the deposited metal."
Atomic Layer Deposition of the Lithium–Silicon–Tin Oxide System for Solid-State Thin-Film Lithium Batteries,Materials and methods for creating the elements of thin-film lithium-ion batteries (TFLBs) are considered.
Analytical Study of the Appearance of Heat Sources on the Surface of a Part during Electrospark Alloying,"The mechanism of heat source formation on electrodes during low-voltage electrospark alloying is theoretically studied. Analytical dependences of the released heat power on the electron ionization current and thermionic emission of a cathode are obtained. Approximately 66% of the heat power during electrospark alloying at low voltages in a spark discharge are found to release at an anode, and the contribution of thermionic emission is insignificant. An analytical method is used to determine the average ion concentration and its change in a spark channel. During theoretical considerations, the pressure at any time is assumed to be the same over the entire cross section of the channel."
Chemical Interactions of Red Mud during the Cleaning of an Industrial Gases Ejected to the Atmosphere from Harmful Impurities,"There are two serious chemical technological problems to be solved simultaneously with significant environmental and economic gain. The first problem is the necessity of complete processing of red mud. The second problem is a decrease in the amount of toxic gases ejected to the atmosphere from industrial enterprises. The importance of the solution of the first problem increased sharply after the large environmental catastrophe happened in Hungary in 2010. The risks of repeating a similar catastrophe increase because of natural cataclysms, which become more frequent. These problems can be solved by the application of multicomponent (in chemical composition) red mud, which can interact with toxic gaseous sulfur compounds and remove the latter from industrial waste gases. The results of laboratory studies are confirmed by industrial tests. The chemical and thermodynamic capacities of the material are revealed. The experimental proofs and the corresponding characteristics of the gas emissions from industrial heat and power plants and the steelmaking and agglomeration productions are presented."
Mathematical Model for Continuous Tube Rolling and the Effect of Technological Factors on Surface Defect Formation,The problems of computer simulation of the continuous tube rolling on FQM (fine quality mill) are formulated and solved to study the influence of technological factors on the shape change and the danger of metal fracture. The solution of the problems makes it possible to estimate the effect of the deviation of the rolling axes of the continuous mill and the extraction mill. The simulation results allowed us to formulate and propose technical solutions to minimize the probability of risk defect formation.
Increasing the Resistance of the Heat-Insulating Insert in the Air Tuyere of a Blast Furnace,"Air tuyeres account for 30% of all heat losses in a blast furnace. One way of lining an air tuyere from the side of the air passage is to use a heat-insulating insert. However, the temperature stresses arising in it can lead to its premature failure during operation. The following three versions for increasing the resistance of the insert without changing its geometric dimensions are considered: the use of a two-part insert, the use of a band on part of the insert, and the deposition of a slurry coating on the insert surface from the blast side. The simulation is performed in the Ansys Fluent 18.2 and Ansys Static Structural environments. The results obtained are experimentally confirmed."
Specific Features of Turning Parts Made of Polymer Materials,"The application of the turning of parts made of polymer materials is considered. The choice of materials for the cutting part of the tools, their geometric parameters, the purpose of technological conditions, and cutting forces are discussed with allowance for the properties of polymer materials that characterize their machinability. The differences between the machining of parts made of polymeric materials and the processing of metal products are revealed. The ways of expanding the technological capabilities of machining of polymeric materials are shown."
Estimation of the Results of Predictive Simulation of a Rational Cutting Material,Predictive computer simulation of the architecture of coatings on hard-alloy tool materials can be used to choose the most rational coatings for the given operating conditions of cutting tool. The simulation results should be analyzed at least by materials science methods. The results of such an analysis are presented.
Study of the Antiwear Properties of a Cutting Fluid during Metal Cutting,"The wear of cutting tool wear is considered for various types of cutting fluid, the dependence of the tool wear on the cutting path using various technological media is determined, the experimental results are analyzed, and recommendations on choosing a cutting fluid for cutting are given."
Some Features of the Sulfuric Acid Leaching of the Reduced Ferriferous Oxidized Nickel Ore,"The oxidized nickel ores from the Buruktal deposit (Orenburg oblast) contain significant sources of nickel (1 377 000 t). However, these ores are fairly poor in nickel (0.8–1.0%) and cobalt (0.04–0.07%) as compared to foreign deposits. The results of studying the possibility of nickel recovery by hydrometallurgical processing of ferriferous oxidized nickel (limonite) ore with weak solutions of sulfuric acid are presented. The studies are carried out for prereduced limonite ore. As a result of reduction, entire nickel and partially iron present in the initial ore are reduced to the metallic state to form an NiFe alloy. The influence of various factors on the degree of recovery of nickel into a solution and the acid consumption is studied."
Formation and Properties of Steel–Iron Aluminide Composites,"Iron and aluminum form a number of intermetallic phases, which have a quite high hardness and can be used for manufacturing parts of equipment operating under abrasive wear conditions. In addition, the advantage of applying iron–aluminum intermetallic alloys is a low cost and the lack of deficiency of the alloy components (aluminum, iron). However, all intermetallic compounds of this system have a high brittleness, and this fact restricts the region of applying the alloys based on iron–aluminum intermetallic phases. As an alternative to the parts made of the intermetallic alloys, steel–iron aluminide composites are proposed. The technology of manufacturing these composites is described. The studies performed in this work show that the proposed technology enables the formation of composite materials of adequate quality. The ultimate compressive strength of porous steel is ~145 MPa, and that of the composite material is higher than 435 MPa. The hardness of the intermetallic portions of the composite material is 385–400 HB, and the relative wear resistance of the composite material is ~6."
"Hardening of Titanium and Iron–Chrome–Nickel Alloy Samples to Increase Their Strength, Life, and Fatigue Properties",A mechanical technique used to determine the surface residual stresses and four techniques used to harden samples are described. The diagrams of surface residual stresss in titanium and iron–chrome–nickel alloy samples before and after hardening are built based on experimental data. All titanium and iron–chrome–nickel alloy samples are found to exhibit compressive surface stresses after hardening. The compressive residual stresses in the external layers of the product increase its fatigue strength to ≈20%.
TianQin Space-Based Gravitational Wave Detector: Key Technologies and Current State of Implementation,"TianQin is a project of a space-based gravitational wave detector for detecting GW events in the millihertz frequency range. The space-based detector must be implemented on three identical drag-free spacecraft orbiting around the Earth. The key technologies that form the principles of operation of the space-based GW detector are, first, an ultrastable transponder laser interferometer and, second, a system for compensating nongravitational disturbances. This work discusses the basic principles of operation and the current state of the key technologies developed in the PRC. At the current level of technological readiness, it is expected that TianQin will be launched in the second half of the next decade and will serve as a space observatory for a wide class of astrophysical sources of gravitational waves."
Migration of Hot Jupiters Induced by Atmosphere Outflow,"As is known, the influence of the ionizing radiation and the gravity of a star on a hot Jupiter results in the outflow of its atmosphere. Due to the gravity of the planet, the outflowing matter acquires angular momentum, after which it is accumulated on a higher circular orbit around the star and forms a disk or a torus. The angular momentum interexchange between the torus and the planet induces the migration of the planet to the star. In this paper, we consider the effectiveness of this migration mechanism by the example of the HD 209458 system. It turns out that, after 4.5 × 109 years since the evaporation of the protoplanetary disk, the planet might migrate from an orbit at ≳0.67 AU to its current orbit at 0.045 AU."
Multi-Brid DBI Inflation,"It is shown that it is possible to extend the application of \(\delta \mathcal{N}\) formalism to some special separable non-canonic cases. In this work, we extended the multi-brid idea to the multi-field separable model with a non-canonical kinetic term, mainly DBI (Dirac–Born–Infeld) action. Multi-brid stands for multi-component hybrid inflation which is based on δN formalism. To be more explicit, we considered the DBI model for two different limits, viz., speed limit and constant sound speed, as examples."
Modeling of Hydrogen Emission Lines in the Spectrum of UX Ori in Its Bright State and during Eclipses,"The hydrogen spectrum of the UX Ori-type star is modeled in a bright state and during an eclipse by an opaque dusty fragment of its own protoplanetary disk. The disk wind is considered as the main source of the emission spectrum. The radiation generated in the stellar magnetosphere is also taken into account. We showed that variations in the Hα line profile during eclipses depend sensitively on the wind opening angle. In models with a large opening angle, the emission line at the minimum brightness becomes single, asymmetric, and shifts towards the red end, which contradicts the observations made in 1992 during the deep minimum of UX Ori, when the asymmetric two-peak emission line turned into an asymmetric single and practically unbiased line. This indicates that one more source contributes to the emission spectrum, which is not occulted by an opaque screen at the moments of eclipses. As possible options, we considered (a) scattered radiation of a hypothetical dust halo in the polar region of the disk and (b) peripheral layers of the gas atmosphere of the disk, which are the source of the photoevaporation wind. To clarify the situation, new high-quality observations of the spectra of this type of star in deep minima are needed."
RETRACTED ARTICLE: LncRNA CTBP1-AS2 sponges miR-216a to upregulate PTEN and suppress endometrial cancer cell invasion and migration,"Although lncRNA CTBP1-AS2 has been functionally analyzed only in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and diabetes, analysis of TCGA dataset revealed its downregulation in endometrial carcinoma (EC), indicating its involvement in EC."
"Pro-inflammatory cytokines, but not brain- and extracellular matrix-derived proteins, are increased in the plasma following electrically induced kindling of seizures","The aim of the study was to evaluate the brain-derived proteins, extracellular matrix-derived protein and cytokines as potential peripheral biomarkers of different susceptibility to seizure development in an animal model of epilepsy evoked by chronic focal electrical stimulation of the brain."
Solar Type U Burst Associated with a High Coronal Loop,"An inverted U burst with equally developed ascending and descending branches observed by the Giant Ukrainian Radio Telescope (GURT) on 18 April 2017 in meter wavelengths band is discussed. This U burst was attributed to the high coronal loop in active region NOAA 12651 above the limb. Under the assumption that, associated with the burst, a coronal loop confines isothermal plasma stratified according to the Boltzmann density relation, geometrical and physical parameters of the loop were estimated. According to our model coronal loops may contain plasma which is up to 20 times denser than the surrounding coronal plasma. In general, the proposed model gives the relation between the plasma temperature and the height of the loop in such a way that under the given parameters of the associated U burst, higher loops contain cooler plasma and vice versa. An alternative method of coronal loop height determination was suggested. Assuming that the observed U burst and the preceding Type III burst were generated by the same exciter, we define the height of the loop from the delay of the former with respect to the latter at a certain frequency. We show that determining the heights of the loops by another independent method, e.g. interferometric or tied-array imaging may reduce the uncertainty of the inside-the-loop plasma temperature determination."
Set-valued risk measures as backward stochastic difference inclusions and equations,"Scalar dynamic risk measures for univariate positions in continuous time are commonly represented via backward stochastic differential equations. In the multivariate setting, dynamic risk measures have been defined and studied as families of set-valued functionals in the recent literature. There are two possible extensions of scalar backward stochastic differential equations for the set-valued framework: (1) backward stochastic differential inclusions, which evaluate the risk dynamics on the selectors of acceptable capital allocations; or (2) set-valued backward stochastic differential equations, which evaluate the risk dynamics on the full set of acceptable capital allocations as a singular object. In this work, the discrete-time setting is investigated with difference inclusions and difference equations in order to provide insights for such differential representations for set-valued dynamic risk measures in continuous time."
Electromagnetic Stirring in an Electric Arc Metal Melt,"The necessity of studying the stirring of liquid-metal components to form homogeneous alloys is substantiated. A mathematical model is developed for the electromagnetic stirring of alloys produced in an electric arc furnace. A special-purpose experiment is carried out to test the proposed model. The results of calculations and experiments performed on a small electric arc furnace are presented. Good agreement of the proposed theory with the experimental results is reached, and recommendations are given for improving the existing technological equipment."
Effect of the Composition and Structure of Al–Si–Y and Ni–Cr–Al–Y Coatings on Gas-Turbine Blades on the Service Life,"The life characteristics of Al–Si–Y and Ni–Cr–Al–Y coatings during oxidation in air at 1050°C are studied. Yttrium is shown to be absent in the solid solution of the phase components of both coatings; in the case of the Ni–Cr–Al–Y coating, yttrium, which falls into the coating as a component drop-phase sparks, negatively affects the heat resistance. Silicon is present in the coating mainly in the form of the silicon solid solution in the γ' Ni3Al phase and improves the heat resistance. The service life of VSDP-11 coating at 1050°C is almost three times higher than that of the SDP-2 coating."
Stress Cracking of the Metal in 08Kh18N9 Steel Pipelines,"The causes and mechanism of metal degradation in damaged regions of heat-exchange pipes (coil) of the sodium–air heat exchanger of the secondary circuit in the IBR-2 research nuclear facility are found due to experimental investigations. The defects that do not lead to the initiation and development of cracks in contact with a sodium coolant are studied. As follows from the experimental results, it is necessary to pay attention to an involuntary change in the heat removal and to the local loads that cause plastic deformation of the pipe metal during erecting work."
On the Prospects of Introduction of Modifying Carbides WC and B4C in the Production of 12Kh18N10T Steel Used in Power Engineering Industry,A method of introducing dispersed particles during centrifugal casting of blanks is proposed; it can be used to achieve a more uniform particle distribution. Tungsten and boron carbides are chosen as strengthening particles to increase the radiation resistance. The interaction of additives with a metal matrix is studied by thermodynamic simulation of the high-temperature processes occurring in the carbide–metal matrix system using the Fact Sage software package. The composition of 12Kh18N10T steel is used as the matrix material composition for simulation.
Method of Convex Marking of the Surfaces of Steel Products Using a Pulsed 50-W Infrared Fiber Laser,"Convex linear structures of various configurations with a height up to 200 μm and a depth up to 100 μm and point structures with a height up to 500 are formed on the surface of steel samples using a 50-W pulsed nanosecond fiber laser with a wavelength of 1.064 μm without filler wires or powders. The structures are formed from the irradiated steel material by controlling the melt dynamics. The possibility of forming braille on a steel surface using this technology is shown. The results are promising for a number of industries, where electron-beam machines and high-power laser sources are prohibitively expensive and a high rate of relief formation is required."
Devonian Radiolarian Ecozones of Northern Eurasia,"This study provides a description of the Devonian radiolarian associations of northern Eurasia and discusses their role in the evolution of Earth’s biosphere. It contributes to evolutionary studies of the Earth and its organic world by reconstructing the diversity dynamics of the Devonian radiolarian biota and the chorology of its components, at the same time revealing the biostratigraphic and paleoecological potential of radiolarians. The taxonomic composition and characteristics of the dominant morphotypes in radiolarian communities are indicators of environmental conditions. Associations of radiolarians vary significantly between different, even neighboring, water areas, so they can be considered as ecozones. Data on the structure of associations of radiolarians at the level of taxa of higher rank (classes) are a kind of “certificate” or “passport” of ecozones of individual paleobasins. Radiolarian ecozones replace each other in time, which allows their use for biostratigraphy. The results of the new and revisional studies of the Devonian radiolarians from 15 regions of northern Eurasia enabled a refined and detailed radiolarian scale of the Devonian system and description of 39 Devonian radiolarian ecozones, 24 of which are described for the first time: 17 ecozones are recognized based on the literature data, while seven ecozones are based on analysis of new data. Of 39 ecozones, 33 are dated based on conodont data, and six are dated using the co-occurring foraminifers, ostracodes, and/or ammonoids. General patterns in the evolution of Devonian radiolarians of northern Eurasia are considered and discussed. Spherical porous Sphaerellaria distinctly dominated in the Devonian. A clear trend towards an eastward increase in the relative abundance of spongy and latticed morphotypes of Spumellaria is shown. Spiny Aculearia of the orders Fasciculata and Triangulata are found to have been widespread. The early evolution of the bilaterally symmetrical Albaillellata is recorded. It is shown that in the Famennian, radiolarians with a pylome, Popofskyellidae and Archocyrtiinae, were common, while the genus Caspiaza first appeared at that time. The habitats and the distribution of the discoidal and ellipsoidal radiolarian morphotypes are analyzed in space and time. The dominance of these morphotypes can be used as an indicator of shallow water settings and a marker of transgression and regression boundaries in the paleobasin. A model of cyclic deposition of Domanik-type rocks in an anoxic basin is proposed, and the ecology of radiolarians in the anoxic environments of the Middle Frasnian Domanik Paleosea is analyzed. The predominance of the spiny morphotypes over spherical radiolarians is proposed as a paleoclimatic coefficient indicating cooling of the seawater in a paleobasin. Devonian radiolarians are represented by indigenous species and migrant species: (1) the value of the settled index exceeds that of the migration index by 3–5 times, (2) radiolarians occupied new ecological niches by emigration of evolutionarily young species representing genera with one–two species in total. Four radiolarian migration episodes are established in the Famennian basins of Laurussia. The monograph is intended for widespread use in paleontology, biostratigraphy, paleoecology, paleobiogeography and for university courses."
Deformation of Corset-Shaped Specimens during Cyclic Heating,"The deformation that develops in a corset specimen during its cyclic heating is analyzed. The plastic deformation in the central part of the specimen, where usually fracture is localized, reaches a very large value of 6–7% (for the thermal conditions typical of thermal fatigue research). This is explained by mechanical deformation due to external cyclically compressed and expanded specimen shoulders, which are rigidly constrained only from the heads. A thermocyclic diagram for a flat corset specimen is given; it differs significantly from the diagram for specimens with a long gauge part (for example, the Coffin technique). Corset specimens are recommended for full-scale tests of products by changing their shape (modeling dangerous regions of the products) and plastic deformation in a wide range."
Hot Plastic Deformation of Titanium Alloys Reflected on Process Maps,"Maps are plotted for the hot plastic deformation of titanium-based alloys with a high-temperature polymorphic transformation, namely, martensitic 23A, 5VA and PT3V alloys. Hot plastic compression is modeled using a DIL 805 A/D dilatometer. Samples in the form of ∅5 × 10 mm cylinders are compressed to a strain of 0.3 in the temperature range 600–1100°C at a strain rate from 10–3 to 10 s–1. The α ↔ β transformation temperatures are 800–900°C in alloy 23A, 880–900°C in 5VA, and 900–920°C in PT3V, and they fall into the temperature range of hot compression. The process maps show the effect of mechanical energy dissipation in changing the shape and structure of the samples. The dissipation of introduced mechanical energy is found to be due to the operation of the following two structural mechanisms: accommodative elastoplastic relaxation in ensembles of lattice defects with η ≈ 25% and the hcp ↔ bcc crystallographic transformation with an efficiency η ≈ 15%."
Technology for Producing a Promising Aluminum-Matrix Composite Material with Discrete Al2O3 Fibers,"The choice of the composition of the components of a composite material that determines its prospects and demand has been substantiated. Liquid-phase combination is used to fabricate billets of an aluminum-matrix composite material of a new composition. The technological problems of introducing discrete Al2O3 nanofibers into an aluminum matrix are solved. A copper powder is used to overcome surface tension forces and to ensure a uniform reinforcing component distribution. When the components of the composite material are prepared, the reinforcing phase consisting of a transport powder and nanofibers is ground and the resulting conglomerate is introduced into a melt to form a composite material. The hardness of the reinforced specimens is higher than the hardness of the matrix, and sufficient uniformity of the hardness distribution over the cross section demonstrates the uniformity of introduced component distribution. An analysis of the fracture of specimens demonstrates a clear predominance of plastic deformation for the initial matrix alloy and an embrittlement effect in the case of reinforcement. Structural studies on a macrolevel show the signs characteristic of brittle fracture, and scanning electron microscopy (Tescan Vega IILMH microscope) studies demonstrate signs of ductile fracture. The fabrication of high-quality specimens and the results of studying the structure and properties confirm the efficiency of the technology developed for the introduction of fillers."
Simulation of the Control System of the Coke Calcination in Tubular Rotary Kilns,"The challenging problem of improving the control of a rotary coke calcining kiln is discussed. An overview of works on simulating such kilns is presented, a mathematical model of the technological process for use in a control system is proposed, and approaches to developing a control system in the SimInTech environment are considered."

The structure of PCMs with various hybrid matrix modifiers is ​​estimated. The results of determining the deformation properties of PCMs with various hybrid matrix modifiers using dynamic mechanical analysis are presented. The effect of hybrid matrix modifiers on the glass transition temperature of PCM is revealed. The hybrid matrix modifier having the best characteristics is found."
"Composition, Structure, and Properties of the Electroerosive Powders Fabricated from the Wastes of a VNZh Alloy in Distilled Water","The elemental composition, the phase composition, and the particle size of the powder fabricated by electroerosion dispersion of the wastes of a VNZh tungsten pseudoalloy in distilled water are investigated."
Effect of the Coatings of Mating Parts on the Strength of Interference Fit Joints,An effective method for increasing the strength of fixation of hard-alloy drill bit roller cutters is developed; it consists in the use of galvanic coatings of mating parts. The strengths of the joints with three types of coatings are experimentally studied. Recommendations are developed for the type and thickness of the coatings of the parts of interference fit joints of hard-alloy bits with the mobile elements of drilling tool.
Technology of Producing Cast Billets Made of a High-Temperature Composite Material Based on the Nb–Si System,"FGUP VIAM has developed a technology for producing cast billets of a high-temperature composite material based on the Nb–Si system. This technology includes the fabrication of a Si–Cr–Al–Y master alloy, the assembling of a consumable electrode, its remelting a vacuum arc furnace, and the subsequent remelting of the resulting ingot in a vacuum induction furnace in an yttrium oxide–based crucible. This technology can be used to achieve a homogeneous chemical composition of an alloy close to the calculated one and low content of oxygen impurities."
Parameters of the Plastic Deformation of a Filler Wire during Electrical-Contact Welding,"The change in the shape of a filler wire during the restoration of worn parts by electrical-contact welding is considered, the geometric dimensions of the weld are determined, and the parameters of the relative plastic deformation of the filler metal are found. The quality (strength) of the welded joint is shown to depend on the intensity of plastic deformation at the joint of the base and filler metals."
Chemistry and Manufacturing Technology of Electronic Ink for Electrophoretic Displays (A Review),"This review examines the state of art in research aimed at the development of electronic paper (electronic ink, e-ink), namely, the general principles to design a colloidal system with desired properties, having sedimentation and aggregate stability, consisting of a dispersed phase (reverse-micellar nanoreactors based on pigments) and a dispersion phase (nonpolar solvent/surfactant). More specifically, the subject matters of the review are: general methods and approaches used in the synthesis and modification of colloidal pigment particles; the electrophoretic properties of various dispersion systems comprising these particles (one-, two-, and three-color e-inks), which depend on the size of modified pigments, their zeta potentials, electrophoretic mobility, the presence of surfactants, dispersants, and emulsifiers; the chemical, physicochemical, and physicomechanical methods for microencapsulation of ink dispersions; and methods for manufacturing electrophoretic cells, including those used in micron-level cell design."
Constructing Bi2WO6-decorated TiO2 composite films for photocathodic protection of 304 stainless steel,"Bi2WO6 nanoplate/TiO2 nanowire and Bi2WO6 nanoflower/TiO2 nanowire composite films were successfully prepared using a hydrothermal method. The results show that the light absorption for Bi2WO6/TiO2 composite films is extended to the visible region after Bi2WO6 nanoplates and nanoflowers are assembled onto TiO2 nanowires. Furthermore, Bi2WO6 nanoflower/TiO2 nanowire composite film exhibits a better absorption property compared to Bi2WO6 nanoplate/TiO2 nanowire film, which is mainly ascribed to the narrower bandgap of Bi2WO6 nanoflower compared to that of Bi2WO6 nanoplate. The photocurrent density for Bi2WO6 nanoflower/TiO2 nanowire and Bi2WO6 nanoplate/TiO2 nanowire composite films can reach 95 and 62.5 μA cm−2, respectively, which are much higher than that obtained for a pure TiO2 nanowire film (25 μA cm−2). Meanwhile, under illumination, the pure TiO2 nanowire, Bi2WO6 nanoplate/TiO2 nanowire and Bi2WO6 nanoflower/TiO2 nanowire films can reduce the potential of the coupled 304 stainless steel in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution by 299, 719 and 739 mV, respectively. Thus, Bi2WO6 nanoflower/TiO2 nanowire film is found to provide the best effective photocathodic protection for 304 stainless steel. This work not only provides an example of shape-dependent photocathodic protection based on Bi2WO6 but also opens up new possibilities to design an ideal microstructure on the basis of semiconductor materials for future applications of photocathodic protection."
To team up or not: single versus team driving in European road freight transport,"The last decades have seen a tremendous amount of research being devoted to effectively managing vehicle fleets and minimizing empty mileage. However, in contrast to, e.g., the air transport sector, the question of how to best assign crews to vehicles, has received very little attention in the road transport sector. The vast majority of road freight transport in Europe is conducted by single drivers and team driving is often only conducted if there are special circumstances, e.g., security concerns. While it is clear that transport companies want to avoid the costs related to additional drivers, vehicles manned by a single driver sit unused whenever the driver takes a mandatory break or rest. Team drivers, on the other hand, can travel a much greater distance in the same amount of time, because mandatory breaks and rests are required less frequently. This paper investigates under which conditions trucking companies should use single or team driving to maximize their profitability. We present a novel optimization approach for simultaneously optimizing routes and crewing decisions and provide experimental evidence that, for a wide range of cost factors, operating a fleet with a mix of team and single drivers can significantly reduce operational costs when compared to typical profit margins in the sector."
Current-driven transformations of a skyrmion tube and a bobber in stepped nanostructures of chiral magnets,"Magnetic skyrmion tubes and bobbers are two types of different nanoscale spin configurations that can coexist in nanostructures of chiral magnets. They are then proposed to be utilized as binary bits to build racetrack memory devices. The ability to manipulate the two magnetic objects controllably by current in nanostructures is the prerequisite to realize the device. Here, we demonstrate by numerical simulations that a magnetic bobber and a skyrmion tube can be transformed to each other using spin-polarized current in nanostripes with stepped shape. We also show such stepped nanostructures can be readily applied as the write head for the skyrmion-bobber-based racetrack memory."
Holographic superconductors in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity,"We investigate the neutral AdS black-hole solution in the consistent D → 4 Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity proposed in [K. Aoki, M.A. Gorji, and S. Mukohyama, Phys. Lett. B 810 (2020) 135843] and construct the gravity duals of (2 + 1)-dimensional superconductors with Gauss-Bonnet corrections in the probe limit. We find that the curvature correction has a more subtle effect on the scalar condensates in the s-wave superconductor in (2 + 1)-dimensions, which is different from the finding in the higher-dimensional superconductors that the higher curvature correction makes the scalar hair more difficult to be developed in the full parameter space. However, in the p-wave case, we observe that the higher curvature correction always makes it harder for the vector condensates to form in various dimensions. Moreover, we note that the higher curvature correction results in the larger deviation from the expected relation in the gap frequency ωg/Tc ≈ 8 in both (2 + 1)-dimensional s-wave and p-wave models."
The boostless bootstrap: amplitudes without Lorentz boosts,"Poincaré invariance is a well-tested symmetry of nature and sits at the core of our description of relativistic particles and gravity. At the same time, in most systems Poincaré invariance is not a symmetry of the ground state and is hence broken spontaneously. This phenomenon is ubiquitous in cosmology where Lorentz boosts are spontaneously broken by the existence of a preferred reference frame in which the universe is homogeneous and isotropic. This motivates us to study scattering amplitudes without requiring invariance of the interactions under Lorentz boosts. In particular, using on-shell methods and assuming massless, relativistic and luminal particles of any spin, we show that the allowed interactions around Minkowski spacetime are severely constrained by unitarity and locality in the form of consistent factorization. The existence of an interacting massless spin-2 particle enforces (analytically continued) three-particle amplitudes to be Lorentz invariant, even those that do not involve a graviton, such as cubic scalar couplings. We conjecture this to be true for all n-particle amplitudes. Also, particles of spin S > 2 cannot self-interact nor can be minimally coupled to gravity, while particles of spin S > 1 cannot have electric charge. Given the growing evidence that free gravitons are well described by massless, luminal relativistic particles, our results imply that cubic graviton interactions in Minkowski must be those of general relativity up to a unique Lorentz-invariant higher-derivative correction of mass dimension 9. Finally, we point out that consistent factorization for massless particles is highly IR sensitive and therefore our powerful flat-space results do not straightforwardly apply to curved spacetime."
Maximally self-interacting dark matter: models and predictions,"We study self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) scenarios, where the s-wave self-scattering cross section almost saturates the Unitarity bound. Such self-scattering cross sections are singly parameterized by the dark matter mass, and are featured by strong velocity dependence in a wide range of velocities. They may be indicated by observations of dark matter halos in a wide range of masses, from Milky Way’s dwarf spheroidal galaxies to galaxy clusters. We pin down the model parameters that saturates the Unitarity bound in well-motivated SIDM models: the gauged Lμ − Lτ model and composite asymmetric dark matter model. We discuss implications and predictions of such model parameters for cosmology like the H0 tension and dark-matter direct-detection experiments, and particle phenomenology like the beam-dump experiments."
Crunching away the cosmological constant problem: dynamical selection of a small Λ,"We propose a novel explanation for the smallness of the observed cosmological constant (CC). Regions of space with a large CC are short lived and are dynamically driven to crunch soon after the end of inflation. Conversely, regions with a small CC are metastable and long lived and are the only ones to survive until late times. While the mechanism assumes many domains with different CC values, it does not result in eternal inflation nor does it require a long period of inflation to populate them. We present a concrete dynamical model, based on a super-cooled first order phase transition in a hidden conformal sector, that may successfully implement such a crunching mechanism. We find that the mechanism can only solve the CC problem up to the weak scale, above which new physics, such as supersymmetry, is needed to solve the CC problem all the way to the UV cutoff scale. The absence of experimental evidence for such new physics already implies a mild little hierarchy problem for the CC. Curiously, in this approach the weak scale arises as the geometric mean of the temperature in our universe today and the Planck scale, hinting at a new “CC miracle”, motivating new physics at the weak scale independent of electroweak physics. We further predict the presence of new relativistic degrees of freedom in the CFT that should be visible in the next round of CMB experiments. Our mechanism is therefore predictive and experimentally falsifiable."
Hyperkähler isometries of K3 surfaces,"We consider symmetries of K3 manifolds. Holomorphic symplectic automorphisms of K3 surfaces have been classified, and observed to be subgroups of the Mathieu group M23. More recently, automorphisms of K3 sigma models commuting with SU(2) × SU(2) R-symmetry have been classified by Gaberdiel, Hohenegger, and Volpato. These groups are all subgroups of the Conway group. We fill in a small gap in the literature and classify the possible hyperkähler isometry groups of K3 manifolds. There is an explicit list of 40 possible groups, all of which are realized in the moduli space. The groups are all subgroups of M23."
Massive fishnets,"Recently, infinite families of massive Feynman integrals were found to feature an unexpected Yangian symmetry. In the massless case, similar integrability properties are understood via the interpretation of individual Feynman integrals as correlators in the massless fishnet theory introduced by Gürdoğan and Kazakov. Here we seek for an analogous interpretation of the integrability of massive Feynman integrals. We contrast two approaches to define simple massive quantum field theories in four dimensions. First, we discuss spontaneous symmetry breaking in the massless bi-scalar fishnet theory. We then propose an alternative route to a massive fishnet theory by taking a double-scaling limit of \( \mathcal{N} \) = 4 SYM theory on the Coulomb branch. Both approaches lead to a massive extension of the massless fishnet theory, differing in how masses enter into the propagators. In the latter theory, planar off-shell amplitudes are in one-to-one correspondence with precisely those massive Feynman integrals that were shown to be invariant under the Yangian. This suggests a re-investigation of Coulomb branch \( \mathcal{N} \) = 4 SYM theory with regard to integrability. Finally, we demonstrate that in the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the original conformal symmetry leads to soft theorems for scattering amplitudes in the broken phase."
Quantum phenomenological gravitational dynamics: a general view from thermodynamics of spacetime,"In this work we derive general quantum phenomenological equations of gravitational dynamics and analyse its features. The derivation uses the formalism developed in thermodynamics of spacetime and introduces low energy quantum gravity modifications to it. Quantum gravity effects are considered via modification of Bekenstein entropy by an extra logarithmic term in the area. This modification is predicted by several approaches to quantum gravity, including loop quantum gravity, string theory, AdS/CFT correspondence and generalised uncertainty principle phenomenology, giving our result a general character. The derived equations generalise classical equations of motion of unimodular gravity, instead of the ones of general relativity, and they contain at most second derivatives of the metric. We provide two independent derivations of the equations based on thermodynamics of local causal diamonds. First one uses Jacobson's maximal vacuum entanglement hypothesis, the second one Clausius entropy flux. Furthermore, we consider questions of diffeomorphism and local Lorentz invariance of the resulting dynamics and discuss its application to a simple cosmological model, finding a resolution of the classical singularity."
Impact of visuomotor feedback on the embodiment of virtual hands detached from the body,"It has been shown that mere observation of body discontinuity leads to diminished body ownership. However, the impact of body discontinuity has mainly been investigated in conditions where participants observe a collocated static virtual body from a first-person perspective. This study explores the influence of body discountinuity on the sense of embodiment, when rich visuomotor correlations between a real and an artificial virtual body are established. In two experiments, we evaluated body ownership and motor performance, when participants interacted in virtual reality either using virtual hands connected or disconnected from a body. We found that even under the presence of congruent visuomotor feedback, mere observation of body discontinuity resulted in diminished embodiment. Contradictory evidence was found in relation to motor performance, where further research is needed to understand the role of visual body discontinuity in motor tasks. Preliminary findings on physiological reactions to a threat were also assessed, indicating that body visual discontinuity does not differently impact threat-related skin conductance responses. The present results are in accordance with past evidence showing that body discontinuity negatively impacts embodiment. However, further research is needed to understand the influence of visuomotor feedback and body morphological congruency on motor performance and threat-related physiological reactions."
Continuous lengthening potential after four years of magnetically controlled spinal deformity correction in children with spinal muscular atrophy,"Magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGR) are commonly implanted for the treatment of early-onset scoliosis. While most authors report favorable short-term results, little is known about long-term deformity correction. This prospective cohort study assesses spinal deformity control in a homogeneous spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patient group treated with MCGR implants, a standardized lengthening protocol and a minimum follow-up of four years. 17 SMA patients with progressive scoliosis were treated with MCGR implanted parallel to the spine with rib-to-pelvis fixation. Radiologic measurements were performed before and after MCGR implantation and during external lengthening procedures. These included measurements of the scoliotic curve, kyphosis, lordosis, pelvic obliquity and the spinal length. Additional clinical data of the complications were also analyzed. 17 children (mean age 7.4 years) were surgically treated and underwent a total of 376 lengthenings. Complication rates were 3.5% in respect to all interventions or 41% of the patients had complications during 3.5% of the lengthening sessions. The initial implantation significantly reduced the main scoliotic curve by 59%, with the correction remaining constant throughout the follow-up. Pelvic obliquity was also significantly and permanently corrected by 72%, whereas kyphosis and lordosis were not influenced. The spinal length could be significantly increased mostly during the first year of treatment. Bilateral implantation of MCGRs for correction of spinal deformity in children with SMA showed no decrease of the lengthening potential during a four-year follow-up. Therefore, the previously described ‘law of diminishing returns’ could not be applied to this patient population."
Glycocalyx regulates the strength and kinetics of cancer cell adhesion revealed by biophysical models based on high resolution label-free optical data,"The glycocalyx is thought to perform a potent, but not yet defined function in cellular adhesion and signaling. Since 95% of cancer cells have altered glycocalyx structure, this role can be especially important in cancer development and metastasis. The glycocalyx layer of cancer cells directly influences cancer progression, involving the complicated kinetic process of cellular adhesion at various levels. In the present work, we investigated the effect of enzymatic digestion of specific glycocalyx components on cancer cell adhesion to RGD (arginine–glycine–aspartic acid) peptide motif displaying surfaces. High resolution kinetic data of cell adhesion was recorded by the surface sensitive label-free resonant waveguide grating (RWG) biosensor, supported by fluorescent staining of the cells and cell surface charge measurements. We found that intense removal of chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate chains by chondroitinase ABC reduced the speed and decreased the strength of adhesion of HeLa cells. In contrast, mild digestion of glycocalyx resulted in faster and stronger adhesion. Control experiments on a healthy and another cancer cell line were also conducted, and the discrepancies were analysed. We developed a biophysical model which was fitted to the kinetic data of HeLa cells. Our analysis suggests that the rate of integrin receptor transport to the adhesion zone and integrin-RGD binding is strongly influenced by the presence of glycocalyx components, but the integrin-RGD dissociation is not. Moreover, based on the kinetic data we calculated the dependence of the dissociation constant of integrin-RGD binding on the enzyme concentration. We also determined the dissociation constant using a 2D receptor binding model based on saturation level static data recorded at surfaces with tuned RGD densities. We analyzed the discrepancies of the kinetic and static dissociation constants, further illuminating the role of cancer cell glycocalyx during the adhesion process. Altogether, our experimental results and modelling demonstrated that the chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate chains of glycocalyx have an important regulatory function during the cellular adhesion process, mainly controlling the kinetics of integrin transport and integrin assembly into mature adhesion sites. Our results potentially open the way for novel type of cancer treatments affecting these regulatory mechanisms of cellular glycocalyx."
"Pole, die nicht schmelzen","Nicht erst durch Covid-19 sind Kinder und Jugendliche in Armutslagen Benachteiligungen in allen zentralen Lebensbereichen ausgesetzt, die sich u. a. mit sozialer Polarisierung begründen lassen. Der Beitrag leitet in den Schwerpunkt ein, in dem Grundzüge und Zusammenhänge gesellschaftlicher Polarisierungsprozesse beleuchtet und sozialpolitische Ansätze, diesen zu begegnen, diskutiert werden."
Transcriptome analysis and differential gene expression profiling of two contrasting quinoa genotypes in response to salt stress,"Soil salinity is one of the major abiotic stress factors that affect crop growth and yield, which seriously restricts the sustainable development of agriculture. Quinoa is considered as one of the most promising crops in the future for its high nutrition value and strong adaptability to extreme weather and soil conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptive response to salinity stress of quinoa remain poorly understood. To identify candidate genes related to salt tolerance, we performed reference-guided assembly and compared the gene expression in roots treated with 300 mM NaCl for 0, 0.5, 2, and 24 h of two contrasting quinoa genotypes differing in salt tolerance."
Surgical suture course for dental students with the Peyton-4-step approach versus the PDCA cycle using video assisted self-monitoring,"In this prospective study the Peyton 4-step approach of demonstration–deconstruction–comprehension (verbalization by the learner), and performance by the learner was compared to the PDCA cycle/Deming-Circle (Plan–Do–Check (video assisted self-monitoring)–Act) as a teaching method for surgical suturing and nodes with end performance as the primary objective."
"Knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy program intended to improve public health professionals’ ability to identify and manage perinatal depressive symptoms: a quasi-experimental study","During the perinatal period women lack screening and treatments for perinatal depressive symptoms, while public health professionals (PHPs) in primary care centres (PCCs) need training for identification and management of such symptoms. This quasi-experimental study was aimed at evaluating knowledge, attitudes and self-efficacy among PHPs after participating in a Knowledge, Attitude, and Self-efficacy (KAS) program for identification and management of perinatal depressive symptoms."
Biological efficacy of perpendicular type-I collagen protruded from TiO2-nanotubes,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the biological efficacy of a unique perpendicular protrusion of type-I collagen (Col-I) from TiO2 nanotubes (NT-EPF surface). We hypothesized that the NT-EPF surface would play bifunctional roles in stimulating platelet-mediated fibroblast recruitment and anchoring fibroblast-derived Col-I to form a perpendicular collagen assembly, mimicking the connective tissue attachment around natural teeth for the long-term maintenance of dental implants. Ti surface modification was accomplished in two steps. First, TiO2 nanotubes (NT) array was fabricated via anodization. Diameters and depths of NTs were controlled by applied voltage and duration. Subsequently, an electrophoretic fusion (EPF) method was applied to fuse Col-I into nanotube arrays in a perpendicular fashion. Surface wettability was assessed by contact angle measurement. The bioactivity of modified TiO2 surfaces was evaluated in terms of NIH3T3 fibroblast attachment, platelet activation, and collagen extension. Early attachment, aggregation, and activation of platelets as well as release of platelet-related growth factors were demonstrated on NT-EPF surfaces. Platelet-mediated NIH3T3 cells migration toward NT-EPF was significantly increased and the attached cells showed a typical fibrous morphology with elongated spindle shape. A direct linkage between pseudopod-like processes of fibroblasts to NT-EPF surfaces was observed. Furthermore, the engineered EPF collagen protrusion linked with cell-derived collagen in a perpendicular fashion. Within the limitation of this in vitro study, the TiO2 nanotube with perpendicular Col-I surface (NT-EPF) promoted better cell attachment, induced a strong platelet activation which suggested the ability to create a more robust soft tissue seal."
Sleep duration and all-cause mortality in the elderly in China: a population-based cohort study,"Although a U-shaped association between sleep duration and all-cause mortality has been found in general population, its association in the elderly adults, especially in the oldest-old, is rarely explored."
The cost of associating with males for Bornean and Sumatran female orangutans: a hidden form of sexual conflict?,"Sexual coercion, in the form of forced copulations, is relatively frequently observed in orangutans and generally attributed to their semi-solitary lifestyle. High ecological costs of association for females may be responsible for this lifestyle and may have prevented the evolution of morphological fertility indicators (e.g., sexual swellings), which would attract (male) associates. Therefore, sexual conflict may arise not only about mating per se but also about associations, because males may benefit from associations with females to monitor their reproductive state and attempt to monopolize their sexual activities. Here, we evaluate association patterns and costs for females when associating with both males and females of two different orangutan species at two study sites: Suaq, Sumatra (Pongo abelii), and Tuanan, Borneo (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii). Female association frequency with both males and females was higher in the Sumatran population, living in more productive habitat. Accordingly, we found that the cost of association, in terms of reduced feeding to moving ratio and increased time being active, is higher in the less sociable Bornean population. Males generally initiated and maintained such costly associations with females, and prolonged associations with males led to increased female fecal cortisol metabolite (FCM) levels at Tuanan, the Bornean population. We conclude that male-maintained associations are an expression of sexual conflict in orangutans, at least at Tuanan. For females, this cost of association may be responsible for the lack of sexual signaling, while needing to confuse paternity."
On the Shadowing Property and Shadowable Point of Set-valued Dynamical Systems,"In this article, the authors introduce the concept of shadowable points for set-valued dynamical systems, the pointwise version of the shadowing property, and prove that a set-valued dynamical system has the shadowing property iff every point in the phase space is shadowable; every chain transitive set-valued dynamical system has either the shadowing property or no shadowable points; and for a set-valued dynamical system there exists a shadowable point iff there exists a minimal shadowable point. In the end, it is proved that a set-valued dynamical system with the shadowing property is totally transitive iff it is mixing and iff it has the specification property."
Integral Representation Formulas Related to the Lamé—Navier System,The paper provides integral representations for solutions to a certain first order partial differential equation natural arising in the factorization of the Lamé—Navier system with the help of Clifford analysis techniques. These representations look like in spirit to the Borel—Pompeiu and Cauchy integral formulas both in three and higher dimensional setting.
Finitely Generated Nilpotent Groups of Infinite Cyclic Commutator Subgroups,"The aim of this paper is to determine the structure and to establish the isomorphic invariant of the finitely generated nilpotent group G of infinite cyclic commutator subgroup. Using the structure and invariant of the group which is the central extension of a cyclic group by a free abelian group of finite rank of infinite cyclic center, we provide a decomposition of G as the product of a generalized extraspecial ℤ-group and its center. By using techniques of lifting isomorphisms of abelian groups and equivalent normal form of the generalized extraspecial ℤ-groups, we finally obtain the structure and invariants of the group G."
Sampling from a Mixture of Different Groups of Coupons,"A collector samples coupons with replacement from a pool containing g uniform groups of coupons, where “uniform group ” means that all coupons in the group are equally likely to occur (while coupons of different groups have different probabilities to occur). For each j = 1,…, g, let Tj be the number of trials needed to detect Group j, namely to collect all Mj coupons belonging to it at least once. We first derive formulas for the probabilities P{T1 < … < Tg} and \(P\left\{{{T_1} = \wedge _{j = 1}^g\,{T_j}} \right\}\). After that, without severe loss of generality, we restrict ourselves to the case g = 2 and compute the asymptotics of P{T1 < T2} as the number of coupons grows to infinity in a certain manner. Then, we focus on T:= T1 ∨ T2, i.e. the number of trials needed to collect all coupons of the pool (at least once), and determine the asymptotics of E[T]and V [T], as well as the limiting distribution of T (appropriately normalized) as the number of coupons becomes large."
The Closed Orbits of a Class of Cubic Vector Fields in ℝ3,"In this paper, we investigate the isolated closed orbits of two types of cubic vector fields in ℝ3 by using the idea of central projection transformation, which sets up a bridge connecting the vector field X (x) in ℝ3 with the planar vector fields. We have proved that the cubic vector field in ℝ3 can have two isolated closed orbits or one closed orbit on the invariant cone. As an application of this result, we have shown that a class of 3-dimensional cubic system has at least 10 isolated closed orbits located on 5 invariant cones, and another type of 3-dimensional cubic system has at least 26 isolated closed orbits located on 13 invariant cones or 26 invariant cones."
Recombinant FVIIIFc Versus BAY 94-9027 for Treatment of Patients with Haemophilia A: Comparative Efficacy Using a Matching Adjusted Indirect Comparison,Prophylaxis with recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) is the current standard of care for haemophilia A. Several approaches have been used to extend the half-life of rFVIII to improve prophylaxis outcomes. An indirect comparison of pivotal clinical trial data was performed to evaluate the relative efficacy of two extended half-life therapies approved for the prophylactic treatment of haemophilia A: recombinant FVIII–IgG1 Fc domain fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) and pegylated rFVIII (BAY 94-9027).

Parotid sparing and quality of life in long-term survivors of locally advanced head and neck cancer after intensity-modulated radiation therapy,"Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) enables radiation oncologists to optimally spare organs at risk while achieving homogeneous dose distribution in the target volume. Despite great advances in technology, xerostomia is one of the most detrimental long-term side effects after multimodal therapy in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer (HNC). This prospective observational study examines the effect of parotid sparing on quality of life in long-term survivors."
Evolution of drug resistance in HIV protease,"Drug resistance is a critical problem limiting effective antiviral therapy for HIV/AIDS. Computational techniques for predicting drug resistance profiles from genomic data can accelerate the appropriate choice of therapy. These techniques can also be used to identify protease mutants for experimental studies of resistance and thereby assist in the development of next-generation therapies. Few studies, however, have assessed the evolution of resistance from genotype–phenotype data."
Multi-view feature selection for identifying gene markers: a diversified biological data driven approach,"In recent years, to investigate challenging bioinformatics problems, the utilization of multiple genomic and proteomic sources has become immensely popular among researchers. One such issue is feature or gene selection and identifying relevant and non-redundant marker genes from high dimensional gene expression data sets. In that context, designing an efficient feature selection algorithm exploiting knowledge from multiple potential biological resources may be an effective way to understand the spectrum of cancer or other diseases with applications in specific epidemiology for a particular population."
Polio Endgame: How India Beat the Monster,"India has had an incredible journey of becoming polio-free in a span of two decades. The conventional vaccination strategies and innovative approaches to ensure that every child in the remotest of the villages of India gets immunized have been an achievement in itself. The year 2020 marks six years of living a dream that a sprawling country like India had harboured for long, and the efforts to keep the country polio-free need to continue until this dreadful disease gets eradicated globally."
"Should We Treat Teddy Bear 2.0 as a Kantian Dog? Four Arguments for the Indirect Moral Standing of Personal Social Robots, with Implications for Thinking About Animals and Humans","The use of autonomous and intelligent personal social robots raises questions concerning their moral standing. Moving away from the discussion about direct moral standing and exploring the normative implications of a relational approach to moral standing, this paper offers four arguments that justify giving indirect moral standing to robots under specific conditions based on some of the ways humans—as social, feeling, playing, and doubting beings—relate to them. The analogy of “the Kantian dog” is used to assist reasoning about this. The paper also discusses the implications of this approach for thinking about the moral standing of animals and humans, showing why, when, and how an indirect approach can also be helpful in these fields, and using Levinas and Dewey as sources of inspiration to discuss some challenges raised by this approach."
Devonian Radiolarian Ecozones of Northern Eurasia,"This study provides a description of the Devonian radiolarian associations of northern Eurasia and discusses their role in the evolution of Earth’s biosphere. It contributes to evolutionary studies of the Earth and its organic world by reconstructing the diversity dynamics of the Devonian radiolarian biota and the chorology of its components, at the same time revealing the biostratigraphic and paleoecological potential of radiolarians. The taxonomic composition and characteristics of the dominant morphotypes in radiolarian communities are indicators of environmental conditions. Associations of radiolarians vary significantly between different, even neighboring, water areas, so they can be considered as ecozones. Data on the structure of associations of radiolarians at the level of taxa of higher rank (classes) are a kind of “certificate” or “passport” of ecozones of individual paleobasins. Radiolarian ecozones replace each other in time, which allows their use for biostratigraphy. The results of the new and revisional studies of the Devonian radiolarians from 15 regions of northern Eurasia enabled a refined and detailed radiolarian scale of the Devonian system and description of 39 Devonian radiolarian ecozones, 24 of which are described for the first time: 17 ecozones are recognized based on the literature data, while seven ecozones are based on analysis of new data. Of 39 ecozones, 33 are dated based on conodont data, and six are dated using the co-occurring foraminifers, ostracodes, and/or ammonoids. General patterns in the evolution of Devonian radiolarians of northern Eurasia are considered and discussed. Spherical porous Sphaerellaria distinctly dominated in the Devonian. A clear trend towards an eastward increase in the relative abundance of spongy and latticed morphotypes of Spumellaria is shown. Spiny Aculearia of the orders Fasciculata and Triangulata are found to have been widespread. The early evolution of the bilaterally symmetrical Albaillellata is recorded. It is shown that in the Famennian, radiolarians with a pylome, Popofskyellidae and Archocyrtiinae, were common, while the genus Caspiaza first appeared at that time. The habitats and the distribution of the discoidal and ellipsoidal radiolarian morphotypes are analyzed in space and time. The dominance of these morphotypes can be used as an indicator of shallow water settings and a marker of transgression and regression boundaries in the paleobasin. A model of cyclic deposition of Domanik-type rocks in an anoxic basin is proposed, and the ecology of radiolarians in the anoxic environments of the Middle Frasnian Domanik Paleosea is analyzed. The predominance of the spiny morphotypes over spherical radiolarians is proposed as a paleoclimatic coefficient indicating cooling of the seawater in a paleobasin. Devonian radiolarians are represented by indigenous species and migrant species: (1) the value of the settled index exceeds that of the migration index by 3–5 times, (2) radiolarians occupied new ecological niches by emigration of evolutionarily young species representing genera with one–two species in total. Four radiolarian migration episodes are established in the Famennian basins of Laurussia. The monograph is intended for widespread use in paleontology, biostratigraphy, paleoecology, paleobiogeography and for university courses."
Method of Convex Marking of the Surfaces of Steel Products Using a Pulsed 50-W Infrared Fiber Laser,"Convex linear structures of various configurations with a height up to 200 μm and a depth up to 100 μm and point structures with a height up to 500 are formed on the surface of steel samples using a 50-W pulsed nanosecond fiber laser with a wavelength of 1.064 μm without filler wires or powders. The structures are formed from the irradiated steel material by controlling the melt dynamics. The possibility of forming braille on a steel surface using this technology is shown. The results are promising for a number of industries, where electron-beam machines and high-power laser sources are prohibitively expensive and a high rate of relief formation is required."
Hot Plastic Deformation of Titanium Alloys Reflected on Process Maps,"Maps are plotted for the hot plastic deformation of titanium-based alloys with a high-temperature polymorphic transformation, namely, martensitic 23A, 5VA and PT3V alloys. Hot plastic compression is modeled using a DIL 805 A/D dilatometer. Samples in the form of ∅5 × 10 mm cylinders are compressed to a strain of 0.3 in the temperature range 600–1100°C at a strain rate from 10–3 to 10 s–1. The α ↔ β transformation temperatures are 800–900°C in alloy 23A, 880–900°C in 5VA, and 900–920°C in PT3V, and they fall into the temperature range of hot compression. The process maps show the effect of mechanical energy dissipation in changing the shape and structure of the samples. The dissipation of introduced mechanical energy is found to be due to the operation of the following two structural mechanisms: accommodative elastoplastic relaxation in ensembles of lattice defects with η ≈ 25% and the hcp ↔ bcc crystallographic transformation with an efficiency η ≈ 15%."
Service Properties of Composites with Various Types of Hybrid Matrices,"Polymer composite materials (PCMs) with a hybrid matrix, which increases the deformation properties of structures in specified local zones, are described.

The structure of PCMs with various hybrid matrix modifiers is ​​estimated. The results of determining the deformation properties of PCMs with various hybrid matrix modifiers using dynamic mechanical analysis are presented. The effect of hybrid matrix modifiers on the glass transition temperature of PCM is revealed. The hybrid matrix modifier having the best characteristics is found."
"Composition, Structure, and Properties of the Electroerosive Powders Fabricated from the Wastes of a VNZh Alloy in Distilled Water","The elemental composition, the phase composition, and the particle size of the powder fabricated by electroerosion dispersion of the wastes of a VNZh tungsten pseudoalloy in distilled water are investigated."
Technology of Producing Cast Billets Made of a High-Temperature Composite Material Based on the Nb–Si System,"FGUP VIAM has developed a technology for producing cast billets of a high-temperature composite material based on the Nb–Si system. This technology includes the fabrication of a Si–Cr–Al–Y master alloy, the assembling of a consumable electrode, its remelting a vacuum arc furnace, and the subsequent remelting of the resulting ingot in a vacuum induction furnace in an yttrium oxide–based crucible. This technology can be used to achieve a homogeneous chemical composition of an alloy close to the calculated one and low content of oxygen impurities."
Electromagnetic Stirring in an Electric Arc Metal Melt,"The necessity of studying the stirring of liquid-metal components to form homogeneous alloys is substantiated. A mathematical model is developed for the electromagnetic stirring of alloys produced in an electric arc furnace. A special-purpose experiment is carried out to test the proposed model. The results of calculations and experiments performed on a small electric arc furnace are presented. Good agreement of the proposed theory with the experimental results is reached, and recommendations are given for improving the existing technological equipment."
Effect of the Composition and Structure of Al–Si–Y and Ni–Cr–Al–Y Coatings on Gas-Turbine Blades on the Service Life,"The life characteristics of Al–Si–Y and Ni–Cr–Al–Y coatings during oxidation in air at 1050°C are studied. Yttrium is shown to be absent in the solid solution of the phase components of both coatings; in the case of the Ni–Cr–Al–Y coating, yttrium, which falls into the coating as a component drop-phase sparks, negatively affects the heat resistance. Silicon is present in the coating mainly in the form of the silicon solid solution in the γ' Ni3Al phase and improves the heat resistance. The service life of VSDP-11 coating at 1050°C is almost three times higher than that of the SDP-2 coating."
On the Prospects of Introduction of Modifying Carbides WC and B4C in the Production of 12Kh18N10T Steel Used in Power Engineering Industry,A method of introducing dispersed particles during centrifugal casting of blanks is proposed; it can be used to achieve a more uniform particle distribution. Tungsten and boron carbides are chosen as strengthening particles to increase the radiation resistance. The interaction of additives with a metal matrix is studied by thermodynamic simulation of the high-temperature processes occurring in the carbide–metal matrix system using the Fact Sage software package. The composition of 12Kh18N10T steel is used as the matrix material composition for simulation.
Stress Cracking of the Metal in 08Kh18N9 Steel Pipelines,"The causes and mechanism of metal degradation in damaged regions of heat-exchange pipes (coil) of the sodium–air heat exchanger of the secondary circuit in the IBR-2 research nuclear facility are found due to experimental investigations. The defects that do not lead to the initiation and development of cracks in contact with a sodium coolant are studied. As follows from the experimental results, it is necessary to pay attention to an involuntary change in the heat removal and to the local loads that cause plastic deformation of the pipe metal during erecting work."
Deformation of Corset-Shaped Specimens during Cyclic Heating,"The deformation that develops in a corset specimen during its cyclic heating is analyzed. The plastic deformation in the central part of the specimen, where usually fracture is localized, reaches a very large value of 6–7% (for the thermal conditions typical of thermal fatigue research). This is explained by mechanical deformation due to external cyclically compressed and expanded specimen shoulders, which are rigidly constrained only from the heads. A thermocyclic diagram for a flat corset specimen is given; it differs significantly from the diagram for specimens with a long gauge part (for example, the Coffin technique). Corset specimens are recommended for full-scale tests of products by changing their shape (modeling dangerous regions of the products) and plastic deformation in a wide range."
Technology for Producing a Promising Aluminum-Matrix Composite Material with Discrete Al2O3 Fibers,"The choice of the composition of the components of a composite material that determines its prospects and demand has been substantiated. Liquid-phase combination is used to fabricate billets of an aluminum-matrix composite material of a new composition. The technological problems of introducing discrete Al2O3 nanofibers into an aluminum matrix are solved. A copper powder is used to overcome surface tension forces and to ensure a uniform reinforcing component distribution. When the components of the composite material are prepared, the reinforcing phase consisting of a transport powder and nanofibers is ground and the resulting conglomerate is introduced into a melt to form a composite material. The hardness of the reinforced specimens is higher than the hardness of the matrix, and sufficient uniformity of the hardness distribution over the cross section demonstrates the uniformity of introduced component distribution. An analysis of the fracture of specimens demonstrates a clear predominance of plastic deformation for the initial matrix alloy and an embrittlement effect in the case of reinforcement. Structural studies on a macrolevel show the signs characteristic of brittle fracture, and scanning electron microscopy (Tescan Vega IILMH microscope) studies demonstrate signs of ductile fracture. The fabrication of high-quality specimens and the results of studying the structure and properties confirm the efficiency of the technology developed for the introduction of fillers."
Simulation of the Control System of the Coke Calcination in Tubular Rotary Kilns,"The challenging problem of improving the control of a rotary coke calcining kiln is discussed.

Effect of the Coatings of Mating Parts on the Strength of Interference Fit Joints,An effective method for increasing the strength of fixation of hard-alloy drill bit roller cutters is developed; it consists in the use of galvanic coatings of mating parts. The strengths of the joints with three types of coatings are experimentally studied. Recommendations are developed for the type and thickness of the coatings of the parts of interference fit joints of hard-alloy bits with the mobile elements of drilling tool.
Recombinant FVIIIFc Versus BAY 94-9027 for Treatment of Patients with Haemophilia A: Comparative Efficacy Using a Matching Adjusted Indirect Comparison,Prophylaxis with recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) is the current standard of care for haemophilia A.

Stress detection using deep neural networks,"Over 70% of Americans regularly experience stress. Chronic stress results in cancer, cardiovascular disease, depression, and diabetes, and thus is deeply detrimental to physiological health and psychological wellbeing. Developing robust methods for the rapid and accurate detection of human stress is of paramount importance."
Integrating the social sciences in epidemic preparedness and response: A strategic framework to strengthen capacities and improve Global Health security,"The importance of integrating the social sciences in epidemic preparedness and response has become a common feature of infectious disease policy and practice debates. However to date, this integration remains inadequate, fragmented and under-funded, with limited reach and small initial investments. Based on data collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, in this paper we analysed the variety of knowledge, infrastructure and funding gaps that hinder the full integration of the social sciences in epidemics and present a strategic framework for addressing them."

GEF-independent Ran activation shifts a fraction of the protein to the cytoplasm and promotes cell proliferation,"Ran (Ras-related nuclear protein) plays several important roles in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, mitotic spindle formation, nuclear envelope/nuclear pore complex assembly, and other functions in the cytoplasm, as well as in cellular transformation when switched on. Unlike other members of the GTPase superfamily, Ran binds more tightly to GDP than to GTP due to the presence of an auto-inhibitory C-terminal tail. Multiple missense mutations in the C-terminus of Ran occur in cancers, but their biological significance remains unclear. Here, the quantitative GDP/GTP binding preference of four engineered mutations with unstable C-termini was analyzed using a devised mant-GDP dissociation assay. The results showed that the impact of different C-terminal mutations depends on multiple factors. Although these mutants were more GTP-loaded in human cells, they were shown to be more cytoplasmic, and to support nuclear transport with minimally or partially reduced efficiency. Further, several Ran cancer mutants were compromised in autoinhibition, slightly more GTP-bound, more cytoplasmic, and enhanced the proliferation of A549 and HeLa cells in vitro. Thus, our work reveals a new route of Ran activation independent of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which may account for the hyper-proliferation induced by Ran cancer mutations."
Exceptionally flame-retardant flexible polyurethane foam composites: synergistic effect of the silicone resin/graphene oxide coating,"A facile strategy was developed to fabricate flexible polyurethane (PU) foam composites with exceptional flame retardancy. The approach involves the incorporation of graphene oxide (GO) into a silicone resin (SiR) solution, which is then deposited onto a PU foam surface via the dip-coating technique and cured. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy measurements demonstrated that the SiR and GO were successfully coated onto the PU skeleton and the intrinsic porous structure of the PU foam remained intact. The effects of SiR and GO on the mechanical and thermal stability and flame retardancy of PU composites were evaluated through compression tests, thermogravimetric analysis, vertical combustion tests, and the limiting oxygen index. The measurement results revealed that the composites (PU@SiR-GO) showed superior flame retardancy and thermal and mechanical stability compared to pristine PU or PU coated with SiR alone. The mechanical and thermal stability and the flame-retardant properties of the PU composites were enhanced significantly with increasing GO content. Based on the composition, microstructure, and surface morphology of PU@SiR-GO composites before and after combustion tests, a possible flameretardance mechanism is proposed. This work provides a simple and effective strategy for fabricating flame-retardant composites with improved mechanical performance."
Multi-parent QTL mapping reveals stable QTL conferring resistance to Gibberella ear rot in maize,"Maize production is on risk by Gibberella ear rot (GER) caused by Fusarium graminearum. This is one of the most important ear rot diseases in temperate zones as it leads to yield losses and production of harmful mycotoxins. We investigated, for the first time, the potential use of Brazilian tropical maize to increase resistance levels to GER in temperate European flint germplasm by analyzing six interconnected biparental populations. We assessed GER symptoms in Brazil and in Europe in up to six environments (= location × year combinations) during the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019. We conducted multi-parent QTL and biparental QTL mapping, and identified four QTLs with additive gene action, each explaining 5.4 to 21.8% of the total genotypic variance for GER resistance. Among them, QTL q1 was stable across test environments, populations, and between inbred lines and testcrosses. The accuracies of genomic prediction ranged from 0.50 to 0.59 depending on the resistance donor and prediction model. Jointly, our study reveals the potential use of Brazilian resistance sources to increase GER resistance levels by genomics-assisted breeding."
Metamagnetic transitions and anomalous magnetoresistance in EuAg4As2 crystals,"In this work, we systematically studied the magnetic and transport properties of EuAg4As2 single crystals. It was found that the two antiferromagnetic transitions (TN1 = 10 K and TN2=15 K) were driven to lower temperatures by an applied magnetic field. Below TN1, two successive metamagnetic transitions were observed when a magnetic field was applied in the ab plane (H//ab-plane). For both H//ab and H//c, EuAg4As2 showed a positive, unexpectedly large magnetoresistance (up to 202%) in lower magnetic fields below TN1, and a large negative magnetoresistance (up to −78%) at high fields/intermediate temperatures, thus presenting potential applications in magnetic sensors. Finally, the magnetic phase diagrams of EuAg4As2 were constructed for both H//ab and H//c using the resistivity and magnetisation data."
The Reeb Graph Edit Distance is Universal,"We consider the setting of Reeb graphs of piecewise linear functions and study distances between them that are stable, meaning that functions which are similar in the supremum norm ought to have similar Reeb graphs. We define an edit distance for Reeb graphs and prove that it is stable and universal, meaning that it provides an upper bound to any other stable distance. In contrast, via a specific construction, we show that the interleaving distance and the functional distortion distance on Reeb graphs are not universal."
The situation of elderly with cognitive impairment living at home during lockdown in the Corona-pandemic in Germany,"The outbreak of the Corona virus is a challenge for health care systems worldwide. The aim of this study is to analyze a) knowledge about, and feelings related to the Corona-pandemic.

Airport pavement evaluation systems for maintenance strategies development: a systematic literature review,"Due to the high growth in air transport, combined with the urgency to increase capacity and suitability of the airport infrastructure, the need to adopt more efficient measures in the system arises of pavement management. Aiming to assist researchers in future studies within the theme related to management and initiatives of maintenance on airport pavements, a review of the existing literature was sought regarding the assessment systems and models for pavement conditions. These methodologies are responsible for steering the decision making regarding the actions of treatment and structures rehabilitation. From this, the purpose of this Systematic Review of the literature is to enable the identification of research and relevant contributions, and above all, to serve as a support and database for a greater understanding of the methodologies used in the assessment of airport pavement conditions. Publications were identified on the basis of a structured search strategy, with the selection of 283 papers on the Scopus and Web of Science databases, and after reading the title and abstract, 41 papers were read in full, leading to the implementation of a bibliometric analysis and a qualitative synthesis. It should be noted that among the most important findings and arguments in this article is the use of 15 different methods for prediction of pavement conditions, most of which fall into the category of empirical-mechanistic models. Finally, important considerations are made regarding the limitations and development of future research for decision making in the strategic context of airports pavements maintenance."

Individual optimization of risky decisions in duration and distance estimations,"Many everyday decisions require an accurate perception of how much time has passed since a previous event. Although humans estimate time intervals with a high degree of mean accuracy, the precision of estimations varies greatly between individuals. In situations in which accurate timing is rewarded but responding too early is punished, the optimal amount of risk is directly dependent on the precision of the timer. Previously, it was found that humans and rodents displayed near-optimal adjustment of their mean response time based on their individual precision and the level of punishment. It is as of yet unknown whether these strategies of optimality in interval timing are specific to the timing domain, or instead reflect an ability that generalizes to other sensorimotor modalities of decision making. Here, we address this by combining a temporal reproduction experiment and a distance estimation experiment with an identical reward scheme. We found that participants approached optimality in both tasks, but generally underadjusted their responses in the face of high risk. As this individual adjustment was consistent over modalities, these results can best be explained by assuming that the adjustment of behavior towards optimal performance is driven by a modality independent mechanism."

Rules of Origin across African Regional Trading Agreements: A Landscape with Measures to Address Challenges at Harmonization,"To become operational, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) must harmonize Rules of Origin (ROO) across Africa’s Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) along two dimensions: regime-wide rules and product-specific rules. This paper describes and evaluates these ROO across the major multiple-membership PTAs engaged in these harmonization negotiations. These PTAs include: The Agadir Agreement, the Greater Arab Free Trade Area, the Common Market for East and South Africa, the East Africa Community, the Economic Community of West African States and the Southern African Development Community. To this list we add available regime-wide information on two Free-trade-areas (FTAs): the Tripartite FTA and the AfCFTA. The paper makes three contributions. It provides the first comprehensive description of regime-wide rules (RWR) and product-specific rules (PSR) separately across the main African PTAs. This landscape is built up from the complementary work based on the rules of origin facilitator1 that has categorized the 850 textually distinct PSR across six selected African PTAs. Second, the paper proposes metrics to evaluate differences along three dimensions: (i) wording-based text analysis; (ii) distance measures to indicate regulatory overlap; (iii) ordinal index to measure restrictiveness based of RWR and PSR. Third, it proposes a dashboard for negotiators incorporating the classifications and measures developed in the text along with other indicators."
Self-crystallized Interlayer Integrating Polysulfide-adsorbed TiO2/TiO and Highly-electron-conductive TiO for High-stability Lithium-sulfur Batteries,"Low-cost lithium sulfur(Li-S) batteries afford preeminent prospect as a next-generation high-energy storage device by virtue of great theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, their applications are restricted by some challenging technical barriers, such as weak cycling stability and low poor-conductivity sulfur loading originated in notorious shuttling effect of polysulfide intermediates. Herein, free of any complicated compositing process, we design an interlayer of carbon fiber paper supported TiO2/TiO to impede the shuttle effect and enhance the electrical conductivity via physical isolation and chemical adsorption. Such a self-crystallized homogeneous interlayer, where TiO2/TiO enables absorbing lithium polysulfides(LiPSs) and TiO plays a key role of high-electron-conductivity exhibited ultrahigh capacities(1000 mA·h/g at 0.5 C and 900 mA·h/g at 1 C) and outstanding capacity retention rate(97%) after 100 cycles. Thus, our design provides a simple route to suppress the shuttle effect via self-derived evolution Li-S batteries."
"Design, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-3,11-dione Derivatives as Novel Neuroprotective Agents","A series of pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-3,11-dione derivatives was designed and synthesized, and their neuroprotective activity against SH-SY5Y cell injury induced by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid(NMDA) was evaluated. All the compounds showed significant neuroprotective effects, especially B16, which showed excellent performance and better activity than the positive control ifenprodil(B16: 56.2%±0.6%; ifenprodil: 41.0%±2.7%). Further investigation indicated that B16 could attenuate the Ca2+ influx induced by NMDA in SH-SY5Y cells and Western blotting also showed that B16 could attenuate the NR2B upregulation in SH-SY5Y cells induced by NMDA. The molecular docking results showed that compound B16 fitted in the binding pocket of NR2B-NMDAR well and could interact with binding sites of compounds 1 and 2 simultaneously. The ADME/Tox prediction results suggested that compound B16 had good blood-brain barrier(BBB) permeability and the zero alert of Pan Assay Interference Structures(PAINS) indicated that B16 could not elicit false-positive activities. These results strongly suggest that B16 is a promising and effective candidate neuroprotective compound, and that NR2B-NMDAR is a potential target of B16."
Hydrophobic Interface Cages in Microemulsions: Concept and Experiment Using Tetraphenylethylene-based Double-tailed Surfactant,"Although hydrophobic interface regions adjacent to water droplets play a vital role in microemulsion-based studies, their widespread applications have not been explicitly evoked owing to their small spaces. Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel double-tailed anionic surfactant(TPE-di-C8SS) by linking the propeller-shaped tetraphenylethylene(TPE) with two octyl chains and an anionic sulfonate headgroup through a methoxy-butyl spacer. The extra spacer and steric hindrance between rigid TPE groups can create the large cavities in hydrophobic interface regions, which we call the hydrophobic interface cages(HICs). The potentials and advantages of HICs in the easily-prepared TPE-di-C8SS microemulsion have been implemented by comparing the extraction efficiency towards cationic rhodamine B with Aerosol OT(AOT) microemulsion. The results provided solid evidence that HICs rather than water droplets contributed to a higher extraction efficiency. This work not only proposes a concept of HICs but also provides a new perspective of their utilization in microemulsion-based applications."
"Acquisition and Use of ‘Priors’ in Autism: Typical in Deciding Where to Look, Atypical in Deciding What Is There","Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are thought to under-rely on prior knowledge in perceptual decision-making. This study examined whether this applies to decisions of attention allocation, of relevance for ‘predictive-coding’ accounts of ASD. In a visual search task, a salient but task-irrelevant distractor appeared with higher probability in one display half. Individuals with ASD learned to avoid ‘attentional capture’ by distractors in the probable region as effectively as control participants—indicating typical priors for deploying attention. However, capture by a ‘surprising’ distractor at an unlikely location led to greatly slowed identification of a subsequent target at that location—indicating that individuals with ASD attempt to control surprise (unexpected attentional capture) by over-regulating parameters in post-selective decision-making."
Network model and analysis of the spread of Covid-19 with social distancing,"The first mitigation response to the Covid-19 pandemic was to limit person-to-person interaction as much as possible. This was implemented by the temporary closing of many workplaces and people were required to follow social distancing. Networks are a great way to represent interactions among people and the temporary severing of these interactions. Here, we present a network model of human–human interactions that could be mediators of disease spread. The nodes of this network are individuals and different types of edges denote family cliques, workplace interactions, interactions arising from essential needs, and social interactions. Each individual can be in one of four states: susceptible, infected, immune, and dead. The network and the disease parameters are informed by the existing literature on Covid-19. Using this model, we simulate the spread of an infectious disease in the presence of various mitigation scenarios. For example, lockdown is implemented by deleting edges that denote non-essential interactions. We validate the simulation results with the real data by matching the basic and effective reproduction numbers during different phases of the spread. We also simulate different possibilities of the slow lifting of the lockdown by varying the transmission rate as facilities are slowly opened but people follow prevention measures like wearing masks etc. We make predictions on the probability and intensity of a second wave of infection in each of these scenarios."
An experimental investigation on the nano-fly ash preparation and its effects on the performance of self-compacting concrete at normal and elevated temperatures,"Previous research regarding the performance of self-compacting concrete (SCC) incorporating nano-fly ash (NFA), especially after exposure to elevated temperatures, is scarce. Therefore, this experimental research was conducted to investigate the influence of NFA particles on the performance of SCC at normal and elevated temperatures. The effects of NFA particles were also compared with the influence of fly ash (FA) particles at the same replacement percentages. The experimental program was managed at two stages. At the first stage, the microparticles of FA were transformed into nanoparticles using electric milling process. The size, shape, and consistency of the FA and NFA particles were characterized using scanning electron microscopy. In the second stage, experimental tests were performed to examine the influences of FA and NFA particles on the performance and characteristics of SCC. The investigated parameters included fresh density, dry density, T50 slump flow time, slump flow diameter, elastic modulus, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), and compressive as well as flexural strength. Furthermore, the residual compressive strength, weight loss, and UPV after exposing the concrete samples to 700 °C were also investigated. The results showed that addition of FA and NFA can cause a reduction in the workability as well as flowability of SCC mixtures. On the other hand, the transformation of FA to NFA significantly enhanced the microstructure of the SCC, which led to the enhancement of its mechanical properties and boosted the resistance of the SCC to high temperatures. The outcomes of this study also illustrated that through transforming the particles of FA from microscale to nanoscale, a sustainable and high-performance SCC can be produced."
Seewis hantavirus in common shrew (Sorex araneus) in Sweden,"Rodent borne hantaviruses are emerging viruses infecting humans through inhalation. They cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hemorrhagic cardiopulmonary syndrome. Recently, hantaviruses have been detected in other small mammals such as Soricomorpha (shrews, moles) and Chiroptera (bats), suggested as reservoirs for potential pandemic viruses and to play a role in the evolution of hantaviruses. It is important to study the global virome in different reservoirs, therefore our aim was to investigate whether shrews in Sweden carried any hantaviruses. Moreover, to accurately determine the host species, we developed a molecular method for identification of shrews."
Bending analysis of five-layer curved functionally graded sandwich panel in magnetic field: closed-form solution,"In this paper, an exact closed-form solution for a curved sandwich panel with two piezoelectric layers as actuator and sensor that are inserted in the top and bottom facings is presented. The core is made from functionally graded (FG) material that has heterogeneous power-law distribution through the radial coordinate. It is assumed that the core is subjected to a magnetic field whereas the core is covered by two insulated composite layers. To determine the exact solution, first characteristic equations are derived for different material types in a polar coordinate system, namely, magneto-elastic, elastic, and electro-elastic for the FG, orthotropic, and piezoelectric materials, respectively. The displacement-based method is used instead of the stress-based method to derive a set of closed-form real-valued solutions for both real and complex roots. Based on the elasticity theory, exact solutions for the governing equations are determined layer-by-layer that are considerably more accurate than typical simplified theories. The accuracy of the presented method is compared and validated with the available literature and the finite element simulation. The effects of geometrical and material parameters such as FG index, angular span along with external conditions such as magnetic field, mechanical pressure, and electrical difference are investigated in detail through numerical examples."
Organic Nanocrystals Based on a Solid-emission-tunable AIEgen for Cell Imaging,"The development of fluorescent nanocrystals based on organic small molecules is of great importance in bioimaging due to the merits of easy modification, high brightness and excellent photostability, however suffering from the emission-detrimental aggregation-caused quenching(ACQ) effect. Herein, we successfully designed and synthesized an AIE-active di(N, N-dimethylaniline)-dibenzofulvene(named as NFTPE), which exhibits the crystallization-induced emission enhancement(CIEE) effect. Interestingly, two types of yellow- and orange-emissive crystals for NFTPE were obtained, exhibiting aggregation microenvironment-dependent emission tuning in the solid state. Single-crystal analysis and density functional theory(DFT) calculations reveal that different aggregation microenvironments result in the distinct molecular conformation for various emission. Excitingly, the crystallization of NFTPE in an aqueous solution under the assistance of amphiphilic PEG polymer matrices could be monitored in situ by the fluorescence changes, facilitating the preparation of NFTPE nanocrystals(NFTPE-NCs) by adjusting the aggregation microenvironment. The obtained NFTPE-NCs exhibit the superior performance in cell imaging in respect to high brightness, photostability, and biocompatibility, thus demonstrating the potential in bioimaging applications."
The naturalness in the BLMSSM and B-LSSM,"In order to interpret the Higgs boson mass and its decays naturally, we hope to examine the BLMSSM and B-LSSM. In the both models, the right-handed neutrino superfields are introduced to better explain the neutrino mass problems. In this paper, we introduce the fine-tuning to acquire the physical Higgs boson mass. Besides, the method of \(\chi ^2\) analyses will be adopted in the BLMSSM and B-LSSM to fit the experimental data. Therefore, we can obtain the reasonable theoretical values of the Higgs decays and muon \(g-2\) that are in accordance with the experimental results respectively in the BLMSSM and B-LSSM."
Dependency parsing of biomedical text with BERT,"Syntactic analysis, or parsing, is a key task in natural language processing and a required component for many text mining approaches. In recent years, Universal Dependencies (UD) has emerged as the leading formalism for dependency parsing. While a number of recent tasks centering on UD have substantially advanced the state of the art in multilingual parsing, there has been only little study of parsing texts from specialized domains such as biomedicine."
A Performance Evaluation of Classic Convolutional Neural Networks for 2D and 3D Palmprint and Palm Vein Recognition,"Palmprint recognition and palm vein recognition are two emerging biometrics technologies. In the past two decades, many traditional methods have been proposed for palmprint recognition and palm vein recognition, and have achieved impressive results. However, the research on deep learning-based palmprint recognition and palm vein recognition is still very preliminary. In this paper, in order to investigate the problem of deep learning based 2D and 3D palmprint recognition and palm vein recognition in-depth, we conduct performance evaluation of seventeen representative and classic convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on one 3D palmprint database, five 2D palmprint databases and two palm vein databases. A lot of experiments have been carried out in the conditions of different network structures, different learning rates, and different numbers of network layers. We have also conducted experiments on both separate data mode and mixed data mode. Experimental results show that these classic CNNs can achieve promising recognition results, and the recognition performance of recently proposed CNNs is better. Particularly, among classic CNNs, one of the recently proposed classic CNNs, i.e., EfficientNet achieves the best recognition accuracy. However, the recognition performance of classic CNNs is still slightly worse than that of some traditional recognition methods."
Globins in the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii shed new light on hemoglobin evolution in bilaterians,"How vascular systems and their respiratory pigments evolved is still debated. While many animals present a vascular system, hemoglobin exists as a blood pigment only in a few groups (vertebrates, annelids, a few arthropod and mollusk species). Hemoglobins are formed of globin sub-units, belonging to multigene families, in various multimeric assemblages. It was so far unclear whether hemoglobin families from different bilaterian groups had a common origin."
"New possibilities for the synthesis of high-molecular weight poly(2,5(6)-benzimidazole) and studies of its solutions in DMSO-based complex organic solvent","New possibilities for the synthesis of high-molecular weight poly(2,5(6)-benzimidazole) (ABPBI) based on a new monomer, 3,4-diaminobenzoic acid monophosphate, in polyphosphoric acid medium at high monomer concentration under stirring and on a Teflon® surface without stirring are investigated. New complex solvent for ABPBI is found. This solvent is based on dimethyl sulfoxide, methanol, and potassium hydroxide. For the first time, molecular weight values are obtained by dynamic light scattering and viscometry in complex solvent. In addition, Kuhn segment values are estimated. Maximal molecular mass MDη value reaches 94 kDa. The values of macromolecular equilibrium rigidity A are estimated as 4.4–5.7 nm according to translational diffusion coefficient and 3.3 nm according to intrinsic viscosity measurements."
"Quantum chemical calculation of the primary thermolysis reactions of 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene (FOX-7)","The primary thermolysis reactions of 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene FOX-7 (1), one of the promising energetic materials, were studied. A number of competing reactions of the primary thermolysis step was calculated: nitro group elimination, rearrangement of the nitro group to the nitrite group, transfer of oxygen and hydrogen atoms to the neighboring carbon atom, and transfer of hydrogen atom to oxygen of the nitro group. The reactions were modeled by the DFT PBE0 method with the cc-pVDZ basis set and by the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ method. The activation enthalpies (ΔHa) of several reaction channels range from 200 to 260 kJ mol−1, and they should be taken into account when estimating the thermal stability of the compounds analogous to compound 1. For compound 1, the highest contribution to the overall thermolysis rate is made by the transfer of the hydrogen atom from the amino group to the carbon atom at the nitro groups. This reaction can proceed via four different channels with ΔHa = 200, 206, 235, and 242 kJ mol−1. For the oxygen atom transfer to carbon ΔHa = 244 kJ mol−1, and for the nitro-nitrite isomerization reaction ΔHa = 263 kJ mol−1. The hydrogen atom transfer to oxygen of the nitro group with the formation of nitronic acid (intermediate product) is characterized by the lowest activation energy (130 kJ mol−1), but further transformations via this route occur with higher (more than 300 kJ mol−1) ΔHa values. The checking of the DFT results at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ level showed that the first method only slightly overestimated the energies of various stated over the initial compound 1 and correctly described the ratio of rates of various thermolysis routes."
"Synthesis of nitroxy and nitraza derivatives of 1,1-dinitroalkyldiazene 1-oxides","New high energy nitroxy and nitraza derivatives of 1-(1,1-dinitroalkyl)-2-methyl- and 1-(1,1-dinitroalkyl)-2-furazanyldiazene 1-oxides were synthesized by nitration of the corresponding hydroxy and sulfamide derivatives."
Nitromethane as a reagent for the synthesis of 3-nitroindoles from 2-haloarylamine derivatives,A new approach to the synthesis of 3-nitroindoles using palladium-catalyzed arylation of nitromethane with N-(2-bromoaryl)imidates was developed. A convenient and rapid method for cyclization of ethyl N-(2-nitromethylaryl)acetimidates to 2-methyl-3-nitro-1H-indoles was proposed.
tert-Butoxychloromethylphenylsilane: synthesis and reactivity,"The reaction of dichloromethylphenylsilane with tert-butanol in the presence of a hydrogen chloride acceptor gave tert-butoxychloromethylphenylsilane. The product is stable at room temperature for a week, undergoing disproportionation upon more prolonged storage. Its reaction with 2-substituted ethanols XCH2CH2OH (X = Cl, MeNH, PhCH2N, PhN) in the presence of bases gives the corresponding polyfunctional silanes MePhSi(OBut)(OCH2CH2X). Alkylation of such N-substituted derivatives with (chloromethyl)triethoxysilane results in polyfunctional α-silyl amines MePhSi(OBut)OCH2CH2N(R)CH2Si(OEt)3 (R = Me, Bn). The structures of all synthesized compounds were confirmed by IR and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy."
Sorption and diffusion behavior of actinium(iii) ions in contact with hydroxyapatite as a transporter of medical radionuclides,"The sorption of the actinium(iii) ions as 225,228Ac isotopes on hydroxyapatite (HAP) with various textures was studied. A “reverse” generator using an extraction chromatographic sorbent based on diglycolamide derivative (DGA Resin) was proposed for 228Ac production. The chemical yield of the product was ≥90%. The optimal acidity of the solution during sorption (pH 6–7) and the ratio of solid and liquid phases (20 mg of the sorbent per mL of the solution) were determined in preliminary experiments. The process kinetics is adequately described by pseudo-second-order model. The stationary state is reached rapidly (in 10 min) when a HAP suspension is used, whereas time (20–30 min) is needed for textured samples. The possibility of actinium ion diffusion within the bulk of these samples is shown. The diffusion coefficient of actinium estimated by diffusion in a wet HAP paste layer (one-dimensional model) was (1.0±0.2) • 10−7 cm2 s−1."
Voltammetric Method for Determination of Glutathione on a Gold-Carbon-Containing Electrode,"Glutathione (GSH) is one of the most important thiol-containing antioxidants involved in various biochemical processes in the human body. Glutathione determination in biological fluids (saliva, urine, serum) and pharmaceutical preparations is rather important for clinical practice. Various analytical methods such as spectrophotometry, fluorimetry, high-performance liquid chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, capillary electrophoresis, and electrochemical methods are widely used for this purpose. Electrochemical methods are characterized by easy implementation, low cost, and possibility of miniaturization. The electrochemical behavior of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione on a gold-carbon-containing electrode (AuCE) was studied using cathodic voltammetry with different methods of removing oxygen from an electrochemical cell: nitrogen sparging and addition of sodium sulfite (4 mol/dm3). It has been shown that traces of H2O2 that remain in the near-electrode layer on the AuCE even after oxygen removal influence the electrochemical properties of GSH at a cathode sweep of the potential from 0 to –1.8 V: GSH is oxidized by H2O2 to GSSG; the most important product of this reaction is O2. An indirect determination of GSH by the current of oxygen reduction in the Na2SO3 medium in the concentration range from 0.5 × 10–8 to 4.2 × 10–8 mol/dmm3 with a detection limit of 2.5 × 10–9 mol/dm3 is proposed. The developed voltammetric method is approved for the determination of GSH in certain pharmaceutical preparations."
Calibration Standard Samples for Multielement Analysis of Silicate Rocks Using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry with Laser Ablation,"A comparison of different standard samples—artificial glass SRM-612 (Standard Reference Material) and standard samples of natural composition SG-1A, SG-3, ST-1A, and SGD-1A—used for external calibration in the elemental analysis of silicate rocks in the form of fused glasses by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and laser ablation (LA-ICP-MS) is carried out with a goal of selecting the most suitable samples for plotting the calibration dependence upon determination of the major and trace elements when using LA-ICP-MS for routine analysis. The results showed that the error of determination for both major and trace elements is lower (compared to SRM-612) when external calibration is carried out using the reference materials of natural composition with Si and Fe contents close to those in the analyzed samples. The use of internal standards in both cases decreases the systematic error attributed to the drift of LA parameters and different ablation yields. The correctness of the determination of 28 elements is proved in comparison of the results of the analysis of four standard samples with the reference values. The obtained results are used to select calibration standards for LA-ICP-MS analysis of the samples of unknown composition. The results of analysis of six samples of unknown composition match within the error limit the results of X-ray fluorescence analysis (major elements) and ICP-MS (trace elements in solutions). Refining of the content of trace elements in the previously certified reference materials allows them to be used for calibration in routine analysis of geological rocks. The developed LA-ICP-MS technique is a rapid method for determination of a wide range of elements, in particular, rare earth elements, in silicate rocks and can be used for routine analysis without additional sample preparation after X-ray fluorescence analysis."
Analytical Capabilities of a Grand Spectrometer in Analysis of Solutions Using Inductively Coupled Plasma,"It has been shown that Grand spectrometers based on a hybrid assembly of BLPP-2000 photodetector arrays produced by VMK-Optoelektronika can be used for atomic emission spectral analysis of solutions using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). For the prototype of a Grand-ICP spectrometer consisting of a Grand spectrometer, RF plasma generator, and RF (radio frequency) power supply the following analytical characteristics were determined: element detection limit, long-term stability linear ranges of calibration graphs for several elements, and optimal operating parameters of the RF generator. The linear concentration range of analyte elements is 105 when using a single analytical line of the element. The long-term stability is less than 2% in 6 h without using an internal standard. The detection limits are comparable to those of modern ICP spectrometers with an axial plasma view and lie in a range of sub-microgram per liter. It has been found that the effect of superposition of the spectral lines of the plasma background, for example, OH molecular lines or others, on the analyte lines can be eliminated by subtracting the blank sample spectrum from the analyte spectrum using Atom software. The analytical characteristics of the spectrometer allow the use of the device both for developing new ICP-based systems and for restoring the performance of defective ICP spectrometers."
High-Speed Multichannel MAES Analyzers Based on BLPP-2000 and BLPP-4000 Photodetector Arrays,"The main directions in the development of the spectral systems for scintillation atomic emission analysis of powdered geological samples are aimed at increasing the sensitivity, spectral resolution, and speed of the spectrum analysis to reduce the detection limits. The goal of this study is development of high-speed multichannel emission spectrum analyzers with hybrid assemblies of arrays consisting of 14 photodetectors of two types, high-sensitivity BLPP-2000 array and high spatial resolution BLPP-4000 array, and theoretical estimation of the signal-to-noise ratio for scintillation and integral spectra recorded with the aforementioned photodetectors. The design of the high-speed MAES analyzers with BLPP-2000 and BLPP-4000 photodetector arrays provides parallel readout of arrays in hybrid assemblies. The Grand spectrometer equipped with such arrays consisting of 14 BLPP-2000 or BLPP-4000 photodetectors can record spectra in the 190–350 nm wavelength range. The minimum exposure time is 0.9 and 1.7 ms, respectively. It is shown that, when intensities of spectral lines are measured using the BLPP-2000 arrays, the signal-to-noise ratio is 3 times higher in integral analysis and 5 times higher in scintillation analysis as compared to measurements using the BLPP-4000 arrays."
Improvement of Sample Preparation in ICP-AES Analysis of Ferroalloys,"A set of ICP-AES techniques has been developed for determination of rated elements: Ti, Si, P, Al, Cu, Mo, V, Sn, and Zr in ferrotitanium; Ni, Fe, Cu, Co, and As in ferronickel; Si, Cr, and P in ferrochrome silicon; Zr, Si, Al, P, and Cu in zirconium ferrosilicon; Mn, Si, and P in manganese ferrosilicon. Combination of the multielement ICP-AES method which allows precise determination of the elements in ferroalloys in a wide range of concentrations and the microwave preparation of samples in closed autoclaves which excludes the loss of the components to be determined provides the rapidity of the analysis procedure. The composition of solutions for opening samples of ferroalloys and the temperature–time modes of microwave sample preparation in an autoclave are substantiated. Conditions for ICP-AES determination of the rated elements in ferroalloys are studied. Analytical lines of the elements to be determined free from significant spectral overlaps are chosen. The dilution rates of the solutions are determined. The method of internal standard was used to improve the reproducibility of the analytical signal for Ti determination in ferrotitanium, Si and Cr in ferrochrome silicon, and all rated elements in manganese ferrosilicon and ferronickel. The spectrometer was calibrated using model solutions and solutions of standard samples with additions of the certified solutions of the elements to be determined. To determine Ti, Si, P, Al, Cu, V, and Zr in ferrotitanium; Ni, Fe, Cu, and Co in ferronickel; Si, Cr, and P in ferrochrome silicon; Zr, Si, Al, P, and Cu in zirconium ferrosilicon; Si and P in manganese ferrosilicon, a multidimensional graduation by two analytical lines was used. The correctness of the determination was evaluated in analysis of standard samples of ferroalloys and comparative analysis of the obtained results with the data of standard methods: comparison of the variances according to the Fisher criterion did not reveal any significant difference between them, whereas the use of the modified Student test showed the absence of a systematic error."
Electro- and Magnetoactive Materials in Medicine: A Review of Existing and Potential Areas of Application,"The review covers problems related to development and application of a new type of “smart” medical materials, mainly, for regeneration of bone tissue that are capable of creating additional stimuli influencing the regeneration process. Application of ferroelectric and magnetoelastic materials is discussed, including their use as sensors and actuators. Physical and materials science principles of development, along with examples of using composite magnetoelectric materials of the piezoelectric/magnetoelastic type as magnetically controlled scaffolds creating local electric fields, are analyzed."
A High-Speed Spectral Pyrometer Based on a Kolibri-2 Spectrometer,"The operating speed of commercially available spectral-ratio pyrometers and brightness pyrometers often appears insufficient for control of a fast-changing temperature (e.g., in a graphite cell of an AAS electrothermal atomizer, whose temperature increases at a rate of 104 °C/s). An advantage of spectral pyrometers is high speed and ability to measure the temperature of objects with unknown emissivity. The goal of this work is to develop a high-speed spectral pyrometer based on a Kolibri-2 spectrometer with a BLPP-2000 photodetector array that provides a working wavelength range of 400–1050 nm and a minimum basic exposure time of 0.4 ms. The temperature was calculated by plotting the emission spectrum of the object in Wien coordinates (with allowance for calibration of the spectral pyrometer using a radiation source of known temperature) and by measuring the slope angle of the obtained graph. The relative error of temperature measurements with a spectral pyrometer estimated by comparing the measurement results and the data obtained with a calibrated Termokont-TN5S1M single-channel pyrometer (Termokont company) was no more than 1.5% in a temperature range of 1000–2400°C and higher and the operating speed was up to 2500 measurements/s. The results of measuring the temperature of the graphite cell in the electrothermal atomizer using a spectral pyrometer during sample atomization at a rate of the temperature increase up to 10 000°C/s are presented."
Integrating the second near-infrared fluorescence imaging with clinical techniques for multimodal cancer imaging by neodymium-doped gadolinium tungstate nanoparticles,"Second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging is a recently emerged technique and is highly useful for accurate diagnosis of cancer. Although a diverse array of fluorescent nanomaterials have been developed to enable NIR-II fluorescence in various situations, they normally fail to unify the clinical techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therefore, exploiting multimodal agents to integrate the newly emerged NIR-II fluorescence and traditional clinical techniques would be of key significance. Here, we report a rational fabrication of neodymium (Nd)-doped gadolinium tungstate nanoparticles (NPs) that are subsequentially decorated with a hydrophilic layer and demonstrate that they can achieve the harmonious integration of NIR-II fluorescence imaging, CT, and MRI. The NIR-II fluorescence emission was activated by an incident light with discrete wavelength ranging from 250 to 810 nm. NIR-II fluorescence-CT-MRI associated trimodal imaging was subsequently demonstrated for breast cancer by an 808 nm laser, along with the estimation of NIR-II fluorescence imaging for cervical cancer. The integration of newly emerged and traditional clinical imaging techniques highlights the huge potential of rare-earth-doped NPs for multimodal imaging of different types of cancer."
Versatile iron-vitamin K3 derivative-based nanoscale coordination polymer augments tumor ferroptotic therapy,"Ferroptosis is a newly form of regulated cell death, which has attracted great attention for tumor therapy. Herein, we prepared nanoscale coordination polymer Fe-NQA particles to deliver iron and NQA (vitamin K3 derivative) into tumor cells, which synergistically promoted ferroptotic therapy for inhibiting tumor growth, preventing metastasis, and overcoming radioresistance."
Ion implantation assisted synthesis of graphene on various dielectric substrates,"Direct synthesis of high-quality graphene on dielectric substrates is of great importance for the application of graphene-based electronics and optoelectronics. However, high-quality and uniform graphene film growth on dielectric substrates has proven challenging due to limited catalytic ability of dielectric substrates. Here, by employing a Cu ion implantation assisted method, high-quality and uniform graphene can be directly formed on various dielectric substrates including SiO2/Si, quartz glass, and sapphire substrates. The growth rate of graphene on the dielectric substrates was significantly improved due to the catalysis of Cu. Moreover, during the graphene growth process, the Cu atoms gradually evaporated away without involving any metal contamination. Furthermore, an interesting growth behavior of graphene on sapphire substrate was observed, and the results show the graphene domains growth tends to grow along the sapphire flat terraces. The ion implantation assisted approach could open up a new pathway for the direct synthesis of graphene and promote the potential application of graphene in electronics."
Carrier mobility tuning of MoS2 by strain engineering in CVD growth process,"Strain engineering is proposed to be an effective technology to tune the properties of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Conventional strain engineering techniques (e.g., mechanical bending, heating) cannot conserve strain due to their dependence on external action, which thereby limits the application in electronics. In addition, the theoretically predicted strain-induced tuning of electrical performance of TMDCs has not been experimentally proved yet. Here, a facile but effective approach is proposed to retain and tune the biaxial tensile strain in monolayer MoS2 by adjusting the process of the chemical vapor deposition (CVD). To prove the feasibility of this method, the strain formation model of CVD grown MoS2 is proposed which is supported by the calculated strain dependence of band gap via the density functional theory (DFT). Next, the electrical properties tuning of strained monolayer MoS2 is demonstrated in experiment, where the carrier mobility of MoS2 was increased by two orders (∼ 0.15 to ∼ 23 cm2·V−1·s−1). The proposed pathway of strain preservation and regulation will open up the optics application of strain engineering and the fabrication of high performance electronic devices in 2D materials."
Manganese nanodepot augments host immune response against coronavirus,"Interferon (IFN) responses are central to host defense against coronavirus and other virus infections. Manganese (Mn) is capable of inducing IFN production, but its applications are limited by nonspecific distributions and neurotoxicity. Here, we exploit chemical engineering strategy to fabricate a nanodepot of manganese (nanoMn) based on Mn2+. Compared with free Mn2+, nanoMn enhances cellular uptake and persistent release of Mn2+ in a pH-sensitive manner, thus strengthening IFN response and eliciting broad-spectrum antiviral effects in vitro and in vivo. Preferentially phagocytosed by macrophages, nanoMn promotes M1 macrophage polarization and recruits monocytes into inflammatory foci, eventually augmenting antiviral immunity and ameliorating coronavirus-induced tissue damage. Besides, nanoMn can also potentiate the development of virus-specific memory T cells and host adaptive immunity through facilitating antigen presentation, suggesting its potential as a vaccine adjuvant. Pharmacokinetic and safety evaluations uncover that nanoMn treatment hardly induces neuroinflammation through limiting neuronal accumulation of manganese. Therefore, nanoMn offers a simple, safe, and robust nanoparticle-based strategy against coronavirus."
Clinical outcome after lumbar spinal fusion surgery in degenerative spondylolisthesis: a 3-year follow-up,Lumbar spinal fusion surgery is a widely accepted surgical treatment in degenerative causes of lumbar spondylolisthesis. The benefit of reduction of anterior displacement and restoration of sagittal parameters is still controversially debated. Purpose of the underlying publication was to analyze the influence of radiographic sagittal parameters of the spine in aspects of changes in postoperative clinical outcome.
3D endoscopy shows enhanced anatomical details and depth perception vs 2D: a multicentre study,"The current standard endoscopic technique is a high resolution visualisation up to Full HD and even 4 K. A recent development are 3D endoscopes providing a 3-dimensional picture, which supposedly gives additional information of depth, anatomical details and orientation in the surgical field. Since the 3D-endoscopic technique is new, little scientific evidence is known whether the new technique provides advantages for the surgeon compared to the 2D-endoscopic standard technique in FESS. This study compares the standard 2D-endoscopic surgical technique with the new commercially available 3D-endoscopic technique."
"Monitoring metabolism of synthetic cannabinoid 4F-MDMB-BINACA via high-resolution mass spectrometry assessed in cultured hepatoma cell line, fungus, liver microsomes and confirmed using urine samples","A tert-leucinate derivative synthetic cannabinoid, methyl (2S)-2-([1-(4-fluorobutyl)-1H-indazole-3-carbonyl]amino)-3,3-dimethylbutanoate (4F-MDMB-BINACA, 4F-MDMB-BUTINACA or 4F-ADB) is known to adversely impact health. This study aimed to evaluate the suitability of three different modes of monitoring metabolism: HepG2 liver cells, fungus Cunninghamella elegans (C. elegans) and pooled human liver microsomes (HLM) for comparison with human in-vivo metabolism in identifying suitable urinary marker(s) for 4F-MDMB-BINACA intake."
Neurological update: use of cardiac troponin in patients with stroke,"Cardiac troponin is a specific and sensitive biomarker to identify and quantify myocardial injury. Myocardial injury is frequently detected after acute ischemic stroke and strongly associated with unfavorable outcomes. Concomitant acute coronary syndrome is only one of several possible differential diagnoses that may cause elevation of cardiac troponin after stroke. As a result, there are uncertainties regarding the correct interpretation and optimal management of stroke patients with myocardial injury in clinical practice. Elevation of cardiac troponin may occur as part of a ‘Stroke-Heart Syndrome’. The term ‘Stroke-Heart Syndrome’ subsumes a clinical spectrum of cardiac complications after stroke including cardiac injury, dysfunction, and arrhythmia which may relate to disturbances of autonomic function and the brain–heart axis. In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview about prognostic implications, mechanisms, and management of elevated cardiac troponin levels in patients with acute ischemic stroke."
Distinguishing intrinsic photon correlations from external noise with frequency-resolved homodyne detection,"In this work, we apply homodyne detection to investigate the frequency-resolved photon statistics of a cw light field emitted by a driven-dissipative semiconductor system in real time. We demonstrate that studying the frequency dependence of the photon number noise allows us to distinguish intrinsic noise properties of the emitter from external noise sources such as mechanical noise while maintaining a sub-picosecond temporal resolution. We further show that performing postselection on the recorded data opens up the possibility to study rare events in the dynamics of the emitter. By doing so, we demonstrate that in rare instances, additional external noise may actually result in reduced photon number noise in the emission."
Grafted human induced pluripotent stem cells improve the outcome of spinal cord injury: modulation of the lesion microenvironment,"Spinal cord injury results in irreversible tissue damage followed by a very limited recovery of function. In this study we investigated whether transplantation of undifferentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into the injured rat spinal cord is able to induce morphological and functional improvement. hiPSCs were grafted intraspinally or intravenously one week after a thoracic (T11) spinal cord contusion injury performed in Fischer 344 rats. Grafted animals showed significantly better functional recovery than the control rats which received only contusion injury. Morphologically, the contusion cavity was significantly smaller, and the amount of spared tissue was significantly greater in grafted animals than in controls. Retrograde tracing studies showed a statistically significant increase in the number of FB-labeled neurons in different segments of the spinal cord, the brainstem and the sensorimotor cortex. The extent of functional improvement was inversely related to the amount of chondroitin-sulphate around the cavity and the astrocytic and microglial reactions in the injured segment. The grafts produced GDNF, IL-10 and MIP1-alpha for at least one week. These data suggest that grafted undifferentiated hiPSCs are able to induce morphological and functional recovery after spinal cord contusion injury."
Physical distancing and risk of COVID-19 in small-scale fisheries: a remote sensing assessment in coastal Ghana,"The novel coronavirus is predicted to have dire implications on global food systems including fisheries value chains due to restrictions imposed on human movements in many countries. In Ghana, food production, both agriculture and fisheries, is exempted from restrictions as an essential service. The enforcement of COVID-19 prevention protocols, particularly social distancing, has been widely reported in Ghana’s agricultural markets whereas casual observations and media reports on fish landing sites suggest no such enforcements are in place. This study aimed to provide sound scientific evidence as a basis for informed policy direction and intervention for the artisanal fishing sector in these challenging times. We employed an unmanned aerial vehicle in assessing the risk of artisanal fishers to the pandemic using physical distancing as a proxy. From analysis of cumulative distribution function (G-function) of the nearest-neighbour distances, this study underscored crowding at all surveyed fish landing beaches, and identified potential “hotspots” for disease transmission. Aerial measurements taken at times of peak landing beach activity indicated that the highest proportion of people, representing 56%, 48%, 39% and 78% in Elmina, Winneba, Apam and Mumford respectively, were located at distances of less than one metre from their nearest neighbour. Risk of crowding was independent of the population at the landing beaches, suggesting that all categories of fish landing sites along the coast would require equal urgency and measured attention towards preventing and mitigating the spread of the disease."
Observations on early fungal infections with relevance for replant disease in fine roots of the rose rootstock Rosa corymbifera 'Laxa',"Replant disease is a worldwide phenomenon affecting various woody plant genera and species, especially within the Rosaceae. Compared to decades of intensive studies regarding replant disease of apple (ARD), the replant disease of roses (RRD) has hardly been investigated. The etiology of RRD is also still unclear and a remedy desperately needed. In greenhouse pot trials with seedlings of the RRD-sensitive rootstock Rosa corymbifera ‘Laxa’ cultured in replant disease affected soils from two different locations, early RRD symptom development was studied in fine roots. In microscopic analyses we found similarities to ARD symptoms with regards to structural damages, impairment in the root hair status, and necroses and blackening in the cortex tissue. Examinations of both whole mounts and thin sections of fine root segments revealed frequent conspicuous fungal infections in association with the cellular disorders. Particularly striking were fungal intracellular structures with pathogenic characteristics that are described for the first time. Isolated fungi from these tissue areas were identified by means of ITS primers, and many of them were members of the Nectriaceae. In a next step, 35 of these isolates were subjected to a multi-locus sequence analysis and the results revealed that several genera and species were involved in the development of RRD within a single rose plant. Inoculations with selected single isolates (Rugonectria rugulosa and Ilyonectria robusta) in a Perlite assay confirmed their pathogenic relationship to early necrotic host plant reactions, and symptoms were similar to those exhibited in ARD."
Extracorporeal shockwave therapy versus musculoskeletal mesotherapy for Achilles tendinopathy in athlete,"Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is considered the commonest tendon pathology, occurring mainly in athletes. Different conservative treatment options have been introduced but with short-term effects; however, extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) and mesotherapy (MT) injections were claimed to provide longer effects and could be used in cases failure of response to conservative treatments."
Rules of Origin across African Regional Trading Agreements: A Landscape with Measures to Address Challenges at Harmonization,"To become operational, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) must harmonize Rules of Origin (ROO) across Africa’s Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) along two dimensions: regime-wide rules and product-specific rules. This paper describes and evaluates these ROO across the major multiple-membership PTAs engaged in these harmonization negotiations. These PTAs include: The Agadir Agreement, the Greater Arab Free Trade Area, the Common Market for East and South Africa, the East Africa Community, the Economic Community of West African States and the Southern African Development Community. To this list we add available regime-wide information on two Free-trade-areas (FTAs): the Tripartite FTA and the AfCFTA. The paper makes three contributions. It provides the first comprehensive description of regime-wide rules (RWR) and product-specific rules (PSR) separately across the main African PTAs. This landscape is built up from the complementary work based on the rules of origin facilitator1 that has categorized the 850 textually distinct PSR across six selected African PTAs. Second, the paper proposes metrics to evaluate differences along three dimensions: (i) wording-based text analysis; (ii) distance measures to indicate regulatory overlap; (iii) ordinal index to measure restrictiveness based of RWR and PSR. Third, it proposes a dashboard for negotiators incorporating the classifications and measures developed in the text along with other indicators."
"Dynamic parameter estimation and prediction over consecutive scales, based on moving horizon estimation: applied to an industrial cell culture seed train","Bioprocess modeling has become a useful tool for prediction of the process future with the aim to deduce operating decisions (e.g. transfer or feeds). Due to variabilities, which often occur between and within batches, updating (re-estimation) of model parameters is required at certain time intervals (dynamic parameter estimation) to obtain reliable predictions. This can be challenging in the presence of low sampling frequencies (e.g. every 24 h), different consecutive scales and large measurement errors, as in the case of cell culture seed trains. This contribution presents an iterative learning workflow which generates and incorporates knowledge concerning cell growth during the process by using a moving horizon estimation (MHE) approach for updating of model parameters. This estimation technique is compared to a classical weighted least squares estimation (WLSE) approach in the context of model updating over three consecutive cultivation scales (40–2160 L) of an industrial cell culture seed train. Both techniques were investigated regarding robustness concerning the aforementioned challenges and the required amount of experimental data (estimation horizon). It is shown how the proposed MHE can deal with the aforementioned difficulties by the integration of prior knowledge, even if only data at two sampling points are available, outperforming the classical WLSE approach. This workflow allows to adequately integrate current process behavior into the model and can therefore be a suitable component of a digital twin."

Grafted human induced pluripotent stem cells improve the outcome of spinal cord injury: modulation of the lesion microenvironment,"Spinal cord injury results in irreversible tissue damage followed by a very limited recovery of function. In this study we investigated whether transplantation of undifferentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into the injured rat spinal cord is able to induce morphological and functional improvement. hiPSCs were grafted intraspinally or intravenously one week after a thoracic (T11) spinal cord contusion injury performed in Fischer 344 rats. Grafted animals showed significantly better functional recovery than the control rats which received only contusion injury. Morphologically, the contusion cavity was significantly smaller, and the amount of spared tissue was significantly greater in grafted animals than in controls. Retrograde tracing studies showed a statistically significant increase in the number of FB-labeled neurons in different segments of the spinal cord, the brainstem and the sensorimotor cortex.

The grafts produced GDNF, IL-10 and MIP1-alpha for at least one week.

"Associating Emergency Medical Services personnel’s workload, trauma exposure, and health with the cortisol, endocannabinoid, and N-acylethanolamine concentrations in their hair","In their line of duty, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel are exposed to chronically stressful working conditions and recurrent traumatic events, which increase their risk for detrimental health outcomes. Here, we investigated whether this risk is due to altered regulation of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and the endocannabinoid system. Therefore, 1 cm hair strands were collected from a cohort of 72 German EMS personnel in order to measure concentrations of cortisol, endocannabinoids [i.e., anandamide (AEA), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)], and N-acylethanolamines [i.e., stearoylethanolamide (SEA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA)]. Rank correlation analyses were conducted to test associations of cortisol, endocannabinoid, and N-acylethanolamine concentrations with the EMS personnel’s workload, lifetime trauma exposure, and mental and physical health problems. We found a negative correlation between cortisol and 2-AG concentrations in hair. Higher hair cortisol was associated with higher workload. Reported traumatic stress during childhood and later in life as well as more severe depressive and physical stress symptoms were associated with elevated 2-AG, SEA, OEA, and PEA concentrations. Future longitudinal research needs to address the prospect of tracing biomolecular markers of glucocorticoid, endocannabinoid, and N-acylethanolamine activity as a predicting value of the long-term course of mental and physical well-being."

Distinguishing intrinsic photon correlations from external noise with frequency-resolved homodyne detection,"In this work, we apply homodyne detection to investigate the frequency-resolved photon statistics of a cw light field emitted by a driven-dissipative semiconductor system in real time. We demonstrate that studying the frequency dependence of the photon number noise allows us to distinguish intrinsic noise properties of the emitter from external noise sources such as mechanical noise while maintaining a sub-picosecond temporal resolution. We further show that performing postselection on the recorded data opens up the possibility to study rare events in the dynamics of the emitter. By doing so, we demonstrate that in rare instances, additional external noise may actually result in reduced photon number noise in the emission."
Indirect overgrowth as a synthesis route for superior diamond nano sensors,"The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (\(\hbox {NV}^{-}\)) center shows excellent spin properties and sensing capabilities on the nanoscale even at room temperature. Shallow implanted \(\hbox {NV}^{-}\) centers can effectively be protected from surface noise by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond overgrowth, i.e. burying them homogeneously deeper in the crystal. However, the origin of the substantial losses in \(\hbox {NV}^{-}\) centers after overgrowth remains an open question. Here, we use shallow \(\hbox {NV}^{-}\) centers to exclude surface etching and identify the passivation reaction of NV to NVH centers during the growth as the most likely reason. Indirect overgrowth featuring low energy (2.5–5 keV) nitrogen ion implantation and CVD diamond growth before the essential annealing step reduces this passivation phenomenon significantly. Furthermore, we find higher nitrogen doses to slow down the NV–NVH conversion kinetics, which gives insight into the sub-surface diffusion of hydrogen in diamond during growth. Finally, nano sensors fabricated by indirect overgrowth combine tremendously enhanced \(T_2\) and \(T_2^*\) times with an outstanding degree of depth-confinement which is not possible by implanting with higher energies alone. Our results improve the understanding of CVD diamond overgrowth and pave the way towards reliable and advanced engineering of shallow \(\hbox {NV}^{-}\) centers for future quantum sensing devices."
Molecular modeling of electrolyte and polysulfide ions for lithium-sulfur batteries,"The operation of a lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery involves the transport of Li+ ions and soluble sulfides mostly in the form of solvated ions. Key challenges in the development of Li-S battery technology are the diffusion of Li+ in micropores filled with sulfur and eliminating the “shuttling” of polysulfides. Ion dimensions in solvated and desolvated forms are key parameters determining the diffusion coefficient and the rate of transport of such ions, while constrictivity effects due to the effect of pore size compared to ion size control both transport and filling of the pores. We present molecular simulations to determine the solvation parameters of electrolyte ions and sulfides S22−, S42−, S62−, and S82− in two different electrolyte systems: LiTFSI in DOL/DME and LiPF6 in EC/DMC. The calculated parameters include the coordination number and the geometrically optimized model and dimensions, using the van der Waals surface approach, of the solvated and desolvated ions. The desolvation energy of the electrolyte ions is also calculated. Such data is useful for the modeling and design of the pore sizes of cathode host materials to be able to accommodate the different sulfides while minimizing their “shuttling” between cathode and anode."
The Reeb Graph Edit Distance is Universal,"We consider the setting of Reeb graphs of piecewise linear functions and study distances between them that are stable, meaning that functions which are similar in the supremum norm ought to have similar Reeb graphs. We define an edit distance for Reeb graphs and prove that it is stable and universal, meaning that it provides an upper bound to any other stable distance. In contrast, via a specific construction, we show that the interleaving distance and the functional distortion distance on Reeb graphs are not universal."
"Statistical student’s t-test in carbon nanospheres synthesis from cis-1,4-polyisoprene","A student’s t-test was applied in carbon nanospheres synthesis from cis-1,4-polyisoprene considering the green chemical principles. The synthesis was carried out by Chemical Vapor Deposition method with a quartz tube reactor using an AISI 304 steel bar as catalyst. It was possible to obtain two types of different samples, one from the surface of the steel bar (catalyst) and another from the quartz tube surface (without catalyst) in the same experiment. Carbon spheres were observed in both samples by micrographs obtained by FESEM. The Raman and FTIR spectroscopies shown characteristic bands of this carbon structures (G and D). The results obtained by student’s t-test proved a statistical significance between spheres means of samples collected from steel bar and quartz tube surface."
Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals regulation of fetal ovary development in the monkey (Macaca fascicularis),"Germ cells are vital for reproduction and heredity. However, the mechanisms underlying female germ cell development in primates, especially in late embryonic stages, remain elusive. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 12,471 cells from whole fetal ovaries, and explored the communications between germ cells and niche cells. We depicted the two waves of oogenesis at single-cell resolution and demonstrated that progenitor theca cells exhibit similar characteristics to Leydig cells in fetal monkey ovaries. Notably, we found that ZGLP1 displays differentially expressed patterns between mouse and monkey, which is not overlapped with NANOG in monkey germ cells, suggesting its role in meiosis entry but not in activating oogenic program in primates. Furthermore, the majority of germ cell clusters that sharply express PRDM9 and SPO11 might undergo apoptosis after cyst breakdown, leading to germ cell attrition. Overall, our work provides new insights into the molecular and cellular basis of primate fetal ovary development at single-cell resolution."
3D landscape of Hepatitis B virus interactions with human chromatins,"Hepatitis B viral (HBV) DNAs, including covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and integrated HBV DNA forms, are considered to be primary contributors to the development and progression of HBV-associated liver diseases. However, it remains largely unclear how HBV DNAs communicate with human chromatin. Here we employed a highly sensitive technology, 3C-high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing (3C-HTGTS), to globally identify HBV DNA–host DNA contacts in cellular models of HBV infection. HBV DNA does not randomly position in host genome but instead preferentially establishes contacts with the host DNA at active chromatin regions. HBV DNA–host DNA contacts are significantly enriched at H3K4me1-marked regions modified by KMT2C/D; this histone modification is also observed in the HBV cccDNA mini-chromosome and strongly influences HBV transcription. On the other hand, chromatin loop formed by integrated HBV DNA with host genomic DNA was found in transcriptionally active regions. Furthermore, HBV infection influences host gene expression accompanied with HBV DNA–host DNA contacts. Our study provides a 3D landscape of spatial organization of cccDNA and integrated HBV DNA within the human genome, which lays the foundation for a better understanding of the mechanisms how HBV involves in liver disease development and progression."
Mind the Measure: On the Effects of Antidumping Investigations in Egypt,"This paper examines the impact of the antidumping measures initiated by the Government of Egypt on imports during the period 2001–2015. Our contribution is twofold. First, the paper distinguishes between the effect of antidumping measures on the value, the volume and the price of imports. Second, it differentiates between the investigation, destruction and diversion effects of antidumping measures. Our main findings show that, once the investigation is approved, while prices increase and quantities decrease, the latter effect is stronger than the former. Moreover, when the investigation is initiated, there is an investigation effect since imports are likely to decrease during the investigation review period and before the final decision of the World Trade Organization is announced. As per the destruction effect, we find that imports coming from countries included in the investigation decrease once the complaint is approved. Consequently, imports will shift from countries targeted by the measure to those non-targeted."
Endovascular stroke treatment in orally anticoagulated patients: an analysis from the German Stroke Registry-Endovascular Treatment,Endovascular treatment (ET) in orally anticoagulated (OAC) patients has not been evaluated in randomized clinical trials and data regarding this issue are sparse.
Impact of the number of conditioning pulses on motor cortex excitability: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study,"Conditioning transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with subthreshold conditioning stimulus followed by supra-threshold test stimulus at inter-stimulus intervals (ISI) of 1–5 ms results in inhibition (SICI), while ISI at 10–15 ms results in facilitation (ICF). One concerning issue, applying ICF/SICI protocols on patients is the substantial protocol variability. Here, we hypothesized that increasing the number of CS could result in more robust ICF/SICI protocols. Twenty healthy subjects participated in the study. Motor-evoked potentials (MEP) were obtained from conditioning TMS with a varying number of conditioning stimuli in 3, 4, 10, and 15 ms ISI over the primary motor cortex. MEP amplitudes were then compared to examine excitability. TMS with 3, 5, and 7 conditioning stimuli but not with one conditioning stimulus induced ICF. Moreover, 10 ms ISI produced stronger ICF than 15 ms ISI. Significant SICI was only induced with one conditioning stimulus. Besides, 3 ms ISI resulted in stronger SICI than 4 ms ISI. Only a train of conditioning stimuli induced stable ICF and may be more advantageous than the classical paired pulse ICF paradigm."
Elevated MUC5AC expression is associated with mismatch repair deficiency and proximal tumor location but not with cancer progression in colon cancer,"Mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) is a secreted gel-forming mucin expressed by several epithelia. In the colon, MUC5AC is expressed in scattered normal epithelial cells but can be abundant in colorectal cancers. To clarify the relationship of MUC5AC expression with parameters of tumor aggressiveness and mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) in colorectal cancer, a tissue microarray containing 1812 colorectal cancers was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. MUC5AC expression was found in 261 (15.7%) of 1,667 analyzable colorectal cancers. MUC5AC expression strongly depended on the tumor location and gradually decreased from proximal (27.4% of cecum cancers) to distal (10.6% of rectal cancers; p < 0.0001). MUC5AC expression was also strongly linked to dMMR. dMMR was found in 21.3% of 169 cancers with MUC5AC positivity but in only 4.6% of 1051 cancers without detectable MUC5AC expression (p < 0.0001). A multivariate analysis showed that dMMR status and tumor localization predicted MUC5AC expression independently (p < 0.0001 each). MUC5AC expression was unrelated to pT and pN status. This also applied to the subgroups of 1136 proficient MMR (pMMR) and of 84 dMMR cancers. The results of our study show a strong association of MUC5AC expression with proximal and dMMR colorectal cancers. However, MUC5AC expression is unrelated to colon cancer aggressiveness."
Encountering suicide in primary healthcare rehabilitation: the experiences of physiotherapists,"Suicide is a serious public health issue and one of the most common causes of death globally. Suicide has long-lasting impact on personal, relational, community and societal levels. Research has shown that patients often seek help in the primary healthcare system preceding a suicide. Studies exploring the experiences of encountering patients at risk for suicide have been performed among various categories of healthcare personnel, such as nurses and psychiatry residents as well as emergency room staff. There is a lack of research regarding primary healthcare rehabilitation staff, despite the fact that physiotherapists are the third largest health profession in the Western hemisphere and often work with patients experiencing mental health symptoms. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of encountering patients at risk for suicide among physiotherapists working in a primary healthcare rehabilitation setting."
Interstate disparities in the performances in combatting COVID-19 in India: efficiency estimates across states,"Currently, the novel coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic poses the greatest global health threat worldwide, and India is no exception. As an overpopulated developing country, it is very difficult to maintain social distancing to restrict the spread of the disease in India. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to examine India’s interstate performances to combat COVID-19."
Study on strength and volume change behavior of stabilized black cotton soil with different pH of soil-lime mixes for pavement subgrade,"Lime stabilization is a proven technique to improve the subgrade properties of black cotton (BC) soil for pavement construction. However, deciding the optimum lime requirement for varying soil properties from location to location is still a challenge during new road construction. Hence, in this study, an attempt was made to bring out the quick identification of optimum lime dosage by pH test. However, the pH test alone is not sufficient to know the changes in Physico-chemical properties of soil by lime addition. Therefore, investigations were performed by addition of different lime contents with varying curing periods to bring out the effect on strength and volumetric change behavior of BC soil."
Radial vs. Femoral Artery Access for Procedural Success in Diagnostic Cerebral Angiography,"Radial artery access has become the standard of care in percutaneous coronary procedures due to demonstrated patient safety and comfort benefits; however, uptake of radial access for diagnostic cerebral angiography has been limited by practitioner concerns over the ability to achieve procedural success. We aimed to provide randomized clinical trial evidence for the non-inferiority of radial access to achieve procedural success."
An automated protocol for modelling peptide substrates to proteases,"Proteases are key drivers in many biological processes, in part due to their specificity towards their substrates. However, depending on the family and molecular function, they can also display substrate promiscuity which can also be essential. Databases compiling specificity matrices derived from experimental assays have provided valuable insights into protease substrate recognition. Despite this, there are still gaps in our knowledge of the structural determinants. Here, we compile a set of protease crystal structures with bound peptide-like ligands to create a protocol for modelling substrates bound to protease structures, and for studying observables associated to the binding recognition."
C-Norm: a neural approach to few-shot entity normalization,"Entity normalization is an important information extraction task which has gained renewed attention in the last decade, particularly in the biomedical and life science domains. In these domains, and more generally in all specialized domains, this task is still challenging for the latest machine learning-based approaches, which have difficulty handling highly multi-class and few-shot learning problems. To address this issue, we propose C-Norm, a new neural approach which synergistically combines standard and weak supervision, ontological knowledge integration and distributional semantics."
"Insights into a giant landslide-prone area on the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, China","A good understanding of giant landslide-prone areas could greatly enhance the understanding of the formation and failure mechanisms of giant landslides. In this study, a classic giant landslide-prone area named the Diexi area located along the upstream stretch of the Minjiang River on the eastern Tibetan Plateau is adopted to analyze the failure mechanism and evolution process by detailed field investigations, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images and a digital surface model (DSM). The results show that among the 37 giant landslides located in the Diexi area, 18 landslides are transverse landslides (wedge failure), and the others are consequent landslides (buckling failure). All landslides blocked rivers, and some barrier lakes still remain. The Diexi area features special geological structural conditions related to the hinge section of the Jiaochang arc tectonic belt, the intersection of two active fault zones (the Songpinggou and Minjiang fault zones) and high levels of geostress. The numerous radial fissures induced by the Jiaochang arcuate belt provided lateral sliding boundaries for buckling deformation (consequent landslides) and head scarps for wedge failure (transverse landslides). The rapid incision (1.88 mm/yr) since the middle Pleistocene formed a deep gorge with steep slopes and strong lateral unloading. Frequent earthquakes and rainfall further reduced the rock mass integrity, and strong earthquakes or other factors triggered the landslides."
"A novel structural type of conformationally fixed, mixed phosphonium-iodonium ylides based on phenoxaphosphinine","A synthetic approach to a novel type of phosphonium and mixed phosphonium-iodonium ylides containing a conformationally fixed phosphonium fragment is developed. New representatives of these families of chemical compounds based on cyclic phenoxaphosphinine were synthesized. One compound was structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Based on the 1H NMR data, one can state that phosphonium ylide exists in solution in the form of two geometric isomers even at room temperature. This is indicative of pronounced double-bond character of the bond between the ylide carbon atom and the stabilizing carbomethoxy group."
Comparative activity of yttrium(iii) pincer complexes in isoprene polymerization,"A new yttrium(iii) complex with the pincer type bis(phosphinophenyl)amide ligand was synthesized and its activity and selectivity in the isoprene polymerization reaction was studied. An ultrahigh molecular weight polyisoprene with a > 99% content of 1,4-cis units was obtained."
Practical synthesis of diaryliodonium(iii) triflates using ArI(OAc)2/TfOH/MeCN reaction system,"Diaryliodonium(iii) triflates were synthesized in a safe manner by the reaction of aryliodine(iii) diacetates ArI(OAc)2 with triflic acid (TfOH) in MeCN under mild exothermic conditions. This method provides access to a variety of diaryliodonium(iii) triflates, including derivatives with two different aryl substituents, with high purity."
"Poly(methoxy-NNO-azoxyethene), a new polymer for active binders in solid composite propellants","Radical polymerization of unsaturated alkoxy-NNO-azoxy compounds was explored. Polymethoxy-NNO-azoxyethene, the first energetic polymer based on alkoxy-NNO-azoxy compounds, was obtained, and its major characteristics were studied. Thermodynamic calculations show that poly(methoxy-NNO-azoxyethene) may be of interest as a polymer component of active binders for solid composite rocket propellants."
Physicochemical regularities of lead sorption by an impregnated type sorbent based on phosphorylpodand,"The sorption of lead by an impregnated type sorbent based on the phosphorylpodand, 1,8-bis[2-(diphenylphosphorylmethyl)phenoxy]-3,6-dioxaoctane, was studied. Sorption isotherms were plotted, as well as the data on kinetics, selectivity, and dynamics of sorption were obtained. The phosphorylpodand-based sorbent attains the sorption equilibrium of lead extraction with a high rate. The maximum sorbent capacity was achieved when the equilibrium concentration of lead in solutions was more than 150 mg L−1. The 1,8-bis[2-(diphenyl-phosphorylmethyl)phenoxy]-3,6-dioxaoctane-based sorbent shows a high selectivity for lead sorption from neutral solutions. The output curve of lead sorption was plotted. The dynamic exchange capacity and total dynamic capacity of the obtained sorbent were determined."
Kinetic features of the chemiluminescent oxidation of N-octylluminol by the hypochlorite ion in a self-organized micellar medium,"For the model chemiluminescent reaction of N-octylluminol, a hydrophobic analogue of luminol and a surfactant, a scheme was established and parameters of the formal kinetic equation were calculated. The formation of intrinsic micelles of the substrate promotes a triple increaese in the rate of the first step of the luminogenous reaction and a multiple increase in the detected maximum and integrated signal intensities compared to results obtained in the classical chemiluminescent system based on luminol. The reversible conversion of N-octylluminol to a non-luminescent form was revealed, and the equilibrium is strongly shifted to the latter, which distorts the shape of the detected kinetic curve and decreases the analytical signal with time. This shift can be prevented by using the systems with controlled mixing of reagents."
Quantum chemical modeling in the system polyvinylpyrrolidone—cation of the dinitrosyl iron complex,The structures of a number of the products for the reaction of the NO donor (cation of the dinitrosyl iron complex [Fe(SC(NH2)2)2(NO)2] • Cl•H2O) with poly-N-vinylpyrrolidone in water were studied using the density functional method and QTAIM analysis. The quantum chemical calculations of the basic geometric and energy parameters of the formed compounds were performed. The expected forms of existence of this system in aqueous solutions were described on the basis of the obtained results. The retention of the NO-donor activity in the formed polymeric structures is related to the preservation of the Fe(NO)2 fragment in them.
"2,5-Diaryl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles: synthesis, spectral-luminescent properties, and complexation with beryllium(ii)","Cyclization of aroylbenzohydrazides in SOCl2 was used to obtain 2,5-diaryl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles, and to study their spectral-luminescent properties. Oxadiazoles with phenyl or 2-methoxyphenyl substituents at position 2 of the oxadiazole ring have a luminescence with a high quantum yield in polar and nonpolar solvents (λflmax = 378−424 nm, φ = 0.88−0.98). Replacement of these groups with a 2-phenol substituent results in a ligand with strong emission only in highly polar aprotic DMSO (λflmax = 397 nm, φ = 0.18). Based on this ligand, a chelated beryllium complex with the composition L2Be was obtained, which has a strong luminescence in the violet region of the visible spectrum (λflmax = 410−414 nm, φ = 0.34−0.48)."
Divergent Projection Patterns Revealed by Reconstruction of Individual Neurons in Orbitofrontal Cortex,"The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is involved in diverse brain functions via its extensive projections to multiple target regions. There is a growing understanding of the overall outputs of the OFC at the population level, but reports of the projection patterns of individual OFC neurons across different cortical layers remain rare. Here, by combining neuronal sparse and bright labeling with a whole-brain florescence imaging system (fMOST), we obtained an uninterrupted three-dimensional whole-brain dataset and achieved the full morphological reconstruction of 25 OFC pyramidal neurons. We compared the whole-brain projection targets of these individual OFC neurons in different cortical layers as well as in the same cortical layer. We found cortical layer-dependent projections characterized by divergent patterns for information delivery. Our study not only provides a structural basis for understanding the principles of laminar organizations in the OFC, but also provides clues for future functional and behavioral studies on OFC pyramidal neurons."
Z-scheme photocatalyst based on porphyrin derivative decorated few-layer BiVO4 nanosheets for efficient visible-light-driven overall water splitting,"It is highly desirable to simulate natural photosynthesis by using sunlight to drive the overall water splitting without using external bias and sacrificial agent. Herein, few-layer monoclinic BiVO4 nanosheets (BVNS) with a thickness of (∼)4.3 nm, exposed (010) facets and abundant oxygen vacancies are fabricated using graphene oxide dots as templating reagent. After decorating with asymmetric chromium porphyrin derivative bearing one benzoic acid and three phenyls as meso-position substituents (chromium-5-(4-carboxyphenyl)-10,15,20-triphenylporphrin, CrmTPP) and PtOx cocatalyst, the obtained two-dimensional (2D) hybrid nanocomposite (BVNS/CrmTPP/Pt) with an optimal component ratio delivers a robust overall water splitting performance with a relatively high apparent quantum yield (8.67%) at 400 nm monochromatic light. The ultrathin structure and widely distributed oxygen vacancies on the exposed (010) facets of BVNS not only endow strong and intimate contact with the decorated CrmTPP molecules to promote a two-step excitation Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism for preserving the high redox ability of the photogenerated charge carriers, but also alleviate their recombination, and thus causing the robust overall water splitting performance of the 2D hybrid nanocomposites. The present results provide a novel strategy to construct highly efficient artificial photosynthetic system for overall water splitting."
Features of Electron Probe Microanalysis of Nitrogen-Containing Compounds,"This work is aimed at development of a method of investigation into the chemical composition of natural and synthetic nitrogen-containing compounds using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and its application for identification of the form of inclusion of light elements (C, N, O) in complex anions and cations. The analysis was performed using Kα lines appearing upon electron transfer from valence 2p states to internal 1s states. The characteristic features of Kα spectra of C, N, and O, which affect the correctness of the EPMA results, were revealed, and adjustments accounting for integral line intensity, self-absorption of the nitrogen line, and absorption of background absorption by nitrogen were determined. The procedure is multifunctional: it is intended for analysis of various nitrogen-containing samples, including diamonds produced by detonation synthesis. The surface of such samples is usually coated with a layer of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing functional groups. The experiments are aimed at detection of the optimum conditions of excitation and recording of Kα lines. The applied accelerating voltage is 10 kV; the beam current is 50–120 nA. When analyzing the recording of the signal amplitude in the differential mode, we apply a universal (for all samples) empirical equation describing the curve of background intensity in the area of the nitrogen line. The resistance of samples against the action of the electron beam is improved by the raster mode with linear size of 20–40 μm and movement of sample in the area of ~100 × 100 μm2 (if allowed by sample size). The concentrations of the detected elements were calculated by the PAP program using Henke absorption coefficients. At 80 nA, the detection limits of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen were 0.33, 0.46, and 0.86 wt %, respectively."
The Use of Piezosensors for Determination of Carboxylic Acids in the Intermediate Products of Edible Ethanol Production,"The reference polymers and polymers with molecular imprints of carboxylic acids (MIPs-CA)—propionic (MIP-Propionic) and butyric (MIP-Butyric) acids—were synthesized on the surface of piezoelectric sensors using aromatic compounds by the non-covalent imprinting method. A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) is a polymer produced through molecular imprinting, which leaves cavities in the polymer matrix with affinity for a chosen “template” target molecule. The values of the imprinting factor and selectivity coefficients were calculated to assess the ability of MIPs-CA to recognize the target molecules. It was shown that the sensors modified by the molecularly imprinted polymers exhibited high selectivity for the acid that was a template during their synthesis. The detection limits for propionic and butyric acids were 7.40 × 10–6 and 8.81 × 10–6 g/dm3, respectively. Correctness of the carboxylic acid determination in model solutions was verified in the spike/recovery tests. The relative standard deviation was less than 10%. The modified piezoelectric sensors were tested in analysis of the intermediate products of edible ethanol production (distillate of fermentation mixture, epurate, bottom liquids of columns). The correctness of the determination of carboxylic acids in liquids was evaluated using an Agilent Technologies 7890B GC System. The difference in the results of acid determination between both methods (piezoelectric sensor and chromatography–mass spectrometry) did not exceed 6%. The modified piezosensors expand the potential of rapid determination of carboxylic acids in the intermediate products of ethyl alcohol production."
Weakly hydrophobic nanoconfinement by graphene aerogels greatly enhances the reactivity and ambient stability of reactivity of MIL-101-Fe in Fenton-like reaction,"In the pursuit of heterogeneous catalysts with high reactivity, metal organic framework (MOF) nanomaterials have received tremendous attentions. However, many MOF catalysts especially Fe-based MOFs need to be utilized immediately after synthesis or being activated using high temperature, because of the easy loss of reactivity in humid environments resulting from the occupation of active Fe sites by water molecules. Here, we describe an inspiring strategy of growing MIL-101-Fe nanoparticles inside the three-dimensional confined space of graphene aerogel (GA), generating shapeable GA/MIL-101-Fe nanocomposite convenient for practical use. Compared to MIL-101-Fe, GA/MIL-101-Fe as catalyst demonstrates much higher reactivity in Fenton-like reaction, attributing to smaller MIL-101-Fe particle size, presence of active Fe(II) sites, and abundant defects in GA. Strikingly, the weakly hydrophobic nature of the composite greatly inhibits the loss of catalytic reactivity after being stored in humid air and accelerates the recovery of reactivity in mild temperature, by resisting the entrance of water molecules and helping to exclude water molecules. This work demonstrates that a delicate design of nanocomposite structure could not only improve the reactivity of the catalytic component, but also overcome its intrinsic drawback by taking advantage of the properties of host. We hope this functional nanoconfinement strategy could be extended to more scenarios in other fields."
Borophene-graphene heterostructure: Preparation and ultrasensitive humidity sensing,"Heterostructure has triggered a surge of interest due to its synergistic effects between two different layers, which contributes to desirable physical properties for extensive potential applications. Structurally stable borophene is becoming a promising candidate for constructing two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures, but it is rarely prepared by suitable synthesis conditions experimentally. Here, we demonstrate that a novel heterostructure composed of hydrogenated borophene and graphene can be prepared by heating the mixture of sodium borohydride and few-layered graphene followed by stepwise and in situ thermal decomposition of sodium borohydride under high-purity hydrogen as the carrier gas. The fabricated borophene-graphene heterostructure humidity sensor shows ultrahigh sensitivity, fast response, and long-time stability. The sensitivity of the fabricated borophene-based sensor is near 700 times higher than that of pristine graphene one at the relative humidity of 85% RH. The sensitivity of the sensor is highest among all the reported chemiresistive sensors based on 2D materials. Besides, the performance of the borophene-graphene flexible sensor maintains good stability after bending, which shows that the borophene-based heterostructures can be applied in wearable electronics. The observed high performance can be ascribed to the well-established charge transfer mechanism upon H2O molecule adsorption. This study further promotes the fundamental studies of interfacial effects and interactions between boron-based 2D heterostructures and chemical species."
X-Ray Fluorescence Determination of Ore Elements in Ferromanganese Formations,"Elemental analysis of ferromanganese formations (first of all, the determination of ore elements) is a necessary stage in the development of ore deposits. A technique for X-ray fluorescence quantitative analysis was proposed for the determination of iron, manganese, cobalt, nickel, copper, and zinc in oceanic ferromanganese formations (nodules and crusts). The studies were performed using a S4 Pioneer wavelength-dispersive spectrometer equipped with a LiF (200) crystal and a scintillation detector. In order to plot the calibration curves, sets of certified reference materials such as ferromanganese nodules, cobalt-bearing ferromanganese crusts, and pelagic sediments previously dried at 105°C for 24 h to remove hygroscopic moisture were used. Two sample preparation techniques were compared: pressing of powder samples with the use a boric acid substrate and homogenizing via fusion with lithium tetraborate at a ratio of 1 : 30 in an electric furnace at 1050°C. For each sample preparation technique, spectral overlaps and matrix correction methods (theoretical and empirical) were considered, and optimal calibration curves for determining ore elements were chosen. The accuracy of the X-ray fluorescence technique was assessed via analyzing a reference material FeMn-1 with a certified content of ore elements and a reference ferromanganese nodule sample preliminarily analyzed using a PerkinElmer M403 atomic absorption spectrometer. Both homogenization via fusion and analysis of pressed samples provide quantitative X-ray fluorescence determination of the main ore elements and can be used to assess the industrial significance of oceanic ferromanganese formations."
Development of a Technique for Analysis of Tungsten-Containing Sludge Using Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES),"A technique for analysis of secondary tungsten-containing raw materials (tungsten-containing sludge) using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry in combination with microwave autoclave sample preparation has been developed. The composition of the acid mixture and algorithm of microwave heating of the autoclave are chosen to provide a complete quantitative transfer of the sample into a convenient analytical form for subsequent ICP-AES determination of the main components (heating of the sample to 220°C in the acid mixture of NH4F, HNO3, and HCl provides a quantitative transfer of its components to be determined into the solution). Analytical lines free from spectral interference were selected to determine Ti, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, and W. We used real industrial samples of secondary raw materials obtained in product manufacture from VK-type hard alloys [solid solution of tungsten carbide grains (WC phase) in cobalt (Co phase)] in the form of tungsten-containing powders, grinding sludge of solid sintered alloys, dust waste, defective mixtures, waste of ventilation systems, and carbide powders. Correctness of the determination of elements was proved in analysis of ferrotungsten standard samples upon determination of the matrix component (tungsten) and by the methods of additives and sample weight variation upon determination of the alloying elements and impurities. The method of internal standard (with Sc as the element of comparison) was used to improve the precision and accuracy of the tungsten determination. The relative standard deviation was thus reduced from 0.03 to 0.004. The developed precise rapid technique was tested in analysis of industrial samples of secondary tungsten-containing sludge of hard alloys. The technique is recommended to control the composition of the secondary tungsten-containing sludge of hard alloys in a wide range of concentrations."

Physicochemical regularities of lead sorption by an impregnated type sorbent based on phosphorylpodand,"The sorption of lead by an impregnated type sorbent based on the phosphorylpodand, 1,8-bis[2-(diphenylphosphorylmethyl)phenoxy]-3,6-dioxaoctane, was studied. Sorption isotherms were plotted, as well as the data on kinetics, selectivity, and dynamics of sorption were obtained. The phosphorylpodand-based sorbent attains the sorption equilibrium of lead extraction with a high rate. The maximum sorbent capacity was achieved when the equilibrium concentration of lead in solutions was more than 150 mg L−1. The 1,8-bis[2-(diphenyl-phosphorylmethyl)phenoxy]-3,6-dioxaoctane-based sorbent shows a high selectivity for lead sorption from neutral solutions. The output curve of lead sorption was plotted. The dynamic exchange capacity and total dynamic capacity of the obtained sorbent were determined."
Kinetic features of the chemiluminescent oxidation of N-octylluminol by the hypochlorite ion in a self-organized micellar medium,"For the model chemiluminescent reaction of N-octylluminol, a hydrophobic analogue of luminol and a surfactant, a scheme was established and parameters of the formal kinetic equation were calculated. The formation of intrinsic micelles of the substrate promotes a triple increaese in the rate of the first step of the luminogenous reaction and a multiple increase in the detected maximum and integrated signal intensities compared to results obtained in the classical chemiluminescent system based on luminol. The reversible conversion of N-octylluminol to a non-luminescent form was revealed, and the equilibrium is strongly shifted to the latter, which distorts the shape of the detected kinetic curve and decreases the analytical signal with time. This shift can be prevented by using the systems with controlled mixing of reagents."
Quantum chemical modeling in the system polyvinylpyrrolidone—cation of the dinitrosyl iron complex,The structures of a number of the products for the reaction of the NO donor (cation of the dinitrosyl iron complex [Fe(SC(NH2)2)2(NO)2] • Cl•H2O) with poly-N-vinylpyrrolidone in water were studied using the density functional method and QTAIM analysis. The quantum chemical calculations of the basic geometric and energy parameters of the formed compounds were performed. The expected forms of existence of this system in aqueous solutions were described on the basis of the obtained results. The retention of the NO-donor activity in the formed polymeric structures is related to the preservation of the Fe(NO)2 fragment in them.
"2,5-Diaryl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles: synthesis, spectral-luminescent properties, and complexation with beryllium(ii)","Cyclization of aroylbenzohydrazides in SOCl2 was used to obtain 2,5-diaryl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles, and to study their spectral-luminescent properties. Oxadiazoles with phenyl or 2-methoxyphenyl substituents at position 2 of the oxadiazole ring have a luminescence with a high quantum yield in polar and nonpolar solvents (λflmax = 378−424 nm, φ = 0.88−0.98). Replacement of these groups with a 2-phenol substituent results in a ligand with strong emission only in highly polar aprotic DMSO (λflmax = 397 nm, φ = 0.18). Based on this ligand, a chelated beryllium complex with the composition L2Be was obtained, which has a strong luminescence in the violet region of the visible spectrum (λflmax = 410−414 nm, φ = 0.34−0.48)."
"A novel structural type of conformationally fixed, mixed phosphonium-iodonium ylides based on phenoxaphosphinine","A synthetic approach to a novel type of phosphonium and mixed phosphonium-iodonium ylides containing a conformationally fixed phosphonium fragment is developed. New representatives of these families of chemical compounds based on cyclic phenoxaphosphinine were synthesized. One compound was structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Based on the 1H NMR data, one can state that phosphonium ylide exists in solution in the form of two geometric isomers even at room temperature. This is indicative of pronounced double-bond character of the bond between the ylide carbon atom and the stabilizing carbomethoxy group."
Comparative activity of yttrium(iii) pincer complexes in isoprene polymerization,"A new yttrium(iii) complex with the pincer type bis(phosphinophenyl)amide ligand was synthesized and its activity and selectivity in the isoprene polymerization reaction was studied. An ultrahigh molecular weight polyisoprene with a > 99% content of 1,4-cis units was obtained."
Practical synthesis of diaryliodonium(iii) triflates using ArI(OAc)2/TfOH/MeCN reaction system,"Diaryliodonium(iii) triflates were synthesized in a safe manner by the reaction of aryliodine(iii) diacetates ArI(OAc)2 with triflic acid (TfOH) in MeCN under mild exothermic conditions. This method provides access to a variety of diaryliodonium(iii) triflates, including derivatives with two different aryl substituents, with high purity."
"Poly(methoxy-NNO-azoxyethene), a new polymer for active binders in solid composite propellants","Radical polymerization of unsaturated alkoxy-NNO-azoxy compounds was explored. Polymethoxy-NNO-azoxyethene, the first energetic polymer based on alkoxy-NNO-azoxy compounds, was obtained, and its major characteristics were studied. Thermodynamic calculations show that poly(methoxy-NNO-azoxyethene) may be of interest as a polymer component of active binders for solid composite rocket propellants."
RETRACTED ARTICLE: Characterization of DicB Inhibitory Activity in Cell Division Under Stress Conditions,
Microwave-assisted Catalyzed Synthesis and In vitro Bioactivity Evaluation of Benzimidazoles Bearing Phenolic Hydroxyl,"An efficient and facile method was introduced for the synthesis of benzimidazoles in this paper. The optimum reaction conditions were determined. A series of benzimidazoles bearing phenolic hydroxyl(2a—2t) were synthesized in moderate to excellent yields starting from differently substituted hydroxyl benzaldehyde and 4-position substituted o-phenylenediamine via nu-cleophilic addition in the presence of catalyst Na2S2O5 under microwave irradiation condition. Herein, effects of the catalyst, molar ratio of reactants, reaction temperature and solvent were investigated. The optimal reaction condition was determined. The effect of DMF and EtOH solvent on the reaction was compared. The synthesized compounds were characterized by FTIR, HRMS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Further, the bacteriostatic activities of the synthesized compounds were evaluated with ciprofloxacin and itraconazole as a positive control, respectively. Compounds 2b, 2n, 2q and 2r exhibited some antibacterial activity. The lowest MIC of antibacterial activity of compound 2b was 32 µg/mL. Meanwhile, the luminescence property of compound 2b was studied. The antibacterial activity of compound 2b, along with their good fluorescence performance highlighted the potential of these compounds as lead structures and owned fluorescence trace for further study towards the development of novel drugs and functional mechanisms in living organisms."
Adsorption and Visible Light Photocatalytic Degradation of Electrospun PAN@W18O49 Nanofibers,"Low density and high porosity polyacrylonitrile(PAN) nanofibers prepared by electrospinning were used as brackets for photocatalyst W18O49 to prepare a kind of light weight and easy recycling water purification material for the first time. The influence of tungsten source concentration on the formation of W18O49 during a solvothermal process was systematically investigated. The prepared PAN@W18O49 nanofibers(NFs) utilize the outstanding visible light photocatalytic performance and the adsorption performance of W18O49, and at the same time give the advantages of low density and easy recyclability. The pollutant removal performance of the composite nanofibers was investigated by using five contaminants including rhodamine B(RhB), methylene blue(MB), malachite green(MG), methyl orange(MO) and chlortetracycline(CTC) as substrates. Among them, the degradation process of rhodamine B has been studied in detail. After five cycles, the degradation efficiency did not decrease significantly, showing excellent reusability of PAN@W18O49 NFs. Besides, the adsorption performance of PAN@W18O49 NFs during the photocatalytic process was also studied in detail. Compared with recently reported literature, the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants by PAN@W18O49 NFs showed better performance, and PAN@W18O49 NFs felt had a promising prospect in the field of degradation of contaminants."
Targeted Synthesis of Anthranilic Diamides Insecticides Containing Trifluoroethoxyl Phenylpyrazole,"A series of novel anthranilic diamides analogues(9a–9t) containing trifluoroethoxyl pyrazole moiety was designed and synthesized and their insecticidal bioactivities against Mythimna separata(Walker, M. separata) and Plutellaxylostella (P. xylostella) were evaluated. The structures of the title compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS. Preliminary insecticidal activities showed that some of the title compounds possessed good to excellent bioactivities towards M. separata and P. xylostella. Compounds 9c and 9t exhibited 100% mortality rate against M. separate at 0.2 mg/L. For the P. xylostella, the synthesized compounds(9c–9e, 9i and 9o) showed 70%, 80%, 75 %, 65% and 60% insecticidal activities at 1×10−6 mg/L, respectively, higher than that of chlorantraniliprole(0). Based on excellent insecticidal activities, the mode of the action was tested by the calcium-imaging technique, the results of which demonstrated that the novel compounds shared the same target with chlorantraniliprole. The binding pose of the most active compound 9t in RyRs of P. xylostella was predicted by molecular docking, which showed that compound 9t interacted with the residues Glu140(A) and His147(A) via hydrogen bond."
"Flow Injection Chemiluminescence Method for Nalbuphine Hydrochloride in Pharmaceutical Formulations Using Tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) Chloride-diperiodatocuprate(III) Reaction","A sensitive and selective method employing chemiluminescence(CL) coupled with flow injection(FI) is reported for nalbuphine hydrochloride(NAL) assay in pharmaceutical formulations. The enhancement effect of NAL on the CL reaction between tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) chloride-diperiodatocuprate(III) {Ru[(bpy)3]2+-Cu(III) complex} in acidic medium is used as analytical measurement. The optimal conditions of the CL reaction were sulfuric acid 1.0×10−3 mol/L, Ru[(bpy)s]2+ 7.5×10−5 mol/L, Cu(III)/Ag(III) complexes 4.0×10−4/5.0×10−4 mol/L, sample loop volume of 120 µL and flow rate of 2.5 mL/min. The sensitivities of the method in terms of detection(S/N=3) and quantification(S/N=10) limits are 5×10−4 and 0.001 ppm(1 ppm=1 mg/L), respectively. The linear response of the instrument in the form of CL intensity with respect to NAL concentration is over the range 0.001–15.0 ppm(R2=0.9999) with relative standard deviation from 0.8% to 3.2% and injection throughput of 120 injection/h. The applications of the method include the quantitative analysis of NAL in pharmaceutical injection samples. Variations and the average results of the proposed method are not significantly different from the results of a reported method by applying F- and paired student t-test. The most likely CL reaction mechanism is written in accordance with spectrophotometric and CL studies."
Hydrothermal Synthesis of NiCo-layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheets Decorated on Biomass Carbon Skeleton for High Performance Supercapacitor,"A facile hydrothermal strategy is adopted to synthesize the composite of NiCo-layered double hydroxide(NiCo-LDH) with biomass carbon as substrate for supercapacitor electrodes. The prepared NiCo@BC was characterized by means of X-ray diffraction(XRD), scanning electronic microscopy(SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical tests. The SEM images demonstrated that numerous NiCo-LDH nanosheets directly grew on the surface of biomass carbon uniformly. Electrochemical tests indicated that the NiCo@BC electrode exhibited good capacitive behavior with a specific capacitance of 606.4 F/g at the current density of 0.5 A/g. In addition, the composite electrode showed excellent cyclic stability of 87.1% even after 1000 cycles. These results manifest that NiCo@BC nanocomposite is a promising candidate for the electrode material for future supercapacitor practical applications."

Schwarzian quantum mechanics as a Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction of BF theory,"We give an interpretation of the holographic correspondence between two-dimensional BF theory on the punctured disk with gauge group PSL(2, ℝ) and Schwarzian quantum mechanics in terms of a Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction. The latter, in turn, is equivalent to the presence of certain edge states imposing a first class constraint on the model. The constrained path integral localizes over exceptional Virasoro coadjoint orbits. The reduced theory is governed by the Schwarzian action functional generating a Hamiltonian S1-action on the orbits. The partition function is given by a sum over topological sectors (corresponding to the exceptional orbits), each of which is computed by a formal Duistermaat-Heckman integral."
Enhanced xylitol production using non-detoxified xylose rich pre-hydrolysate from sugarcane bagasse by newly isolated Pichia fermentans,"Integrated management of hemicellulosic fraction and its economical transformation to value-added products is the key driver towards sustainable lignocellulosic biorefineries. In this aspect, microbial cell factories are harnessed for the sustainable production of commercially viable biochemicals by valorising C5 and C6 sugars generated from agro-industrial waste. However, in the terrestrial ecosystem, microbial systems can efficiently consume glucose. On the contrary, pentose sugars are less preferred carbon source as most of the microbes lack metabolic pathway for their utilization. The effective utilization of both pentose and hexose sugars is key for economical biorefinery."
Gamete binning: chromosome-level and haplotype-resolved genome assembly enabled by high-throughput single-cell sequencing of gamete genomes,"Generating chromosome-level, haplotype-resolved assemblies of heterozygous genomes remains challenging. To address this, we developed gamete binning, a method based on single-cell sequencing of haploid gametes enabling separation of the whole-genome sequencing reads into haplotype-specific reads sets. After assembling the reads of each haplotype, the contigs are scaffolded to chromosome level using a genetic map derived from the gametes. We assemble the two genomes of a diploid apricot tree based on whole-genome sequencing of 445 individual pollen grains. The two haplotype assemblies (N50: 25.5 and 25.8 Mb) feature a haplotyping precision of greater than 99% and are accurately scaffolded to chromosome-level."
Cell fate clusters in ICM organoids arise from cell fate heredity and division: a modelling approach,"During the mammalian preimplantation phase, cells undergo two subsequent cell fate decisions. During the first decision, the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass are formed. Subsequently, the inner cell mass segregates into the epiblast and the primitive endoderm. Inner cell mass organoids represent an experimental model system, mimicking the second cell fate decision. It has been shown that cells of the same fate tend to cluster stronger than expected for random cell fate decisions. Three major processes are hypothesised to contribute to the cell fate arrangements: (1) chemical signalling; (2) cell sorting; and (3) cell proliferation. In order to quantify the influence of cell proliferation on the observed cell lineage type clustering, we developed an agent-based model accounting for mechanical cell–cell interaction, i.e. adhesion and repulsion, cell division, stochastic cell fate decision and cell fate heredity. The model supports the hypothesis that initial cell fate acquisition is a stochastically driven process, taking place in the early development of inner cell mass organoids. Further, we show that the observed neighbourhood structures can emerge solely due to cell fate heredity during cell division."
In-depth blood proteome profiling analysis revealed distinct functional characteristics of plasma proteins between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over forty million patients worldwide. Although most coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have a good prognosis, some develop severe illness. Markers that define disease severity or predict clinical outcome need to be urgently developed as the mortality rate in critical cases is approximately 61.5%. In the present study, we performed in-depth proteome profiling of undepleted plasma from eight COVID-19 patients. Quantitative proteomic analysis using the BoxCar method revealed that 91 out of 1222 quantified proteins were differentially expressed depending on the severity of COVID-19. Importantly, we found 76 proteins, previously not reported, which could be novel prognostic biomarker candidates. Our plasma proteome signatures captured the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby highlighting the role of neutrophil activation, complement activation, platelet function, and T cell suppression as well as proinflammatory factors upstream and downstream of interleukin-6, interleukin-1B, and tumor necrosis factor. Consequently, this study supports the development of blood biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets to aid clinical decision-making and subsequently improve prognosis of COVID-19."
Actionable and incidental neuroradiological findings in twins with neurodevelopmental disorders,"While previous research has investigated neuroradiological findings in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the entire range of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) has not yet been well-studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Considering the overlap among NDDs and simultaneous development of the brain and face, guided by molecular signaling, we examined the relationship of actionable and incidental (non-actionable) MRI findings and NDD diagnoses together with facial morphological variants and genetic copy number variants (CNVs). A cross-sectional study was conducted with a twin cohort 8–36 years of age (57% monozygotic, 40% dizygotic), including 372 subjects (46% with NDDs; 47% female) imaged by MRI, 280 with data for facial morphological variants, and 183 for CNVs. Fifty-one percent of participants had MRI findings. Males had a statistically significantly higher percentage of MRI findings (57.7%) compared with females (43.8%, p = 0.03). Twin zygosity was not statistically significantly correlated with incidence or severity of specific MRI findings. No statistically significant association was found between MRI findings and any NDD diagnosis or facial morphological variants; however, MRI findings were statistically significantly associated with the number of CNVs (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.00–1.44, p = 0.05, adjusted OR for sex 1.24, 95% CI 1.03–1.50, p = 0.02). When combining the presence of MRI findings, facial morphological variants, and CNVs, statistically significant relationships were found with ASD and ADHD diagnoses (p = 0.0006 and p = 0.002, respectively). The results of this study demonstrate that the ability to identify NDDs from combined radiology, morphology, and CNV assessments may be possible. Additionally, twins do not appear to be at increased risk for neuroradiological variants."
Excellent age hardenability with the controllable microstructure of AXW100 magnesium sheet alloy,"Age-hardenability and corresponding improvement of the mechanical properties of Mg–1Al–0.7Ca and Mg–1Al–0.7Ca–0.7Y alloy sheets are addressed with respect to the microstructure and texture evolution during thermomechanical treatments. A fine grain structure and weak texture with the basal pole split into the sheet transverse direction are retained in the Mg–1Al–0.7Ca–0.7Y sheet even after the homogenization at 500 °C, due to the grain boundary pinning by Y-containing precipitates possessing a high thermal stability. Contrarily, the Mg–1Al–0.7Ca sheet shows a coarse microstructure and basal-type texture after the homogenization. The peak-aged condition is attained after the aging at 250 °C for 1800 s of both homogenized sheets, while the Y-containing sheet shows a higher hardness than the Mg–1Al–0.7Ca sheet. TEM analysis and thermodynamic calculation show the formation of metastable precipitates composed of Al, Ca, Y and Mg in the Mg–1Al–0.7Ca–0.7Y sheet at the homogenized and peak-aged conditions. A significant increase in the yield strength is obtained in the peak-aged condition from 162 MPa after the homogenization to 244 MPa, which arises from the increased size and number density of the precipitates. The high age-hardenability of the Mg–1Al–0.7Ca–0.7Y sheet attributes to the superior mechanical properties with an improved ductility promoted by the weak texture."
Uncovering the chemistry behind inducible morphological defences in the crustacean Daphnia magna via micro-Raman spectroscopy,"The widespread distribution of Crustacea across every aquatic ecological niche on Earth is enabled due to their exoskeleton's versatile properties. Especially mineralization of the exoskeleton provides protection against diverse environmental threats. Thereby, the exoskeleton of some entomostracans is extremely phenotypically plastic, especially in response to predators. For instance, the freshwater zooplankton Daphnia forms conspicuous inducible morphological defenses, such as helmets, and can increase the stability of its exoskeleton, which renders them less vulnerable to predation. In this study, we reveal for the first time the chemical composition of the exoskeleton of Daphnia magna, using Raman spectroscopy, to be composed of α-chitin and proteins with embedded amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). Furthermore, we reveal the exoskeleton's chemical changes associated with inducible defense mechanisms in the form of more substantial mineralization, which is probably correlated with enhanced carapace stability. We, therefore, highlight the importance of calcium-biominerals for inducible morphological defenses in Daphnia."
Environmental patterns of brown moss- and Sphagnum-associated microbial communities,"Northern peatlands typically develop through succession from fens dominated by the moss family Amblystegiaceae to bogs dominated by the moss genus Sphagnum. How the different plants and abiotic environmental conditions provided in Amblystegiaceae and Sphagnum peat shape the respective moss associated microbial communities is unknown. Through a large-scale molecular and biogeochemical study spanning Arctic, sub-Arctic and temperate regions we assessed how the endo- and epiphytic microbial communities of natural northern peatland mosses relate to peatland type (Sphagnum and Amblystegiaceae), location, moss taxa and abiotic environmental variables. Microbial diversity and community structure were distinctly different between Amblystegiaceae and Sphagnum peatlands, and within each of these two peatland types moss taxon explained the largest part of microbial community variation. Sphagnum and Amblystegiaceae shared few (< 1% of all operational taxonomic units (OTUs)) but strikingly abundant (up to 65% of relative abundance) OTUs. This core community overlapped by one third with the Sphagnum-specific core-community. Thus, the most abundant microorganisms in Sphagnum that are also found in all the Sphagnum plants studied, are the same OTUs as those few shared with Amblystegiaceae. Finally, we could confirm that these highly abundant OTUs were endophytes in Sphagnum, but epiphytes on Amblystegiaceae. We conclude that moss taxa and abiotic environmental variables associate with particular microbial communities. While moss taxon was the most influential parameter, hydrology, pH and temperature also had significant effects on the microbial communities. A small though highly abundant core community is shared between Sphagnum and Amblystegiaceae."
Clinical features of BK-polyomavirus and cytomegalovirus co-infection after kidney transplantation,"BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) are the main viral pathogens affecting the graft and recipient outcome after allogenic kidney transplantation. It has recently been found that infection with both viruses has a greater impact on kidney graft function than a single infection. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 723 recipients who received kidney transplantation between 2007 and 2015 after living and postmortal donation for differences in risk and outcome parameters regarding BKPyV (DNAemia) and CMV (CMV DNAemia) co-infection compared to sole viremias and to patients without viremia. Of all kidney allograft recipients in our cohort, 8.2% developed co-infection with BKPyV DNAemia and CMV DNAemia, 15.1% showed BKPyV viremia alone and 25.2% sole CMV DNAemia. Acute rejection was closely linked with co-infection (multivariable analysis, p = 0.001). Despite the fact that the estimated glomerular filtration rate of patients with co-infection was noticeably reduced compared to patients with BKV or CMV infection alone, transplant survival and patient survival were not significantly reduced. Co-infection with BKPyV and CMV in kidney transplanted patients is significantly associated with inferior allograft function. Since co-infection is strongly associated with acute rejection, co-infected individuals should be considered a risk collective."
Mind the Measure: On the Effects of Antidumping Investigations in Egypt,"This paper examines the impact of the antidumping measures initiated by the Government of Egypt on imports during the period 2001–2015. Our contribution is twofold. First, the paper distinguishes between the effect of antidumping measures on the value, the volume and the price of imports. Second, it differentiates between the investigation, destruction and diversion effects of antidumping measures. Our main findings show that, once the investigation is approved, while prices increase and quantities decrease, the latter effect is stronger than the former. Moreover, when the investigation is initiated, there is an investigation effect since imports are likely to decrease during the investigation review period and before the final decision of the World Trade Organization is announced. As per the destruction effect, we find that imports coming from countries included in the investigation decrease once the complaint is approved. Consequently, imports will shift from countries targeted by the measure to those non-targeted."
Compensation and Socio-Economic Status of Borrowers in Foreclosure: Evidence from Swedish Micro-data,"Proper compensation during foreclosure is essential to any effort to protect borrowers as consumers. However, the effectiveness of consumer protection and other safety nets during foreclosure has been debated within academia. This study contributes to this debate by exploring socio-economic group differences related to the compensatory potential of foreclosure proceedings. It employs micro-level data on foreclosure auctions in Sweden from 2000 to 2014. The results indicate that there is a correlation between high socio-economic status and a greater potential for compensation and that this is likely not explained by appraiser bias. This article discusses these empirical findings in terms of the need for strict consumer protection regulation and other safety nets, such as alternative mortgage products or debt relief, to ensure that there is a potential for compensation for all borrowers in foreclosure, regardless of socio-economic status."
B vitamin blood concentrations and one-carbon metabolism polymorphisms in a sample of Italian women and men attending a unit of transfusion medicine: a cross-sectional study,"To define blood status of folate, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, homocysteine, and major one-carbon metabolism-related polymorphisms in healthy, males and females blood donors, aged 18–65 years were evaluated. General characteristics and lifestyle factors were also investigated."
From Blackboard to Green Screen,"We report on the conversion of two advanced database courses from their classical in-lecture-hall setup into an all-digital remote format that was delivered via YouTube. While the course contents were not turned on their heads, throughout the semester we adopted a video style that has been popularized by the live coding community. This new focus on the live interaction with the underlying database systems, led us (1) to adopt the idea of SQL probe queries that are specifically crafted to reveal database internals and (2) a study of database-supported computation that treats SQL like a true programming language. We are happy to share videos, slides, and code with anyone who is interested."
Red panda: a novel method for detecting variants in single-cell RNA sequencing,"Single-cell sequencing enables us to better understand genetic diseases, such as cancer or autoimmune disorders, which are often affected by changes in rare cells. Currently, no existing software is aimed at identifying single nucleotide variations or micro (1-50 bp) insertions and deletions in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Generating high-quality variant data is vital to the study of the aforementioned diseases, among others."
Comprehensive network modeling from single cell RNA sequencing of human and mouse reveals well conserved transcription regulation of hematopoiesis,"Presently, there is no comprehensive analysis of the transcription regulation network in hematopoiesis. Comparison of networks arising from gene co-expression across species can facilitate an understanding of the conservation of functional gene modules in hematopoiesis."
Multivariate genome wide association and network analysis of subcortical imaging phenotypes in Alzheimer’s disease,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many individual genes associated with brain imaging quantitative traits (QTs) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However single marker level association discovery may not be able to address the underlying biological interactions with disease mechanism.
Sicherheit und Monitoring der patientenkontrollierten intravenösen Analgesie,"Die patientenkontrollierte intravenöse Analgesie („patient controlled intravenous analgesia“, PCIA) ist als Verfahren in der Akutschmerztherapie etabliert. Ziel dieser Untersuchung war es, Anwendungspraxis, Überwachung, unerwünschte Vorkommnisse und Komplikationen unter einer PCIA-Therapie an deutschen Krankenhäusern zu erfassen."
A bivariate finite mixture growth model with selection,"A model is proposed to analyze longitudinal data where two response variables are available, one of which is a binary indicator of selection and the other is continuous and observed only if the first is equal to 1. The model also accounts for individual covariates and may be considered as a bivariate finite mixture growth model as it is based on three submodels: (i) a probit model for the selection variable; (ii) a linear model for the continuous variable; and (iii) a multinomial logit model for the class membership. To suitably address endogeneity, the first two components rely on correlated errors as in a standard selection model. The proposed approach is applied to the analysis of the dynamics of household portfolio choices based on an unbalanced panel dataset of Italian households over the 1998–2014 period. For this dataset, we identify three latent classes of households with specific investment behaviors and we assess the effect of individual characteristics on households’ portfolio choices. Our empirical findings also confirm the need to jointly model risky asset market participation and the conditional portfolio share to properly analyze investment behaviors over the life-cycle."

Unobserved preferences and dynamic platform pricing under positive network externality,"We study the dynamic optimization of platform pricing in industries with positive direct network externalities. The utility of the network for the consumer is modeled as a function of three components. Platform price and participation rate affect the consumer’s decision to join the platform. The platform operator is assumed to know the consumer’s sensitivities with respect to these components. In addition, the consumer’s utility is a function of other attributes, such as network privacy policies and environmental effects of the service. We assume that the distribution of these unobserved preferences in the potential customer base is known to the platform operator. We show analytically how the unobserved preferences affect the dynamic platform price design. Both static and rational expectations with respect to the platform participation are presented. We simulate an electricity market demand side management service application and show that the platform operator sets low prices in the launch phase. The platform operator can set higher launching prices if it can affect customers’ preferences, expectations or adjustment friction."
"Biometric technology in “no-gate border crossing solutions” under consideration of privacy, ethical, regulatory and social acceptance","Biometric technologies have become the main focus in the design of state-of-the-art border security solutions. While respective research in the field of multimedia vision has been centred around improving quality and accuracy of identity recognition, the impact of such technologies upon society and legal regulations still remains a topic unaddressed, specifically within the engineering community. Research in technology can and in some respect must include collaboration with social sciences and social practice. Building on participation in the EU funded research project PERSONA [18] (Privacy, Ethical, Regulatory and SOcial No-gate crossing point solutions Acceptance), authors of this paper look at the challenges associated with biometrics-based solutions in no-gate border crossing point scenarios. This included the procedures needed for the assessment of their social, ethical, privacy and regulatory acceptance, particularly in view of the impact on both, the passengers and border control authorities as well as the potential pitfalls of biometric technology due to fraudulent activities. In consultation with the collaborating border control authorities, the paper reports on the formal assessment of biometric technologies for real-world acceptance to cope with the increasing demand of global travellers crossing state borders."
Spin-induced scalarization of Kerr black holes with a massive scalar field,"In the present paper we study the onset of the spin-induced scalarization of a Kerr black hole in scalar-Gauss–Bonnet gravity with a massive scalar field. Our approach is based on a \((2+1)\) time evolution of the relevant linearized scalar field perturbation equation. We examine the region where the Kerr black hole becomes unstable giving rise to new scalarized rotating black holes with a massive scalar field. With increasing of the scalar field mass, the minimum value of the Gauss–Bonnet coupling parameter at which scalarization is possible, increases and thus the instability region shrinks. Interestingly, the introduction of scalar field mass does not change the critical minimal value of the black hole angular momentum \(a_{\mathrm{crit}}/M\) where the instability of the Kerr black hole develops."
The growth factor parametrization versus numerical solutions in flat and non-flat dark energy models,"In the present investigation we use observational data of \( f \sigma _ {8} \) to determine observational constraints in the plane \((\Omega _{m0},\sigma _{8})\) using two different methods: the growth factor parametrization and the numerical solutions method for density contrast, \(\delta _{m}\). We verified the correspondence between both methods for three models of accelerated expansion: the \(\Lambda CDM\) model, the \( w_{0}w_{a} CDM\) model and the running cosmological constant RCC model. In all case we consider also the curvature as free parameter. The study of this correspondence is important because the growth factor parametrization method is frequently used to discriminate between competitive models. Our results we allow us to determine that there is a good correspondence between the observational constrains using both methods. We also test the power of the \( f\sigma _ {8} \) data to constraints the curvature parameter within the \( \Lambda CDM \) model. For this we use a non-parametric reconstruction using Gaussian processes. Our results show that the \( f\sigma _ {8}\) data with the current precision level does not allow to distinguish between a flat and non-flat universe."
Vacua and exact solutions in lower-D limits of EGB,"We consider the action principles that are the lower dimensional limits of the Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravity via the Kaluza–Klein route. We study the vacua and obtain some exact solutions. We find that the reality condition of the theories may select one vacuum over the other from the two vacua that typically arise in Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravity. We obtain exact black hole and cosmological solutions carrying scalar hair, including scalar hairy BTZ black holes with both mass and angular momentum turned on. We also discuss the holographic central charges in the asymptotic AdS backgrounds."
Quantum corrections to the accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole in the background of quintessence,"It is well known that quantum effects may lead to removal of the intrinsic singularity point of back holes. Also, the quintessence scalar field is a candidate model for describing late-time acceleration expansion. Accordingly, Kazakov and Solodukhin considered the existence of back-reaction of the spacetime due to the quantum fluctuations of the background metric to deform a Schwarzschild black hole, which led to a change of the intrinsic singularity of the black hole to a 2-sphere with a radius of the order of the Planck length. Also, Kiselev rewrote the Schwarzschild metric by taking into account the quintessence field in the background. In this study, we consider the quantum-corrected Schwarzschild black hole inspired by Kazakov–Solodukhin’s work, and the Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence deduced by Kiselev to study the mutual effects of quantum fluctuations and quintessence on the accretion onto the black hole. Consequently, the radial component of the 4-velocity and the proper energy density of the accreting fluid have a finite value on the surface of its central 2-sphere due to the presence of quantum corrections. Also, by comparing the accretion parameters in different kinds of black holes, we infer that the presence of a point-like electric charge in the spacetime is somewhat similar to some quantum fluctuations in the background metric."
Gamete binning: chromosome-level and haplotype-resolved genome assembly enabled by high-throughput single-cell sequencing of gamete genomes,"Generating chromosome-level, haplotype-resolved assemblies of heterozygous genomes remains challenging. To address this, we developed gamete binning, a method based on single-cell sequencing of haploid gametes enabling separation of the whole-genome sequencing reads into haplotype-specific reads sets. After assembling the reads of each haplotype, the contigs are scaffolded to chromosome level using a genetic map derived from the gametes. We assemble the two genomes of a diploid apricot tree based on whole-genome sequencing of 445 individual pollen grains. The two haplotype assemblies (N50: 25.5 and 25.8 Mb) feature a haplotyping precision of greater than 99% and are accurately scaffolded to chromosome-level."
Enhanced xylitol production using non-detoxified xylose rich pre-hydrolysate from sugarcane bagasse by newly isolated Pichia fermentans,"Integrated management of hemicellulosic fraction and its economical transformation to value-added products is the key driver towards sustainable lignocellulosic biorefineries. In this aspect, microbial cell factories are harnessed for the sustainable production of commercially viable biochemicals by valorising C5 and C6 sugars generated from agro-industrial waste. However, in the terrestrial ecosystem, microbial systems can efficiently consume glucose. On the contrary, pentose sugars are less preferred carbon source as most of the microbes lack metabolic pathway for their utilization. The effective utilization of both pentose and hexose sugars is key for economical biorefinery."
Study on strength and volume change behavior of stabilized black cotton soil with different pH of soil-lime mixes for pavement subgrade,"Lime stabilization is a proven technique to improve the subgrade properties of black cotton (BC) soil for pavement construction. However, deciding the optimum lime requirement for varying soil properties from location to location is still a challenge during new road construction. Hence, in this study, an attempt was made to bring out the quick identification of optimum lime dosage by pH test. However, the pH test alone is not sufficient to know the changes in Physico-chemical properties of soil by lime addition. Therefore, investigations were performed by addition of different lime contents with varying curing periods to bring out the effect on strength and volumetric change behavior of BC soil."
"COVID-19: Reflections on the Crisis, Transformation, and Interactive Processes Under Development","With a global extent, the pandemic of the new coronavirus and the resulting measures to contain the contagion imposed immediate changes in the routine of people and societies. In view of this historical event, the first part of this theoretical study discussed its relationship with the concept of crisis, while circumscribing human development processes, mobilizing reorganizations in life trajectories. In the second part, the intensification of the use of digital tools to support communication during social isolation was highlighted, particularly reflecting on new interactive arrangements and inter-corporeal experiences. The paper reflects on the proximal processes in the new interactive and contextual configurations through the bioecological theory of human development and, based on concepts of the enactive theory, discusses possible implications of the new perceptual fields and the production of meanings with the repositioning of the body and new modes of engagement. The study highlights that the changes, events, relationships, and effects that we are experiencing (trans)form our forms of sociability and bases of psyche."
Study of the temperature effect on the morphology and structure of ZnS nanoparticles synthesized by hydrothermal method,"The control over the materials structure is crucial for the modulation of its properties, in order to achieve this control is important to know the formation mechanism of the material as function of parameters used. For this purpose, the effect of temperature (120, 140, 160 and 180 °C) on the hydrothermal synthesis of zinc sulphide is evaluated and a proposal of the sequence of reactions formation of zinc sulphur is presented. ZnS nanostructures with blend-phase were obtained, the temperature increment induces the growth of the nanostructure ranged between.62 and 12.72 nm, furthermore, increase the crystallinity of the ZnS nanostructures. The proposed reactions suggest the formation of a complex of thioacetamide with the Zn+2 and its subsequent decomposition into ZnS."
Interlayer transition in graphene carbon quantum dots,"Graphene Carbon Quantum Dots (GCQDs) are multi-layered carbon nanostructures that have attracted considerable attention due to its unique properties. Many technological applications, such as batteries, biological imaging, capacitors, solar cells, light emitting diodes, among others, could benefit from the low toxicity and the chemical and physical stability of these nanostructures. Despite much research, many optical properties, such as absorption and photoluminescence, of GCQDs are not completely understood yet. GCQD absorption spectra show a number of different bands whose origin is still on discussion. Many interpretations are made considering a single graphene layer. In this work, GCQD samples synthesized by the pyrolysis of citric acid was characterized by absorption spectroscopy measurements and Density Functional Theory simulations considering multi-layered structures. Density of States and electronic response functions calculations were also performed. From the results of these calculations, the absorption band associated to a π-π* (CC) transition could be also associated to a transition between different graphene layers."
SERS properties of biogenic gold nanoparticles synthesized using Anemopsis californica extract.,"Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been classified as one of the most attractive nanotechnologies, thanks to their potential or already implemented applications; therefore, biological methods for their synthesis have been widely investigated. This study explores the synthesis of AuNPs using the extract of Anemopsis californica, and determinates the effect of the solvent used (water, methanol, and isopropanol) to obtain the AuNPs. Biogenic nanoparticles were analysed through UV-Vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, HRTEM, and SAED). Significant differences in polydispersity and morphology of AuNPs among the different methods used were found; the aqueous extract and the extract based on methanol formed nanotriangles and polyhedral nanoparticles; the shape of the nanoparticles is predominantly polyhedral when isopropanol is used as the solvent. The as obtained nanoparticles were placed on glass slides to perform Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) experiments, an amplification of the methylene blue Raman signal was observed when triangular nanoparticles cover the biogenic SERS substrate."
White Light Emitting CdS Quantum Dot Devices Coated with Layers of Graphene Carbon Quantum Dots,"Cadmium sulfide quantum dots (CdS QDs) are semiconductor nanoparticles having sizes in the order of nanometers. They are materials that have outstanding properties for down conversion applications. These nanostructures have been used in the fabrication of white light emitting diodes (WLEDs) in the last years. However, inhomogeneous deposition of CdS QD conversion materials allows unwanted UV light escape. In addition, low efficiency due to strong self-quenching effect, incompatibility between CdS QD solution/crystal polyester resin matrix and reabsorption are common problems that need to be solved. In this work, we try to address the incompatibility between the CdS QD solution/crystal polyester resin matrix by using a solvent exchange procedure. To block the unwanted UV-light escape, we coated our devices with a mixture of graphene carbon quantum dot (GCQD) solution/crystal polyester resin matrix. The QDs and the WLED prototypes were characterized by absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The QDs embedded in the matrix shown a good homogeneous dispersion. On the other hand, the mixture shown a rapid solidification. These facts indicate a good compatibility between the CdS QDs and the crystal polyester resin. We also observed a considerable reduction of unwanted near UV-light. White light emission from WLED devices with common crystal polyester resin and low-cost materials has been achieved."
Titanium Disulphide (TiS2) Dichalcogenide Thin Films as Inorganic Hole Transport Layer for Perovskite Solar Cells Synthesized from Ionic Liquid Electrodeposition,"In high efficiency organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells formed as a multilayer structure, the hole transporting layer (HTL) at the perovskite absorber layer interface has a critical role. Organic HTLs based on Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA have led to high efficiencies but displayed poor long-term stability and involves expensive purification processes that hinders universal low-cost commercialization goals for perovskite solar cells. Though as an inorganic alternative, transition metal chalcogenides have been investigated for HTL recently, the hot-injection method often used in synthesis has shown poor reproducibility and difficulty in scaling-up. In this work we demonstrate an ab initio facile inexpensive scalable synthesis of transition metal dichalcogenide (TiS2) by electrodeposition from ionic liquids as a low-cost inorganic HTL for perovskite solar cells. The TiS2 thin films were electrodeposited from choline chloride–urea eutectic based ionic liquid electrolytes at 80°C with Na2S2O3 as sulphur and TiCl4 as titanium source. From cyclic voltammetry studies the deposition potential of TiS2 was optimized at -0.8V vs Pt. The as-deposited TiS2 HTL exhibited polycrystalline structure with preferential growth along (001), (100), (002), (102), (110), (111) planes. The Raman spectroscopy of the films showed peaks around 225 cm−1 and 332 cm−1 attributed to the Eg and A1 g Raman modes respectively. The synthesized thin films demonstrated sharp optical bandgap edge along with bandgap tunability as the bandgap (direct) decreased from 1.53 eV to 1.49 eV, 1.40 eV, and 1.34 eV with gradual change in deposition potential from −0.8 V to −0.9 V, −1.0 V, and −1.1 V vs Pt, respectively. This aspect has potential for alignment of valance band edge in facilitating the hole transport at the perovskite-TiS2 interface. The absorption coefficient in visible-light range of the as-deposited TiS2 thin films likewise has shown a dependence on the synthesis potential which is highly conducive for application as an HTL in multilayer solar cell structure. The TiS2 thin films were observed to be p-type as shown from the Hall effect studies with a carrier mobility up to 14.4 cm2V−1s−1. A detailed study of the effect of the synthesis parameters on the structural, optical, band-edge, and electronic properties of TiS2 thin films suitable for application as HTL in perovskite solar cells is presented."
Trihydrazinotriazine-grafting Fe3O4/SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles with expanded porous structure for organic reactions,"This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of a novel magnetic nanocomposite 2,4,6-trihydrazino-1,3,5-triazine (THDT)-functionalized with silica-coated iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). This nanocomposite has porous morphology decorated with the spherical MNPs. Through co-precipitation of iron salts, MNPs were obtained. The prepared THDT was placed on the chlorine surface-modified MNPs. The present environment-friendly nanocatalyst intensely accelerated the synthesis of highly functionalized tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran derivatives as well as reduced the reaction times and increased yields of the products."
Trichotomic separation of light and heavy lanthanides and Am by batchwise multi-stage extractions using TODGA,"To achieve trichotomic separation of light lanthanides (Ln), heavy Ln, and Am, batchwise multi-stage extractions using N,N,N′,N′-tetraoctyl-diglycolamide (TODGA) extractant from organic acids are studied. This technique has the advantages of both solvent extraction and chromatography, which enable successive separation and management of large volumes of aqueous solutions. Malonic acid (M-Acid) is used as the main component of the aqueous phase. It is clear that the separation factor for Nd/Am from M-Acid and that for La/Am from M-Acid + HNO3 are both around 30, thus we plan to conduct these separations."
A novel magnetic functionalized m-carboxyphenyl azo calix[4]arene symmetric sulfide derivative: synthesis and application as a selective adsorbent for removal of U (VI),"A novel adsorbent magnetic functionalized m-carboxyphenyl azo calix[4]arene symmetrical sulfide derivative (Fe3O4/M-CCSSD) was fabricated by a series of simple reactions and characterized by FT-IR and SEM. The effects on U (VI) adsorption process were investigated at several conditions. The calculated data disclose that the adsorption process of U (VI) by Fe3O4/M-CCSSD is an endothermic spontaneous process, which well fits with the pseudo-second-order kinetic and Freundlich isotherm model. In the most favorable conditions, accounting for approximately 89% of U (VI) was removed. In addition, Fe3O4/M-CCSSD showed high selectivity for U (VI) and exceptional reusability."
intePareto: an R package for integrative analyses of RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data,"RNA-Seq, the high-throughput sequencing (HT-Seq) of mRNAs, has become an essential tool for characterizing gene expression differences between different cell types and conditions. Gene expression is regulated by several mechanisms, including epigenetically by post-translational histone modifications which can be assessed by ChIP-Seq (Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation Sequencing). As more and more biological samples are analyzed by the combination of ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, the integrated analysis of the corresponding data sets becomes, theoretically, a unique option to study gene regulation. However, technically such analyses are still in their infancy."
LongGF: computational algorithm and software tool for fast and accurate detection of gene fusions by long-read transcriptome sequencing,"Long-read RNA-Seq techniques can generate reads that encompass a large proportion or the entire mRNA/cDNA molecules, so they are expected to address inherited limitations of short-read RNA-Seq techniques that typically generate < 150 bp reads. However, there is a general lack of software tools for gene fusion detection from long-read RNA-seq data, which takes into account the high basecalling error rates and the presence of alignment errors."
Deep learning for HGT insertion sites recognition,"Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) refers to the sharing of genetic materials between distant species that are not in a parent-offspring relationship. The HGT insertion sites are important to understand the HGT mechanisms. Recent studies in main agents of HGT, such as transposon and plasmid, demonstrate that insertion sites usually hold specific sequence features. This motivates us to find a method to infer HGT insertion sites according to sequence features."
Template-based prediction of protein structure with deep learning,"Accurate prediction of protein structure is fundamentally important to understand biological function of proteins. Template-based modeling, including protein threading and homology modeling, is a popular method for protein tertiary structure prediction. However, accurate template-query alignment and template selection are still very challenging, especially for the proteins with only distant homologs available."
Prognostic value and co-expression patterns of metabolic pathways in cancers,"Abnormal metabolic pathways have been considered as one of the hallmarks of cancer. While numerous metabolic pathways have been studied in various cancers, the direct link between metabolic pathway gene expression and cancer prognosis has not been established."

It is clear that the separation factor for Nd/Am from M-Acid and that for La/Am from M-Acid + HNO3 are both around 30, thus we plan to conduct these separations."

A new variational approach for the thermodynamic topology optimization of hyperelastic structures,We present a novel approach to topology optimization based on thermodynamic extremal principles. This approach comprises three advantages: (1) it is valid for arbitrary hyperelastic material formulations while avoiding artificial procedures that were necessary in our previous approaches for topology optimization based on thermodynamic principles; (2) the important constraints of bounded relative density and total structure volume are fulfilled analytically which simplifies the numerical implementation significantly; (3) it possesses a mathematical structure that allows for a variety of numerical procedures to solve the problem of topology optimization without distinct optimization routines. We present a detailed model derivation including the chosen numerical discretization and show the validity of the approach by simulating two boundary value problems with large deformations.
Neutrino amplitude decomposition: toward observing the atmospheric-solar wave interference,"Observation of the interference between the atmospheric and solar oscillation waves with the correct magnitude would provide another manifestation of the three-generation structure of leptons. As a prerequisite for such analyses we develop a method for decomposing the oscillation S matrix into the atmospheric and solar amplitudes. Though the similar method was recently proposed successfully in vacuum, once an extension into the matter environment is attempted, it poses highly nontrivial problems. Even for an infinitesimal matter potential, inherent mixture of the atmospheric and solar oscillation waves occurs, rendering a simple extension of the vacuum definition untenable. We utilize general kinematic structure as well as analyses of the five perturbative frameworks, in which the nature of matter-dressed atmospheric and solar oscillations are known, to understand the origin of the trouble, how to deal with the difficulty, and to grasp the principle of decomposition. Then, we derive the amplitude decomposition formulas in these frameworks, and discuss properties of the decomposed probabilities. We mostly discuss the \(\nu _{\mu } \rightarrow \nu _{e}\) channel, but a comparison with the \(\nu _{\mu } \rightarrow \nu _{\tau }\) channel reveals an interesting difference."
Matter accretion onto a conformal gravity black hole,"The accretion of test fluids flowing onto a black hole is investigated. Particularly, by adopting a dynamical Hamiltonian approach, we are capable to find the critical points for various cases of black hole in conformal gravity. In these cases, we have analyzed the general solutions of accretion employing the isothermal equations of state. The steady state and spherically symmetric accretion of different test fluids onto the conformal gravity black hole has been considered. Further, we have classified these flows in the context of equations of state and the cases of conformal gravity black hole. The new behavior of polytropic fluid accretion is also discussed in all three cases of black hole. Black hole mass accretion rate is the most important part of this research in which we have investigated that the Schwarzschild black hole produce a typical signature than the conformal gravity black hole and Schwarzschild–de Sitter black hole. The critical fluid flow and the mass accretion rate have been presented graphically by the impact parameters \(\beta \), \(\gamma \), k and these parameters have great significance. Additionally, the maximum mass rate of accretion fall near the universal and Killing horizons and minimum rate of accretion occurs in between these regions. Finally, the results are compared with the different cases of black hole available in the literature."
HiggsBounds-5: testing Higgs sectors in the LHC 13 TeV Era,"We describe recent developments of the public computer code HiggsBounds. In particular, these include the incorporation of LHC Higgs search results from Run 2 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, and an updated and extended framework for the theoretical input that accounts for improved Higgs cross section and branching ratio predictions and new search channels. We furthermore discuss an improved method used in HiggsBounds to approximately reconstruct the exclusion likelihood for LHC searches for non-standard Higgs bosons decaying to \(\tau \tau \) final states. We describe in detail the new and updated functionalities of the new version HiggsBounds-5."

"An accurate, high-speed, portable bifunctional electrical detector for COVID-19","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread and caused a severe global pandemic. Because no specific drugs are available for COVID-19 and few vaccines are available for SARS-CoV-2, accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 has been the most crucial measure to control this pandemic. Here, we developed a portable bifunctional electrical detector based on graphene fieldeffect transistors for SARS-CoV-2 through either nucleic acid hybridization or antigen-antibody protein interaction, with ultra-low limits of detection of ~0.1 and ~1 fg mL−1 in phosphate buffer saline, respectively. We validated our method by assessment of RNA extracts from the oropharyngeal swabs of ten COVID-19 patients and eight healthy subjects, and the IgM/IgG antibodies from serum specimens of six COVID-19 patients and three healthy subjects. Here we show that the diagnostic results are in excellent agreement with the findings of polymerase chain reaction-based optical methods; they also exhibit rapid detection speed (~10 min for nucleic acid detection and ~5 min for immunoassay). Therefore, our assay provides an efficient, accurate tool for high-throughput point-of-care testing."

"Land degradation risk mapping using topographic, human-induced, and geo-environmental variables and machine learning algorithms, for the Pole-Doab watershed, Iran","Land degradation (LD) is a complex process affected by both anthropogenic and natural driving variables, and its prevention has become an essential task globally. The aim of the present study was to develop a new quantitative LD mapping approach using machine learning techniques, benchmark models, and human-induced and socio-environmental variables. We employed four machine learning algorithms [Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and Dragonfly Algorithm (DA)] for LD risk mapping, based on topographic (n = 7), human-induced (n = 5), and geo-environmental (n = 6) variables, and field measurements of degradation in the Pole-Doab watershed, Iran. We assessed the performance of different algorithms using receiver operating characteristic, Kappa index, and Taylor diagram. The results revealed that the main topographic, geoenvironmental, and human-induced variable was slope, geology, and land use change, respectively. Assessments of model performance indicated that DA had the highest accuracy and efficiency, with the greatest learning and prediction power in LD risk mapping. In LD risk maps produced using SVM, GLM, MARS, and DA, 19.16%, 19.29%, 21.76%, and 22.40%, respectively, of total area in the Pole-Doab watershed had a very high degradation risk. The results of this study demonstrate that in LD risk mapping for a region, topographic, and geological factors (static conditions) and human activities (dynamic conditions, e.g., residential and industrial area expansion) should be considered together, for best protection at watershed scale. These findings can help policymakers prioritize land and water conservation efforts."
Soil bacterial depth distribution controlled by soil orders and soil forms,"Human disturbances to soils can lead to dramatic changes in soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. The influence of agricultural activities on the bacterial community over different orders of soil and at depth is still not well understood. We used the concept of genoform and phenoform to investigate the vertical (down to 1 m depth) soil bacterial community structure in paired genosoils (undisturbed forests) and phenosoils (cultivated vineyards) in different soil orders. The study was conducted in the Hunter Valley area, New South Wales, Australia, where samples were collected from 3 different soil orders (Calcarosol, Chromosol, and Kurosol), and each soil order consists of a pair of genosoil and phenosoil. The bacterial community structure was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA. Results showed that bacterial-diversity decreased with depth in phenosoils, however, the trend is less obvious in genoform profiles. Topsoil diversity was greater in phenosoils than genosoils, but the trend was reversed in subsoils. Thus, cropping not only affected topsoil bacteria community but also decreased its diversity in the subsoil. Bacterial community in topsoils was influenced by both soil orders and soil forms, however, in subsoils it was more impacted by soil orders. Constrained Analysis of Principal Coordinates revealed that cropping increased the similarity of bacterial structures of different soil orders. This study highlighted the strong influence of agricultural activities on soil microbial distribution with depth, which is controlled by soil order."

Adaptability of asphalt pavement structures to deformation of embankment underlain by black cotton soil,"Three pavement structures, including fatigue-resistant layer sandwich structure (FRLSS), sandwich asphalt pavement structure (SAPS) and semi-rigid base pavement structure (SRBPS), were designed to investigate their adaptability to the differential deformation of highway embankment on black cotton soil (BCS), which shrink/swell behavior was modeled by the coupled consolidation theory for unsaturated soils. The maximum additional tensile stress in pavement was obtained, and the present serviceability index (PSI) and the international roughness index (IRI) were calculated by the vertical movement, pavement properties and traffic data. The adaptability of those pavement structures to the differential deformation of highway embankment was evaluated by grey relational analytical method using the PSI, IRI and additional tensile stress as the indexes. The results reveal that FRLSS presents the better effect in controlling cracks on the key-layer bottom, while SRBPS presents the better effect in controlling cracks on the pavement surface. The effect in controlling roughness decreases gradually from FRLSS, SAPS to SRBPS in order. The adaptability of FRLSS to the soil movement of highway embankment on BCS is superior to SAPS, which excels SRBPS. Overall, FRLSS should be given priority in designing asphalt pavement underlain by BCS foundation from the perspective of controlling roughness and cracks."
Effect of microlimestone on properties of self-consolidating concrete with manufactured sand and mineral admixture,"Self-consolidating concrete (SCC) with manufactured sand (MSCC) is crucial to guarantee the quality of concrete construction technology and the associated property. The properties of MSCC with different microlimestone powder (MLS) replacements of retreated manufactured sand (TMsand) are investigated in this study. The result indicates that high-performance SCC, made using TMsand (TMSCC), achieved high workability, good mechanical properties, and durability by optimizing MLS content and adding fly ash and silica fume. In particular, the TMSCC with 12% MLS content exhibits the best workability, and the TMSCC with 4% MLS content has the highest strength in the late age, which is even better than that of SCC made with the river sand (Rsand). Though MLS content slightly affects the hydration reaction of cement and mainly plays a role in the nucleation process in concrete structures compared to silica fume and fly ash, increasing MLS content can evidently have a significant impact on the early age hydration progress. TMsand with MLS content ranging from 8% to 12% may be a suitable alternative for the Rsand used in the SCC as fine aggregate. The obtained results can be used to promote the application of SCC made with manufactured sand and mineral admixtures for concrete-based infrastructure."
Validation of Doppler Wind Lidar during Super Typhoon Lekima (2019),"This study undertook verification of the applicability and accuracy of wind data measured using a WindCube V2 Doppler Wind Lidar (DWL). The data were collected as part of a field experiment in Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province (China), which was conducted by Shanghai Typhoon Institute of China Meteorological Administration during the passage of Super Typhoon Lekima (2019). The DWL measurements were compared with balloon-borne GPS radiosonde (GPS sonde) data, which were acquired using balloons launched from the DWL location. Results showed that wind speed measured by GPS sonde at heights of < 100 m is unreliable owing to the drift effect. Optimal agreement (at heights of > 100 m) was found for DWL-measured wind speed time-averaged during the ascent of the GPS sonde from the ground surface to the height of 270 m (correlation coefficient: 0.82; root mean square (RMS): 2.19). Analysis revealed that precipitation intensity (PI) exerts considerable influence on both the carrier-to-noise ratio and the rate of missing DWL data; however, PI has minimal effect on the wind speed bias of DWL measurements. Specifically, the rate of missing DWL data increased with increasing measurement height and PI. For PI classed as heavy rain or less (PI < 12 mm·h−1), the DWL data below 300 m were considered valid, whereas for PI classed as a severe rainstorm (PI > 90 mm·h−1), only data below 100 m were valid. Up to the height of 300 m, the RMS of the DWL measurements was nearly half that of wind profile radar (WPR) estimates (4.32 m·s−1), indicating that DWL wind data are more accurate than WPR data under typhoon conditions."
Optimal design of extractive dividing-wall column using an efficient equation-oriented approach,"The extractive dividing-wall column (EDWC) is one of the most efficient technologies for separation of azeotropic or close boiling-point mixtures, but its design is fairly challenging. In this paper we extend the hybrid feasible path optimisation algorithm (Ma Y, McLaughlan M, Zhang N, Li J. Computers & Chemical Engineering, 2020, 143: 107058) for such optimal design. The tolerances-relaxation integration method is refined to allow for long enough integration time that can ensure the solution of the pseudo-transient continuation simulation close to the steady state before the required tolerance is used. To ensure the gradient and Jacobian information available for optimisation, we allow a relaxed tolerance for the simulation in the sensitivity analysis mode when the simulation diverges under small tolerance. In addition, valid lower bounds on purity of the recycled entrainer and the vapour flow rate in column sections are imposed to improve computational efficiency. The computational results demonstrate that the extended hybrid algorithm can achieve better design of the EDWC compared to those in literature. The energy consumption can be reduced by more than 20% compared with existing literature report. In addition, the optimal design of the heat pump assisted EDWC is achieved using the improved hybrid algorithm for the first time."
Trihydrazinotriazine-grafting Fe3O4/SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles with expanded porous structure for organic reactions,"This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of a novel magnetic nanocomposite 2,4,6-trihydrazino-1,3,5-triazine (THDT)-functionalized with silica-coated iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). This nanocomposite has porous morphology decorated with the spherical MNPs. Through co-precipitation of iron salts, MNPs were obtained. The prepared THDT was placed on the chlorine surface-modified MNPs. The present environment-friendly nanocatalyst intensely accelerated the synthesis of highly functionalized tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran derivatives as well as reduced the reaction times and increased yields of the products."
A Gentle Sedimentation Process for Size-Selecting Porous Silicon Microparticles to Be Used for Drug Delivery Via Fine Gauge Needle Administration,"Biodegradable porous silicon (pSi) particles are under development for drug delivery applications. The optimum particle size very much depends on medical use, and microparticles can outperform nanoparticles in specific instances. Here we demonstrate the ability of sedimentation to size-select ultrasmall (1–10 μm) nanoporous microparticles in common solvents. Size tunability is quantified for 1–24 h of sedimentation. Experimental values of settling times in ethanol and water are compared to those calculated using Stokes’ Law. Differences can arise due to particle agglomeration, internal gas generation and incomplete wetting. Air-dried and supercritically-dried pSi powders are shown to have, for example, their median diameter d (0.5) particle sizes reduced from 13 to 1 μm and from 20 to 3 μm, using sedimentation times of 6 and 2 h respectively. Such filtered microparticles also have much narrower size distributions and are hence suitable for administration in 27 gauge microneedles, commonly used in intravitreal drug delivery."

Time-series analysis of heart rate and blood pressure in response to changes in work rate before and after 60 days of 6° head down tilt bed rest,"Cardiovascular regulation during exercise, described using time series analysis, is expected to be attenuated after bed rest (BR) and this effect will be dampened by a reactive jumps countermeasure."
Micromechanical modelling of ductile fracture in pipeline steel using a bifurcation-enriched porous plasticity model,"In this paper, we investigate the possibility of predicting ductile fracture of pipeline steel by using the Gurson–Tvergaard–Needleman (GTN) model where the onset of void coalescence is determined based on in situ bifurcation analyses. To this end, three variants of the GTN model, one of which includes in situ bifurcation, are calibrated for a pipeline steel grade X65 using uniaxial and notch tension tests. Then plane-strain tension tests and Kahn tear tests of the same material are used for assessment of the credibility of the three models. Explicit finite element simulations are carried out for all tests using the three variants of the GTN model, and the results are compared to the experimental data. The capability of the simulation models to capture onset of fracture and crack propagation in the pipeline steel is evaluated. It is found that the use of in situ bifurcation as a criterion for onset of void coalescence in each element makes the GTN model easier to calibrate with less free parameters, all the while obtaining similar or even better predictions as other widely used formulations of the GTN model over a wide range of different stress states."
Modular crawling robots using soft pneumatic actuators,"Crawling robots have elicited much attention in recent years due to their stable and efficient locomotion. In this work, several crawling robots are developed using two types of soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs), namely, an axial elongation SPA and a dual bending SPA. By constraining the deformation of the elastomeric chamber, the SPAs realize their prescribed motions, and the deformations subjected to pressures are characterized with numerical models. Experiments are performed for verification, and the results show good agreement. The SPAs are fabricated by casting and developed into crawling robots with 3D-printing connectors. Control schemes are presented, and crawling tests are performed. The speeds predicted by the numerical models agree well with the speeds in the experiments."
Health services research in colorectal cancer: a quasi-experimental interventional pilot study on in- and outpatient oncology,"Due to frequent treatment side effects and weight loss, colorectal cancer patients require oncologic care and nutritional counseling both during and after hospitalization. The current study evaluated differences in discharge and side effects management and nutritional behavior between colorectal cancer patients of a control group without systematic counseling and of an intervention group with access to structured in- and outpatient oncology nurse and nutritional counseling."
Spin-locality of η2 and \( {\overline{\eta}}^2 \) quartic higher-spin vertices,"Higher-spin theory contains a complex coupling parameter η. Different higher-spin vertices are associated with different powers of η and its complex conjugate \( \overline{\eta} \). Using Z-dominance Lemma of [1], that controls spin-locality of the higher-spin equations, we show that the third-order contribution to the zero-form B(Z; Y; K) admits a Z-dominated form that leads to spin-local vertices in the η2 and \( {\overline{\eta}}^2 \) sectors of the higher-spin equations. These vertices include, in particular, the η2 and \( {\overline{\eta}}^2 \) parts of the ϕ4 scalar field vertex."
Demographic analyses of a new sample of haploid genomes from a Swedish population of Drosophila melanogaster,"European and African natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster have been the focus of several studies aiming at inferring demographic and adaptive processes based on genetic variation data. However, in these analyses little attention has been given to gene flow between African and European samples. Here we present a dataset consisting of 14 fully sequenced haploid genomes sampled from a natural population from the northern species range (Umeå, Sweden). We co-analyzed this new data with an African population to compare the likelihood of several competing demographic scenarios for European and African populations and show that gene flow improves the fit of demographic models to data."
Survival of the enveloped bacteriophage Phi6 (a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2) in evaporated saliva microdroplets deposited on glass surfaces,"Survival of respiratory viral pathogens in expelled saliva microdroplets is central to their transmission, yet the factors that determine survival in such microdroplets are not well understood. Here we combine microscopy imaging with virus viability assays to study survival of three bacteriophages suggested as good models for respiratory pathogens: the enveloped Phi6 (a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2), and the non-enveloped PhiX174 and MS2. We measured virus viability in human saliva microdroplets, SM buffer, and water following deposition on glass surfaces at various relative humidities (RH). Saliva and water microdroplets dried out rapidly, within minutes, at all tested RH levels (23%, 43%, 57%, and 78%), while SM microdroplets remained hydrated at RH ≥ 57%. Generally, the survival of all three viruses in dry saliva microdroplets was significantly greater than those in SM buffer and water under all RH (except PhiX174 in water under 57% RH survived the best among 3 media). Thus, atmosphere RH and microdroplet hydration state are not sufficient to explain virus survival, indicating that the virus-suspended medium, and association with saliva components in particular, likely play a role in virus survival. Uncovering the exact properties and components that make saliva a favorable environment for the survival of viruses, in particular enveloped ones like Phi6, is thus of great importance for reducing transmission of viral respiratory pathogens including SARS-CoV-2."
Exchange Rate Dynamics and Trade Balance in Selected African Countries,"African countries have over the years experienced persistent current account deficits. The role of asymmetries in explaining the response of trade balance to exchange rate movement has not received adequate attention as linear models dominate extant empirical literature. In this paper, we examined the impact of exchange rate on the trade balance in five African countries using both linear and nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag models to analyze data for the period 1980–2018. The linear model revealed that the J-curve holds in Uganda in the short run, whereas evidence of long-run J-curve effect was found only in Algeria. However, the nonlinear analysis showed that the short-run J-curve holds for South Africa and Uganda whereas a long-run J-curve effect was found in Algeria and Uganda. The results make a case for modeling asymmetries as the nonlinear model performed relatively better. An important policy implication is the need to address structural imbalances in the economy to leverage on the exchange rate and trade policies to improve trade outcomes."
Energy and Exergy Analysis of a Cooling/Power Cogeneration Ejector Refrigeration System,"The organic Rankine cycle is introduced into the conventional ejector refrigeration (CER) system to establish the low-grade heat-driven cooling/power cogeneration ejector refrigeration (CPC-ER) system using the isobutane as the refrigerant. In comparison with the CER system where external power is consumed by the circulating pump, the power output from the CPC-ER system is more than the power consumption of its circulating pump so that a portion of net power is derived from the CPC-ER system. Based on the mathematical model of thermodynamics, energy and exergy analysis of the CPC-ER system is carried out and compared with the CER system. The results reveal that the equivalent coefficient of performance (COP) of the CPC-ER system is 41.14% to 71.30% higher than that of the CER system, and the exergy efficiency of the CPC-ER system is 1.32 to 1.49 times higher than that of the CER system. Both the power produced by the turbine and the total exergy output from the CPC-ER system approach the maximum, as the generating temperature in the generator is up to 80°C. The CPC-ER system has the higher energy utilization efficiency than the CER system, and it is suitable for the cooling and power-required places with low-grade thermal sources."
"Artificial Neural Network-based prediction of glacial debris flows in the ParlungZangbo Basin, southeastern Tibetan Plateau, China","Accurate prediction on geological hazards can prevent disaster events in advance and greatly reduce property losses and life casualties. Glacial debris flows are the most serious hazards in southeastern Tibet in China due to their complexity in formation mechanism and the difficulty in prediction. Data collected from 102 glacier debris flow events from 31 gullies since 1970 and regional meteorological data from 1970 to 2019 in ParlungZangbo River Basin in southeastern Tibet were used for Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based prediction of glacial debris flows. The formation mechanism of glacial debris flows in the ParlungZangbo Basin was systematically analyzed, and the calculations involving the meteorological data and disaster events were conducted by using the statistical methods and two layers fully connected neural networks. The occurrence probabilities and scales of glacial debris flows (small, medium, and large) were predicted, and promising results have been achieved. Through the proposed model calculations, a prediction accuracy of 78.33% was achieved for the scale of glacial debris flows in the study area. The prediction accuracy for both large- and medium-scale debris flows are higher than that for small-scale debris flows. The debris flow scale and the probability of occurrence increase with increasing rainfall and temperature. In addition, the K-fold cross-validation method was used to verify the reliability of the model. The average accuracy of the model calculated under this method is about 93.3%, which validates the proposed model. Practices have proved that the combination of ANN and disaster events can provide sound prediction on geological hazards under complex conditions."
Inversion analysis of the shear strength parameters for a high loess slope in the limit state,"It is difficult to obtain reliable shear strength parameters for the stability analysis and evaluation of high loess slopes. Hence, this paper determines slope elements and physical parameter of 79 slopes with heights of [40, 120] m based on the measured loess slopes in the Ganquan and Tonghuang subregions of northern Shaanxi Province, China. In the limit state of the loess slope (stability factor Fs is 1.0), a fitting equation for the slope height and width is established. Then, the model is developed by stability analysis software-SLOPE/W, and the comprehensive shear strength parameters corresponding to different slope heights of the high slope in the study area are obtained by inversion using the Morgenstern-Price method. The results show that when the height of the slope increases, the cohesion c increases in the soil, and the internal friction angle φ decreases. This change is consistent with the characteristics reflected in the composition and physical properties of the slopes, and the comprehensive strength parametric curves are very similar between the Ganquan subregion and the Tonghuang subregion. A landslide that occurred in Miaodian-zaitou of Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, is selected to verify this inversion method, and the results show that the calculated shear strength parameters of the inversion are consistent with the measured value of the actual slope."
Nonlinear vibrations and time delay control of an extensible slowly rotating beam,Nonlinear dynamics of a rotating flexible slender beam with embedded active elements is studied in the paper. Mathematical model of the structure considers possible moderate oscillations thus the motion is governed by the extended Euler–Bernoulli model that incorporates a nonlinear curvature and coupled transversal–longitudinal deformations. The Hamilton’s principle of least action is applied to derive a system of nonlinear coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) of motion. The embedded active elements are used to control or reduce beam oscillations for various dynamical conditions and rotational speed range. The control inputs generated by active elements are represented in boundary conditions as non-homogenous terms. Classical linear proportional (P) control and nonlinear cubic (C) control as well as mixed (\(P-C\)) control strategies with time delay are analyzed for vibration reduction. Dynamics of the complete system with time delay is determined analytically solving directly the PDEs by the multiple timescale method. Natural and forced vibrations around the first and the second mode resonances demonstrating hardening and softening phenomena are studied. An impact of time delay linear and nonlinear control methods on vibration reduction for different angular speeds is presented.
Der schleichende Niedergang der Demokratie in Benin. Konsequenzen für die Förderung von Rechtsstaatlichkeit und gutem Regieren in der internationalen Zusammenarbeit mit Westafrika,"Benin, Afrikas ehemalige Modelldemokratie, steht vor einem Scheideweg. Nach einem friedlichen Systemwechsel und der anschließenden Herausbildung und Konsolidierung demokratischer Institutionen hat ein Abschwung begonnen, dessen Ende noch nicht abzusehen ist. 30 Jahre nach der demokratischen Erneuerung hat die ärmere Bevölkerung bisher keine demokratische Dividende erhalten, und checks and balances werden als Hindernisse für Reformen wahrgenommen. Hat das Modell ausgedient, wird sich ein weiterer Staat Afrikas für ein autokratisches System entscheiden?"
Atomically thin heterostructure with gap-mode plasmon for overcoming trade-off between photoresponsivity and response time,"Two-dimensional (2D) materials have recently provided a new perspective on optoelectronics because of their unique layered structure and excellent physical properties. However, their potential use as optoelectric devices has been limited by the trade-off between photoresponsivity and response time. Here, based on a vertically stacked atomically thin p-n junction, we propose a gap-mode plasmon structure that simultaneously enables enhanced responsivity and rapid photodetection. The atomically thin 2D materials act as a spacer for enhancing the gap-mode plasmons, and their short transit length in the vertical direction allows fast photocarrier transport. We demonstrate a high responsivity of up to 8.67 A/W with a high operation speed that exceeds 35 MHz under a 30 nW laser power. Spectral photocurrent, absorption, and a numerical simulation are used to verify the effectiveness of the gap-mode plasmons in the device. We believe that the design strategy proposed in this study can pave the way for a platform to overcome the trade-off between responsivity and response time."
A glutathione-triggered precision explosive system for improving tumor chemosensitivity,"Stimuli-responsive delivery systems hold promise in cancer treatments. However, their application potential has been limited due to undesirable drug leaking during blood circulation and inefficient therapeutic efficacy in tumors, resulting in undesirable therapeutic outcomes. Herein, we have developed a novel redox-sensitive pegylated phospholipid, termed as DOPE-SS-PEG, which can form a glutathione (GSH)-triggered precision explosive system (GPS) for simultaneously improving circulation stability, tumor specificity, and chemosensitivity, leading to explosive anticancer effects. GPS is constructed of liposomal doxorubicin (DOX) functionalized with DOPE-SS-PEG and MnO2 nanoparticles, which can protect liposome structure in the presence of serum GSH (20 pM), whereas converts to cationic liposome in response to intracellular GSH (10 mM), thereby enhancing circulation stability, tumor specificity, endosomal escape, and cytoplasmic delivery. Importantly, GPS can not only generate oxygen to relieve hypoxia and consequently enhance chemosensitivity, but quench GSH antioxidability to elevate the accruement of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to an explosion of oxidative stress induced cell injury. Particularly, in vivo studies show that GPS selectively accumulates in tumor tissues, effectively inhibits tumor growth, exhibits minimal systemic adverse effects, and consequently prolongs the survival time of tumor-bearing mice. Therefore, GPS is a unique stimuli-responsive treatment with programmed and on-demand drug delivery, as well as explosive therapeutic efficacy, and provides an intelligent anticancer treatment."
Defect-rich titanium nitride nanoparticle with high microwave-acoustic conversion efficiency for thermoacoustic imaging-guided deep tumor therapy,"Pulse microwave excite thermoacoustic (TA) Shockwave to destroy tumor cells in situ. This has promising applications for precise tumor therapy in deep tissue. Nanoparticle (NP) with high microwave-acoustic conversion is the key to enhance the efficiency of therapy. In this study, we firstly developed defect-rich titanium nitride nanoparticles (TiN NPs) for pulse microwave excited thermoacoustic (MTA) therapy. Due to a large number of local structural defects and charge carriers, TiN NPs exhibit excellent electromagnetic absorption through the dual mechanisms of dielectric loss and resistive loss. With pulsed microwave irradiation, it efficiently converts the microwave energy into shockwave via thermocavitation effect, achieving localized mechanical damage of mitochondria in the tumor cell and yielding a precise antitumor effect. In addition to the therapeutic function, the NP-mediated TA process also generates images that provide valuable information, including tumor size, shape, and location for treatment planning and monitoring. The experimental results showed that the TiN NPs could be efficiently accumulated in the tumor via intravenous infusion. With the deep tissue penetration characteristics of microwave, the proposed TiN-mediated MTA therapy effectively and precisely cures tumors in deep tissue without any detectable side effects. The results indicated that defect-rich TiN NPs are promising candidates for tumor therapy."
Electrochemical top-down synthesis of C-supported Pt nano-particles with controllable shape and size: Mechanistic insights and application,"In this work, we demonstrate the power of a simple top-down electrochemical erosion approach to obtain Pt nanoparticle with controlled shapes and sizes (in the range from ~ 2 to ~ 10 nm). Carbon supported nanoparticles with narrow size distributions have been synthesized by applying an alternating voltage to macroscopic bulk platinum structures, such as disks or wires. Without using any surfactants, the size and shape of the particles can be changed by adjusting simple parameters such as the applied potential, frequency and electrolyte composition. For instance, application of a sinusoidal AC voltage with lower frequencies results in cubic nanoparticles; whereas higher frequencies lead to predominantly spherical nanoparticles. On the other hand, the amplitude of the sinusoidal signal was found to affect the particle size; the lower the amplitude of the applied AC signal, the smaller the resulting particle size. Pt/C catalysts prepared by this approach showed 0.76 A/mg mass activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction which is ~ 2 times higher than the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.42 A/mg) from Tanaka. In addition to this, we discussed the mechanistic insights about the nanoparticle formation pathways."
Ultrathin nanoporous metal electrodes facilitate high proton conduction for low-Pt PEMFCs,"Design of catalyst layers (CLs) with high proton conductivity in membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) is an important issue for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Herein, an ultrathin catalyst layer was constructed based on Pt-decorated nanoporous gold (NPG-Pt) with sub-Debye-length thickness for proton transfer. In the absence of ionomer incorporation in the CLs, these integrated carbon-free electrodes can deliver maximum mass-specific power density of 198.21 and 25.91 kW·gPt−1 when serving individually as the anode and cathode, at a Pt loading of 5.6 and 22.0 µg·cm−2, respectively, comparable to the best reported nano-catalysts for PEMFCs. In-depth quantitative experimental measurements and finite-element analyses indicate that improved proton conduction plays a critical role in activation, ohmic and mass transfer polarizations."
Multilevel structured carbon film as cathode host for Li-S batteries with superhigh-areal-capacity,"The commercialization of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery could be accelerated by designing advanced sulfur cathode with high sulfur utilization and stable cycle life at a high sulfur loading. To allow the energy density of Li-S batteries comparable to that of commercial Li-ion batteries, the areal capacity of sulfur cathode should be above 4 mA·h·cm−2. In general, a high sulfur loading often causes rapid capacity fading by slowing electron/ion transport kinetics, catastrophic shuttle effect and even cracking the electrodes. To address this issue, herein, a multilevel structured carbon film is built by covering highly conductive CNTs and hollow carbon nanofiber together with carbon layer via chemical vapor deposition. The self-standing carbon film exhibits well-interweaved conductive network, hollow fibrous structure and abundant N, O co-doped active sites, which combine the merits of high electronic conductivity (1200·S·m−1), high porosity and polar characteristic in one host. Benefiting from this attractive multilevel structure, the obtained sulfur cathode based on the carbon film host shows an ultra-high areal capacity of 8.9 mA·h·cm−2 at 0.2 C with outstanding cyclability over 60 cycles. This work shed light on designing advanced sulfur host for Li-S batteries with high areal capacity and high cycle stability, and might make a contribution to the commercialization of Li-S batteries."
50-Year Anniversary of the Method of Determining the Parameters of Crystal Nucleation in Inorganic Glasses,"The results obtained by the “developing” method, namely, the method of determination of the crystal nucleating parameters in inorganic glasses, are given starting from the first appearance of the studies on the determination of the stationary nucleation rate in the glass having the stoichiometric composition of lithium disilicate to the latest research on the determination of the energy barrier at the formation of the critical size nucleus in a wide range of glasses in the lithium silicate system (23.4–46.00 mol % Li2O), in sodium silicate glasses with Na2O content of 42.0 and 44.0 mol %, in sodium-chromium silicate glass with the composition of 34.67Na2O · 2.74Cr2O3 · 62.68SiO2, in lithium alumosilicate glass with the composition of 35.6Li2O 3.6Al2O3 · 60.8SiO2, and in a series of sodium-zinc phosphate glasses (66.7ZnO ∙ 33.3P2O5; 51.4ZnO ∙ 16.3Na2O ∙ 32.3P2O5; 6.7Li2O ∙ 6.7Na2O ∙ 6.7K2O ∙ 45.0ZnO ∙ 2.0Al2O3 ∙ 33.0P2O5) under conditions of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation. Homogeneous nucleation is performed for glasses without photosensitive additives and in glasses containing the photosensitive additive of silver (gold) in the amount of 0.05 wt % over 100% without irradiation. Heterogeneous nucleation was carried out in the following cases: in the 26Li2O · 74SiO2 glass with shifted composition on active bubbles; in glasses with photosensitive additives of silver (gold) and X-ray irradiation; in glasses based on the stoichiometric composition of lithium disilicate; and in glasses of the sodium-zinc phosphate system containing different amounts of water. For both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, temperature dependences of the stationary rate of crystal nucleation Ist(T) have a domed shape with a maximum at a temperature Тmax which is close to the glass transition temperature (Tg) for all studied glasses."
"Separation of Pt(IV), Pd(II), and Rh(III) from Chloride Solutions by Multistage Extraction Using Nitrogen-Containing Extractants","This article demonstrates possible separation of Pd(II), Pt(IV), and Rh(III) ions from chloride solutions by solvent extraction in rotating coiled columns (RCC). The most common reagents used for extraction of platinum metals were selected as extractants: trioctylamine (TOA), methyltrialkylammonium chloride (MTAA), tributyl phosphate (TBP), and relatively new reagent—N,N,N',N'-tetra-n-octyldiglycolamide (TODGA). The completeness of extraction of platinum metals from individual and mixed hydrochloric acid and chloride solutions has been analyzed as a function of the essence and concentration of extractant, acidity of the analyzed solutions, and other factors. Optimum conditions of quantitative extraction of the metals from model hydrochloric acid and chloride solutions into the extractant phase have been determined, including subsequent selective separation at the re-extraction stage. A flowchart has been proposed for multistage extraction of Pd(II), Pt(IV), and Rh(III) using 0.05 M MTAA solution in toluene as a stationary phase in RCC. The flowchart includes extraction of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) ions from the solution (0.1 M HCl + 30 g/L Cl–) into the organic phase upon simultaneous separation of Rh(III) remaining in the aqueous phase and consecutive re-extraction of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) from the organic phase using 0.01 M solution of thiourea in 0.1 M HCl and 1 M solution of thiourea in 0.5 M HCl, respectively. The flowchart has been verified for separation of platinum metals in the production process of preset composition. The degree of metal extraction after processing by 0.05 M solution of MTAA in in toluene and consecutive re-extraction by solutions of thiourea is 99.5% for rhodium(III), 99.9% for palladium(II), and 97.4% for platinum(IV). The extracted aqueous phases of rhodium and platinum after output from the column did not contain impurities of other platinum metals. In the aqueous fraction of palladium, the platinum content was 0.5%."
Expansion of the Element Content Range through the Use of Self-Absorption Lines,"As a rule, the width of a spectral line in atomic emission spectral analysis with arc sources is much smaller than the hardware function of the spectral device. Thus, the spectral line contour is determined by the hardware function of the device and can be approximated, e.g., by the Voigt function. However, when reference samples with a wide range of element concentrations are analyzed, there is a frequent problem of self-absorption that causes one to change the analytical line, which is not always possible. It is proposed to modify the Voigt function by adding a factor that describes self-absorption, by analogy with the Bouguer–Lambert law. The possibility of using the proposed function is evaluated during the analysis of reference samples of rocks, ores, and sandstones in a Grand-Potok spectral system with a MAES analyzer and BLPP-2000 photodetector arrays. The use of the proposed approximating function has provided an increase in the working range of the calibration curves of Cu 327.3954 nm, Cu 324.7532 nm, Pb 287.3311 nm, Ni 305.0818 nm, and Mo 313.2594 nm by 1–3 orders of magnitude."
Standardization of P. ginseng and P. quinquefolius Root Extracts by HPLC-MS,"We develop a method on the basis of high-performance liquid phase chromatography–mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) for determination of triterpene glycosides in ginseng extracts. In contrast to procedures based on HPLC with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV), commonly used for extract standardization, superior selectivity afforded by the developed method enables identification and quantitation of 23 major and minor ginsenosides. For this, in addition to using MS for highly selective detection of adduct ions composed of ginsenoside molecules and sodium and fragment sapogenin ions, we identify the conditions for chromatographic separation on a sorbent with grafted pentafluorophenyl groups. The effects that the temperature and mobile phase composition have on the selectivity of glycoside determination receive special attention here. For some pairs of compounds (F4/Rg6 and Rk3/Rh4), complete separation of chromatographic peaks is not achieved; nevertheless, even if present simultaneously, they can be determined owing to their different m/z ratios. The linearity ranges, equations for calibration curves, and analytical parameters (i.e., the limit of detection and reproducibility) are established for all analytes. The developed method is tested for standardization of reference extracts of Asian (P. ginseng) and American (P. quinquefolius) ginseng roots. For some ginsenosides, the content claimed by the manufacturer is at variance with the actual values, while for others the determined concentrations proved to be close to the claimed values. Additionally, we succeed in expanding the range of determinable ginsenosides, which is important for medical application of such extracts."
Analysis of Nanomaterials Based on Indium and Zinc Oxides by High Resolution Atomic Absorption Spectrometry with the Use of Continuous Spectral Source and Electrothermal Atomization,"The properties of nanostructured materials based on zinc and indium oxides can be modified by adding alloying elements to obtain the necessary electrical or optical properties. For example, the specificity of the chemical properties of ZnO and In2O3 for the determination of toxic gases is achieved by immobilizing Au, Ag, etc., nanoparticles on their surface. Control of the material composition plays an important role in determining the dependence between the dopant content and functional properties of the materials. The study is aimed at the development of a methodical approach to the multielement determination of catalytic dopants (Ag, Au) and matrix elements in nanostructured tin and indium oxides using the method of high resolution atomic absorption spectrometry with electrothermal atomization (ETAAS) and continuous spectral source. The matrix of the synthesized nanostructured materials is the corresponding oxide with possible oxygen deficiency due to the temperature conditions of the synthesis (300–700°C), and the content of additives (Ag, Au) is varied from 1 to 3 wt %. Optimal conditions of pyrolysis and atomization for sequential multielement analysis by the ETAAS method are determined. The optimal pyrolysis temperatures for determining Ag and Au (for both oxides), In, and Zn are 1000, 1600, 1200, and 900°C, respectively. The optimal atomization temperatures for determining Ag and Au (for nanomaterial based on indium oxide), Au (for nanomaterial based on zinc oxide), In, and Zn are 1800, 2200, 2100, 2200, and 1500°C, respectively. The accuracy of analyte determination reaches 1–4% (rel.). The correctness of the results is confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The developed method provides control of the composition of synthesized nanostructured materials for their more efficient use in photovoltaics, as well as in production of chemical sensors for detection of harmful compounds like CO, NO2, and NH3."
Characteristics of Compact Spectrometers with Diffraction Gratings of Different Types,"Modern small-sized spectrometers are mainly designed by the Czerny–Turner scheme with a flat diffraction grating or, if the goal is to obtain the maximum aperture at the expense of resolution, by the scheme with a concave diffraction grating. In such spectrometers, the spectrum is registered by photodiode array. In this work, we provide an overview of characteristics of the compact spectrometers developed by our group. These spectrometers use caseless linear photodiode arrays for spectrum registration that eliminates the reflection of radiation from the cover glass of the photodiode array and reduces stray light. The tightness of the housing of spectrometers prolongs their service life. The parameters of the spectrometer modifications designed according to the Czerny–Turner scheme are given. The main advantage of the spectrometer of this type is the low stray light inside the device and the same spectral resolution throughout the spectral range. Aberrations limit the working aperture in the Czerny–Turner scheme to 1/6. The scheme with a flat field allows operation with a larger working aperture. Three modifications of the spectrometer have been developed according to this scheme; a description of their main parameters is given. The results of experimental comparison of the light gathering power and spectral resolution of spectrometers with different optical schemes, as well as the examples of their application, are presented. Devices designed according to the Czerny–Turner scheme are used in atomic emission and atomic absorption spectral analysis and in spectrophotometry for registration of absorption spectra of condensed media. The spectrometers with flat field are used for recording luminescence and Raman spectra of minerals. The developed compact spectrometers can work in a spectral range of 190–1100 nm with the width of the recorded spectral range from 70 to 1000 nm; the best spectral resolution is 0.1 nm, the stray light level is less than 0.05%, and the maximum measured optical density exceeds 3. Owing to a large working aperture of 1 : 2.1, the flat field spectrometers have an increased light gathering power."
"Specific features of amidoalkylation of 6-hydroxy-5-isopropyl-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydropyrimidin-4(1H)-one","During the synthesis of new structural analogs of isothiobarbamine, the amidoalkylation of 6-hydroxy-5-isopropyl-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydropyrimidin-4(1H)-one was found to give a mixture of mono-, di-, and trisubstituted products. Possible explanations for low regioselectivity of the reaction are given."
Synthesis of organic cyclic carbonates assisted by macroporous polystyrene-based catalyst,An easy-to-prepare recyclable catalyst of quaternary ammonium nature and based on commercially available and inexpensive macroporous polymeric sorbent Purolite A103 resin has been devised for the carbon dioxide addition to epoxides. The catalyst can be easily separated due to its 0.6–0.85 mm bead size and recycled at least seven times. The catalyst makes it possible to carry out the reaction under solvent-free conditions. It is insensitive to the steric and electronic effects of various epoxy substrates.
Synthesis and structure of regioisomeric amino enones containing 2-pyridyl and CF3 substituents,"Regioisomeric amino enones (Z)-4-amino-1,1,1-trifluoro-4-(2-pyridyl)but-3-en-2-one and (Z)-3-amino-4,4,4-trifluoro-1-(2-pyridyl)but-2-en-1-one were synthesized by the reaction of lithium (Z)-1,1,1-trifluoro-4-oxo-4-(2-pyridyl)but-2-en-2-olate with ammonium acetate in glacial AcOH. A comparative study of physicochemical properties and the crystal structures showed that the molecules of these new compounds are planar (except for two fluorine atoms) with an U-shaped configuration of the keto enamine moiety. A change in the position of the amino group with respect to the CF3 substituent leads to significant changes in the electron density distribution and the C-C bond lengths in the keto enamine moiety and also in the character of intermolecular hydrogen bonds responsible for the crystal packing mode of regioisomeric amino enones."
Alkylation of catechol with cyclohexene. Novel sterically hindered o-quinones and catechols,A synthetic procedure for the preparation of sterically hindered catechols and o-quinones by the reaction of catechol with cyclohexene was developed. Novel cyclohexyl substituted catechols displayed remarkable stability during redox transformations and could be used as redoxactive ligands.
Effect of Acid Treatment on Electrocatalytic Performance of PtNi Catalyst,"In this paper, we describe the synthesis of the AC-PtNi/G catalysts with graphene as the carrier, via the alcohol reduction and the sulfuric acid treatment. The prepared catalysts were microscopically characterized by X-ray diffractometry(XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS), scanning electron microscopy(SEM), electron spectroscopy(EDAX), and transmission electron micros-copy(TEM). We tested the electrochemical performance of the prepared catalysts using an electrochemical workstation and in situ infrared spectroscopy(FTIR). The results showed that the acid-treated AC-PtNi/G catalysts had a more uniform dispersion and with the increased of treatment time, the particle size of the catalyst became smaller. And the electrocatalytic performance of the AC-PtNi/G-48h catalyst treated with sulfuric acid for 48 h was significantly better than that of the untreated PtNi/G catalyst. Its electrochemically active surface area was 76.63 m2/g, and the peak current density value for catalytic oxidation of ethanol was 1218.83 A/g, which was 10 times that of ordinary commercial Pt/C catalyst. The steady-state current density value of 1100 s was 358.77 A/g, and it has excellent anti-CO toxicity performance. It was determined that a sulfuric acid treatment controlled catalyst particle size and increased the electrocatalytic activity of the catalytic oxidation of ethanol."
3D Tungsten Trioxide Nanosheets as Optoelectronic Materials for On-chip Quantification of Global Antioxidant Capacity,"The photoelectrochemical properties of semiconductors mainly depend on the size and shape of the corresponding nanoparticles. Herein, 3D WO3 nanosheets were controllably synthesized with the aid of polyethyleneimine, which presents enhanced photocurrent responses. Based on this excellent photoelectrochemical property, a photoelectrochemical chip was prepared by lithography technology for the smart monitoring of the antioxidant capacity(AC) in red wine and exhibits a series of advantages including rapid response time, high sensitivity, and long-lasting stability. The mechanism of the present photoelectrochemical sensing was explored and shows a single electron transfer reaction. Furthermore, only 200 µL of samples are required for one testing, which demonstrates that the present photoelectrochemical chip can be potentially integrated with a portable commercial device(such as a mobile phone) for further research and development of food and drug supervision."
"An accurate, high-speed, portable bifunctional electrical detector for COVID-19","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread and caused a severe global pandemic. Because no specific drugs are available for COVID-19 and few vaccines are available for SARS-CoV-2, accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 has been the most crucial measure to control this pandemic. Here, we developed a portable bifunctional electrical detector based on graphene fieldeffect transistors for SARS-CoV-2 through either nucleic acid hybridization or antigen-antibody protein interaction, with ultra-low limits of detection of ~0.1 and ~1 fg mL−1 in phosphate buffer saline, respectively. We validated our method by assessment of RNA extracts from the oropharyngeal swabs of ten COVID-19 patients and eight healthy subjects, and the IgM/IgG antibodies from serum specimens of six COVID-19 patients and three healthy subjects. Here we show that the diagnostic results are in excellent agreement with the findings of polymerase chain reaction-based optical methods; they also exhibit rapid detection speed (~10 min for nucleic acid detection and ~5 min for immunoassay). Therefore, our assay provides an efficient, accurate tool for high-throughput point-of-care testing."
Comparative Evaluation of Pellet Cushioning Agents by Various Imaging Techniques and Dissolution Studies,"Most of the commercially available pharmaceutical products for oral administration route are marketed in the tablet dosage forms. However, compression of multiparticulate systems is a challenge for the pharmaceutical research and industry, especially if the individual unit is a coated particle, as the release of the active ingredient depends on the integrity of the coating. In the present study, polymer-coated pellets tableted with different types of excipients (powder, granules, pellets) then were investigated by various tablet-destructive (microscopic) and tablet non-destructive (microfocus X-ray; microCT) imaging methods. The information obtained from the independent evaluation of the in vitro drug release profiles model is confirmed by the results obtained by image analysis, regardless of whether X-ray or stereomicroscopic images of the coated, tableted pellets were used for image analysis. The results of this study show that the novel easy-to-use, fast, and non-destructive MFX method is a good alternative to the already used microscopic image analysis methods regarding the characterization of particulates, compressed into tablets."
"A novel approach of methane dehydroaromatization using group VIB metals (Cr, Mo, W) supported on sulfated zirconia","Methane dehydroaromatization (MDHA) is a direct activation approach to covert methane to value-added chemicals in a single step. This requires no intermediate step, making it a commercially economic approach. Mo supported on HZSM-5/MCM-22 is a well-studied catalyst for this reaction, where Mo sites are responsible for activating methane to C2Hy dimers, which can oligomerize on HZSM-5 Bronsted acid sites to produce aromatics. Challenges for these bifunctional catalysts involve rapid coking and low product yield. In this study, a novel catalytic approach is introduced using group VIB metals (Cr, Mo, W) supported on sulfated zirconia (SZ) solid acid. It is believed that the Bronsted acidity of SZ should help to convert the dimers generated from metal sites to ethylene and aromatics like benzene."
Analysis of thermodynamic conditions to grow GaAsP epitaxial layers by LPE on GaAs and GaP substrates,"In this work we have analysed the conditions to grow epitaxial layers by Liquid Phase Epitaxy (LPE) from ternary Ga-As-P liquid phases on GaAs and GaP under initial conditions that are far away of the thermodynamic equilibrium. First, it is shown that the liquid-solid (L-S) interfaces are “stable” for all compositions of the liquid phases exclusively in contact with the GaP substrates. At the same time the elastic energy generated in mismatched GaAsyP1-y layers induces a reduction in the As content of the layer. Then, it should be expected that highly lattice mismatched epitaxial layers could be grown with small elastic energy, so that beyond certain stress the layers are initially non-planar having spatially separated but simultaneous local centres of nucleation and dissolution pits. These processes should cause a change on the composition of the liquid phase and, as consequence, the formation of the epitaxial islands with a composition gradient along its thickness. Our estimations show that in the case of contact of a Ga-As liquid phase with a GaP substrate the P content in the epitaxial islands increases with its thickness. The thermodynamic analysis was done with the CALPHAD method using SGTE data."
From a cholesteric non-aqueous cellulose nanocrystal suspension to a highly ordered film,"A highly ordered cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) film was processed and characterized from a non-aqueous suspension. As a first step, by drawing upon the negative magnetic anisotropy of CNCs, a global order of the nanocrystals is achieved by magnetic field-assisted manipulation of a cholesteric suspension in n-methylformamide (NMF), and then the order is subsequently preserved into a solid-state film. We study the differences between the structures of the 4 T-dried film and the control film dried in the absence of magnetic field. Additionally, we compare the NMF-dried films to those dried from aqueous suspensions with and without magnetic field. Optical microscopy, cross-sectional imaging analysis, and sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy show that the CNC-NMF film dried under magnetic field exhibited a highly ordered layered structure throughout the film, comparable to that observed when films were produced from aqueous suspensions. Extending the potential of the CNC alignment to non-aqueous systems will enable a broad spectrum of applications for CNC-based polymer composites."
Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles with phytosterols and betalain pigments as reducing agents present in cactus Myrtillocactus geometrizans.,"In the current work, we compared the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using plant extracts, a promising methodology against the use of chemical reducers, such as oleic acid and oleylamine. The advantages of green synthesis are one-step method, economic and ecological while the advantages of classic synthesis methods are high nanoparticle performance, homogeneity in size and smaller average sizes. With this work we want to demonstrate that plant extracts with specific mixtures of chemical compounds can obtain smaller average sizes with greater homogeneity in nanoparticles compared to the use of classical synthesis. Myrtillocactus geometrizans was used as a polar plant extract, which was selected by the chemical components contained in the extract. Phytosterols, oleic acid and betalains contained in Myrtillocactus geometrizans are biomolecules responsible for the reduction and stability of AgNP below 5 nm. TEM analysis of the green synthesis of nanoparticles revealed the formation of spherical particles with an average diameter of 5 nm and with preferential crystallographic directions of the silver plane [111]."
Seed-mediated synthesis and PEG coating of gold nanoparticles for controlling morphology and sizes,"A significant area of research is biomedical applications of nanoparticles which involves efforts to control the physicochemical properties through simple and scalable processes. Gold nanoparticles have received considerable attention due to their unique properties that they exhibit based on their morphology. Gold nanospheres (AuNSs) and nanorods (AuNRs) were prepared with a seed-mediated method followed of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coating. The seeds were prepared with 0.1 M cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB), 0.005 M chloroauric acid (HAuCl4), and 0.01 M sodium borohydride (NaBH4) solution. Gold nanoparticles with spherical morphology was achieved by growth by aggregation at room temperature, while to achieve the rod morphology 0.1 M silver nitrate (AgNO3) and 0.1 M ascorbic acid solution were added. The gold nanoparticles obtained by the seed-mediated synthesis have spherical or rod shapes, depending on the experimental conditions, and a uniform particle size. Surface functionalization was developed using polyethylene glycol. Morphology, and size distribution of AuNPs were evaluated by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy. The average size of AuNSs, and AuNRs was 7.85nm and 7.96 x 31.47nm respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry was performed to corroborate the presence of PEG in the AuNPs surface. Additionally, suspensions of AuNSs and AuNRs were evaluated by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Gold nanoparticles were stored for several days at room temperature and it was observed that the colloidal stability increased once gold nanoparticles were coated with PEG due to the shield formed in the surface of the NPs and the increase in size which were 9.65±1.90 nm of diameter for AuNSs and for AuNRs were 29.03±5.88 and 8.39±1.02 nm for length and transverse axis, respectively."
Effect of temperature during the synthesis process of CdSe nanoparticles using the colloidal technique,"In this work, the first results of the effects of temperature during the production of Se2- ions and the effect during the interaction of Cd2+ and Se2- ions in the synthesis process of CdSe nanoparticles are presented. The synthesis of CdSe was carried out by the colloidal technique, in the first one we used a temperature of 63 °C to produce Se2- ions and in the second one an interaction temperature of 49 °C. The samples were characterized using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM). From the SEM micrographs it was possible to identify the thorns formation and irregular islands. STM micrographs reveal elliptical shapes with a regular electron cloud profile."
Reflections on the past and future of urban conservation in Iran,"The material authenticity of cultural heritage has been questioned by societies in which the modern paradigm of conservation has not developed from within the native culture. This paper examines the philosophical and practical traditions in Iran regarding the materiality and authenticity of past structures. By reviewing the emergence of the Western conservation paradigm in Iran, this paper highlights two key factors: the rapidness of this paradigm shift and the remarkable contradiction between the new and old paradigms. By borrowing the Deleuzo-Guattarian concept of a ‘body without organs’ (BwO), this paper problematises the rapidness and radicality of the paradigm shift in Iran. It suggests exploring the under-investigated possibilities between the pre-modern and modern paradigms to address the gap between native circumstances and Western standards."
"Effects of the internal structures of monolith ceramic substrates on thermal and hydraulic properties: additive manufacturing, numerical modelling and experimental testing","Rigorous emission regulations call for more efficient passive control catalysts for exhaust gas aftertreatment without affecting the internal combustion process and CO2 emissions. Although the state-of-art ceramic honeycomb substrate designs provide high surface area and a degree of flexibility for heat and mass transfer adaptations, additional emission reduction benefits can be achieved when more flexible designs to provide effective thermal management are introduced. The conventional cordierite honeycomb substrates are manufactured by extrusion; therefore, only substrates with straight channels can be fabricated. This study aims to highlight any design limitations of conventional substrates by employing additive manufacturing as the main method of manufacturing diamond lattice structures using DLP (digital light processing) technology. Both conventional substrates and diamond lattice structures are studied numerically and experimentally for flow through resistance and temperature distribution. Numerical predictions and experimental results showed good agreement. The results show the increase of the axial temperature distribution for diamond lattice structures and a significant decrease of the pressure drop (38–45%) in comparison with the benchmark honeycomb with similar surface area."
The influence of soak temperature and forging lubricant on surface properties of steel forgings,"A small series of ring compression tests were performed on BS970:708M40 alloy steel. The samples were tested using a 2-factor temperature variable, and a 4-factor lubricant variable, as the design parameters. Two differing soak temperatures were used, namely 1030 °C and 1300 °C respectively. The lubricants applied at the billet to tooling interface were synthetic water–based, graphite water–based, graphite and molybdenum disulphide viscous grease, and finally, unlubricated samples were tested. The ring compression tests were performed using a traditional drop forging hammer and induction heating to minimise any unintentional process variability. The impact that the two varying process parameters have upon the compression sample was then assessed by measuring each sample’s surface hardness and surface roughness prior to and post forging with fully calibrated equipment. It was demonstrated that the higher soak temperature of 1300 °C yielded a lower surface hardness value and higher surface roughness than the lower soak temperature, 1030 °C. The two water-based lubricants offered negligible change in results compared with the unlubricated forging, strongly suggesting that the lubricants were evaporated off the surface prior to forging. However, the results from the graphite–molybdenum disulphate grease do indicate in particular higher surface roughness than other lubricants, and a non-symmetric distortion pattern."
Safety and Effectiveness of Rivaroxaban in Combination with Various Antiarrhythmic Drugs in Patients with Non-Permanent Atrial Fibrillation,"Rivaroxaban reduces the risk of thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, who often also receive antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) to maintain sinus rhythm. Current guidelines contraindicate concomitant use of rivaroxaban with the popular AAD dronedarone, despite little data demonstrating interactions with AADs. This study investigates the outcomes of concomitant rivaroxaban and AAD drug use in a real-world cohort."
[11C]MODAG-001—towards a PET tracer targeting α-synuclein aggregates,"Deposition of misfolded alpha-synuclein (αSYN) aggregates in the human brain is one of the major hallmarks of synucleinopathies. However, a target-specific tracer to detect pathological aggregates of αSYN remains lacking. Here, we report the development of a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer based on anle138b, a compound shown to have therapeutic activity in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases."
Genome-wide detection of short tandem repeat expansions by long-read sequencing,"Short tandem repeat (STR), or “microsatellite”, is a tract of DNA in which a specific motif (typically < 10 base pairs) is repeated multiple times. STRs are abundant throughout the human genome, and specific repeat expansions may be associated with human diseases. Long-read sequencing coupled with bioinformatics tools enables the estimation of repeat counts for STRs. However, with the exception of a few well-known disease-relevant STRs, normal ranges of repeat counts for most STRs in human populations are not well known, preventing the prioritization of STRs that may be associated with human diseases."
LDscaff: LD-based scaffolding of de novo genome assemblies,"Genome assembly is fundamental for de novo genome analysis. Hybrid assembly, utilizing various sequencing technologies increases both contiguity and accuracy. While such approaches require extra costly sequencing efforts, the information provided millions of existed whole-genome sequencing data have not been fully utilized to resolve the task of scaffolding. Genetic recombination patterns in population data indicate non-random association among alleles at different loci, can provide physical distance signals to guide scaffolding."
In silico ranking of phenolics for therapeutic effectiveness on cancer stem cells,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have features such as the ability to self-renew, differentiate into defined progenies and initiate the tumor growth. Treatments of cancer include drugs, chemotherapy and radiotherapy or a combination. However, treatment of cancer by various therapeutic strategies often fail. One possible reason is that the nature of CSCs, which has stem-like properties, make it more dynamic and complex and may cause the therapeutic resistance. Another limitation is the side effects associated with the treatment of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. To explore better or alternative treatment options the current study aims to investigate the natural drug-like molecules that can be used as CSC-targeted therapy. Among various natural products, anticancer potential of phenolics is well established. We collected the 21 phytochemicals from phenolic group and their interacting CSC genes from the publicly available databases. Then a bipartite graph is constructed from the collected CSC genes along with their interacting phytochemicals from phenolic group as other. The bipartite graph is then transformed into weighted bipartite graph by considering the interaction strength between the phenolics and the CSC genes. The CSC genes are also weighted by two scores, namely, DSI (Disease Specificity Index) and DPI (Disease Pleiotropy Index). For each gene, its DSI score reflects the specific relationship with the disease and DPI score reflects the association with multiple diseases. Finally, a ranking technique is developed based on PageRank (PR) algorithm for ranking the phenolics."
The shape of gene expression distributions matter: how incorporating distribution shape improves the interpretation of cancer transcriptomic data,"In genomics, we often assume that continuous data, such as gene expression, follow a specific kind of distribution. However we rarely stop to question the validity of this assumption, or consider how broadly applicable it may be to all genes that are in the transcriptome. Our study investigated the prevalence of a range of gene expression distributions in three different tumor types from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)."
Detection of two pathogenic marine ciliates Ancistrum haliotis and A. crassum (Ciliophora: Scuticociliatia) by fluorescence in situ hybridization,"The scuticociliatid ciliates Ancistrum haliotis and A. crassum are parasites that may cause high mortality in the cultured abalone Haliotis spp. and the bivalve Ruditapes philippinarum. Traditional identification with silver staining methods is hampered by their morphological similarities to closely related species and the complicated procedures of morphological analysis. We designed two SSU rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes labeled with a fluorochrome, and optimized the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) protocols for identification of A. halioti and A. crassum, respectively. The assays resulted in a clear identification by strong fluorescence signals from the oligonucleotide probes. The method can be used for quick and accurate quantitative analysis of A. haliotis and A. crassum infections on host molluscs."
Inverse determination of multiple heat sources’ release history in indoor environments,"The heat source of an air-conditioned room has an important effect on the indoor environment. The release rates of heat sources are related to the comfort of the designed thermal environment, so they must be determined. Traditional design methods rely on iterative guess-and-correct, which consumes resources and time and cannot meet the needs of modern design. This study aims to establish an inverse model of Tikhonov regularization and least square optimization by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), so that researchers can accurately determine the time release rate of multiple heat sources with known parameters. The temporal release rates can then be solved based on the inverse matrix operation with the temperature series at different discrete times. The study speeds up the solving process and expresses the temperature as the convolution integral between the temperature response of the thermal response factor and the arbitrary release rate. The results show that applying the above method to the quantization of the temporal release rates of three heat sources in a three-dimensional cavity can correctly determine the temporal release rates of multiple heat sources. The errors between the inversely determined release rates and the actual release rates are less than 40%."
Identification of cross-section loads for steel beam with simple cross-sectional shape based on measured strain and its application,"A new strain gauge layout method on the structural surface is proposed to identify the six-component loads in cross-section. Numerical simulation of a cantilever beam and an industrial case study, i.e., identification of hinge joint loads on excavator working device under actual excavating condition, are presented to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed method for industrial scale problems. The hinge joint loads deduced from the stick’s six-component cross-section loads identified by the new method were compared with the values calculated by traditional method, and the recurrence degree of stress and fatigue cumulative damage of the stick’s fatigue critical points were also compared. The maximum deviation between the actual damage of each selected measuring point and the damage caused by the identified hinge joint loads was only 1.69 %. The field test results showed that the new method could be conveniently applied with high identification accuracy for complicated actual loads."
Nonlinear dynamic analysis of an external gear system with meshing beyond pitch point,"A two-dimensional non-linear dynamics model of a gear with meshing beyond pitch point with six degrees has been established, considering time-varying meshing stiffness, time-varying bearing stiffness, time-varying friction, backlash and bearing clearance. Time-varying meshing stiffness is computed by using material mechanics method. The friction coefficient of Coulomb model and the friction coefficient of EHL theory are analyzed and compared in dynamic response. The global bifurcation characteristics caused by input speed, backlash, bearing clearance and damping are investigated. The maximum Lyapunov exponent which leads to chaos characters effect of changing parameters is analyzed. The verification experiment is carried out on the CL-100 test rig. Meshing frequency has main impact on vibration acceleration of ordinary spur gear and double meshing frequency has main impact on vibration acceleration of gear with meshing beyond pitch point. The results show that the gear with meshing beyond is better than ordinary spur gear whether in bifurcation characteristics or in vibration acceleration response."
Development of measurement technique of explosive flame using an optical measurement method,"It is essential in weapons systems to understand how much explosive power is applied according to various chemicals and methods of the explosion. In particular, to measure dynamic thermal phenomena and analyze thermal properties under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. Although many researchers have used thermocouples to measure the temperature during an explosion, this method has an error in the temperature measurement as the radiant heat flux increases. Another measurement method is needed to solve this problem. During an explosion in a shock tube, the temperature change was measured with a thermocouple and a pressure sensor. To solve the limitations of the thermocouple’s measurement responsiveness in temperature measurement was compared with the TDLD (tunable diode laser detection) method. In the case of the TDLD method, the time to reach the peak was measured an average 0.0207 sec faster than the thermocouple. Moreover, the peak average temperature was 15.8 °C higher than that of the thermocouple."
Reliability optimization design of hydraulic system considering oil contamination,"This paper presents a reliability optimization design method for a hydraulic system that considers oil contamination. The proposed method applies the quantitative relationship between oil contamination and system reliability to the reliability design of a hydraulic system, while considering the performance, layout, and other design factors. A global reliability model of the hydraulic system is constructed based on the oil contamination control model. Further studies aiming at an optimization design model of the hydraulic system is established where the cost is the objective function, reliability index, size and structure range, performance requirements are constraints, structure size and oil change period are design variables. For illustration, a case study on the reliability optimization design of the oil supply point branch of the static pressure bracket of a certain type of heavy CNC horizontal lathe is considered."
Mathematical model and meshing analysis of internal meshing gear transmission with curve element,"A new internal meshing gear transmission with curve element is put forward in this paper. The mathematical principle of tooth profile generation is described based on conjugate curves theory. For a given spatial curve, the meshing equation and its conjugated spatial curve under the motion law were derived. Considering the equidistant kinematic method, general internal tooth profiles models were established by the conjugate-curve pair. Numerical example of the internal gear pair was developed according to gear parameters and gear solid models were established by MATLAB and UG software. Motion simulation result shows that the gear pair satisfies point contact condition and design requirements. Meshing analysis of tooth profiles using FEA method was carried out. Stress analysis results of tooth profiles with single point contact and two points contact were, respectively, obtained. The conclusions lay the foundation for multi-point contact generation and tooth profile design. Also, further studies on transmission characteristics and manufacturing technology of the new gear drive will be carried out."
Nonlinear impact of traction rod on the dynamics of a high-speed rail vehicle carbody,"This paper focuses on the bogie-carbody nonlinear dynamic interaction of a Shinkansen high-speed rail vehicle. The Euler-Bernoulli beam model is used to simulate vertical elastic vibrations of the carbody. As a novelty, the traction rod that connects the bogie frame and the carbody is considered a nonlinear element. The equivalent linearization method is used to analyze the nonlinear vehicle system in the frequency domain. The analytical spectrum solution was compared with the measured data from the running test and the numerical solution in the time domain. When the dynamic interaction due to the carbody’s flexibility is considered as nonlinear rather than linear, the maximum amplitude of the bounce acceleration relevant to the first bending mode increases by 38.2 percent at a travel speed of 300 km/h. Ride comfort improvement can be achieved with the inclusion of the nonlinear interaction. It is also feasible to manipulate the vehicle’s ride comfort by altering its bogie-base."
Performance analysis of the two-stage axial compressor with 90-degree bend inlet conditions,"The 90-degree bend is one of the basic connection components applied in industrial flowing systems. This bend influences the aerodynamic performance of the downstream connecting equipment. In this study, the performance of a two-stage axial compressor with a 90-degree bend inlet was numerically and experimentally analyzed under low rotating speed. The testing results show that the outflow of the bend was numerically non-uniform in the circumferential and radial directions. To analyze the performance influence of the bend on the downstream compressor, a full passage compressor model with and without the inlet bend was simulated. The size of the distortion region gradually spread to the entire cascade, and the intensity of the distortion obviously dropped after the first stage as the compressor ran with the bend. The deterioration of the compressor performance, especially in the first stage, was verified numerically and experimentally. The total pressure coefficient and isentropic efficiency decreased by 2.6 % and 1.13 %, respectively. To save simulation cost, a model with a downstream single blade passage and cylindrical inlet was proposed, and the distorted flow was set as the inlet boundary condition. In addition, the unsteady numerical simulation was performed with the rotating inlet distortion region. Compared with the full blade passage model, the unsteady single blade passage model obtained the downstream spread characteristic of the distortion and performance deterioration. The latter can therefore be suggested as a compromised approach for obtaining the propagation characteristics of the inlet distortion with acceptable accuracy and low computational cost."
Identification of Na+-Pumping Cytochrome Oxidase in the Membranes of Extremely Alkaliphilic Thioalkalivibrio Bacteria,"For the first time, the functioning of the oxygen reductase Na+-pump (Na+-pumping cytochrome c oxidase of the cbb3-type) was demonstrated by examining the respiratory chain of the extremely alkaliphilic bacterium Thioalkalivibrio versutus [Muntyan, M. S., et al. (2015) Cytochrome cbb3 of Thioalkalivibrio is a Na+-pumping cytochrome oxidase, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 112, 7695-7700], a product of the ccoNOQP operon. In this study, we detected and identified this enzyme using rabbit polyclonal antibody against the predicted C-terminal amino acid sequence of its catalytic subunit. We found that this cbb3-type oxidase is synthesized in bacterial cells, where it is located in the membranes. The 48-kDa oxidase subunit (CcoN) is catalytic, while subunits CcoO and CcoP with molecular masses of 29 and 34 kDa, respectively, are cytochromes c. The theoretical pI values of the CcoN, CcoO, and CcoP subunits were determined. It was shown that parts of the CcoO and CcoP subunits exposed to the aqueous phase on the cytoplasmic membrane P-side are enriched with negatively charged amino acid residues, in contrast to the parts of the integral subunit CcoN adjacent to the aqueous phase. Thus, the Na+-pumping cytochrome c oxidase of T. versutus, both in function and in structure, demonstrates adaptation to extremely alkaline conditions."
"Linking 7-Nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) to Triphenylphosphonium Yields Mitochondria-Targeted Protonophore and Antibacterial Agent","Appending lipophilic cations to small molecules has been widely used to produce mitochondria-targeted compounds with specific activities. In this work, we obtained a series of derivatives of the well-known fluorescent dye 7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD). According to the previous data [Denisov et al. (2014) Bioelectrochemistry, 98, 30-38], alkyl derivatives of NBD can uncouple isolated mitochondria at concentration of tens of micromoles despite a high pKa value (~11) of the dissociating group. Here, a number of triphenylphosphonium (TPP) derivatives linked to NBD via hydrocarbon spacers of varying length (C5, C8, C10, and C12) were synthesized (mitoNBD analogues), which accumulated in the mitochondria in an energy-dependent manner. NBD-C10-TPP (C10-mitoNBD) acted as a protonophore in artificial lipid membranes (liposomes) and uncoupled isolated mitochondria at micromolar concentrations, while the derivative with a shorter linker (NBD-C5-TPP, or C5-mitoNBD) exhibited no such activities. In accordance with this data, C10-mitoNBD was significantly more efficient than C5-mitoNBD in suppressing the growth of Bacillus subtilis. C10-mitoNBD and C12-mitoNBD demonstrated the highest antibacterial activity among the investigated analogues. C10-mitoNBD also exhibited the neuroprotective effect in the rat model of traumatic brain injury."
Autophagy as a Target for the Retinoprotective Effects of the Mitochondria-Targeted Antioxidant SkQ1,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease, a main cause of vision loss in elderly people. The pathogenesis of dry AMD, the most common form of AMD (~ 80% cases), involves degenerative changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which are closely associated with the age-associated impairments in autophagy. Reversion of these degenerative changes is considered as a promising approach for the treatment of this incurable disease. The purpose of our study was to assess the relationship between previously identified retinoprotective effects of the mitochondrial antioxidant plastoquinonyl-decyl-triphenylphosphonium (SkQ1) and its influence on the autophagy process in senescence-accelerated OXYS rats characterized by the development of AMD-like retinopathy (Wistar rats were used as a control). The treatment with SkQ1 (250 nmol/kg body weight) during the period of active disease progression (from 12 to 18 months of age) completely prevented progression of clinical manifestations of retinopathy in the OXYS rats, suppressed atrophic changes in the RPE cells and activated autophagy in the retina, which was evidenced by a significant decrease in the content of the multifunctional adapter protein p62/Sqstm1 and increase in the level of the Beclin1 gene mRNA. In general, the results obtained earlier and in the present study have shown that SkQ1 is a promising agent for prevention and suppression of AMD."
The Effect of Foliar Fertilization with Micronutrients on the Incidence and Severity of Leaf and Stem-base Diseases in Winter Triticale (x Triticosecale Witmm.) and Winter Rye (Secale cereale L.),"Winter triticale (Triticale) cv. Dinaro and winter rye (Secale cereale L.) cv. Dańkowskie Diament were grown in 2012 and 2013 in a field-plot experiment in Tomaszkowo near Olsztyn (NE Poland). The experiment consisted of 7 treatments: absolute control (without fertilizers or the growth stimulator), control-NPK fertilizer, NPK fertilizer + micronutrients applied alone or in combination (4 treatments), NPK fertilizer + Nano-Gro growth stimulator. The severity of disease symptoms on the leaves and stem-bases of triticale and rye was evaluated throughout the growing season. Symptoms of powdery mildew on the leaves of winter triticale and winter rye were noted only in the growing season of 2013, and disease severity remained at a low level. In the growing season of 2012, weather conditions were conducive to the spread of Septoria tritici blotch (STB) and brown rust on triticale (the highest values of infection index were 41.6 and 23.8%, respectively), and scald and brown rust on rye (29.0 and 38.1%, respectively). Foliar application of micronutrients influenced the rates of infections caused by Zymoseptoria tritici and Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici on triticale leaves. Symptoms of eyespot and Fusarium foot and root rot were noted on the stem-bases of both cereal species, whereas symptoms of take-all disease and sharp eyespot were observed sporadically. Significant differences were found between treatments in the severity of infections caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis on the stem-bases of triticale, and by Tapesia spp. and Rhizoctonia spp. on the stem-bases of rye."
Attenuation characteristics of ground penetrating radar electromagnetic wave in aeration zone,"Amplitude, an important electromagnetic wave attribute, is considered as a useful parameter to describe the energy attenuation of electromagnetic wave. In this study, SIR-3000 Radar Equipment was employed to investigate the amplitude of electromagnetic wave in medium sandstone with different water content and depth. Results suggest that, with same water content, the decreasing of electromagnetic wave energy with increasing depth can be described by maximum peak amplitude, while, the decreasing of electromagnetic wave energy with increasing water content at certain depth can be described by average amplitude. In addition, energy of electromagnetic wave is negatively correlated to the dielectric constant because of the positive correlation between water content and dielectric constant. This study can provide significant information to the water measurement in aeration zone."
High-Temperature Oxidation of NiAlCr–Ca and NiAlCr–Sr Alloys in Air,"In this study, interrupted oxidation behavior of synthetic NiAlCr–Ca (Ca = 0.3, 1.4, 2 at.%) and NiAlCr–Sr (Sr = 0.4 at.%) alloys in the air at 1027 °C for 192 h was investigated. Parabolic rate constants (kp) showed that the Sr-containing alloy exhibited the best oxidation resistance among the alloys investigated in this study. The oxide scale formed on the Sr-containing alloy was composed of α-Al2O3 phase with Sr-rich nodules. Increasing the Ca concentration in the alloys was found to reduce the oxidation resistance due to the formation of non-protective Ca-rich complex oxides and consumption of α-Al2O3 scale by the reaction between Al2O3 and CaO. The Ca-rich complex oxides were initially formed on the Ca-rich interdendritic region and grew with time. Very little scale spallation was observed for the Sr-containing alloy, while it was notable for 0.3 at.% Ca-containing alloy. Spallation was attributed to the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch arisen from the formation of CaAl4O7 phase, a compound with a very low CTE."
What Do Migrants Know About Their Childcare Rights? A First Exploration in West Germany,"Although an increasing number of studies emphasise migrants’ lack of knowledge about their childcare rights as a crucial barrier to their childcare usage, almost none examines the conditions under which migrant families acquire this knowledge. This study contributes to the literature by exploring potential individual factors determining migrant families’ knowledge about their childcare rights in Germany. I use unique data collected through the project Migrants’ Welfare State Attitudes (MIFARE), in which nine different migrant groups in Germany were surveyed about their relation to the welfare state, including childcare. Analysing a total sample of 623 migrants living with children in their household and by using logistic regression analyses, I find that human and social capital play significant roles in explaining migrants’ knowledge about their childcare rights. Migrants who speak the host language sufficiently are more likely to know about their childcare rights; however, it does not matter whether migrants are lower or higher educated. Moreover, I observe that migrants benefit from their co-ethnic relations only if childcare usage is high among their ethnic group. Based on these results, policy recommendations are discussed in order to increase migrants’ knowledge about their childcare rights in Germany."
Calcium mediated functional interplay between myocardial cells upon laser-induced single-cell injury: an in vitro study of cardiac cell death signaling mechanisms,"The electromechanical function of myocardial tissue depends on the intercellular communication between cardiomyocytes (CMs) as well as their crosstalk with other cell types. Cell injury, and subsequent death trigger inflammation as in myocardial infarction (MI) resulting in myocardial remodeling. Although mechanisms underlying myocardial cell death have been studied so far, the signaling events following single cell death and spontaneous response of connected cells in the myocardial tissue is still barely understood."
Ambulante Jugendhilfe: Ein systematisches Literatur-Review zur Arbeits- und Gesundheitssituation,"Das vielfältige Tätigkeitsfeld der Jugendhilfe im ambulanten Bereich ist von diversen – unter anderem psychischen – Einflussfaktoren geprägt, die sich auf die Gesundheit der pädagogischen Fachkräfte auswirken können."
Crisis and Intergovernmental Retrenchment in the European Union? Framing the EU’s Answer to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has placed severe pressure on the EU’s capacity to provide a timely and coordinated response capable of curbing the pandemic’s disastrous economic and social effects on EU member states. In this situation, the supranational institutions and their models of action are evidently under pressure, seeming incapable of leading the EU out of the stormy waters of the present crisis. The article frames the first months of management of the COVID-19 crisis at EU level as characterised by the limited increase in the level of steering capacity by supranational institutions, due to the reaffirmed centrality of the intergovernmental option. To explain this situation, the article considers the absence of the institutional capacity/legitimacy to extract resources from society(ies), and the subsequent impossibility of guaranteeing an effective and autonomous process of political (re)distribution, the key factors accounting for the weakness of vertical political integration in the response to the COVID-19 challenge. This explains why during the COVID-19 crisis as well, the pattern followed by the EU is rather similar to past patterns, thus confirming that this has fed retrenchment aimed at the enforcement of the intergovernmental model and the defence of the most sensitive core state powers against inference from supranational EU institutions."
Outdoor air pollution from industrial chemicals causing new onset of asthma or COPD: a systematic review protocol,"Until today, industrial sources contribute to the multifaceted contamination of environmental air. Exposure to air pollutants has the potential to initiate and promote asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). At global scale, both entities cause the majority of about 4 million annual deaths by respiratory disease. However, we identified industrial contamination as a subgroup of air pollution that may be associated with this burden and is underinvestigated in research. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate associations between substances industrially released into environmental air and the occurrence of asthma and COPD in the human population. Here we present the protocol for our systematic review of the current evidence."
A novel reduced-dimensional dictionary grid screening strategy for SR-STAP,"The traditional space-time adaptive processing (STAP) methods require large training samples to estimate the clutter covariance matrix. Sparse recovery STAP (SR-STAP) can get a highly accurate estimation in the case of insufficient samples and it alleviates the above problem of conventional STAP methods, however, the price of SR-STAP is that it involves a huge computational load in optimization, especially when the input data size is very big. This paper proposed a novel SR-STAP dictionary construction method that can significantly improve computational efficiency. We introduce the noise grids as the supplement of the spectrum-aid methods and design a second grids screening method based on the prior spectrum information. After the process of the proposed method, the dimension of the space-time dictionary has a sharp decrease compared to the over-complete dictionary, moreover, the sparsity of variable can be maintained better than the common spectrum-aid methods. The numerical experiments verify that the proposed method not only can significantly reduce the optimization time to far smaller than the SR-STAP but also more robust than spectrum-aid methods even in the small input size."
Evaluating the Reliability of Predictions of First-Year Corrosion Losses of Structural Metals Calculated Using Dose-Response Functions for Territories with Different Categories of Atmospheric Corrosion Aggressiveness,"To predict \(K_{1}^{{{\text{pr}}}}\) values, the dose-response functions (DRFs) presented in the ISO 9223:2012(E) standard were used, both new and universal ones. This work is based on experimental data of the corrosion losses of St3, Zn, Cu, and Al for the first year of exposure (\(K_{1}^{{\exp }}\)) and calculated by the DRF values ​​of corrosion losses for the first year (\(K_{1}^{{{\text{pr}}}}\)) for the test sites conducted in the framework of international UN/ECE and Russian programs, as well as the MICAT project. For these places, the necessary atmospheric aggressiveness parameters for DRF were taken into account. The categories of atmospheric corrosion activity are adopted in accordance with ISO 9223:2012(E) standard."
In silico ranking of phenolics for therapeutic effectiveness on cancer stem cells,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have features such as the ability to self-renew, differentiate into defined progenies and initiate the tumor growth. Treatments of cancer include drugs, chemotherapy and radiotherapy or a combination. However, treatment of cancer by various therapeutic strategies often fail. One possible reason is that the nature of CSCs, which has stem-like properties, make it more dynamic and complex and may cause the therapeutic resistance. Another limitation is the side effects associated with the treatment of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. To explore better or alternative treatment options the current study aims to investigate the natural drug-like molecules that can be used as CSC-targeted therapy. Among various natural products, anticancer potential of phenolics is well established. We collected the 21 phytochemicals from phenolic group and their interacting CSC genes from the publicly available databases. Then a bipartite graph is constructed from the collected CSC genes along with their interacting phytochemicals from phenolic group as other. The bipartite graph is then transformed into weighted bipartite graph by considering the interaction strength between the phenolics and the CSC genes. The CSC genes are also weighted by two scores, namely, DSI (Disease Specificity Index) and DPI (Disease Pleiotropy Index). For each gene, its DSI score reflects the specific relationship with the disease and DPI score reflects the association with multiple diseases. Finally, a ranking technique is developed based on PageRank (PR) algorithm for ranking the phenolics."
Genome-wide detection of short tandem repeat expansions by long-read sequencing,"Short tandem repeat (STR), or “microsatellite”, is a tract of DNA in which a specific motif (typically < 10 base pairs) is repeated multiple times. STRs are abundant throughout the human genome, and specific repeat expansions may be associated with human diseases. Long-read sequencing coupled with bioinformatics tools enables the estimation of repeat counts for STRs. However, with the exception of a few well-known disease-relevant STRs, normal ranges of repeat counts for most STRs in human populations are not well known, preventing the prioritization of STRs that may be associated with human diseases."
LDscaff: LD-based scaffolding of de novo genome assemblies,"Genome assembly is fundamental for de novo genome analysis. Hybrid assembly, utilizing various sequencing technologies increases both contiguity and accuracy. While such approaches require extra costly sequencing efforts, the information provided millions of existed whole-genome sequencing data have not been fully utilized to resolve the task of scaffolding. Genetic recombination patterns in population data indicate non-random association among alleles at different loci, can provide physical distance signals to guide scaffolding."
The shape of gene expression distributions matter: how incorporating distribution shape improves the interpretation of cancer transcriptomic data,"In genomics, we often assume that continuous data, such as gene expression, follow a specific kind of distribution. However we rarely stop to question the validity of this assumption, or consider how broadly applicable it may be to all genes that are in the transcriptome. Our study investigated the prevalence of a range of gene expression distributions in three different tumor types from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)."
"Restoring steppe landscapes: patterns, drivers and implications in Russia’s steppes","Agricultural land abandonment across the steppe belt of Eurasia has provided an opportunity for the restoration of steppe landscapes in recent decades. However, global food demands are about to revert this trajectory and put restored steppe landscapes at risk."
Global optimization based on active preference learning with radial basis functions,"This paper proposes a method for solving optimization problems in which the decision-maker cannot evaluate the objective function, but rather can only express a preference such as “this is better than that” between two candidate decision vectors. The algorithm described in this paper aims at reaching the global optimizer by iteratively proposing the decision maker a new comparison to make, based on actively learning a surrogate of the latent (unknown and perhaps unquantifiable) objective function from past sampled decision vectors and pairwise preferences. A radial-basis function surrogate is fit via linear or quadratic programming, satisfying if possible the preferences expressed by the decision maker on existing samples. The surrogate is used to propose a new sample of the decision vector for comparison with the current best candidate based on two possible criteria: minimize a combination of the surrogate and an inverse weighting distance function to balance between exploitation of the surrogate and exploration of the decision space, or maximize a function related to the probability that the new candidate will be preferred. Compared to active preference learning based on Bayesian optimization, we show that our approach is competitive in that, within the same number of comparisons, it usually approaches the global optimum more closely and is computationally lighter. Applications of the proposed algorithm to solve a set of benchmark global optimization problems, for multi-objective optimization, and for optimal tuning of a cost-sensitive neural network classifier for object recognition from images are described in the paper. MATLAB and a Python implementations of the algorithms described in the paper are available at http://cse.lab.imtlucca.it/~bemporad/glis."
Astragaloside IV suppresses post-ischemic natural killer cell infiltration and activation in the brain: involvement of histone deacetylase inhibition,"Natural killer (NK) cells, a type of cytotoxic lymphocytes, can infiltrate into ischemic brain and exacerbate neuronal cell death. Astragaloside IV (ASIV) is the major bioactive ingredient of Astragalus membranaceus, a Chinese herbal medicine, and possesses potent immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties. This study investigated the effects of ASIV on post-ischemic brain infiltration and activation of NK cells. ASIV reduced brain infarction and alleviated functional deficits in MCAO rats, and these beneficial effects persisted for at least 7 days. Abundant NK cells infiltrated into the ischemic hemisphere on day 1 after brain ischemia, and this infiltration was suppressed by ASIV. Strikingly, ASIV reversed NK cell deficiency in the spleen and blood after brain ischemia. ASIV inhibited astrocyte-derived CCL2 upregulation and reduced CCR2+ NK cell levels in the ischemic brain. Meanwhile, ASIV attenuated NK cell activating receptor NKG2D levels and reduced interferon-γ production. ASIV restored acetylation of histone H3 and the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-κB in the ischemic brain, suggesting inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC). Simultaneously, ASIV prevented p65 nuclear translocation. The effects of ASIV on reducing CCL2 production, restoring acetylated p65 levels and preventing p65 nuclear translocation were mimicked by valproate, an HDAC inhibitor, in astrocytes subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation. Our findings suggest that ASIV inhibits post-ischemic NK cell brain infiltration and activation and reverses NK cell deficiency in the periphery, which together contribute to the beneficial effects of ASIV against brain ischemia. Furthermore, ASIV’s effects on suppressing NK cell brain infiltration and activation may involve HDAC inhibition."
Biogenic Contamination and Mineral Pseudo-Biogenic Structures in Earth Rocks and Astromaterials,"Bacterial paleontology studies the roles played by organisms in the genesis of sediments and ores. It is, therefore, important to clearly distinguish in-situ biological objects present in the rock material from various contaminants of later origin and from mineral structures that merely resemble organisms. The same is crucial for correct interpretation of alleged biogenic structures found in meteorites. The use of a scanning electron microscope equipped with an EDX microanalysis system and designation of model objects from previously studied rock samples allows us to address this problem. This approach also needs to be applied to previously discovered structures."
"Carbon and Nitrogen Isotope Composition of the Wood of Pinus sylvestris, Betula pendula and Populus tremula","Proportions of 13C/12C and 15N/14N isotopes were identified in different woody compartments of birch (Betula pendula Roth), pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and aspen (Populus tremula L.) trunks in preforest-steppe and pine-birch forests of the Middle Urals using mass spectrometry. The data were analyzed and interpreted from the perspective of the biochemical processes of carbon and nitrogen metabolism in leaves, cambial tissue, trunk wood, branches, roots, and soil. A lighter isotopic composition of carbon is characteristic of the leaves and trunk cambium. The trunk wood is characterized by a basal trend for 13C enrichment. The 13C/12C ratio corresponds to the nitrogen content in the trunk wood tissues, indicating metabolic control of carbon fractionation in woody plants. The isotope composition of nitrogen in the trunk cambium was significantly depleted in 15N (δ15N varies from –1.5 to –3.5‰) and δ13C (δ13C varies from –28.3 to –25.8‰). Meanwhile the sapwood (δ15N varies from –2.6 to 1‰ and δ13C varies from –27.5 to –27.1‰) and heartwood (δ15N varies from –2.5 to –3.5‰ and δ13C varies from –26 to –24.5‰) were more enriched in 15N and 13C. The significant difference between the values of 13C and 15N isotope discrimination consequently in the different woody compartments of trunk should be taken into account when interpreting data of wood organic matter in the context of paleoclimate."
The Role of Microbial Communities in Soil Formation and Soil Ecosystem Health,"The concept of the microbial community (MC) current at the time of writing, its structure, and the theories that reflect and generalize the progress in MC research are considered. Contemporary knowledge is used as the basis to discuss the role and functions of microbial communities in the emergence and maintenance of what is traditionally referred to by the brief and capacious term “soil”, even though soil is essentially a product of the interaction of diverse biological communities and materials, and is a substance of infinite complexity and diversity, which can be regarded as an ecosystem; namely, the soil ecosystem (SE). A novel concept of soil health (SH), which integrates current knowledge of MCs and their functions, and can be used to understand their role in the soil ecosystem, is discussed. Methods for assessment of soil health parameters are briefly presented."
Soil Biomarkers as Indicators of Landscape Evolution on the Russian Plain,"Biomarkers, due to their structure and biochemistry, are resistant to soil degradation and mineralization under particular environmental conditions, and therefore can provide molecular evidence of paleobiota and past land vegetation, and of the intensity of not only modern, but also past biochemical processes in the biosphere. Parameters of the humus group composition, optical densities of solutions of humic acids, pool of chlorophyll, lipids, fatty acids, and lignin phenols together with the isotopic composition of organic carbon and soil age are suggested as promising biomarkers for paleoecological studies."
Biogenic Carbon Balance in the Territory of the Russian Federation for 1992–2017,"The investigations of the carbon balance and its composition in the territory of Russia was initiated by Academician Geogiy Zavarzin in the early 1990s. The first estimate of carbon balance over the entire Russian territory was obtained while implementing the State Science and Technology Program (GNTP 18) headed by George Zavarzin. The results of further studies carried out by both Russian and international research teams varied due to different methods of determining carbon dioxide sink, CO2 emissions and carbon pools in ecosystems."
Culturable Bacterial Communities Isolated from Cryo-Arid Soils: Phylogenetic and Physiological Characteristics,"The results of the phylogenetic analysis and analysis of the physiological characteristics of metabolic activity of strains isolated from frozen sedimentary rocks collected in the Antarctic and the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago are reported in this article. A comparable abundance of cultured cells and close morphological diversity of colony morphotypes were revealed in all samples. Representatives of the Actinobacteria and Firmicutes phyla were predominant in the cultured bacterial communities. These communities were characterized by mesophilic and neutrophilic optima, as well as by the wide ranges of temperatures and pH suitable for metabolic activity. Moderate halotolerance in the presence of sodium or potassium chloride, as well as the high inhibitory effect of sodium hydrocarbonate and low inhibitory effect of magnesium sulfate, were revealed. The communities were highly resistant to the presence of 5% magnesium perchlorate in the culture medium. Strains resistant to antibiotics in the composition of the medium were revealed: The isolated strains were the most resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cephalexin."
Microbiomorphic Analysis of Paleosols from the Upper Quaternary Deposits of the Kolyma Lowland,"This work presents the results of the study of microbiomorphs (pollen, spores, phytoliths, diatoms, shells of testate amoebae, sponge spicules, plant tissue remains) from the paleosols of the Upper Quaternary deposits of the Kolyma Lowland. The analysis of their abundance and diversity, as well as the relationships between different types of biomorphs, made it possible to clarify the genesis of the paleosols and the nature of the vegetation cover."
The Use of Modern Physical Methods of Instrumental Analytics in the Study of Stromatolites,"The use of X-ray microtomography, neutron tomography, scanning electron microscopy and X‑ray microanalysis in the study of stromatolites is discussed, and the advantages of each of these methods are summarized. Scanning electron microscopy allows study of the morphology of the object surface. Information about the composition and ratio of chemical elements of surface structures can be obtained using X‑ray microanalysis. X-ray microtomography will be useful for detecting internal structures and their localization in the sample. Neutron tomography can be used to search for organic matter and other hydrogen-containing compounds."
Volcanic Soil Series of the Lesser Caucasus as an Archive of Early Pleistocene Paleoecological Information,"Early Pleistocene volcanic soil series exposed in archaeological sites of the Lori Plateau and the Upper Akhurian Lowland of the Armenian Upland were studied. The study considers the isotopic composition of organic carbon and the content of n-alkanes, not previously analyzed in this area. Both these parameters indicate the waterlogged conditions of Early Pleistocene soil formation as is also indicated by morphology and magnetic susceptibility values. The reconstructed landscapes were represented by herbaceous biocenoses on hydromorphic soils with prevalence of C3-grasses."
Bacterial-Paleontological Study of Siderite Transformation in the Early Proterozoic Jaspilites of the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly,Interesting observations illustrating the process of transformation of some minerals of banded iron formations (BIF) were made while studying the Early Proterozoic jaspilites of the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly (KMA). Examples showing the process of siderite transformation into iron oxides/hydroxides by iron-oxidizing bacteria are given.
Microeukaryotes in the Metagenomes of Late Pleistocene Permafrost Deposits,"The analysis of metagenomes from four Late Pleistocene permafrost samples allowed us to recognize nearly four hundred genera of protists and fungi, as well as nematodes, in the microeukaryotic assemblage. The sample of the ancient oxbow lake sediments is characterized by the highest taxonomic diversity. Heterotrophic protists and autotrophs dominated the deposits that formed under hydromorphic conditions. Fungi, in turn, prevailed in the Ice Complex deposits. In general, metagenomic analysis characterizes the assemblages from permafrost deposits more entirely than the standard methods of enrichment cultivation."
Unusual Benthic Morphotypes Typical of Permanent Hydrogen Sulfide Zone of the Black Sea: Hypotheses of Their Origin and Perspectives of Study,"Benthic morphotypes with an organic shell of unknown systematic affiliation are constantly registered in the bottom sediments of deep-water hydrogen sulfide zone of the Black Sea. The work offers a brief description with illustrations of these morphotypes, which are identified as “Form 3,” “Form 4,” “Form 5,” “Form 6,” and “Form 11.” Hypotheses are proposed concerning their origin. In addition, this paper gives an opinion on the unexplained role of the morphotype accumulations in the formation of deep-sea sediments and the importance of these objects in sedimentology and micropaleontology. The use of the accepted term azoic or lifeless is discussed in relation to the hydrogen sulfide zone of the Black Sea."
"Monitoring a short-lived earthquake swarm during April–May 2020 in Haenam, Korea, and its preliminary results","On 3 May 2020, an ML 3.1 earthquake occurred in Haenam, southwestern Korea, in an area devoid of recorded seismicity since instrumental observations began in 1978. Careful examination of the temporal occurrence of seismicity, and the magnitude distribution of the sequence before and after the ML 3.1 earthquake, indicates typical swarm-like behavior. The earthquake swarm started with an ML 0.6 event on 26 April 2020, intensified up to 3 May 2020, and abruptly terminated with an ML 1.0 event on 9 May 2020. The Pusan National University Geophysics Laboratory (PNUGL) deployed a temporary seismic array with eight three-component short-period instruments to monitor the short-lived bursts of seismicity. During the monitoring campaign, we detected > 700 microearthquakes by applying a matched-filter technique to the combined dataset produced by PNUGL, the Korea Meteorological Administration, and the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology. We determined earthquake parameters for 299 earthquakes that were detected at four or more seismic stations. We also determined the focal mechanism solutions of the 10 largest earthquakes in the swarm using first-motion polarities with S/P ratios. The focal mechanism, hypocentral depth, and stress orientation of the largest earthquake in the sequence were also determined using waveform inversions. The distribution of earthquake hypocenters, together with focal mechanism solutions, indicates that the earthquake swarm activated deeply-buried faults (~20 km) oriented either NNE-SSW or WNW-ESE. We also report details of the temporary seismic monitoring network, including the instrumentation, detection of microearthquakes, and variations in event-detection threshold influenced by anthropogenic and natural noise fluctuations. We also discuss the limitations associated with lowering the detection threshold of microearthquakes by increasing the number of seismic stations or by adopting advanced event-detection techniques."
Identifying spatial technology clusters from patenting concentrations using heat map kernel density estimation,"In this paper a methodology for identifying and delineating spatial technology clusters based on patenting concentration is developed. The methodology involves the automated geocoding of patent inventor addresses, the application of a home bias correction factor and a sensitivity analysis to determine the optimal parameters of the kernel density estimation interpolation distance and the minimum concentration threshold to identify clusters. The methodology’s performance is compared to a number of other cluster identification methods and it is validated across 18 individual sectors, including mature broad-based high-technology sectors and emerging niche sustainable energy technology sectors. The results suggest that the performance of the methodology exceed that of alternative cluster identification methods, although there is some variation in performance between different sectors. This demonstrates that the methodology provides researchers, practitioners and policy makers with a useful tool to gain insight into the spatial distribution of sectoral innovation activity at a global scale and sub-national regional level and to monitor changes over time, thereby supplementing more readily available global statistical data which is available at the national level."
Inverse determination of multiple heat sources’ release history in indoor environments,"The heat source of an air-conditioned room has an important effect on the indoor environment. The release rates of heat sources are related to the comfort of the designed thermal environment, so they must be determined. Traditional design methods rely on iterative guess-and-correct, which consumes resources and time and cannot meet the needs of modern design. This study aims to establish an inverse model of Tikhonov regularization and least square optimization by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), so that researchers can accurately determine the time release rate of multiple heat sources with known parameters. The temporal release rates can then be solved based on the inverse matrix operation with the temperature series at different discrete times. The study speeds up the solving process and expresses the temperature as the convolution integral between the temperature response of the thermal response factor and the arbitrary release rate. The results show that applying the above method to the quantization of the temporal release rates of three heat sources in a three-dimensional cavity can correctly determine the temporal release rates of multiple heat sources. The errors between the inversely determined release rates and the actual release rates are less than 40%."
The effect of assembly and static unbalance on reaction wheel assembly bearing harmonics,"Reaction wheel assemblies (RWA) are well-known major sources of microvibrations, whilst they have been studied thoroughly and many disturbance types can be reasonably modelled, bearing disturbances and how their amplitude evolves with the RWA rotational speed are not at the same level of confidence. Whilst studies have been carried out, many of the test rigs used do not truly show the bearing harmonic development, either due to interference from other disturbances such as structural modes or are not representative of an RWA. This study aims to design and validate a test rig which alleviates those issues by moving the resonance frequencies out of a range of interest and isolating the motor disturbances. Using this test rig, it was possible to observe many engine order development without any inference and start to investigate some of the effects some manufacturing parameters can have. The two studied and discussed in this paper were the effect of reassembly and static unbalance. Investigating the microvibration signature at different levels ranging from a top-down to individual harmonics it showed a clear significant variation between disturbance amplitudes."
Bodily Maps of Emotion in Major Depressive Disorder,"Emotions play a central role in mental disorder and especially in depression. They are sensed in the body, and it has recently been shown in healthy participants that these sensations can be differentiated between emotions. The aim of the current study was to assess bodily sensations for basic emotions induced by emotion eliciting pictures in depression."
Die Bedeutung von Gratifikationen bei der Aneignung neuer Medien im höheren Lebensalter,"Eine verbreitete Annahme geht davon aus, dass Menschen im Laufe der Jugend und des Erwachsenenlebens bestimmte Dispositionen des Umgangs mit Medien erlernen, die es ihnen später erschweren, neue mediale Nutzungsmuster zu entwickeln. Jenseits theoretischer Annahmen besteht bislang ein Mangel an explorierenden Untersuchungen, die der Frage nachgehen, unter welchen Bedingungen ältere Menschen digitale, ihnen bislang nicht vertraute Medien aufgreifen und in ihren Alltag einbeziehen."
Further results on Hilbert’s Tenth Problem,"Hilbert’s Tenth Problem (HTP) asked for an algorithm to test whether an arbitrary polynomial Diophantine equation with integer coefficients has solutions over the ring ℤ of integers. This was finally solved by Matiyasevich negatively in 1970. In this paper we obtain some further results on HTP over ℤ. We prove that there is no algorithm to determine for any P(z1,…,z9) ∈ ℤ[z1,…,z9] whether the equation P(z1,…,z9) = 0 has integral solutions with z9 ⩾ 0. Consequently, there is no algorithm to test whether an arbitrary polynomial Diophantine equation P(z1,…,z11) = 0 (with integer coefficients) in 11 unknowns has integral solutions, which provides the best record on the original HTP over ℤ. We also prove that there is no algorithm to test for any P(z1,…,z17) ∈ ℤ[z1,…,z17] whether P(z

) = 0 has integral solutions, and that there is a polynomial Q(z1, …, z20) ∈ ℤ[z1,…,z20] such that {Q(z

The mechanodonor-acceptor coupling (MDAC) approach for unidirectional multi-state fluorochromism,"Uni-directional multi-state fluorochromic scaffolds are valuable photofunctional molecules and yet scarce. We report a general approach for their design, i.e., mechanodonor-acceptor coupling (MDAC). A photochromic molecule is a mechanodonor, due to its capability to convert photonic energy into mechanical force. Upon proper coupling, it can be used to drive a mechanochromic molecule for uni-directional multi-state fluorochromism. The embodiment of this approach is a rhodamine-dithienylethylene hydride (RDH), which has been successfully employed in super-resolution localization microscopy"
Phase I Study of Rucaparib in Combination with Bevacizumab in Ovarian Cancer Patients: Maximum Tolerated Dose and Pharmacokinetic Profile,"Targeted agents, such as antiangiogenic drugs (e.g., bevacizumab) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (e.g., rucaparib), have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent ovarian cancer. Evidence suggests that combinations of these two classes of targeted agents may result in synergistic antitumor activity."

"Pharmacotherapy of 1,044 inpatients with posttraumatic stress disorder: current status and trends in German-speaking countries","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with limited approved pharmacological treatment options and high symptom burden. Therefore, real-life prescription patterns may differ from guideline recommendations, especially in psychiatric inpatient settings. The European Drug Safety Program in Psychiatry (“Arzneimittelsicherheit in der Psychiatrie”, AMSP) collects inpatients’ prescription rates cross-sectionally twice a year in German-speaking psychiatric hospitals. For this study, the AMSP database was screened for psychiatric inpatients with a primary diagnosis of PTSD between 2001 and 2017. N = 1,044 patients with a primary diagnosis of PTSD were identified with 89.9% taking psychotropics. The average prescription rate was 2.4 (standard deviation: 1.5) psychotropics per patient with high rates of antidepressant drugs (72.0%), antipsychotics drugs (58.4%) and tranquilizing drugs (29.3%). The presence of psychiatric comorbidities was associated with higher rates of psychotropic drug use. The most often prescribed substances were quetiapine (24.1% of all patients), lorazepam (18.1%) and mirtazapine (15.0%). The use of drugs approved for PTSD was low (sertraline 11.1%; paroxetine 3.7%). Prescription rates of second-generation antipsychotic drugs increased, while the use of tranquilizing drugs declined over the years. High prescription rates and extensive use of sedative medication suggest a symptom-driven prescription (e.g., hyperarousal, insomnia) that can only be explained to a minor extent by existing comorbidities. The observed discrepancy with existing guidelines underlines the need for effective pharmacological and psychological treatment options in psychiatric inpatient settings."
Global electroweak fit and vector-like leptons in light of the Cabibbo angle anomaly,"The “Cabibbo Angle Anomaly” (CAA) originates from the disagreement between the CKM elements Vud and Vus extracted from superallowed beta and kaon decays, respectively, once compared via CKM unitarity. It points towards new physics with a significance of up to 4 σ, depending on the theoretical input used, and can be explained through modified W couplings to leptons. In this context, vector-like leptons (VLLs) are prime candidates for a corresponding UV completion since they can affect Wℓν couplings at tree-level, such that this modification can have the dominant phenomenological impact. In order to consistently assess agreement data, a global fit is necessary which we perform for gauge-invariant dimension-6 operators and all patterns obtained for the six possible representations (under the SM gauge group) of VLLs. We find that even in the lepton flavour universal case, including the measurements of the CKM elements Vus and Vud into the electroweak fit has a relevant impact, shifting the best fit point significantly. Concerning the VLLs we discuss the bounds from charged lepton flavour violating processes and observe that a single representation cannot describe experimental data significantly better than the SM hypothesis. However, allowing for several representations of VLLs at the same time, we find that the simple scenario in which N couples to electrons via the Higgs and Σ1 couples to muons not only explains the CAA but also improves the rest of the electroweak fit in such a way that its best fit point is preferred by more than 4 σ with respect to the begin."
Superconformal mechanics of AdS2 D-brane boundstates,"We explicitly construct a family of \( \mathcal{N} \) = 4 superconformal mechanics of dyonic particles, generalizing the work of Anninos et al. [1] to an arbitrary number of particles. These mechanics are obtained from a scaling limit of the effective Coulomb branch description of \( \mathcal{N} \) = 4 quiver quantum mechanics describing D-branes in type II Calabi-Yau compactifications. In the supergravity description of these D-branes this limit changes the asymptotics to AdS2×S2×CY3. We exhibit the D(1, 2; 0) superconformal symmetry and conserved charges of the mechanics in detail. In addition we present an alternative formulation as a sigma model on a hyperkähler manifold with torsion."
In silico discovery of antigenic proteins and epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 for the development of a vaccine or a diagnostic approach for COVID-19,"In the genome of SARS-CoV-2, the 5′-terminus encodes a polyprotein, which is further cleaved into 15 non-structural proteins whereas the 3′ terminus encodes four structural proteins and eight accessory proteins. Among these 27 proteins, the present study aimed to discover likely antigenic proteins and epitopes to be used for the development of a vaccine or serodiagnostic assay using an in silico approach. For this purpose, after the full genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan isolate and variant proteins that are detected frequently, surface proteins including spike, envelope, and membrane proteins as well as proteins with signal peptide were determined as probable vaccine candidates whereas the remaining were considered as possible antigens to be used during the development of serodiagnostic assays. According to results obtained, among 27 proteins, 26 of them were predicted as probable antigen. In 26 proteins, spike protein was selected as the best vaccine candidate because of having a signal peptide, negative GRAVY value, one transmembrane helix, moderate aliphatic index, a big molecular weight, a long-estimated half-life, beta wrap motifs as well as having stable, soluble and non-allergic features. In addition, orf7a, orf8, and nsp-10 proteins with signal peptide were considered as potential vaccine candidates. Nucleocapsid protein and a highly antigenic GGDGKMKD epitope were identified as ideal antigens to be used in the development of serodiagnostic assays. Moreover, considering MHC-I alleles, highly antigenic KLNDLCFTNV and ITLCFTLKRK epitopes can be used to develop an epitope-based peptide vaccine."
Inclusive groups can avoid the tragedy of the commons,"The public goods game is a famous example illustrating the tragedy of the commons (Hardin in Science 162:1243–1248, 1968). In this game cooperating individuals contribute to a pool, which in turn is distributed to all members of the group, including defectors who reap the same rewards as cooperators without having made a contribution before. The question is now, how to incentivize group members to all cooperate as it maximizes the common good. While costly punishment (Helbing et al. in New J Phys 12:083005, 2010) presents one such method, the cost of punishment still reduces the common good. The selfishness of the group members favors defectors. Here we show that including other members of the groups and sharing rewards with them can be another incentive for cooperation, avoiding the cost required for punishment. Further, we show how punishment and this form of inclusiveness interact. This work suggests that a redistribution similar to a basic income that is coupled to the economic success of the entire group could overcome the tragedy of the commons."
Presence of the neonatal Staphylococcus capitis outbreak clone (NRCS-A) in prosthetic joint infections,"Staphylococcus capitis is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus that has been described primarily as causing bloodstream infections in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), but has also recently been described in prosthetic joint infections (PJIs). The multidrug-resistant S. capitis subsp. urealyticus clone NRCS-A, comprising three sublineages, is prevalent in NICUs across the world, but its impact on other patient groups such as those suffering from PJIs or among adults planned for arthroplasty is unknown. Genome sequencing and subsequent analysis were performed on a Swedish collection of PJI isolates (n = 21), nasal commensals from patients planned to undergo arthroplasty (n = 20), NICU blood isolates (n = 9), operating theatre air isolates (n = 4), and reference strains (n = 2), in conjunction with an international strain collection (n = 248). The NRCS-A Outbreak sublineage containing the composite type V SCCmec-SCCcad/ars/cop element was present in PJIs across three Swedish hospitals. However, it was not found among nasal carrier strains, where the less virulent S. capitis subsp. capitis was most prevalent. The presence of the NRCS-A Outbreak clone in adult patients with PJIs demonstrates that dissemination occurs beyond NICUs. As this clone has several properties which facilitate invasive infections in patients with medical implants or immunosuppression, such as biofilm forming ability and multidrug resistance including heterogeneous glycopeptide-intermediate susceptibility, further research is needed to understand the reservoirs and distribution of this hospital-associated pathogen."
Mendelian randomization and experimental IUGR reveal the adverse effect of low birth weight on lung structure and function,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and low birth weigth (LBW) are risk factors for neonatal chronic lung disease. However, maternal and fetal genetic factors and the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the relationship between LBW and lung function with Mendelian randomisation analyses and studied angiogenesis in a low protein diet rat model of IUGR. Our data indicate a possible association between LBW and reduced FEV1 (p = 5.69E−18, MR-PRESSO) and FVC (6.02E-22, MR-PRESSO). Complimentary, we demonstrated two-phased perinatal programming after IUGR. The intrauterine phase (embryonic day 21) is earmarked by a reduction of endothelial cell markers (e.g. CD31) as well as mRNA expression of angiogenic factors (e.g., Vegfa, Flt1, Klf4). Protein analysis identified an activation of anti-angiogenic mTOR effectors. In the postnatal phase, lung capillaries (< 20 µm) were significantly reduced, expression of CD31 and VE-Cadherin were unaffected, whereas SMAD1/5/8 signaling and Klf4 protein were increased (p < 0.01). Moreover, elevated proteolytic activity of MMP2 and MMP9 was linked to a 50% reduction of lung elastic fibres. In conclusion, we show a possible link of LBW in humans and reduced lung function in adulthood. Experimental IUGR identifies an intrauterine phase with inhibition of angiogenic signaling, and a postnatal phase with proteolytic activity and reduced elastic fibres."
A meta-analysis of accuracy and sensitivity of chest CT and RT-PCR in COVID-19 diagnosis,"Nowadays there is an ongoing acute respiratory outbreak caused by the novel highly contagious coronavirus (COVID-19). The diagnostic protocol is based on quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and chests CT scan, with uncertain accuracy. This meta-analysis study determines the diagnostic value of an initial chest CT scan in patients with COVID-19 infection in comparison with RT-PCR. Three main databases; PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and EMBASE were systematically searched for all published literature from January 1st, 2019, to the 21st May 2020 with the keywords ""COVID19 virus"", ""2019 novel coronavirus"", ""Wuhan coronavirus"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""X-Ray Computed Tomography"", ""Polymerase Chain Reaction"", ""Reverse Transcriptase PCR"", and ""PCR Reverse Transcriptase"". All relevant case-series, cross-sectional, and cohort studies were selected. Data extraction and analysis were performed using STATA v.14.0SE (College Station, TX, USA) and RevMan 5. Among 1022 articles, 60 studies were eligible for totalizing 5744 patients. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of chest CT scan compared to RT-PCR were 87% (95% CI 85–90%), 46% (95% CI 29–63%), 69% (95% CI 56–72%), and 89% (95% CI 82–96%), respectively. It is important to rely on the repeated RT-PCR three times to give 99% accuracy, especially in negative samples. Regarding the overall diagnostic sensitivity of 87% for chest CT, the RT-PCR testing is essential and should be repeated to escape misdiagnosis."
Precision calculations of the double radiative bottom-meson decays in soft-collinear effective theory,"Employing the systematic framework of soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) we perform an improved calculation of the leading-power contributions to the double radiative Bd,s-meson decay amplitudes in the heavy quark expansion by including the perturbative resummation of enhanced logarithms of mb/ΛQCD at the next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. We then construct the QCD factorization formulae for the subleading power contributions arising from the energetic photon radiation off the constituent light-flavour quark of the bottom meson at tree level. Furthermore, we explore the factorization properties of the subleading power correction from the effective SCET current  at \( \mathcal{O}\left({\alpha}_s^0\right) \) by virtue of the operator identities due to the classical equations of motion. The higher-twist contributions to the Bd,s → γγ helicity form factors from the two-particle and three-particle bottom-meson distribution amplitudes are evaluated with the perturbative factorization technique, up to the twist-six accuracy. In addition, the subleading power weak-annihilation contributions from both the current-current and QCD penguin operators are taken into account at the one-loop accuracy. We proceed to apply the operator-production-expansion-controlled dispersion relation for estimating the power-suppressed soft contributions to the double radiative Bd,s-meson decay form factors, which cannot be factorized into the light-cone distribution amplitudes of the heavy-meson and the resolved photon as well as the hard-scattering kernel calculable in perturbation theory canonically. Phenomenological explorations of the radiative Bd,s → γγ decay observables in the presence of the neutral-meson mixing, including the CP-averaged branching fractions, the polarization fractions and the time-dependent CP asymmetries, are carried out subsequently with an emphasis on the numerical impacts of the newly computed ingredients together with the theory uncertainties from the shape parameters of the HQET bottom-meson distribution amplitudes."
Fate of domain walls in 5D gravitational theory with compact extra dimension,"We pursue the time evolution of the domain walls in 5D gravitational theory with a compact extra dimension by numerical calculation. In order to avoid a kink-antikink pair that decays into the vacuum, we introduce a topological winding in the field space. In contrast to the case of non-gravitational theories, there is no static domain-wall solution in the setup. In the case that the minimal value of the potential is non-negative, we find that both the 3D space and the extra dimension will expand at late times if the initial value of the Hubble parameter is chosen as positive. The wall width almost remains constant during the evolution. In other cases, the extra dimension diverges and the 3D space shrinks to zero at a finite time."
Speeds of Sound in n-Hexane and n-Heptane at Temperatures from (233.33 to 353.21) K and Pressures up to 20 MPa,"The speed of sound in high-purity n-hexane and n-heptane was experimentally studied utilizing the double-path length pulse-echo technique. Measurements with each alkane were carried out at temperatures from (233 to 353) K with pressures up to 20 MPa. Considering the uncertainty contributions from temperature, pressure, path-length calibration, pulse timing and sample purity, the relative expanded combined uncertainty (k = 2) in the speed of sound in n-hexane ranges from (0.012 to 0.042) % over the investigated ranges of pressure and temperature; for n-heptane, the uncertainty varies from (0.014 to 0.018) %. The sound speed data measured in n-hexane were among the data used for the development of a new fundamental equation of state, which is, however, not described in this work. The experimental data of n-heptane can be considered appropriate for modeling purposes and validation of existing equations of state."
Identification of Na+-Pumping Cytochrome Oxidase in the Membranes of Extremely Alkaliphilic Thioalkalivibrio Bacteria,"For the first time, the functioning of the oxygen reductase Na+-pump (Na+-pumping cytochrome c oxidase of the cbb3-type) was demonstrated by examining the respiratory chain of the extremely alkaliphilic bacterium Thioalkalivibrio versutus [Muntyan, M. S., et al. (2015) Cytochrome cbb3 of Thioalkalivibrio is a Na+-pumping cytochrome oxidase, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 112, 7695-7700], a product of the ccoNOQP operon. In this study, we detected and identified this enzyme using rabbit polyclonal antibody against the predicted C-terminal amino acid sequence of its catalytic subunit. We found that this cbb3-type oxidase is synthesized in bacterial cells, where it is located in the membranes. The 48-kDa oxidase subunit (CcoN) is catalytic, while subunits CcoO and CcoP with molecular masses of 29 and 34 kDa, respectively, are cytochromes c. The theoretical pI values of the CcoN, CcoO, and CcoP subunits were determined. It was shown that parts of the CcoO and CcoP subunits exposed to the aqueous phase on the cytoplasmic membrane P-side are enriched with negatively charged amino acid residues, in contrast to the parts of the integral subunit CcoN adjacent to the aqueous phase. Thus, the Na+-pumping cytochrome c oxidase of T. versutus, both in function and in structure, demonstrates adaptation to extremely alkaline conditions."
"Linking 7-Nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) to Triphenylphosphonium Yields Mitochondria-Targeted Protonophore and Antibacterial Agent","Appending lipophilic cations to small molecules has been widely used to produce mitochondria-targeted compounds with specific activities. In this work, we obtained a series of derivatives of the well-known fluorescent dye 7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD). According to the previous data [Denisov et al. (2014) Bioelectrochemistry, 98, 30-38], alkyl derivatives of NBD can uncouple isolated mitochondria at concentration of tens of micromoles despite a high pKa value (~11) of the dissociating group. Here, a number of triphenylphosphonium (TPP) derivatives linked to NBD via hydrocarbon spacers of varying length (C5, C8, C10, and C12) were synthesized (mitoNBD analogues), which accumulated in the mitochondria in an energy-dependent manner. NBD-C10-TPP (C10-mitoNBD) acted as a protonophore in artificial lipid membranes (liposomes) and uncoupled isolated mitochondria at micromolar concentrations, while the derivative with a shorter linker (NBD-C5-TPP, or C5-mitoNBD) exhibited no such activities. In accordance with this data, C10-mitoNBD was significantly more efficient than C5-mitoNBD in suppressing the growth of Bacillus subtilis. C10-mitoNBD and C12-mitoNBD demonstrated the highest antibacterial activity among the investigated analogues. C10-mitoNBD also exhibited the neuroprotective effect in the rat model of traumatic brain injury."
Autophagy as a Target for the Retinoprotective Effects of the Mitochondria-Targeted Antioxidant SkQ1,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease, a main cause of vision loss in elderly people. The pathogenesis of dry AMD, the most common form of AMD (~ 80% cases), involves degenerative changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which are closely associated with the age-associated impairments in autophagy. Reversion of these degenerative changes is considered as a promising approach for the treatment of this incurable disease. The purpose of our study was to assess the relationship between previously identified retinoprotective effects of the mitochondrial antioxidant plastoquinonyl-decyl-triphenylphosphonium (SkQ1) and its influence on the autophagy process in senescence-accelerated OXYS rats characterized by the development of AMD-like retinopathy (Wistar rats were used as a control). The treatment with SkQ1 (250 nmol/kg body weight) during the period of active disease progression (from 12 to 18 months of age) completely prevented progression of clinical manifestations of retinopathy in the OXYS rats, suppressed atrophic changes in the RPE cells and activated autophagy in the retina, which was evidenced by a significant decrease in the content of the multifunctional adapter protein p62/Sqstm1 and increase in the level of the Beclin1 gene mRNA. In general, the results obtained earlier and in the present study have shown that SkQ1 is a promising agent for prevention and suppression of AMD."
High-Temperature Oxidation of NiAlCr–Ca and NiAlCr–Sr Alloys in Air,"In this study, interrupted oxidation behavior of synthetic NiAlCr–Ca (Ca = 0.3, 1.4, 2 at.%) and NiAlCr–Sr (Sr = 0.4 at.%) alloys in the air at 1027 °C for 192 h was investigated. Parabolic rate constants (kp) showed that the Sr-containing alloy exhibited the best oxidation resistance among the alloys investigated in this study. The oxide scale formed on the Sr-containing alloy was composed of α-Al2O3 phase with Sr-rich nodules. Increasing the Ca concentration in the alloys was found to reduce the oxidation resistance due to the formation of non-protective Ca-rich complex oxides and consumption of α-Al2O3 scale by the reaction between Al2O3 and CaO. The Ca-rich complex oxides were initially formed on the Ca-rich interdendritic region and grew with time. Very little scale spallation was observed for the Sr-containing alloy, while it was notable for 0.3 at.% Ca-containing alloy. Spallation was attributed to the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch arisen from the formation of CaAl4O7 phase, a compound with a very low CTE."
Identification of cross-section loads for steel beam with simple cross-sectional shape based on measured strain and its application,"A new strain gauge layout method on the structural surface is proposed to identify the six-component loads in cross-section. Numerical simulation of a cantilever beam and an industrial case study, i.e., identification of hinge joint loads on excavator working device under actual excavating condition, are presented to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed method for industrial scale problems. The hinge joint loads deduced from the stick’s six-component cross-section loads identified by the new method were compared with the values calculated by traditional method, and the recurrence degree of stress and fatigue cumulative damage of the stick’s fatigue critical points were also compared. The maximum deviation between the actual damage of each selected measuring point and the damage caused by the identified hinge joint loads was only 1.69 %. The field test results showed that the new method could be conveniently applied with high identification accuracy for complicated actual loads."
Nonlinear dynamic analysis of an external gear system with meshing beyond pitch point,"A two-dimensional non-linear dynamics model of a gear with meshing beyond pitch point with six degrees has been established, considering time-varying meshing stiffness, time-varying bearing stiffness, time-varying friction, backlash and bearing clearance. Time-varying meshing stiffness is computed by using material mechanics method. The friction coefficient of Coulomb model and the friction coefficient of EHL theory are analyzed and compared in dynamic response. The global bifurcation characteristics caused by input speed, backlash, bearing clearance and damping are investigated. The maximum Lyapunov exponent which leads to chaos characters effect of changing parameters is analyzed. The verification experiment is carried out on the CL-100 test rig. Meshing frequency has main impact on vibration acceleration of ordinary spur gear and double meshing frequency has main impact on vibration acceleration of gear with meshing beyond pitch point. The results show that the gear with meshing beyond is better than ordinary spur gear whether in bifurcation characteristics or in vibration acceleration response."
Development of measurement technique of explosive flame using an optical measurement method,"It is essential in weapons systems to understand how much explosive power is applied according to various chemicals and methods of the explosion. In particular, to measure dynamic thermal phenomena and analyze thermal properties under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. Although many researchers have used thermocouples to measure the temperature during an explosion, this method has an error in the temperature measurement as the radiant heat flux increases. Another measurement method is needed to solve this problem. During an explosion in a shock tube, the temperature change was measured with a thermocouple and a pressure sensor. To solve the limitations of the thermocouple’s measurement responsiveness in temperature measurement was compared with the TDLD (tunable diode laser detection) method. In the case of the TDLD method, the time to reach the peak was measured an average 0.0207 sec faster than the thermocouple. Moreover, the peak average temperature was 15.8 °C higher than that of the thermocouple."
Reliability optimization design of hydraulic system considering oil contamination,"This paper presents a reliability optimization design method for a hydraulic system that considers oil contamination. The proposed method applies the quantitative relationship between oil contamination and system reliability to the reliability design of a hydraulic system, while considering the performance, layout, and other design factors. A global reliability model of the hydraulic system is constructed based on the oil contamination control model. Further studies aiming at an optimization design model of the hydraulic system is established where the cost is the objective function, reliability index, size and structure range, performance requirements are constraints, structure size and oil change period are design variables. For illustration, a case study on the reliability optimization design of the oil supply point branch of the static pressure bracket of a certain type of heavy CNC horizontal lathe is considered."
Mathematical model and meshing analysis of internal meshing gear transmission with curve element,"A new internal meshing gear transmission with curve element is put forward in this paper. The mathematical principle of tooth profile generation is described based on conjugate curves theory. For a given spatial curve, the meshing equation and its conjugated spatial curve under the motion law were derived. Considering the equidistant kinematic method, general internal tooth profiles models were established by the conjugate-curve pair. Numerical example of the internal gear pair was developed according to gear parameters and gear solid models were established by MATLAB and UG software. Motion simulation result shows that the gear pair satisfies point contact condition and design requirements. Meshing analysis of tooth profiles using FEA method was carried out. Stress analysis results of tooth profiles with single point contact and two points contact were, respectively, obtained. The conclusions lay the foundation for multi-point contact generation and tooth profile design. Also, further studies on transmission characteristics and manufacturing technology of the new gear drive will be carried out."
Nonlinear impact of traction rod on the dynamics of a high-speed rail vehicle carbody,"This paper focuses on the bogie-carbody nonlinear dynamic interaction of a Shinkansen high-speed rail vehicle. The Euler-Bernoulli beam model is used to simulate vertical elastic vibrations of the carbody. As a novelty, the traction rod that connects the bogie frame and the carbody is considered a nonlinear element. The equivalent linearization method is used to analyze the nonlinear vehicle system in the frequency domain. The analytical spectrum solution was compared with the measured data from the running test and the numerical solution in the time domain. When the dynamic interaction due to the carbody’s flexibility is considered as nonlinear rather than linear, the maximum amplitude of the bounce acceleration relevant to the first bending mode increases by 38.2 percent at a travel speed of 300 km/h. Ride comfort improvement can be achieved with the inclusion of the nonlinear interaction. It is also feasible to manipulate the vehicle’s ride comfort by altering its bogie-base."
Performance analysis of the two-stage axial compressor with 90-degree bend inlet conditions,"The 90-degree bend is one of the basic connection components applied in industrial flowing systems. This bend influences the aerodynamic performance of the downstream connecting equipment. In this study, the performance of a two-stage axial compressor with a 90-degree bend inlet was numerically and experimentally analyzed under low rotating speed. The testing results show that the outflow of the bend was numerically non-uniform in the circumferential and radial directions. To analyze the performance influence of the bend on the downstream compressor, a full passage compressor model with and without the inlet bend was simulated. The size of the distortion region gradually spread to the entire cascade, and the intensity of the distortion obviously dropped after the first stage as the compressor ran with the bend. The deterioration of the compressor performance, especially in the first stage, was verified numerically and experimentally. The total pressure coefficient and isentropic efficiency decreased by 2.6 % and 1.13 %, respectively. To save simulation cost, a model with a downstream single blade passage and cylindrical inlet was proposed, and the distorted flow was set as the inlet boundary condition. In addition, the unsteady numerical simulation was performed with the rotating inlet distortion region. Compared with the full blade passage model, the unsteady single blade passage model obtained the downstream spread characteristic of the distortion and performance deterioration. The latter can therefore be suggested as a compromised approach for obtaining the propagation characteristics of the inlet distortion with acceptable accuracy and low computational cost."
What Do Migrants Know About Their Childcare Rights? A First Exploration in West Germany,"Although an increasing number of studies emphasise migrants’ lack of knowledge about their childcare rights as a crucial barrier to their childcare usage, almost none examines the conditions under which migrant families acquire this knowledge. This study contributes to the literature by exploring potential individual factors determining migrant families’ knowledge about their childcare rights in Germany. I use unique data collected through the project Migrants’ Welfare State Attitudes (MIFARE), in which nine different migrant groups in Germany were surveyed about their relation to the welfare state, including childcare. Analysing a total sample of 623 migrants living with children in their household and by using logistic regression analyses, I find that human and social capital play significant roles in explaining migrants’ knowledge about their childcare rights. Migrants who speak the host language sufficiently are more likely to know about their childcare rights; however, it does not matter whether migrants are lower or higher educated. Moreover, I observe that migrants benefit from their co-ethnic relations only if childcare usage is high among their ethnic group. Based on these results, policy recommendations are discussed in order to increase migrants’ knowledge about their childcare rights in Germany."
Attenuation characteristics of ground penetrating radar electromagnetic wave in aeration zone,"Amplitude, an important electromagnetic wave attribute, is considered as a useful parameter to describe the energy attenuation of electromagnetic wave. In this study, SIR-3000 Radar Equipment was employed to investigate the amplitude of electromagnetic wave in medium sandstone with different water content and depth. Results suggest that, with same water content, the decreasing of electromagnetic wave energy with increasing depth can be described by maximum peak amplitude, while, the decreasing of electromagnetic wave energy with increasing water content at certain depth can be described by average amplitude. In addition, energy of electromagnetic wave is negatively correlated to the dielectric constant because of the positive correlation between water content and dielectric constant. This study can provide significant information to the water measurement in aeration zone."
The Effect of Foliar Fertilization with Micronutrients on the Incidence and Severity of Leaf and Stem-base Diseases in Winter Triticale (x Triticosecale Witmm.) and Winter Rye (Secale cereale L.),"Winter triticale (Triticale) cv. Dinaro and winter rye (Secale cereale L.) cv. Dańkowskie Diament were grown in 2012 and 2013 in a field-plot experiment in Tomaszkowo near Olsztyn (NE Poland). The experiment consisted of 7 treatments: absolute control (without fertilizers or the growth stimulator), control-NPK fertilizer, NPK fertilizer + micronutrients applied alone or in combination (4 treatments), NPK fertilizer + Nano-Gro growth stimulator. The severity of disease symptoms on the leaves and stem-bases of triticale and rye was evaluated throughout the growing season. Symptoms of powdery mildew on the leaves of winter triticale and winter rye were noted only in the growing season of 2013, and disease severity remained at a low level. In the growing season of 2012, weather conditions were conducive to the spread of Septoria tritici blotch (STB) and brown rust on triticale (the highest values of infection index were 41.6 and 23.8%, respectively), and scald and brown rust on rye (29.0 and 38.1%, respectively). Foliar application of micronutrients influenced the rates of infections caused by Zymoseptoria tritici and Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici on triticale leaves. Symptoms of eyespot and Fusarium foot and root rot were noted on the stem-bases of both cereal species, whereas symptoms of take-all disease and sharp eyespot were observed sporadically. Significant differences were found between treatments in the severity of infections caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis on the stem-bases of triticale, and by Tapesia spp. and Rhizoctonia spp. on the stem-bases of rye."
Sustaining primary care teams in the midst of a pandemic,"The challenges wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic on health systems have tested primary care clinicians, who are on the front lines of care delivery. To ensure the longevity of the primary care workforce, strong interprofessional teams are one important solution to alleviating burnout and increasing clinician and patient satisfaction, but the pandemic has demonstrated that the operating manual needs to be adapted for virtual work. Essential principles of primary care, including preventative care, communication and collaboration, and building strong relationships, can be applied to strengthen virtual primary care teams."
The flow characteristics around bridge piers under the impact of a ship,"The complicated flow structure around the pier threatens the safe navigation of ships. This paper studies the mechanism of the flow with a ship around the pier, passing or not passing and with consideration of the interval between the ship and the pier. The flow field model and the moving ship model are constructed by the six degrees of freedom (6DOF) solver combined with the virtual unit immersed boundary method and the level set method, both of which are based on the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. The simulation results show that the ship significantly influences the flow around the pier, increasing the flow velocity by 50% to 140%. Away from the bridge pier, the cross-flow velocity decreases. The cross-flow velocity near the side of the pier also increases but in the opposite direction. The ship is affected by the negative yaw moment because of the reverse cross-flow between the pier and the ship. The size of the ship has an important impact on the extent of the affected flow areas but the velocity distribution is roughly in the same shape. The results show double impacts of ship and pier should be considered when determining the safe area of navigation."
Numerical study on the bubble dynamics in a broken confined domain,"In this paper, the dynamic characteristics of the bubble in a broken confined domain are studied. The broken confined domain is composed of a solid wall and a plate that has a hole. The axisymmetric numerical model is established by combining the Eulerian finite-element method with volume of fluid (VOF) method, and is validated by comparing the results with those from an experiment. Then the influences of the wall distance, plate distance and size of the hole are analyzed. The results show that cavity-attraction jet caused by the hole and annular jet caused by the upper solid wall compete with each other to dominate the bubble dynamics. The cavity-attraction jet develops earlier, but slower. Thus, jet load in the bubble stage is mainly generated by the annular jet with a higher impact speed. Within a certain range, the closer the hole is to the bubble or the smaller the hole, the longer the pulsation period of the bubble will be."
The effects of caudal fin deformation on the hydrodynamics of thunniform swimming under self-propulsion,"To investigate the effects of the caudal fin deformation on the hydrodynamic performance of the self-propelled thunniform swimming, we perform fluid-body interaction simulations for a tuna-like swimmer with thunniform kinematics. The 3-D vortices are visualized to reveal the role of the leading-edge vortex (LEV) in the thrust generation. By comparing the swimming velocity of the swimmer with different caudal fin flexure amplitudes fa, it is shown that the acceleration in the starting stage of the swimmer increases with the increase of fa, but its cruising velocity decreases. The results indicate that the caudal fin deformation is beneficial to the fast start but not to the fast cruising of the swimmer. During the entire swimming process, the undulation amplitudes of the lateral velocity and the yawing angular velocity decrease as fa increases. It is found that the formation of an attached LEV on the caudal fin is responsible for generating the low-pressure region on the surface of the caudal fin, which contributes to the thrust. Furthermore, the caudal fin deformation can delay the LEV shedding from the caudal fin, extending the duration of the low pressure on the caudal fin, which will cause the caudal fin to generate a drag-type force over a time period in one swimming cycle and reduce the cruising speed of the swimmer."
Crisis and Intergovernmental Retrenchment in the European Union? Framing the EU’s Answer to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has placed severe pressure on the EU’s capacity to provide a timely and coordinated response capable of curbing the pandemic’s disastrous economic and social effects on EU member states. In this situation, the supranational institutions and their models of action are evidently under pressure, seeming incapable of leading the EU out of the stormy waters of the present crisis. The article frames the first months of management of the COVID-19 crisis at EU level as characterised by the limited increase in the level of steering capacity by supranational institutions, due to the reaffirmed centrality of the intergovernmental option. To explain this situation, the article considers the absence of the institutional capacity/legitimacy to extract resources from society(ies), and the subsequent impossibility of guaranteeing an effective and autonomous process of political (re)distribution, the key factors accounting for the weakness of vertical political integration in the response to the COVID-19 challenge. This explains why during the COVID-19 crisis as well, the pattern followed by the EU is rather similar to past patterns, thus confirming that this has fed retrenchment aimed at the enforcement of the intergovernmental model and the defence of the most sensitive core state powers against inference from supranational EU institutions."
Ambulante Jugendhilfe: Ein systematisches Literatur-Review zur Arbeits- und Gesundheitssituation,"Das vielfältige Tätigkeitsfeld der Jugendhilfe im ambulanten Bereich ist von diversen – unter anderem psychischen – Einflussfaktoren geprägt, die sich auf die Gesundheit der pädagogischen Fachkräfte auswirken können."
New fractional inequalities of Hermite–Hadamard type involving the incomplete gamma functions,"A specific type of convex functions is discussed. By examining this, we investigate new Hermite–Hadamard type integral inequalities for the Riemann–Liouville fractional operators involving the generalized incomplete gamma functions. Finally, we expose some examples of special functions to support the usefulness and effectiveness of our results."
A novel reduced-dimensional dictionary grid screening strategy for SR-STAP,"The traditional space-time adaptive processing (STAP) methods require large training samples to estimate the clutter covariance matrix. Sparse recovery STAP (SR-STAP) can get a highly accurate estimation in the case of insufficient samples and it alleviates the above problem of conventional STAP methods, however, the price of SR-STAP is that it involves a huge computational load in optimization, especially when the input data size is very big. This paper proposed a novel SR-STAP dictionary construction method that can significantly improve computational efficiency. We introduce the noise grids as the supplement of the spectrum-aid methods and design a second grids screening method based on the prior spectrum information. After the process of the proposed method, the dimension of the space-time dictionary has a sharp decrease compared to the over-complete dictionary, moreover, the sparsity of variable can be maintained better than the common spectrum-aid methods. The numerical experiments verify that the proposed method not only can significantly reduce the optimization time to far smaller than the SR-STAP but also more robust than spectrum-aid methods even in the small input size."
Integrated constellation design and deployment method for a regional augmented navigation satellite system using piggyback launches,"The method proposed in this paper is adopted to solve problem B of the 9th China Trajectory Optimization Competition (CTOC). An accurate and economical constellation design strategy for regional augmented navigation satellite systems (RANSSs) has attracted a substantial amount of research interest owing to the increased demand for navigation services in complex environments. This paper proposes a hybrid method of constellation design and deployment for a RANSS to satisfy the navigation performance requirements and minimize the construction cost. First, the search spaces of the design parameters are determined by analyzing the orbital parameters of piggyback launches. Second, the constellation is designed as a combined Walker constellation and optimized by a differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Finally, optimal strategies for deploying satellites to the desired orbits are obtained using a transfer optimization design. The method was adopted to design a RANSS for servicing the 182 cities in the Asia-Pacific region. The configuration consists of five orbital planes and 80 navigation satellites and achieves a low construction cost with 10 piggyback launches. Furthermore, the constellation can cooperate with an existing navigation satellite system to further improve the navigation accuracy for all cities. The results reveal that the RANSS design and deployment problem can be effectively solved with a low construction cost and high navigation performance."
A system for probing Casimir energy corrections to the condensation energy,"In this article, we present a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) designed to detect changes in the Casimir energy. The Casimir effect is a result of the appearance of quantum fluctuations in an electromagnetic vacuum. Previous experiments have used nano- or microscale parallel plate capacitors to detect the Casimir force by measuring the small attractive force these fluctuations exert between the two surfaces. In this new set of experiments, we aim to directly detect the shifts in the Casimir energy in a vacuum due to the presence of the metallic parallel plates, one of which is a superconductor. A change in the Casimir energy of this configuration is predicted to shift the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) because of the interaction between it and the superconducting condensation energy. In our experiment, we take a superconducting film, carefully measure its transition temperature, bring a conducting plate close to the film, create a Casimir cavity, and then measure the transition temperature again. The expected shifts are smaller than the normal shifts one sees in cycling superconducting films to cryogenic temperatures, so using a NEMS resonator in situ is the only practical way to obtain accurate, reproducible data. Using a thin Pb film and opposing Au surface, we observe no shift in Tc >12 µK down to a minimum spacing of ~70 nm at zero applied magnetic field."
Micromechanical analysis of the tensile deformation behavior for 3D printed unidirectional continuous fiber reinforced thermos-plastic composites,"The aim of this study is to analysis the tensile deformation behavior of 3D printed unidirectional continuous fiber reinforced thermos-plastic composites (UD-CFRTP). Tensile experiments were performed to obtain the deformation curves and tensile properties of composites specimens. It is found that the reinforcement fiber bundles of specimens bearing the load non-synchronously. Meanwhile, with the fiber content change, the deformation form could be different. An improved micromechanical model was proposed to investigate the influence of non-synchronous phenomenon and fiber content on the deformation behavior. The fiber content is measured by the number of reinforcement fiber bundles instead of fiber volume fraction in this model. Based on this model, the deformation behavior and tensile properties of test specimens with different fiber bundles number were analyzed in detail. The analytical results about deformation behavior and tensile properties show a good agreement with experiment results."
Analysis of enhancement and impairment mechanisms of natural convection heat transfer on a vertical finned plate,"We investigated the heat transfer enhancement and impairment mechanisms of the laminar natural convection on a vertical finned plate. Numerical analyses were performed for wide ranges of Prandtl numbers 0.7–2014, Rayleigh numbers 3.69×105−8.49×1010 and fin heights 0.0025–0.5 m. Experiments were performed for a few cases for verification. Four different heat transfer mechanisms were identified: corner, core acceleration, chimney and in-flow effects. The competitions of these mechanisms depending on the fin geometries and the Prandtl number resulted in complex variations of the heat transfer. The results showed the heat transfer enhancement of maximum 6.9 % for Pr = 2014, L = 0.1 m and H = 0.015 m and impairment up to 47 % for Pr = 0.7, L = 0.1 m and H = 0.015 m compared with that of a flat plate with the same heat transfer area and baseplate length."
Swept-sine integration method for complex amplitude extraction of swept-sine signal,"Swept-sine vibration test plays a significant role in product validations. As its basic step, the accuracy and efficiency of complex amplitude (which includes the amplitude and phase information of swept-sine signal) extraction have an important impact on the performance of swept-sine vibration test. In order to improve the efficiency while ensuring its accuracy, a swept-sine integration method is proposed. The proposed swept-sine integration method, which is inspired by tracking filter method and tracking integration method, utilizes a weighted integral process to extract the complex amplitude. A numeral example is presented to compare the performance of the proposed method with several other methods for complex amplitude extraction which are also reviewed in this paper. By comparing the results of the numerical example, some light is shed on the strength of the method proposed. Afterwards, the swept-sine integration method is applied in a real test, further validating the appliance value of this method."
Mathematical modeling and process parameters optimization of ultrasonic assisted electrochemical magnetic abrasive machining,"A new machining technique called ultrasonic assisted electrochemical magnetic abrasive machining integrates ultrasonic vibrations, electrochemical machining and magnetic abrasive finishing is used to machine and finish biomaterials more efficiently as compared to single process. This investigation highlights a novel technique for machining of hard materials in order to improve machining efficiency with hybrid process. Experimental design of Taguchi L27 and TOPSIS methods are implemented to find the optimum parameters of process. The objective is to maximize MRR and PISF and minimize PCMH simultaneously. This research investigates the interaction between input parameters (rotational speed of work piece, machining time, working gap, ultrasonic frequency time and voltage) and their effect on output characteristics of process like MRR, PCMH and PISF. The recommended settings of parameters for UEMAM process is found to be rotational speed = 600 rpm, machining time = 5 minutes, working gap = 3 mm, frequency time = 4 sec and voltage = 3 V from TOPSIS and rotational speed = 600 rpm, machining time = 15 minutes, working gap = 3 mm, frequency time = 6 sec and voltage = 4.5 V from Taguchi optimization plot. A comparison of experimental results and theoretical results have been done to validate the proposed mathematical model. The calculation results of the model showed that the maximum value of error is not more than 7.351 while comparing with experimental results, which suggests that the mathematical model is reasonable."
Modal parameter identification by adaptive parameter domain with multiple genetic algorithms,"The identification of aero-engine dynamic parameters is fundamental to establishing accurate dynamic models, which has a great effect on the accuracy of model calculation. The accurate parameter range, however, is not easy to define in practical engineering applications. In many cases, it could only be constructed out of experience. In order to reduce the impact of initial parameter interval accuracy on the identification results, the adaptive parameter domain with multiple genetic algorithms is proposed to identify the aeroengine dynamic model parameters, through which the vibration modal parameter identification is studied under the condition of initial uncertainty of the parameters. The effectiveness of the adaptive parameter domain method is verified through the third-order model with severe modal coupling, which also proves the efficiency and rapidity of finding the correct value of parameters and, indicates that it would not be necessary to introduce an exact definition of the initial interval of parameters. All these suggest that the proposed multiple genetic algorithms of the adaptive parameter domain has a good reference value for engineering applications."
Nonlinear fatigue life prediction model based on material memory,"New nonlinear fatigue damage accumulation model is established on the basis of material memory theory and fatigue driving energy damage parameters to evaluate high-cycle fatigue life under multilevel variable amplitude loading. The loading interaction factor is constructed on the basis of damage degree and then the model is modified to consider the effect of loading interaction on fatigue damage accumulation. The two proposed models are convenient for calculation and have only two parameters that can be easily identified through experiments. In accordance with the test data of aluminum alloy Al-2024-T42, titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V, nodular cast iron GS61, Q235B welded joint, and hot-rolled 16Mn steel, the two models developed in this study have been verified to predict fatigue life effectively. For multilevel loading, the modified model achieves higher prediction accuracy and its results are closer to the actual test data compared with those of the other models."
Finite element analysis of eyeball with its microstructure by use of homogenization method,"An effective simulation of the eyeball containing microstructures which are optic nerves and lamina cribrosa, through homogenization method, was studied. Entire domain of the eyeball is divided into a fine-scale zone and a coarse-scale zone to reduce the number of degrees of freedom accompanied by modeling the microstructures. In the coarse-scale zone, homogenized material properties of the lamina cribrosa combined with the optic nerves are employed to compute overall behavior, while the optic nerves are directly modeled to obtain their local behavior in the fine-scale zone. Numerical tests with models having different size of the fine-scale zone showed that this homogenization scheme did not severely deteriorate solution accuracy and makes it possible to reflect the microstructures with reduced computational cost. Then, this multiscale method was employed to confirm a clinical result that a greater susceptibility to development of glaucoma corresponds to a larger curvature of the lamina cribrosa."
Generalized comparative analysis of crosshead-free and crosshead schemes of piston hybrid power machines,"A generalized analysis of crosshead and crosshead-free piston hybrid power machine (PHPM) is conducted in this research. A comparison of these machines was carried out experimentally by using two created experimental samples for comparison with practically the same working volumes of the compressor and pump sections, crosshead, and crosshead-free piston hybrid power machines. The comparison was performed within the framework of the following units: thermodynamic unit, dynamic unit, comparison unit for weight and size indicators, comparison unit for reliability and durability, comparison unit for the manufacturing technology, and the provision of gaps in the cylinder-piston group. Results of the experimental data were compared in the thermodynamic comparison unit in terms of cooling the compressor section, flow coefficient and its components, volumetric efficiency of the pump section, and cavitation margin. Comparison results show that the temperature of the cylinder-piston group and, in particular, the temperature of the valve body and of the suction gas of the crosshead-free PHPM is lower than those of the crosshead PHPM; the indicator isothermal efficiency of the crosshead-free PHPM is higher than that of the crosshead PHPM; and the volumetric efficiency for a cross-head-free PHPM is 5 %–10 % higher than that for a crosshead PHPM. The comparison of the acting forces and torques of the crosshead and crosshead-free PHPM established that the crosshead PHPM has better dynamic characteristics in terms of maximum effective force and torque unevenness. Moreover, the PHPM crosshead-free scheme has better overall characteristics."
Temperature impact analysis of star gear bearing inner ring based on under-race lubrication passage,"In order to reduce the inner ring temperature and the oil consumption, temperature impact of star gear bearing inner ring based on under-race lubrication passage is analyzed, the flow and temperature fields of the inner ring are simulated using the realizable k-ε turbulence model based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, and experimental verification is performed. The results indicate that adding annular grooves to the star gear cylindrical roller bearing has a significant impact in reducing the temperature of the inner ring, and annular grooves with different cross-sectional sizes have different impacts in reducing the temperature of the inner ring. When the cross-sectional area of the annular grooves is 5 × 1.5 mm, the temperatures of the inner raceway of the left and right bearing decrease from 123.95 and 111.98 °C to 104.3 and 101.4 °C, respectively."
A combined cold extrusion for a drive shaft: experimental assessment on dimensional compatibility,"A combined cold extrusion process is experimentally visualized to manufacture a drive shaft. Due to the requirements of a face width of about 92.00 mm for the spur gear section and a groove depth of roughly 22.70 mm for the internal spline region, a preform is adopted to prevent excessive accumulation of plastic deformation. AISI 1035 medium carbon steel material is spheroidized and annealed to use as the initial billet workpiece. In order to verify the deformed configuration and the dimensional accuracy, both shoulder angles of (θ1, θ2) are selected to be (30°, 30°) and (45°, 45°) on each extrusion die for the preform forging and the combined extrusion. Using the prepared tool components, experimental investigations on the dimensional relevancy of the cold forged drive shaft are performed. When the shoulder angle set of (30°, 30°) is applied, the required dimensions with respect to the face width and the groove depth are sufficiently satisfied, but unpredictable forging defects are observed. With the shoulder angles of (45°, 45°), the drive shaft is well deformed and fabricated without any cold forging defects. As a result, it is confirmed that the drive shaft can successfully be actualized with the dimensional precision satisfied by the combined cold extrusion."
Recursive least squares based sliding mode approach for position control of DC motors with self-tuning rule,"In this paper, a self-tuning rule-based position control algorithm is proposed for DC motors with system parameter estimation using the recursive least squares method. First, a mathematical model of the angular position control of a DC motor was derived. Next, the time-varying parameters including the rotational inertia in the model were estimated using the RLS method along with multiple forgetting factors without prior knowledge of the system. Based on the derived model and the parameter estimation, a sliding mode control algorithm was designed by applying a self-tuning rule that enables the magnitude of the voltage input to be adaptively adjusted for improvement of the energy efficiency. The performance of the designed control algorithm was then experimentally evaluated under several different load conditions. Finally, the evaluation results show that the designed controller achieves a satisfactory capability for a DC motor to deal with both tracking accuracy and energy efficiency without prior knowledge of the system."
Experimental investigation on the deflection of a serpentine spring machined by WEDM,"A kind of micro serpentine spring by wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) is selected as research object, and the bending deformation mechanism of serpentine spring during cutting was discussed. Then a method of reducing the bending deformation of the micro serpentine spring was studied. The results demonstrate that the resultant force of the serpentine spring is attractive force. The degree of deformation is closely related to the material and the deformation of pure copper is smallest, so it is also a good choice to choose alternative materials. The deformation angle of the serpentine spring was reduced from 16.2° to 3.6° by establishing the supporting structure, changing the cutting trajectory, using multi-cutting and stress relief annealing methods. The bending deformation of the serpentine spring was significantly improved, which provided a new method for the processing of mechanical micro structures or devices."
Immunological biomarkers of the vitreous responsible for proliferative alteration in the different forms of retinal detachment,The purpose of the study was to explore the immunological components that are responsible for the proliferative alterations in the different forms of retinal detachment (RD).
The analysis of freshwater pearl mussel shells using µ-XRF (micro-x-ray fluorescence) and the applicability for environmental reconstruction,"Freshwater pearl mussel is a highly threatened species, and many populations are currently on the brink of local extinction. For example, in south Finland, only two populations are currently viable. Even though the reasons for the mussels’ demise are relatively well known, the long-term impacts of water quality are not completely resolved. Here, µ-XRF analysis and historical records were used to evaluate whether the differences in water chemistry or past environmental changes in three rivers in southern Finland are visible in mussel shell chemistry. The results show that the cracks inside mussel shells, invisible to the naked eye, may greatly affect the elemental composition results. Further, anomalies which could be related to inclusion of detrital matter inside the shells were detected. Manganese (Mn) seems to be related to mussel growth dynamics, especially in the nacreous layer, while high values of iron (Fe) and Mn are also present at the top sections of the prismatic layer. Line scan analysis revealed high variation between replicates. The µ-XRF method could be used as prescreening method in mussel sclerochemistry studies, but more studies are needed to clarify the ability of FPM shells to reliably record the environmental conditions."
Impacts of electricity generation on air pollution: evidence from data on air quality index and six criteria pollutants,"We estimate impacts of electricity generation (total power output and thermal power output) on air pollution (air quality index (AQI) and six criteria air pollutants), with a particular emphasis on industry and city heterogeneity. To identify this relationship, we combine detailed monthly data on electricity production, air pollution, economy and weather for a six-year period in four biggest cities in China. Our fundamental identification strategy employs Ordinary Least Squares Regression of panel data with city–month fixed effects and addresses confounding variations between electricity generation and economy or weather conditions. We find that one unit (100 million kwh) increase in power output is associated with a 0.3-unit (representing value) increase in AQI, nearly all of which is driven by increases in thermal power output. We notice a robust positive impact of increased electricity generation (specifically thermal power output) on PM2.5 and PM10, also positive relationships between increases in other power output (total power output minus thermal power output) and SO2, NO2, while changes in power output have no statistically significant effect on CO and O3. The heterogeneous pollution effects of electricity generation are present in specific cities with different weather conditions. The results indicate that a reduction policy in power industry differentiating among cities might enhance effectiveness by considering each city’s particular backgrounds, a previously overlooked aspect associated with pollution reduction policies."

New butyrolactone derivatives from the endophytic Fungus Talaromyces sp. CPCC 400783 of Reynoutria japonica Houtt,"Six new butyrolactone derivatives (1, 2a/2b, 3a/3b and 4), together with another two known derivatives (5 and 6) were isolated from the endophytic fungus Talaromyces sp. CPCC 400783. Their structures were established by a combination of spectroscopic analysis, including NMR and HRESIMS. The absolute configurations were elucidated by ECD experiments. Subsequently, compound 1, 3b, 4 and 5 exhibited good inhibitory effect against influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus with IC50 values of 21.93 ± 1.51, 21.54 ± 3.75, 18.36 ± 2.15 and 23.80 ± 3.05 μM respectively."
"Antimicrobial properties of diethylamine NONOate, a nitric oxide donor, against Escherichia coli: a pilot study","The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, highlights the increasing need for new and effective antiviral and antimicrobial agents. The FDA has recently banned several active ingredients used in hand sanitizers, including triclosan and benzethonium chloride. Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the innate immune response and is a major component of macrophage-mediated attack on foreign viruses and bacteria. The specific aim of this study was to assess the antibacterial effects of 2-(N,N-diethylamino)-diazenolate-2-oxide (DEA-NONOate) against Escherichia coli (E. coli). A bacterial growth assay was compared to an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) activity assay at various time points to assess effects of DEA-NONOate on E. coli growth. A UV/Vis spectrophotometer was used to determine concentration of E. coli by measuring optical density (OD) at 630 nm. A luminescent assay was used to measure ATP activity correlating to viable cells. DEA-NONOate at a concentration of 65 mM was able to inhibit the growth of E. coli with the same efficacy as 1 μg ml−1 concentration of ciprofloxacin. Both the OD and ATP assays demonstrated a 99.9% reduction in E. coli. Both a 1 μg ml−1 concentration of ciprofloxacin and a 65 mM concentration of DEA-NONOate achieved 99.9% inhibition of E. coli, verified using both optical density measurement of bacterial cultures in 96 well plates and a luminescent ATP activity assay. The bactericidal effects of DEA-NONOate against E. coli is proof-of-concept to pursue evaluation of nitric oxide-based formulations as antimicrobial and antiviral agents as hand sanitizers."
Aktuelle Ist-Analyse zur Situation des nichttraumatologischen Schockraummanagements in Deutschland,"In Notaufnahmen kommen bundesweit nichttraumatologische kritisch kranke Patienten zur Aufnahme. Zur Struktur, Organisation und Ausstattung des nichttraumatologischen Schockraummanagements ist bisher wenig bekannt. Mittels einer Umfrage sollte daher der Ist-Zustand analysiert werden."
Swept-sine integration method for complex amplitude extraction of swept-sine signal,"Swept-sine vibration test plays a significant role in product validations. As its basic step, the accuracy and efficiency of complex amplitude (which includes the amplitude and phase information of swept-sine signal) extraction have an important impact on the performance of swept-sine vibration test. In order to improve the efficiency while ensuring its accuracy, a swept-sine integration method is proposed. The proposed swept-sine integration method, which is inspired by tracking filter method and tracking integration method, utilizes a weighted integral process to extract the complex amplitude. A numeral example is presented to compare the performance of the proposed method with several other methods for complex amplitude extraction which are also reviewed in this paper. By comparing the results of the numerical example, some light is shed on the strength of the method proposed. Afterwards, the swept-sine integration method is applied in a real test, further validating the appliance value of this method."
Mathematical modeling and process parameters optimization of ultrasonic assisted electrochemical magnetic abrasive machining,"A new machining technique called ultrasonic assisted electrochemical magnetic abrasive machining integrates ultrasonic vibrations, electrochemical machining and magnetic abrasive finishing is used to machine and finish biomaterials more efficiently as compared to single process. This investigation highlights a novel technique for machining of hard materials in order to improve machining efficiency with hybrid process. Experimental design of Taguchi L27 and TOPSIS methods are implemented to find the optimum parameters of process. The objective is to maximize MRR and PISF and minimize PCMH simultaneously. This research investigates the interaction between input parameters (rotational speed of work piece, machining time, working gap, ultrasonic frequency time and voltage) and their effect on output characteristics of process like MRR, PCMH and PISF. The recommended settings of parameters for UEMAM process is found to be rotational speed = 600 rpm, machining time = 5 minutes, working gap = 3 mm, frequency time = 4 sec and voltage = 3 V from TOPSIS and rotational speed = 600 rpm, machining time = 15 minutes, working gap = 3 mm, frequency time = 6 sec and voltage = 4.5 V from Taguchi optimization plot. A comparison of experimental results and theoretical results have been done to validate the proposed mathematical model. The calculation results of the model showed that the maximum value of error is not more than 7.351 while comparing with experimental results, which suggests that the mathematical model is reasonable."
Modal parameter identification by adaptive parameter domain with multiple genetic algorithms,"The identification of aero-engine dynamic parameters is fundamental to establishing accurate dynamic models, which has a great effect on the accuracy of model calculation. The accurate parameter range, however, is not easy to define in practical engineering applications. In many cases, it could only be constructed out of experience. In order to reduce the impact of initial parameter interval accuracy on the identification results, the adaptive parameter domain with multiple genetic algorithms is proposed to identify the aeroengine dynamic model parameters, through which the vibration modal parameter identification is studied under the condition of initial uncertainty of the parameters. The effectiveness of the adaptive parameter domain method is verified through the third-order model with severe modal coupling, which also proves the efficiency and rapidity of finding the correct value of parameters and, indicates that it would not be necessary to introduce an exact definition of the initial interval of parameters. All these suggest that the proposed multiple genetic algorithms of the adaptive parameter domain has a good reference value for engineering applications."
A combined cold extrusion for a drive shaft: experimental assessment on dimensional compatibility,"A combined cold extrusion process is experimentally visualized to manufacture a drive shaft. Due to the requirements of a face width of about 92.00 mm for the spur gear section and a groove depth of roughly 22.70 mm for the internal spline region, a preform is adopted to prevent excessive accumulation of plastic deformation. AISI 1035 medium carbon steel material is spheroidized and annealed to use as the initial billet workpiece. In order to verify the deformed configuration and the dimensional accuracy, both shoulder angles of (θ1, θ2) are selected to be (30°, 30°) and (45°, 45°) on each extrusion die for the preform forging and the combined extrusion. Using the prepared tool components, experimental investigations on the dimensional relevancy of the cold forged drive shaft are performed. When the shoulder angle set of (30°, 30°) is applied, the required dimensions with respect to the face width and the groove depth are sufficiently satisfied, but unpredictable forging defects are observed. With the shoulder angles of (45°, 45°), the drive shaft is well deformed and fabricated without any cold forging defects. As a result, it is confirmed that the drive shaft can successfully be actualized with the dimensional precision satisfied by the combined cold extrusion."
Nonlinear fatigue life prediction model based on material memory,"New nonlinear fatigue damage accumulation model is established on the basis of material memory theory and fatigue driving energy damage parameters to evaluate high-cycle fatigue life under multilevel variable amplitude loading. The loading interaction factor is constructed on the basis of damage degree and then the model is modified to consider the effect of loading interaction on fatigue damage accumulation. The two proposed models are convenient for calculation and have only two parameters that can be easily identified through experiments. In accordance with the test data of aluminum alloy Al-2024-T42, titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V, nodular cast iron GS61, Q235B welded joint, and hot-rolled 16Mn steel, the two models developed in this study have been verified to predict fatigue life effectively. For multilevel loading, the modified model achieves higher prediction accuracy and its results are closer to the actual test data compared with those of the other models."
Generalized comparative analysis of crosshead-free and crosshead schemes of piston hybrid power machines,"A generalized analysis of crosshead and crosshead-free piston hybrid power machine (PHPM) is conducted in this research. A comparison of these machines was carried out experimentally by using two created experimental samples for comparison with practically the same working volumes of the compressor and pump sections, crosshead, and crosshead-free piston hybrid power machines. The comparison was performed within the framework of the following units: thermodynamic unit, dynamic unit, comparison unit for weight and size indicators, comparison unit for reliability and durability, comparison unit for the manufacturing technology, and the provision of gaps in the cylinder-piston group. Results of the experimental data were compared in the thermodynamic comparison unit in terms of cooling the compressor section, flow coefficient and its components, volumetric efficiency of the pump section, and cavitation margin. Comparison results show that the temperature of the cylinder-piston group and, in particular, the temperature of the valve body and of the suction gas of the crosshead-free PHPM is lower than those of the crosshead PHPM; the indicator isothermal efficiency of the crosshead-free PHPM is higher than that of the crosshead PHPM; and the volumetric efficiency for a cross-head-free PHPM is 5 %–10 % higher than that for a crosshead PHPM. The comparison of the acting forces and torques of the crosshead and crosshead-free PHPM established that the crosshead PHPM has better dynamic characteristics in terms of maximum effective force and torque unevenness. Moreover, the PHPM crosshead-free scheme has better overall characteristics."
Recursive least squares based sliding mode approach for position control of DC motors with self-tuning rule,"In this paper, a self-tuning rule-based position control algorithm is proposed for DC motors with system parameter estimation using the recursive least squares method. First, a mathematical model of the angular position control of a DC motor was derived. Next, the time-varying parameters including the rotational inertia in the model were estimated using the RLS method along with multiple forgetting factors without prior knowledge of the system. Based on the derived model and the parameter estimation, a sliding mode control algorithm was designed by applying a self-tuning rule that enables the magnitude of the voltage input to be adaptively adjusted for improvement of the energy efficiency. The performance of the designed control algorithm was then experimentally evaluated under several different load conditions. Finally, the evaluation results show that the designed controller achieves a satisfactory capability for a DC motor to deal with both tracking accuracy and energy efficiency without prior knowledge of the system."
Experimental investigation on the deflection of a serpentine spring machined by WEDM,"A kind of micro serpentine spring by wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) is selected as research object, and the bending deformation mechanism of serpentine spring during cutting was discussed. Then a method of reducing the bending deformation of the micro serpentine spring was studied. The results demonstrate that the resultant force of the serpentine spring is attractive force. The degree of deformation is closely related to the material and the deformation of pure copper is smallest, so it is also a good choice to choose alternative materials. The deformation angle of the serpentine spring was reduced from 16.2° to 3.6° by establishing the supporting structure, changing the cutting trajectory, using multi-cutting and stress relief annealing methods. The bending deformation of the serpentine spring was significantly improved, which provided a new method for the processing of mechanical micro structures or devices."
Finite element analysis of eyeball with its microstructure by use of homogenization method,"An effective simulation of the eyeball containing microstructures which are optic nerves and lamina cribrosa, through homogenization method, was studied. Entire domain of the eyeball is divided into a fine-scale zone and a coarse-scale zone to reduce the number of degrees of freedom accompanied by modeling the microstructures. In the coarse-scale zone, homogenized material properties of the lamina cribrosa combined with the optic nerves are employed to compute overall behavior, while the optic nerves are directly modeled to obtain their local behavior in the fine-scale zone. Numerical tests with models having different size of the fine-scale zone showed that this homogenization scheme did not severely deteriorate solution accuracy and makes it possible to reflect the microstructures with reduced computational cost. Then, this multiscale method was employed to confirm a clinical result that a greater susceptibility to development of glaucoma corresponds to a larger curvature of the lamina cribrosa."
Temperature impact analysis of star gear bearing inner ring based on under-race lubrication passage,"In order to reduce the inner ring temperature and the oil consumption, temperature impact of star gear bearing inner ring based on under-race lubrication passage is analyzed, the flow and temperature fields of the inner ring are simulated using the realizable k-ε turbulence model based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, and experimental verification is performed. The results indicate that adding annular grooves to the star gear cylindrical roller bearing has a significant impact in reducing the temperature of the inner ring, and annular grooves with different cross-sectional sizes have different impacts in reducing the temperature of the inner ring. When the cross-sectional area of the annular grooves is 5 × 1.5 mm, the temperatures of the inner raceway of the left and right bearing decrease from 123.95 and 111.98 °C to 104.3 and 101.4 °C, respectively."
Micromechanical analysis of the tensile deformation behavior for 3D printed unidirectional continuous fiber reinforced thermos-plastic composites,"The aim of this study is to analysis the tensile deformation behavior of 3D printed unidirectional continuous fiber reinforced thermos-plastic composites (UD-CFRTP). Tensile experiments were performed to obtain the deformation curves and tensile properties of composites specimens. It is found that the reinforcement fiber bundles of specimens bearing the load non-synchronously. Meanwhile, with the fiber content change, the deformation form could be different. An improved micromechanical model was proposed to investigate the influence of non-synchronous phenomenon and fiber content on the deformation behavior. The fiber content is measured by the number of reinforcement fiber bundles instead of fiber volume fraction in this model. Based on this model, the deformation behavior and tensile properties of test specimens with different fiber bundles number were analyzed in detail. The analytical results about deformation behavior and tensile properties show a good agreement with experiment results."
Analysis of enhancement and impairment mechanisms of natural convection heat transfer on a vertical finned plate,"We investigated the heat transfer enhancement and impairment mechanisms of the laminar natural convection on a vertical finned plate. Numerical analyses were performed for wide ranges of Prandtl numbers 0.7–2014, Rayleigh numbers 3.69×105−8.49×1010 and fin heights 0.0025–0.5 m. Experiments were performed for a few cases for verification. Four different heat transfer mechanisms were identified: corner, core acceleration, chimney and in-flow effects. The competitions of these mechanisms depending on the fin geometries and the Prandtl number resulted in complex variations of the heat transfer. The results showed the heat transfer enhancement of maximum 6.9 % for Pr = 2014, L = 0.1 m and H = 0.015 m and impairment up to 47 % for Pr = 0.7, L = 0.1 m and H = 0.015 m compared with that of a flat plate with the same heat transfer area and baseplate length."
Suppressing the surface passivation of Pt-Mo nanowires via constructing Mo-Se coordination for boosting HER performance,"Modulating the surface coordination environment of Pt based nanocrystals at the atomic level is of great importance to obtain good electrocatalytic performance. Given the fundamental understandings of surface structure degeneration of Pt based nanocrystals, introducing a weak electronegative element to the surface of Pt-based catalysts is beneficial for suppressing surface passivation and improving hydrogen evolution reaction performance of Pt. Density functional theory results reveal that the energy barrier of water dissociation process can be greatly reduced by using Se element as the surface modifier to replace the O. This hypothesis is further validated by experiments that ultralong Pt85Mo15-Se nanowires were fabricated to suppress the excessive passivation behavior of transition metals of Pt based alloy. The Pt85Mo15-Se nanowires exhibit higher activity with 4.98 times the specific activity and 4.87 times the mass activity of commercial Pt/C, as well as a better stability towards alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. The deep exploration of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations disclose that Se element could maintain the electron-rich state around the electronic orbit of Pt. This study provides a new insight to advance the fundamental understanding on electrocatalytic materials, which exhibits a promising approach to protect the surface chemical environment of Pt based nanocrystals."
Soil-Chronological Studies and GIS-Modeling of Formation and Evolution of Soils on the Crimean Peninsula,"The methodological basis for the research of soils of various ages, which are formed on dated archaeological objects of the Crimean Peninsula, is considered. The application of soil-chronological studies for the solution of applied problems of soil formation—genesis, formation, and evolution of soils under modern conditions—is substantiated. The results of time mathematical and geoinformation modeling of soil formation, its energy expenditures, and rates are given."
Climate Dynamics and the History of Soil Formation in the Steppe Zone of Eastern Europe in the Holocene,"The results of the study of paleosols of different ages buried under kurgan mounds allowed specific features of soil evolution to be determined, and a reconstruction of the climate dynamics in the steppe zone of Eastern Europe over the second half of the Holocene. It has been shown that over the past 6000 years, this area has undergone repeated changes in climatic conditions, causing variations in the boundaries of soil-geographical zones. Humid conditions of the Atlantic period of the Holocene existed until the end of the 4th millennium BC; after that, a trend towards a gradual increase in aridity and soil salinization began. The maximum aridity was at the turn of the 2nd millennium BC. This was followed by several periods of increasing humidity and soil desalinization in the 18th–15th and the 5th–4th centuries BC, interrupted by stages of aridization, erosion, carbonate accumulation, and salinization."
Seismicity of the 2020 ML3.1 Haenam earthquake and its sequence in South Korea,"Recently an earthquake sequence occurred in Haenam, southwestern part of the Korean Peninsula. Earthquake swarms are not unusual in the western region of Korea, which already experienced comparable series of earthquakes before the Haenam earthquake: in the Boryeong offshore (2013) and Baekryeong Island (2013 and 2019) regions. The ML 3.1 earthquake occurred 21km WNW of Haenam on May 3, 2020 and the earthquake sequence occurred from April 26 to May 9 intensively. For two weeks, a dozen small foreshocks preceded the mainshock and more aftershocks occurred. In this paper, relocation of events with focal mechanisms based on the seismicity of the 2020 Haenam earthquake sequence is proposed. The distribution of earthquake sequence in Haenam area is WNW-ESE direction, which is approximately parallel to the fault plane solutions of events with ML ≥ 2.0 indicating strike-slip faults. The sequential events concentrate within the elliptical area of about 0.18 km2 on the surface and the focal depth distributions show some variations between 19.6 km and 21.6 km for different velocity models but their ranges are within about 500–600 m. The depth variations for different models can be due to the different boundary depths between upper and lower crusts. Based on a comparison of the earthquake swarms in the western region of the Korean Peninsula, this study provides seismological information for understanding the seismotectonic structures in the Korean Peninsula."
"The Ordovician succession of the Taebaek Group (Korea) revisited: old conodont data, new perspectives, and implications","We recompiled available Ordovician conodont data from previous studies for the Taebaek Group of the Taebaeksan Basin, Korea, based on the recently revised Ordovician conodont biostratigraphic scheme for North China. The recompiled Ordovician Taebaek Group conodont data conform well with the middle Tremadocian, lower Floian, and middle Darriwilian biozones of North China. The overall conodont distribution patterns, the occurrence of endemic species found only in North China, and the presence of an Upper Ordovician hiatus reaffirms the close relationship of the Taebaeksan Basin to the North China (Sino-Korean) Block. In addition, the absence of middle Floian to lower Darriwilian conodonts in the Taebaek Group and sudden appearance of abundant middle Darriwilian conodonts raises the possibility of the presence of a hiatus in the Lower Ordovician of the Taebaek Group. The possible disconformity may be located at the uppermost contact of the massive dolostone interval (the basal member) of the Makgol Formation. Lithologic evidence for the discontinuity includes the presence of local brecciation and oversized vuggy pores immediately below the contact and that of numerous dolomitic clasts above the contact."
Effect of Membrane Environment on the Ligand-Binding Properties of the Terminal Oxidase Cytochrome bd-I from Escherichia coli,"Cytochrome bd-I is a terminal oxidase of the Escherichia coli respiratory chain. This integral membrane protein contains three redox-active prosthetic groups (hemes b558, b595, and d) and couples the electron transfer from quinol to molecular oxygen to the generation of proton motive force, as one of its important physiological functions. The study was aimed at examining the effect of the membrane environment on the ligand-binding properties of cytochrome bd-I by absorption spectroscopy. The membrane environment was found to modulate the ligand-binding characteristics of the hemoprotein in both oxidized and reduced states. Absorption changes upon the addition of exogenous ligands, such as cyanide or carbon monoxide (CO), to the detergent-solubilized enzyme were much more significant and heterogeneous than those observed with the membrane-bound enzyme. In the native membranes, both cyanide and CO interacted mainly with heme d. An additional ligand-binding site (heme b558) appeared in the isolated enzyme, as was evidenced by more pronounced changes in the absorption in the Soret band. This additional reactivity could also be detected after treatment of E. coli membranes with a detergent. The observed effect did not result from the enzyme denaturation, since reconstitution of the isolated enzyme into azolectin liposomes restored the ligand-binding pattern close to that observed for the intact membranes."
"Unmet Medical Needs Among Adults Who Move due to Unaffordable Housing: California Health Interview Survey, 2011–2017","Stable, affordable housing is an established determinant of health. As affordable housing shortages across the USA threaten to displace people from their homes, it is important to understand the implications of cost-related residential moves for healthcare access."
Extracting the phase distribution of the electron wave packet ionized by an elliptically polarized laser pulse,"We use an interferometic scheme to extract the phase distribution of the electron wave packet from above-threshold ionization in elliptically polarized laser fields. In this scheme, an electron wave packet released from a circularly polarized laser pulse acts as a reference wave and interferes with the electron wave packet ionized by a time-delayed counter-rotating elliptically polarized laser field. The generated vortex-shaped interference pattern in the photoelectron momentum distribution enables us to extract the phase distribution of the electron wave packet in the elliptically polarized laser pulse with high precision. By artificially screening the ionic potential at different ranges when solving the time-dependent Schördinger equation, we find that the angle-dependent phase distribution of the electron wave packet in the elliptically polarized laser field shows an obvious angular shift as compared to the strong-field approximation, whose value is the same as the attoclock shift. We also show that the amplitude of the angle-dependent phase distribution is sensitive to the ellipticity of the laser pulse, providing an alternative way to precisely calibrate the laser ellipticity in the attoclock measurement."
Evolving Role of Immunotherapy in Metastatic Castration Refractory Prostate Cancer,"Immunotherapies have shown remarkable success in the treatment of multiple cancer types; however, despite encouraging preclinical activity, registration trials of immunotherapy in prostate cancer have largely been unsuccessful. Sipuleucel-T remains the only approved immunotherapy for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer based on modest improvement in overall survival. This immune evasion in the case of prostate cancer has been attributed to tumor-intrinsic factors, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and host factors, which ultimately make it an inert ‘cold’ tumor. Recently, multiple approaches have been investigated to turn prostate cancer into a ‘hot’ tumor. Antibodies directed against programmed cell death protein 1 have a tumor agnostic approval for a small minority of patients with microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair-deficient metastatic prostate cancer. Herein, we present an overview of the current immunotherapy landscape in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with a focus on immune checkpoint inhibitors. We describe the results of clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; either as single agents or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, novel hormonal therapies, chemotherapies, and radioligands. Finally, we review upcoming immunotherapies, including novel monoclonal antibodies, chimeric-antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, Bi-Specific T cell Engagers (BiTEs), therapies targeting the adenosine pathway, and other miscellaneous agents."
Sensitivity of direct detection experiments to neutrino magnetic dipole moments,"With large active volume sizes dark matter direct detection experiments are sensitive to solar neutrino fluxes. Nuclear recoil signals are induced by 8B neutrinos, while electron recoils are mainly generated by the pp flux. Measurements of both processes offer an opportunity to test neutrino properties at low thresholds with fairly low backgrounds. In this paper we study the sensitivity of these experiments to neutrino magnetic dipole moments assuming 1, 10 and 40 tonne active volumes (representative of XENON1T, XENONnT and DARWIN), 0.3 keV and 1 keV thresholds. We show that with nuclear recoil measurements alone a 40 tonne detector could be as competitive as Borexino, TEXONO and GEMMA, with sensitivities of order 8.0 × 10−11 μB at the 90% CL after one year of data taking. Electron recoil measurements will increase sensitivities way below these values allowing to test regions not excluded by astrophysical arguments. Using electron recoil data and depending on performance, the same detector will be able to explore values down to 4.0 × 10−12μB at the 90% CL in one year of data taking. By assuming a 200-tonne liquid xenon detector operating during 10 years, we conclude that sensitivities in this type of detectors will be of order 10−12 μB. Reducing statistical uncertainties may enable improving sensitivities below these values."
Surface defects on E-string from 5-brane webs,"We study 6d E-string theory with defects on a circle. Our basic strategy is to apply the geometric transition to the supersymmetric gauge theories. First, we calculate the partition functions of the 5d SU(3)0 gauge theory with 10 flavors, which is UV-dual to the 5d Sp(2) gauge theory with 10 flavors, based on two different 5-brane web diagrams, and check that two partition functions agree with each other. Then, by utilizing the geometric transition, we find the surface defect partition function for E-string on ℝ4 × T2. We also discuss that our result is consistent with the elliptic genus. Based on the result, we show how the global symmetry is broken by the defects, and discuss that the breaking pattern depends on where/how we insert the defects."
A note on the \( \mathcal{N} \) = 2 super-\( {\mathcal{W}}_3 \) holographic dictionary,"This is a long-overdue companion paper to [1]. We study the relation between sl(3|2) Chern-Simons supergravity on AdS3 and two-dimensional CFT’s with \( \mathcal{N} \) = 2 super-\( {\mathcal{W}}_3 \) symmetry. Specifically, we carry out a complete analysis of asymptotic symmetries in a basis that makes the superconformal structure transparent, allowing us to establish the precise dictionary between currents and transformation parameters in the bulk and their boundary counterparts. We also discuss the incorporation of sources and display in full detail the corresponding holographic Ward identities. By imposing suitable hermiticity conditions on the CFT currents, we identify the superalgebra su(2, 1|1, 1) as the appropriate real form of sl(3|2) in Lorentzian signature. We take the opportunity to review some of the properties of the \( \mathcal{N} \) = 2 super-\( {\mathcal{W}}_3 \) conformal algebra, including its multiplet structure, OPE’s and spectral flow invariance, correcting some minor typos present in the literature."
Prospects of non-resonant di-Higgs searches and Higgs boson self-coupling measurement at the HE-LHC using machine learning techniques,"The prospects of observing the non-resonant di-Higgs production in the Standard Model at the proposed high energy upgrade of the LHC, viz. the HE-LHC (\( \sqrt{s} \) = 27 TeV and ℒ = 15 ab−1) is studied. Various di-Higgs final states are considered based on their cleanliness and production rates. The search for the non-resonant double Higgs production at the HE-LHC is performed in the \( b\overline{b}\gamma \gamma \), \( b\overline{b}{\tau}^{+}{\tau}^{-} \), \( b\overline{b}{WW}^{\ast } \), WW∗γγ, \( b\overline{b}{ZZ}^{\ast } \) and \( b\overline{b}{\mu}^{+}{\mu}^{-} \) channels. The signal-background discrimination is performed through multivariate analyses using the Boosted Decision Tree Decorrelated (BDTD) algorithm in the TMVA framework, the XGBoost toolkit and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The variation in the kinematics of Higgs pair production as a function of the self-coupling of the Higgs boson, λh, is also studied. The ramifications of varying λh on the \( b\overline{b}\gamma \gamma \), \( b\overline{b}{\tau}^{+}{\tau}^{-} \) and \( b\overline{b}{WW}^{\ast } \) search analyses optimized for the SM hypothesis is also explored."
Cutoff AdS3 versus \( T\overline{T} \) CFT2 in the large central charge sector: correlators of energy-momentum tensor,"In this article we probe the proposed holographic duality between \( T\overline{T} \) deformed two dimensional conformal field theory and the gravity theory of AdS3 with a Dirichlet cutoff by computing correlators of energy-momentum tensor. We focus on the large central charge sector of the \( T\overline{T} \) CFT in a Euclidean plane and a sphere, and compute the correlators of energy-momentum tensor using an operator identity promoted from the classical trace relation. The result agrees with a computation of classical pure gravity in Euclidean AdS3 with the corresponding cutoff surface, given a holographic dictionary which identifies gravity parameters with \( T\overline{T} \) CFT parameters."
Topological operators and completeness of spectrum in discrete gauge theories,"In many gauge theories, the existence of particles in every representation of the gauge group (also known as completeness of the spectrum) is equivalent to the absence of one-form global symmetries. However, this relation does not hold, for example, in the gauge theory of non-abelian finite groups. We refine this statement by considering topological operators that are not necessarily associated with any global symmetry. For discrete gauge theory in three spacetime dimensions, we show that completeness of the spectrum is equivalent to the absence of certain Gukov-Witten topological operators. We further extend our analysis to four and higher spacetime dimensions. Since topological operators are natural generalizations of global symmetries, we discuss evidence for their absence in a consistent theory of quantum gravity."
"Dapagliflozin effects on haematocrit, red blood cell count and reticulocytes in insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes","Recent studies have shown that high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have improved cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. In an exploratory analysis of data from the EMPA-REG study, elevations in haematocrit were shown to be strongly associated with beneficial CV effects. As insulin treatment has been shown to be antinatriuretic, with an associated increase in extracellular fluid volume, it is important to confirm whether haematocrit increase is maintained with concomitant insulin therapy. Here, we investigate the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on haematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) counts and reticulocyte levels in high-risk patients with T2DM receiving insulin. A 24-week, double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00673231) was reported previously with extension periods of 24 and 56 weeks (total of 104 weeks). Patients receiving insulin were randomised 1:1:1:1 to placebo or dapagliflozin at 2.5, 5 or 10 mg. Haematocrit, RBC and reticulocyte measurements were conducted during this study, and a longitudinal repeated-measures analysis was performed here to examine change from baseline during treatment. Dapagliflozin treatment in combination with insulin resulted in a dose-dependent increase in haematocrit levels and RBCs over a 104 week period. There was a short-term increase in reticulocyte levels at the start of treatment, which dropped to below baseline after 8 weeks. SGLT2 inhibition with dapagliflozin leads to a sustained increase in haematocrit in patients receiving chronic insulin treatment."
The association between ADHD and physical health: a co-twin control study,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been associated with increased risk for physical comorbidity. This study used a twin cohort to investigate the association between physical diseases and phenotypic variations of ADHD. A twin cohort enriched for ADHD and other neurodevelopmental conditions were analysed. The Attention Problems subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist/Adult Behavior Checklist (CBCL/ABCL-AP) was used to measure the participants’ severity of ADHD symptoms. Physical health issues were obtained with a validated questionnaire and were tested in relation to ADHD symptom severity in a co-twin control model. Neurological problems were significantly associated with a diagnosis of ADHD. A conditional model for the analysis of within-twin pair effects revealed an inverse association between digestive problems and the severity of ADHD symptoms, after adjusting for co-existing autism spectrum disorder and ADHD medications. Our findings suggest that individuals with ADHD are susceptible to neurological problems, why a thorough neurological check-up is indicated in clinical practice for this population. In addition, health conditions of digestive system could be considered as a non-shared environmental factor for behavioral phenotypes in ADHD. It supports the possible role of gut-brain axis in the underpinnings of ADHD symptoms, at least for a subgroup of individuals with certain genetic predisposition."
CT fatty muscle fraction as a new parameter for muscle quality assessment predicts outcome in venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,"Impaired skeletal muscle quality is a major risk factor for adverse outcomes in acute respiratory failure. However, conventional methods for skeletal muscle assessment are inapplicable in the critical care setting. This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of computed tomography (CT) fatty muscle fraction (FMF) as a biomarker of muscle quality in patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). To calculate FMF, paraspinal skeletal muscle area was obtained from clinical CT and separated into areas of fatty and lean muscle based on densitometric thresholds. The cohort was binarized according to median FMF. Patients with high FMF displayed significantly increased 1-year mortality (72.7% versus 55.8%, P = 0.036) on Kaplan–Meier analysis. A multivariable logistic regression model was built to test the impact of FMF on outcome. FMF was identified as a significant predictor of 1-year mortality (hazard ratio per percent FMF, 1.017 [95% confidence interval, 1.002–1.033]; P = 0.031), independent of anthropometric characteristics, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Simplified Acute Physiology Score, Respiratory Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Survival Prediction Score, and duration of ECMO support. To conclude, FMF predicted 1-year mortality independently of established clinical prognosticators in ECMO patients and may have the potential to become a new muscle quality imaging biomarker, which is available from clinical CT."
Neonatal hyperoxia enhances age-dependent expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in mice,"The severity of COVID-19 lung disease is higher in the elderly and people with pre-existing co-morbidities. People who were born preterm may be at greater risk for COVID-19 because their early exposure to oxygen (hyperoxia) at birth increases the severity of respiratory viral infections. Hyperoxia at birth increases the severity of influenza A virus infections in adult mice by reducing the number of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells. Since AT2 cells express the SARS-CoV-2 receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), their expression should decline as AT2 cells are depleted by hyperoxia. Instead, ACE2 was detected in airway Club cells and endothelial cells at birth, and then AT2 cells at one year of age. Neonatal hyperoxia stimulated expression of ACE2 in Club cells and in AT2 cells by 2 months of age. It also stimulated expression of TMPRSS2 in the lung. Increased expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors was blocked by mitoTEMPO, a mitochondrial superoxide scavenger that reduced oxidative stress and DNA damage seen in oxygen-exposed mice. Our finding that hyperoxia enhances the age-dependent expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in mice helps explain why COVID-19 lung disease is greater in the elderly and people with pre-existing co-morbidities."
Cognitive impairment without altered levels of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in patients with encephalitis caused by varicella-zoster virus: a pilot study,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is one of the most common agents causing viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS). VZV encephalitis is associated with severe neurological sequelae, despite antiviral treatment. Cognitive impairment has been reported and VZV has been associated with dementia. Our aim was to investigate the cognitive impairment and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in a follow-up study of patients with VZV encephalitis. Thirteen patients with VZV encephalitis, diagnosed by detection of VZV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by PCR and concomitant symptoms of encephalitis, were included. Neuropsychological assessment in parallel with a lumbar puncture to obtain CSF was performed 1.5–7 years after acute disease. The CSF biomarkers neurofilament light chain (NFL), S100B, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), amyloid-β (Aβ) 40 and Aβ42, total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) were analysed and compared to controls (n = 24). Cognitive impairment was shown in the domains of executive functions and speed/attention and to a minor degree in the domains of learning/memory and language, indicated by a significantly poorer performance on seven neuropsychological test variables. No convincing evidence of alterations in concentrations of biomarkers in the CSF were shown. Our results indicate that patients with VZV encephalitis suffer from cognitive impairment long time after acute disease. Importantly, these impairments do not seem to be accompanied by biomarker evidence of ongoing neuronal or astrocytic injury/activation or induction of dementia-related brain pathologies by the infection."
Blood loss from transverse versus longitudinal uterine incision in abdominal myomectomy: a randomized controlled trial,It is unclear whether transverse uterine incision is non-inferior to longitudinal incision during myomectomy with regard to bleeding. Our aim was to compare between transverse and longitudinal uterine incisions in myomectomy.
The Role of Using HEART Score to Risk Stratify Chest Pain Among Emergency Department High Utilizers,"The HEART score is used to effectively risk stratify undifferentiated chest pain patients in the Emergency Department (ED). It is unclear whether such risk stratification can be applied among ED high utilizers. We aim to determine the efficacy and safety of using the HEART score to predict 30-day short-term major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in ED high utilizers. We conducted a retrospective, observational study in which ED high utilizers were defined as patients who had four or more ED visits within the past 12 months. ED high utilizers presenting at the study ED with chest pain were enrolled. Patients in which the HEART score was utilized were placed in the HEART group and patients with no HEART scores documented were placed to the usual care group. Hospital admissions and cardiac stress tests performed during the index hospitalizations, and 30-day MACE rates were analyzed and compared between the HEART and usual care groups. From January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019, a total of 8,315 patient visits from ED high utilizers were enrolled. In the HEART group, 49% of ED visits were admitted with 20% receiving stress tests. A 30-day MACE outcome occurred among 1.4% of visits. In the usual care group, 44% of ED visits were admitted, with only 9% receiving index stress tests and a 1.5% of 30-day MACE occurrence (p=0.727). The study showed that similar short-term MACE outcomes occurred between patients using HEART scores and usual care to risk stratify chest pain among ED high utilizers."
RETRACTED ARTICLE: Long non-coding RNA LBX2-AS1 enhances glioma proliferation through downregulating microRNA-491-5p,"Dysregulation of lncRNAs is frequent in glioma and has emerged as an important mechanism involved in tumorigenesis. Previous analysis of Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) database indicated that LBX2-AS1 expression is one of differentially expression lncRNA between lower grade glioma (LGG) (grade II and III) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, the function and mechanism of LBX2-AS1 in glioma has not been evaluated yet."
A pan-kidney cancer study identifies subtype specific perturbations on pathways with potential drivers in renal cell carcinoma,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a complex disease and is comprised of several histological subtypes, the most frequent of which are clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC). While lots of studies have been performed to investigate the molecular characterizations of different subtypes of RCC, our knowledge regarding the underlying mechanisms are still incomplete. As molecular alterations are eventually reflected on the pathway level to execute certain biological functions, characterizing the pathway perturbations is crucial for understanding tumorigenesis and development of RCC."
Community-Acquired Pneumonia and Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia in Adult Patients with Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathy: Outcome and Antibiotic Therapy,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) are common complications in idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) patients, and are frequently associated with unfavorable outcome as well as prolonged antibiotic therapy. In this study, we intended to clarify whether clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) and multiple serum biomarkers are valuable in predicting unfavorable outcomes and prolonged antibiotic therapy in adult IIM patients complicated with CAP or HAP."
Anticancer Agent Gefitinib and Congenital Anomalies,"Congenital abnormalities caused by human teratogenic drugs account for less than 1% of total congenital abnormalities. We report the first case of multiple anomalies associated with antenatal exposure to the anticancer agent Gefitinib. The patient conceived while she was on tablet Gefitinib 250 mg once a day for stage IV adenocarcinoma of lungs. The first scan done at 29 weeks 2 days showed liquor amnii on the upper limit of normal, single umbilical artery, left sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia, ventriculoseptal defect and left radial ray defect. The patient had a preterm delivery after one week and she refused autopsy. It is important to advise patients regarding contraception while undergoing chemotherapy as there is an increased risk of drug induced fetal malformations."

Lignin provides mechanical support to herbaceous peony (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.) stems,"Stem bending caused by mechanical failure is a major constraint for high-quality herbaceous peony (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.) cut flowers, but little is known about the underlying factors. In this study, two P. lactiflora cultivars, Xixia Yingxue (bending) and Hong Feng (upright), were used to investigate differences in stem bending. The results showed that the stem mechanical strength of Hong Feng was significantly higher than that of Xixia Yingxue, and the thickening of the secondary cell wall and the number of thickened secondary cell wall layers in Hong Feng were significantly higher than those in Xixia Yingxue. Moreover, compared with Xixia Yingxue, Hong Feng showed greater lignification of the cell wall and lignin deposition in the cell walls of the sclerenchyma, vascular bundle sheath and duct. All three types of lignin monomers were detected. The S-lignin, G-lignin, and total lignin contents and the activities of several lignin biosynthesis-related enzymes were higher in Hong Feng than in the other cultivar, and the S-lignin content was closely correlated with stem mechanical strength. In addition, 113,974 full-length isoforms with an average read length of 2106 bp were obtained from the full-length transcriptome of P. lactiflora stems, and differential expression analysis was performed based on the comparative transcriptomes of these two cultivars. Ten lignin biosynthesis-related genes, including 26 members that were closely associated with lignin content, were identified, and multiple upregulated and downregulated transcription factors were found to positively or negatively regulate lignin biosynthesis. Consequently, lignin was shown to provide mechanical support to P. lactiflora stems, providing useful information for understanding the formation of P. lactiflora stem strength."
Analysis of the developing gut microbiota in young dairy calves—impact of colostrum microbiota and gut disturbances,"The aim of this study was to characterize the colostrum and fecal microbiota in calves and to investigate whether fecal microbiota composition was related to colostrum microbiota or factors associated with calf health. Colostrum samples were collected in buckets after hand milking of 76 calving cows from 38 smallholder dairy farms. Fecal samples were taken directly from the rectum of 76 calves at birth and at 14 days age. The bacterial community structure in colostrum and feces was analyzed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism for all samples, and the microbial composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing for a subset of the samples (8 colostrum, 40 fecal samples). There was a significant difference in fecal microbiota composition between day 0 and day 14 samples, but no associations between the microbiota and average daily gain, birth weight, or transfer of passive immunity. At 14 days of age, Faecalibacterium and Butyricicoccus were prevalent in higher relative abundances in the gut of healthy calves compared to calves with diarrhea that had been treated with antimicrobials. Colostrum showed great variation in composition of microbiota but no association to fecal microbiota. This study provides the first insights into the composition of colostrum and fecal microbiota of young dairy calves in southern Vietnam and can form the basis for future more detailed studies."
The usage of deep neural network improves distinguishing COVID-19 from other suspected viral pneumonia by clinicians on chest CT: a real-world study,"Based on the current clinical routine, we aimed to develop a novel deep learning model to distinguish coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia from other types of pneumonia and validate it with a real-world dataset (RWD)."
"Resisters, Vacillators or Laggards? Reconsidering the First Farmer-Herders in Prehistoric Egypt","This article discusses the diffusion of food production from the Levant to Egypt in the Early–Middle Holocene. It attempts to explain how the diffusion and adoption of food production occurred in Egypt in light of optimal foraging theory, niche construction theory and innovation diffusion models. It disputes an old argument that Southwest Asian domesticates appeared late in Egypt and played only a minor role in its inhabitants’ subsistence. The primary focus is on the Fayum in northern Egypt, where the earliest-dated Southwest Asian domesticated cereal remains in Egypt were found together with cultivation-related tools and facilities. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the beginning of food production in the Fayum was not as late as previously thought, and that the subsequent development of food production should be seen as a response to the increasing imbalance between the growing human population and the limited wild food resources available in the Middle Holocene. Lithic evidence strongly indicates that people in the Fayum exerted every possible effort to make food production feasible and efficient with the aid of technology in the course of a millennium, starting in the early-to-mid 6th millennium BC."
Epithelial Dysplasia in Actinic Cheilitis: Microscopic Study of 70 Cases from Brazil,"To compare two grading systems of epithelial dysplasia—World Health Organization (WHO) and binary system (BS) –in actinic cheilitis (AC). Seventy cases diagnosed as AC in an Oral Pathology Laboratory from Brazil in the last 12 years were retrospectively retrieved, including the demographic data of each patient. All conventionally stained slides were reviewed, and epithelial dysplasia was evaluated by two independent observers using both WHO and BS grading systems. Data correlation was performed using kappa and chi-square tests (p < 0.05). Most patients were white men with a mean age of 57 years old and history of chronic exposure to sunlight. Most of the lesions were clinically described as whitish plaques with irregular surface located in the lower lip semi-mucosa. Most cases were microscopically graded as severe epithelial dysplasia and low-risk by both observers. The interobserver and intraobserver agreement between systems was slight. All reddish lesions were graded as severe epithelial dysplasia, showing an equal distribution between low and high-risk grading. Most ulcerated lesions showed severe epithelial dysplasia but was graded as low-risk of malignant transformation. Statistical significance was observed among the presence of “irregular stratification”, severe epithelial dysplasia and high-risk lesions (p < 0.05) likewise among the presence of “loss of polarity of basal cells” and “drop-shaped ridges” (p < 0.05) with high-risk lesions. The absence of “increased mitotic figures”, “dyskeratosis” and “keratin pearls” (p < 0.05) were strongly correlated to low-risk lesions. The presence of “hyperchromasia” was statistically significant with severe epithelial dysplasia (p < 0.05) as well the absence of “atypical mitotic figures” with low-risk lesions (p < 0.05). Although there was slight agreement between microscopic grading systems, microscopic analysis indicated that architectural epithelial changes individually may be the more reliable criteria to indicate the risk of malignant transformation in AC in both grading systems."
Disseminated Herpes Simplex Infection Presenting as Acute Supraglottitis in an Adult,"Supraglottitis is a life-threatening, predominantly bacterial disease that is rarely caused by viral etiologies. Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) supraglottitis has been infrequently reported, but its presentation can mimic that of bacterial supraglottitis or pharyngitis which may lead to delayed diagnosis and increased morbidity. We present a case of supraglottitis in an immunocompetent man initially thought to have bacterial epiglottitis. After receiving a tracheostomy due to impending airway compromise and failing to improve on antibiotic therapy, biopsy of the upper airway tissue revealed infection with HSV type 2. The patient improved after multiple weeks of systemic antivirals. HSV supraglottitis remains an unusual but important diagnostic consideration in patients with dysphonia, dysphagia, ulcerative supraglottal lesions, and acute supraglottic inflammation unresponsive to antibiotics."
Can Migrants’ Emigration Intentions Predict Their Actual Behaviors? Evidence from a Swiss Survey,"In this paper, we use original linked data to better understand the relationship between remigration intentions and actual behaviors and, more specifically, to verify whether remigration intentions can predict migrants’ actual behaviors. To do so, we compare self-declared remigration intentions with actual departures during the 2 years following a survey. Then, we analyze to what extent the factors associated with both dimensions are similar. The results show that 96% of migrants who wanted to stay in Switzerland actually stayed and that 71% of those who wanted to leave the country actually left. Overall, intentions were a good predictor of behaviors, and the factors associated with remigration intentions and actual behaviors were almost the same. However, intentions reflected migrants’ personal feelings at the time of the survey and sometimes reflected their potential to remain in Switzerland from a legal point of view. Behaviors were more rational than intentions in that migrants’ reflections on their actual situations were more profound, and their choices to stay in Switzerland or to leave were thus influenced by rational elements such as their labor market situations or family constraints."
A standardized pathological proposal for evaluating microvascular invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma: a multicenter study by LCPGC,"Microvascular invasion (MVI) is a key pathological factor that severely affects the postoperative prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, no MVI classification schemes based on standardized gross sampling protocols of HCC are available at present."
Factors associated with major radiological progression of primary sclerosing cholangitis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease,"Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is the most common hepatobiliary manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) has become the primary diagnostic modality for PSC. However, data on radiological progression over time of large-duct PSC–IBD are limited."
Analysis of Relations between the Landscape Morphometric Characteristics and Forest Productivity (Using the Example of Leningrad Oblast),"An algorithm for determining the correlations between the structural characteristics and productivity of forests and the morphometric characteristics of terrain has been shown using the example of 12 model plots related to 11 different types of landscapes in Leningrad oblast. Geoinformation forestry databases, data from ASTER GDEM survey, and landscape maps have been used for the research. Geoinformation systems have been used to form the spatial datasets, create a grid with a 1-km pitch, and determine the generalized structural and productivity characteristics of the forests (mean stand growing stock, quality classes, rates of the dominating species, and area covered by different forest types and by the dominating species). Automatic landscape classification based on data from the ASTER global digital altitudinal model has been performed using the Iwahashi–Pike method. During the classification, each pixel of the altitudinal model was allotted to one of the eight classes, based on the calculated values of the morphometric characteristics of terrain relief: slope steepness, texture, and convexity. Principal components analysis has been used to determine a set of form classes that explain most of the landscape diversity in model plots. Correlations between the representation of the determined set of landscape classes and some of the productivity and structural characteristics of the forests have been revealed using the rank correlation analysis. A possible explanation for the landscape impact on the formation conditions of forest ecotopes has been provided. Morphometric characteristics used for classification (slope steepness, texture, and convexity) can specify the draining conditions in forest ecotopes and, as a result, influence the productivity and structural characteristics of the forests. The regression correlations between the landform classes and the productivity and structural characteristics of the forests for different landscape levels and landscape types of Leningrad oblast have been revealed. Thus, the results allow one to value the perspectives of further studies in this direction and regard geomorphometry methods as a possible instrument for forest inventory."
The Effect of a Pine Looper Moth Outbreak on the Radial Growth Rate of Pine,"This study compares the 1945–2015 time series of the radial growth rate of pine Pinus sylvestris L. damaged by the 1974–1978 outbreak of the pine looper moth Bupalus piniarius L. and those of the undisturbed Krasnoturansk pine forest. It is proposed to employ regulatory characteristics of time series, including the order of autoregression (lag value n) and standard deviation of the amplitude of time series oscillation s (number of the first differences of radial growth s), to estimate differences between radial growth rates of trees in damaged and intact stands. These indicators allow for a quantitative assessment of the lag of the processes regulating the radial growth rate. Only the first differences of the series of radial growth rate are assessed, inasmuch as the regulatory characteristics can be correctly calculated only for the stationery time series. Trees exposed to insect outbreak either have no lag in the dynamics of the first differences of the series in the radial growth rate or they have high values of autoregression order n. At the same time, the oscillations of the current radial growth rate of damaged trees in relation to the age gradient are significantly larger than in undisturbed trees. We estimate the speed of the growth-rate recovery in damaged trees as a function of regulatory characteristics of time series of the radial growth rate before the damage. These data could be used to assess the pest hazard in the stands and recovery rates of forests damaged by insect outbreaks."
Population Dynamics of the Gypsy Moth in Oak Forests in the Forest Steppes of European Russia,"There were five major outbreaks of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) population between 1977 and 2018. The representation of the phases combined with the their ecological and population indices made it possible to recognize the eruptive and relatively prodromal cycles in the dynamics. The permanent outbreak was a feature of the coppice oak forests in southeastern Europe. The mean population size of the gypsy moth was higher, the maximum density and range of fluctuations were lower, the minimum density was significantly higher, and long periods of time between the outbreaks were not found under the optimum conditions in degraded forest stands with a simple structure growing in a dry climate. The outbreaks occurred every 10 years, while the population fluctuations could be characterized by cycles of various intensity. An eruptive stage was followed by a less intense outbreak (relatively prodromal stage), which differed from conventional prodromal stage by the recovery of the population at a level above stable, which immediately led to a fast growth and a new outbreak. The reason was the insufficient controls set by the complex of polytrophic entomophags, which held the population of gypsy moths at a low to near-average number."
Schwarzschild-like solutions in Finsler–Randers gravity,"In this work, we extend for the first time the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild–De Sitter solutions with a Finsler–Randers-type perturbation which is generated by a covector \(A_\gamma \). This gives a locally anisotropic character to the metric and induces a deviation from the Riemannian models of gravity. A natural framework for this study is the Lorentz tangent bundle of a spacetime manifold. We apply the generalized field equations to the perturbed metric and derive the dynamics for the covector \(A_\gamma \). Finally, we find the timelike, spacelike and null paths on the Schwarzschild–Randers spacetime, we solve the timelike ones numerically and we compare them with the classic geodesics of general relativity. The obtained solutions are new and they enrich the corresponding literature."
Gravitational Landau damping for massive scalar modes,"We establish the possibility of Landau damping for gravitational scalar waves which propagate in a non-collisional gas of particles. In particular, under the hypothesis of homogeneity and isotropy, we describe the medium at the equilibrium with a Jüttner–Maxwell distribution, and we analytically determine the damping rate from the Vlasov equation. We find that damping occurs only if the phase velocity of the wave is subluminal throughout the propagation within the medium. Finally, we investigate relativistic media in cosmological settings by adopting numerical techniques."
Interacting ghost dark energy in complex quintessence theory,"We employ a ghost model of interacting dark energy to obtain the equation of state \(\omega \) for ghost energy density in an FRW universe in complex quintessence theory. We reconstruct the potential and study the dynamics of the scalar field that describes complex quintessence cosmology. We perform \(\omega -\omega '\) analysis and stability analysis for both non-interacting and interacting cases and find that the same basic conclusion as for the real model, where \(\omega ' = d\omega / d ln a\). Taking account of the effect of the complex part and assuming the real part of the quintessence field to be a slow-rolling field, we conclude that the non-interacting model cannot describe the real universe since this will lead to fractional energy density \(\Omega _D > 1\), where \(\Omega _D\) can be defined as the ratio of \(\rho _D\) to \(\rho _{cr}\). However, for the interacting case, if we take present \(\Omega _D =0.73\), then we can determine that \(b^2 = 0.0849\), where \(b^2\) is the interaction coupling parameter between matter and dark energy. In the real quintessence model, \(\Omega _D\) and \(b^2\) are independent parameters, whereas in the complex quintessence model, we conclude that there is a relationship between these two parameters."
Analytic baby skyrmions at finite density,"We study the baby Skyrme model in (2+1)-dimensions built on a finite cylinder. To this end, we introduce a consistent ansatz which is able to reduce the complete set of field equations to just one equation for the profile function for arbitrary baryon charge. Many analytic solutions both with and without the inclusion of the effects of the minimal coupling with the Maxwell field are constructed. The baby skyrmions appear as a sequence of rings along the cylinder, leading to a periodic shape in the baryon density. Linear stability and other physical properties are discussed. These analytic gauged baby Skyrmions generate a persistent U(1) current which cannot be turned off continuously as it is tied to the topological charge of the baby Skyrmions themselves. In the simplest non-trivial case of a gauged baby Skyrmion, a very important role is played by the Mathieu equation with an effective coupling constant which can be computed explicitly. These configurations are a very suitable arena to test resurgence in a non-integrable context."
Chamber Inhibitors of Corrosion of AMg6 Aluminum Alloy,"Using a set of physicochemical (ellipsometry and contact angle measurements), electrochemical (potentiometric anode polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy), and corrosion (periodic moisture condensation test) methods, the properties of adsorption films formed on the AMg6 aluminum alloy surface by the chamber method in vapors of some amines of heterocyclic compounds, carboxylic acids, and their salts are studied. It is established that the use of the studied compounds in the chamber processing of the alloy increases—though not effectively enough—its corrosion resistance in a humid atmosphere. The most promising inhibitors are carboxylic acids themselves; the optimum temperature for surface treatment with them is 140°C. One-hour treatment of steel with pairs of oleic, neodecanoic acid, and carboxylic acid A at this temperature gives rise to the formation of nanoscale adsorption films on the AMg6 alloy, which slightly hydrophilize the surface, but possess a protective aftereffect. Apparently, further improvement of chamber protection methods of the AMg6 alloy should consist in the selection of synergists for chamber corrosion inhibitors of the carboxylate type."
Aktuelle Ist-Analyse zur Situation des nichttraumatologischen Schockraummanagements in Deutschland,"In Notaufnahmen kommen bundesweit nichttraumatologische kritisch kranke Patienten zur Aufnahme.

Efficient reversible CO/CO2 conversion in solid oxide cells with a phase-transformed fuel electrode,"The reversible solid oxide cell (RSOC) is an attractive technology to mutually convert power and chemicals at elevated temperatures. However, its development has been hindered mainly due to the absence of a highly active and durable fuel electrode. Here, we report a phase-transformed CoFe-Sr3Fe1.25Mo0.75O7−δ (CoFe-SFM) fuel electrode consisting of CoFe nanoparticles and Ruddlesden-Popper-layered Sr3Fe1.25Mo0.75O7−δ (SFM) from a Sr2Fe7/6Mo0.5Co1/3O6−δ (SFMCo) perovskite oxide after annealing in hydrogen and apply it to reversible CO/CO2 conversion in RSOC. The CoFe-SFM fuel electrode shows improved catalytic activity by accelerating oxygen diffusion and surface kinetics towards the CO/CO2 conversion as demonstrated by the distribution of relaxation time (DRT) study and equivalent circuit model fitting analysis. Furthermore, an electrolyte-supported single cell is evaluated in the 2:1 CO-CO2 atmosphere at 800°C, which shows a peak power density of 259 mW cm−2 for CO oxidation and a current density of −0.453 A cm−2 at 1.3 V for CO2 reduction, which correspond to 3.079 and 3.155 mL min−1 cm−2 for the CO and CO2 conversion rates, respectively. More importantly, the reversible conversion is successfully demonstrated over 20 cyclic electrolysis and fuel cell switching test modes at 1.3 and 0.6 V. This work provides a useful guideline for designing a fuel electrode through a surface/interface exsolution process for RSOC towards efficient CO-CO2 reversible conversion."
Three-dimensional hierarchical Co(OH)F nanosheet arrays decorated by single-atom Ru for boosting oxygen evolution reaction,"Electronic coupling with the support plays a crucial role in boosting the intrinsic catalytic activity of a single-atom catalyst. Herein, the three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical Co(OH)F nanosheet arrays modified by singleatom Ru (SA-Ru/Co(OH)F) are prepared by a facile one-step hydrothermal method under mild conditions, which exhibit excellent activity with an overpotential of 200 and 326 mV at 10 and 500 mA cm−2, respectively, as well as robust stability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 mol L−1 KOH electrolyte. The study of electronic structures and surface chemical states before and after OER testing reveals that the strong electronic coupling between single-atom Ru and Co(OH)F induces the charge redistribution in SA-Ru/Co(OH)F and suppresses the excessive oxidation of Ru into higher valence state (more than +4) under high OER potential. This work provides a strategy to stabilize single-atom Ru by Co(OH)F that can enhance the activity and durability for OER under large current densities."
Drought and Property Prices: Empirical Evidence from Provinces of Iran,"This study examines the effect of drought on housing and residential land prices in Iran. Using panel data covering the 2006–2015 period for 31 provinces of Iran and applying a dynamic system and the difference Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) methods, we find that an increase in the balance of water (reducing the severity of drought) within provinces has a positive effect on property prices. Our results are robust, controlling for province fixed effects, time trend, and a set of control variables that may affect property prices."

Is Training with the N-Back Task More Effective Than with Other Tasks? N-Back vs. Dichotic Listening vs. Simple Listening,"Cognitive training most commonly uses computerized tasks that stimulate simultaneous cognitive processing in two modalities, such as a dual n-back task with visual and auditive stimuli, or on two receptive channels, such as a listening task with dichotically presented stimuli. The present study was designed to compare a dual n-back task and a dichotic listening (DL) task with an active control condition (a simple listening task) and a no-training control condition for their impact on cognitive performance, daily life memory, and mindfulness. One hundred thirty healthy adults aged 18–55 years were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions. The training consisted of twenty 15-min sessions spread across 4 weeks. The results indicated some improvement on episodic memory tasks and a trend for enhanced performance in an untrained working memory (WM) span task following cognitive training relative to the no-training control group. However, the only differential training effects were found for the DL training in increasing choice reaction performance and a trend for self-reported mindfulness. Transfer to measures of fluid intelligence and memory in daily life did not emerge. Additionally, we found links between self-efficacy and n-back training performance and between emotion regulation and training motivation. Our results contribute to the field of WM training by demonstrating that our listening tasks are comparable in effect to a dual n-back task in slightly improving memory. The possibility of improving attentional control and mindfulness through dichotic listening training is promising and deserves further consideration."
Numerical investigation of alleviation of undesirable effect of inter-blade vortex with air admission for a low-head Francis turbine,"In order to compensate for the stochastic nature of the power grid due to the tremendous development and the integration of renewable energy resources and meet its other requirements, the hydraulic turbines are forced to operate more frequently under partial load conditions with singular and misaligned flows inevitably excited by the inter-blade vortex. This paper presents numerical investigations of the unsteady characteristics of the inter-blade vortex for a low-head model Francis turbine. The SST k - ω turbulent model is used to close the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation. The flow structure of the inter blade vortex predicted by the numerical simulation is confirmed by experimental visualizations. It is shown that the total vortex volume in the runner sees a quasi-periodical oscillation, with significant flow separations created on the suction side of the runner blade. A counter measure by using the air admission into the water from the head cover is implemented to alleviate the undesirable effect of the inter-blade vortex. The analyses show that the development of the inter-blade vortex is significantly mitigated by the injecting air that controls and changes the spatial distribution of streamlines. Furthermore, the flow aeration with a suitable air flow rate can reduce the energy dissipation caused by the inter-blade vortex and plays a critical role in preventing the excessive amplitudes of the pressure fluctuation on the suction side of the runner blade. This investigation provides an insight into the flow mechanism underlying the inter-blade vortex and offers a reference to alleviate and mitigate the adverse consequences of the inter-blade vortex for the Francis turbine."
Liutex core line and POD analysis on hairpin vortex formation in natural flow transition,"In this study, the new method of the vortex core line based on Liutex definition, also known as Liutex core line, is applied to support the hypothesis that the vortex ring is not a part of the Λ - vortex and the formation of the ring-like vortex is formed separately from the Λ - vortex. The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is also applied to analyze the Kelvin-VHelmholtz (K-H) instability happening in hairpin ring areas of the flow transition on the flat plate to understand the mechanism of the ring-like vortex formation. The new vortex identification method named modified Liutex-Omega method is efficiently used to visualize and observe the shapes of vortex structures in 3-D. The streamwise vortex structure characteristics can be found in POD mode one as the mean flow. The other POD modes are in stremwise and spanwise structures and have the fluctuation motions, which are induced by K-H instability. Moreover, the result shows that POD modes are in pairs and share the same characteristics such as amplitudes, mode shapes, and time evolutions. The vortex core and POD results confirm that the Λ - vortex is not self-deformed to a hairpin vortex, but the hairpin vortex is formed by the K-H instability during the development of Lambda vortex to hairpin vortex in the boundary layer flow transition."
Self-cleaning semiconductor heterojunction substrate: ultrasensitive detection and photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants for environmental remediation,"Emerging technologies in the field of environmental remediation are becoming increasingly significant owing to the increasing demand for eliminating significant amounts of pollution in water, soil, and air. We designed and synthesized MoS2/Fe2O3 heterojunction nanocomposites (NCs) as multifunctional materials that are easily separated and reused. The trace detection performance of the prepared sample was examined using bisphenol A (BPA) as the probe molecule, with limits of detection as low as 10−9 M; this detection limit is the lowest among all reported semiconductor substrates. BPA was subjected to rapid photocatalytic degradation by MoS2/Fe2O3 NCs under ultraviolet irradiation. The highly recyclable MoS2/Fe2O3 NCs exhibited photo-Fenton catalytic activity for BPA and good detection ability when reused as a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate after catalysis. The SERS and photocatalysis mechanisms were proposed while considering the effects of the Z-scheme charge-transfer paths, three-dimensional flower-like structures, and dipole–dipole coupling. Moreover, the prepared MoS2/Fe2O3 NCs were successfully applied in the detection of BPA in real lake water and milk samples. Herein, we present insights into the development of MoS2/Fe2O3 materials, which can be used as multifunctional materials in chemical sensors and in photocatalytic wastewater treatments for the removal of recalcitrant organic pollutants."
Smartphone-powered iontophoresis-microneedle array patch for controlled transdermal delivery,"The incidence rate of diabetes has been increasing every year in nearly all nations and regions. The traditional control of diabetes using transdermal insulin delivery by metal needles is generally associated with pain and potential infections. While microneedle arrays (MAs) have emerged as painless delivery techniques, the integration of MA systems with electronic devices to precisely control drug delivery has rarely been realized. In this study, we developed an iontophoresis-microneedle array patch (IMAP) powered by a portable smartphone for the active and controllable transdermal delivery of insulin. The IMAP in situ integrates iontophoresis and charged nanovesicles into one patch, achieving a one-step drug administration strategy of “penetration, diffusion and iontophoresis”. The MA of the IMAP is first pressed on the skin to create microholes and then is retracted, followed by the iontophoresis delivery of insulin-loaded nanovesicles through these microholes in an electrically controlled manner. This method has synergistically and remarkably enhanced controlled insulin delivery. The amount of insulin can be effectively regulated by the IMAP by applying different current intensities. This in vivo study has demonstrated that the IMAP effectively delivers insulin and produces robust hypoglycemic effects in a type-1 diabetic rat model, with more advanced controllability and efficiency than delivery by a pristine microneedle or iontophoresis. The IMAP system shows high potential for diabetes therapy and the capacity to provide active as well as long-term glycemic regulation without medical staff care."
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) membrane (M) protein inhibits type I and III interferon production by targeting RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has quickly spread worldwide and has affected more than 10 million individuals. A typical feature of COVID-19 is the suppression of type I and III interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immunity. However, the molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 evades antiviral immunity remains elusive. Here, we reported that the SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein inhibits the production of type I and III IFNs induced by the cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathway mediated by RIG-I/MDA-5–MAVS signaling. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein suppresses type I and III IFN induction stimulated by SeV infection or poly (I:C) transfection. Mechanistically, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein interacts with RIG-I, MAVS, and TBK1, thus preventing the formation of the multiprotein complex containing RIG-I, MAVS, TRAF3, and TBK1 and subsequently impeding the phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and activation of IRF3. Consequently, ectopic expression of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein facilitates the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus. Taken together, these results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein antagonizes type I and III IFN production by targeting RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling, which subsequently attenuates antiviral immunity and enhances viral replication. This study provides insight into the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2-induced antiviral immune suppression and illuminates the pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19."
A cross-species interaction with a symbiotic commensal enables cell-density-dependent growth and in vivo virulence of an oral pathogen,"Recent studies describe in detail the shifts in composition of human-associated polymicrobial communities from health to disease. However, the specific processes that drive the colonization and overgrowth of pathogens within these communities remain incompletely understood. We used in vitro culture systems and a disease-relevant mouse model to show that population size, which determines the availability of an endogenous diffusible small molecule, limits the growth, colonization, and in vivo virulence of the human oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. This bacterial pathogen overcomes the requirement for an endogenous cue by utilizing a cell-density dependent, growth-promoting, soluble molecule provided by the symbiotic early colonizer Veillonella parvula, but not produced by other commensals tested. Our work shows that exchange of cell-density-dependent diffusible cues between specific early and late colonizing species in a polymicrobial community drives microbial successions, pathogen colonization and disease development, representing a target process for manipulation of the microbiome towards the healthy state."
Elektrische Wechselfelder – eine Therapieoption bei Glioblastom,"Die Einführung von Tumortherapiefeldern zur Behandlung von Glioblastomen ermöglichte erstmals seit der Etablierung der kombinierten Radiochemotherapie mit Temozolomid einen signifikanten Überlebensvorteil. Ob ein Patient von dieser Therapieform profitieren kann, ist abhängig von seiner kognitiven und sozialen Situation sowie der Bereitschaft, in der Öffentlichkeit durch das Tragen des Geräts aufzufallen. Bei den an unserer Abteilung behandelten Patienten erwies sich die Therapieform als nebenwirkungsarm, allerdings nimmt die Compliance mit zunehmender Krankheitsdauer und Zunahme der neurologischen Defizite ab."
Microbially Mediated Organomineralization in Paleozoic Carbonate Ooids,"This article reports the first results of studies on microbially mediated organomineralization in carbonate ooids from the Paleozoic sections of the Timan–Northern Ural region, which were formed in different environments and had different original mineral composition (calcite, Mg-calcite, and dolomite). Using a scanning electron microscope, mineralized microbial biofilms preserved in various forms and the modified morphology of primary grains under the effect of organic acids were identified. The interrelation between microbes and organomineralization has been established, which was observed in the form of conserved nuclei of the amorphous phase of calcium carbonate on the surfaces of mineralized biofilms, including EPS relics in the composition of ooid crusts. Carbon and oxygen isotope data showed the difference in Paleozoic ooid formation from saline lagoons to open shallow sea. The Raman spectra revealed the state of structure order of carbonaceous materials (CM) ranging from amorphous to weakly ordered carbon in ooids, which enables the data on the isotope composition of ooid carbonates to be considered corresponding to their primary composition and the environmental conditions under which they were formed."
Bacterial Diversity of the Soil of the Polar Tundra of Russia,"This review summarizes the results of the study of bacterial communities of seasonally thawed soil horizons in the polar tundra of Russia. It has been shown that the representatives of different physiological groups of microorganisms developing in the soils of this extremely cold habitat are involved in the global biological cycle of carbon. Light has been thrown upon the role of microorganisms in the formation of volatile organic compounds including gases (methane, hydrogen) during anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter and their uptake by aerobic bacteria, which are a kind of bacterial filter for volatile organic compounds on their way to the atmosphere. It has been shown that the bacteria of Soehngen cycle developing in the soil of the polar tundra of Russia at low temperatures control the flow of methane, one of the greenhouse gases formed by the anaerobic microbial community at the methanogenic step, into the atmosphere. The community also includes methylotrophic bacteria using oxidized and substituted methane derivatives as carbon and energy sources, which are a biofilter for volatile C1 compounds on their way to the atmosphere. The pure cultures of psychrophilic and psychroactive representatives of hydrogen, methanotrophic, methylotrophic, heterotrophic bacteria of the microbial community of tundra soil have been described. It has been shown that the microbial community is characterized by high species diversity. In general, the bacteria of the seasonally thawed horizon of tundra soil are adapted to exist in extreme habitats: cold tundra ecosystems."
Experimental and numerical study on jet properties and penetration of double-layered shaped charge,"Double-layered shaped charge (DLSC) is a special type of shaped charge which has been recently attracted to enhance the penetration performance. The DLSC consists of a co-axial double-layered charge composed of outer high-velocity explosive and inner low-velocity explosive. In this paper, numerical simulations and experiments are carried out to investigate the usefulness of the DLSC compare to an ordinary shaped charge (OSC) at different stand-off distances. Jet properties of shaped charges are measured by simulation models and compared with the experimental penetration depths. It was found that the penetration performance strongly depends on the existence of jet breakup and the DLSCs performed better than the OSC only when no jet breakup occurs before reaching the target. The comparison study between the simulations and experiments also revealed that the jet properties such as kinetic energy, cumulative jet mass, and the initial jet breakup distance are highly related to the penetration performance."
Force attenuation properties of shear-thickening polymer (STP)-based hip protector in simulated sideways fall,"Shear-thickening polymer (STP) has a unique property of increasing its viscosity with an increase in shear strain to attenuate the application of force, implying that it can be used as a material for hip protectors. This study introduces a new hip protector composed of STP and compares its force attenuation capacity to that of other commercial hip protectors in simulated sideways falls. The performance of the STP-based hip protector was analyzed against eight commercial hip protectors (Pelican, Posey, SafeHip, Hornsby, FallSafe, HipSaver, Impact Wear (Hard), Impact Wear (Soft)). The simulated sideways fall conditions were created by a drop weight impact testing system using an anatomical hip model. The machine was dropped from a 20 or 30 cm height resulting in impact energy of 25.1 J (low) or 44.1 J (moderate), respectively. At low impact energy, the commercial hip protectors showed an attenuation range from 21.6 % to 53.3 %, and the STP-based hip pad was able to attenuate the force by 42.7 %. At moderate impact energy, the commercial hip protectors showed an attenuation range from 23 % to 54.3 %, and the STP-based hip pad was able to attenuate the force by 32.6 %. The low coefficient of variance showed a high precision in the execution of the experiments. Although the STP-based hip protector was thinner than the average of commercial soft shell pads and retained comfortable fit, it showed comparable force attenuation capacity to the commercial ones for the low impact energy test. This study highlights that STP, in combination with a polyurethane foam layer, provides the best features in energy-absorption and shunting, showing that it can be used in hip protectors to gain a competitive advantage over others."
Simulation of response characteristic of VTVL system with hybrid rocket engine,"To determine the suitability of the control performance of the VTVL system with hybrid rocket engine, simulations were done for the vertical and horizontal motion using various engine data. In the simulation, the thrust modulation characteristics of each engine were modeled with the same second-order transfer function in all cases. The results showed that the VTVL system with HRE showed better performance in terms of vertical motion error and touch down speed. In addition, this confirms the possibility for successful VTVL flight missions using HRE. In the next step, a better control algorithm and an efficient control technique will be attempted for developing the VTVL demonstrator."
Size effect in flexural behaviour of unidirectional GFRP composites,"In this paper, the size effect in unidirectional (UD) laminated glass-fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) composites subjected to quasi-static bending loading was investigated: the sensitivity of a specimen’s mechanical behaviour and failure mechanism to its geometry was studied. Composite beams with different numbers of 0° unidirectional plies were tested and their post-deformation structures were analysed microscopically. In the subsequent simulations, the intraply damage was modelled using continuum damage mechanics, implemented as a user-defined VUMAT subroutine in ABAQUS/Explicit, while cohesive zone elements were employed to characterize the delamination between different plies. It was observed that the flexural failure triggered the multiple delaminations; their location was studied. The influence of the size effect on the bending response of the UD composite beams was analysed in depth. The findings of the current study can be used to design modern structures made of composite materials."
Design methodology and computational fluid analysis for the printed circuit steam generator (PCSG),"To introduce the printed circuit steam generator (PCSG), the design methods were developed, and the CFD analysis was performed. The design considerations were divided into three parts: thermal sizing, structural integrity evaluation, and specific design for water channels. The thermal sizing was performed by a 1D heat transfer analysis and the channel length was increased until it satisfied the target thermal power. The structural integrity was evaluated based on the ASME code and the calculated stresses were compared to the allowable stress. The flow instability, flow maldistribution, and fouling have negative effects on the performance. In order to prevent such phenomena, the mixing channel and orifice were designed. The CFD analysis on the final design of the PCSG was performed to evaluate the steam state at the outlet and flow distribution. Although a flow maldistribution (∼12 %) was observed, the steam state at the outlet was satisfied with the operating conditions."
Investigation on the aerodynamic performance and boundary layer characteristics of high deflection industrial turbine cascade at off-design conditions,"This research leads to reach the effects of the off-design operation on the aerodynamic performance, boundary layer behavior, and associated loss occurring in a high deflection industrial turbine blade. Numerical simulations, proved opposed to experimental results, are used to achieve the detailed flow field of the cascade, incidence angels ranging from −15° to +10° at inlet chord Reynolds number varied from 9.63E+04 to 2.24E+05. Boundary layer specifications covering thickness, displacement thickness, and momentum thickness are achieved in the 15 points on the suction side and talk about detail on the authority of numerical simulations in various flow conditions. Results indicate that profile loss is forcefully increased by the rising up the incidence angle mostly in the positive range. Studying the effect of incidence angle on the boundary layer behavior indicates that as incidence angle varies from negative to positive, all three characteristics of the boundary layer increase gradually."
Research on roll forming process and springback based on five-boundary condition forming angle distribution function,"In the present study, a five-boundary conditional distribution function of the forming angle is proposed. The stress, strain, and springback of a sheet in roll-forming process under three different angle distribution functions are studied. Furthermore, effects of forming angle increment, sheet thickness, and material yield strength on stress, strain distribution, and springback of sheet during roll forming are studied under optimized forming angle. The results demonstrate that stress, strain, and springback of each pass based on increment of forming angle under five-boundary condition during roll forming are less than those achieved by other forming angle distribution methods. The stress and strain in the bending zone increase with increase in the sheet thickness. After roll forming, the springback angle decreases with the increase of sheet thickness, increases with the increase of forming angle and material yield strength. However, springback angle can be effectively reduced by increasing the number of passes or correction rolls."
Investigation of oxygen and water distributions in the modified parallel-serpentine cathode channels of a unit polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell,"In this paper, the measurement of water and oxygen distributions along the modified parallel serpentine cathode flow channels has been performed using a gas chromatograph (GC). Generally, it is difficult to directly profile oxygen and water distributions where water concentration nearly reaches saturation levels. Here, the measurement of high levels of water saturation in cathode channels was carefully performed according to operating conditions such as cell voltage and air stoichiometry. GC measurement was also carried out to understand the oxygen and water distributions under channel flooding conditions. In addition, the oxygen and water vapor distributions by GC measurements for the base-line case were compared with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results. For the entrance of the flow channel, the simulated results show a good agreement with the measured results. However, some discrepancy between calculated and experimental results is found for the flow channels near the cathode outlet."
Moisture diffusion coefficients of a PE/PA composite membrane in an enthalpy exchanger for heat and moisture recovery,"Paper membranes have long been used in an enthalpy exchanger. However, there has been a continuous concern on the durability or the anti-bacterial performance. In this study, heat and moisture transfer characteristics of a recently-developed PE/PA (polyethylene/polyacetate) composite membrane was investigated as a possible substitute to the paper membrane. Results showed that the diffusion coefficients of the PE/PA membrane (7.7 × 10−10 m2/s to 1.8 × 10−9 m2/s) were higher than those of the paper membrane (1.8 × 10−11 m2/s to 6.0 × 10−11 m2/s). Furthermore, the diffusion coefficient increased as relative humidity increased, reached a maximum at 50 % to 60 % and then decreased. For PE/PA membrane, the sorption constant increased as temperature increased, which was the reversed trend to the paper membrane. Successful prediction of the moisture transfer effectivenesses of the separate pseudo-counter flow enthalpy exchangers further strengthened the validity of the obtained diffusion coefficients."
Computer-aided gear product realization using enhanced decision-making in material selection and reliability assessment,"Unmatched in its diversity of applications, gears continue to be one of the most successful components used to transfer energy throughout a mechanical system. Certain project settings can require gears to meet more than one criterion to achieve optimal performance. In this paper, we proposed the simulation-based design synthesis using virtual simulations and material selection charts. For this, a computer-generated two gear mechanism is made to create a gear material selection chart, similar to an Ashby chart, that compares the desired conditions of angular velocity and torque. By utilizing computer software to personalize specifications, a gear design material selection chart can be constructed to expedite the material selection process for project environments and needs. Using this approach, gear designers and manufactures can promote design efficiency in the early stage of product development by flexibly determining possible material choices for their gear design based on the desired performance specifications."
Towards selective laser sintering of objects with customized mechanical properties based on ANFIS predictions,"Recently, the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) has been used extensively in modeling of manufacturing processes to save both optimization time and manufacturing costs. ANFIS is a powerful iterative tool for optimizing non-linear and multivariable manufacturing operations. In the present study, ANFIS is used to predict the optimum manufacturing parameters in selective laser sintering (SLS) of cement-filled polyamide 12 (PA12) composite. For this purpose, a set of cement-filled PA12 test specimens is manufactured by SLS technique with 8 different values of laser power (4.5–8 Watt) and 8 different weight fractions of white cement (5 %–40 %). Mechanical characterization of cement-filled PA12 is carried out to evaluate the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), compressive strength, and flexural properties. The experimental data are then divided into two groups; one group for training the ANFIS model and the other group for checking the validity of the identified model. The built ANFIS model was validated experimentally and comparison with experimental results revealed mean relative errors of 2.92 %, 3.84 %, 4.75 %, and 3.31 % in the predictions of UTS, compressive strength, flexural modulus, and flexural yield strength, respectively."
A tuning scheme of cycle reference point for gas turbine adaptive performance simulation with field data,"To minimize the simulated performance error of gas turbines, traditional adaptive methods are mainly concerned with the tuning of cycle design point and component maps given by the manufacturer, usually ignoring the fact that performance at cycle design point may not match the field data due to the deviation between test-rig conditions and field conditions. In this paper, a new tuning scheme of the cycle reference point is proposed to minimize the simulated errors simultaneously at design point and off-design points. The scheme is composed of a backward iteration algorithm and a genetic algorithm. During the backward iteration, the field data at the maximum operating condition is selected to obtain the initial cycle reference point with several undetermined parameters. Further, the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the undetermined parameters. The accuracy of the proposed method was validated by the simulated performance of a PGT25+ gas turbine."
Numerical study on the effect of the tip clearance of a 100 HP axial fan on the aerodynamic performance and unsteady stall characteristics,"In this study, a numerical analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of the tip clearance on the aerodynamic performance, internal flow characteristics, and stall region characteristics of an axial fan. Three-dimensional steady and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) calculations were conducted with a shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model. Tip clearance ratios of 0, 0.01, and 0.02 were applied to the impeller. As the tip clearance ratio increased, the aerodynamic performance of the axial fan decreased at both the design and the off-design conditions. The correlation between the tip leakage vortex (TLV) and the flow angle of the velocity triangle was presented for the difference in the tip clearance and flow rate. As the flow rate increased, the differences in the aerodynamic performance induced by the tip clearance ratio decreased. As the tip clearance ratio increased, the size of the TLV increased and gradually moved in the circumferential direction to interfere with the main flow at the low flow rate. Meanwhile, the size of the TLV was similar and gradually moved in the axial direction even if the tip clearance ratio increased at the high flow rate. The pressure fluctuations were observed by the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) analysis to compare and analyze internal flow characteristics at the stall region and design point. The static pressure was converted to the appropriate magnitude. The locations of the highest magnitude were shown to be different at the stall region and the design point, respectively."
Vibration control of multi-story building structure by hybrid control using tuned liquid damper and active mass damper,"This study proposes a hybrid control methodology that combines tuned liquid damper (TLD) and active mass damper (AMD) to suppress vibrations of multi-story building structure effectively. To this end, a dynamic model that can predict the vibration of multi-story building structure coupled with TLD and AMD is derived using the energy approach. The TLD that is mainly designed to suppress the main natural mode is developed with a multi-degree-of-freedom model to investigate the effect of the TLD on natural modes of structure numerically. The AMD is an active vibration controller that can suppress remaining resonant peaks, including ones resulting from the application of the TLD as well as other higher modes of interest. In this way, the proposed control can utilize the advantages of TLD and AMD simultaneously. We set up an experimental apparatus to verify the performance of the hybrid control methodology. The numerical and experimental results show that the proposed hybrid control method can successfully suppress the vibrations of multi-story building structure. The dynamic model derived in this study can also accurately predict the actual behavior of the system."
A novel chaotic manta-ray foraging optimization algorithm for thermo-economic design optimization of an air-fin cooler,"This research study aims to introduce chaos theory into the Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) Algorithm and optimize a real-world design problem through the chaos-enhanced versions of this method. Manta Ray Foraging Optimization algorithm is a bio-inspired swarm intelligence-based metaheuristic algorithm simulating the distinctive food search behaviors of the manta rays. However, MRFO suffers from some intrinsic algorithmic inefficiencies such as slow and premature convergence and unexpected entrapment to the local optimum points in the search domain like most of the metaheuristic algorithms in the literature. Recently, random numbers generated by chaos theory have been incorporated into the metaheuristic algorithms to solve these problems. More than twenty chaotic maps are applied to the base algorithm and ten best performing methods are considered for performance evaluation on high-dimensional optimization test problems. Forty test problems comprising unimodal and multimodal functions have been solved by chaotic variants of MRFO and extensive statistical analysis is performed. Furthermore, thermo-economic design optimization of an air-fin cooler is maintained by the chaotic MRFO variants to assess their optimization capabilities over complex engineering design problems. Ten decisive design variables of an air fin cooler are optimized in terms of total annual cost rates and optimum solutions obtained by five best chaotic MRFO algorithms are compared to the preliminary design. A significant improvement is observed in the objective function values when MRFO with chaotic operators is applied to this considered thermal design problem."
COvid-19 and high-dose VITamin D supplementation TRIAL in high-risk older patients (COVIT-TRIAL): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"With the lack of effective therapy, chemoprevention, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, focusing on the immediate repurposing of existing drugs gives hope of curbing the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent unbiased genomics-guided tracing of the SARS-CoV-2 targets in human cells identified vitamin D among the three top-scoring molecules manifesting potential infection mitigation patterns. Growing pre-clinical and epidemiological observational data support this assumption. We hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation may improve the prognosis of COVID-19. The aim of this trial is to compare the effect of a single oral high dose of cholecalciferol versus a single oral standard dose on all-cause 14-day mortality rate in COVID-19 older adults at higher risk of worsening."
Numerical simulation of the effect of waves on cavity dynamics for oblique water entry of a cylinder,"The water entry process associated with complicated unsteady structures, with consideration of the influence of the waves, is not well studied. In the present work, the oblique water entry of a cylinder under different regular waves is numerically investigated. The volume of fluid (VOF) method and the sub-grid scale (SGS) stress model based on the large eddy simulation (LES) method are adopted for the 3-D simulation with six degrees of freedom. The present numerical model is based on a wave model, and as shown by the previous work that the predicted cavity evolution in the calm water agrees well with the experimental results. The present model is validated and it is shown that it could be used to predict the correct wave periods and fluctuations. The cavity evolution mechanism, the dynamic characteristics and the vortex structures are analyzed. The cavity of the water entry with waves closes more quickly than in the calm water case. Finally, several parametric studies of the water entry with different wave heights and water entry locations are carried out. The results provide insights into the effects of the waves on the cavity dynamics for oblique water entry problems."
Reflections on the 7th international Jerusalem conference on health policy in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak,"In 2019, a conference in Israel showcased new frontiers in technology in healthcare, highlighting research conducted in Israel as well as across the globe. At the time, no one realized how critical—and ubiquitous—some of these technologies would become. In the wake of a global pandemic, the ability to provide healthcare remotely has become ever more important. We explore some Israeli innovations and consider how healthcare may be permanently changed."
Generic security analysis framework for quantum secure direct communication,"Quantum secure direct communication provides a direct means of conveying secret information via quantum states among legitimate users. The past two decades have witnessed its great strides both theoretically and experimentally. However, the security analysis of it still stays in its infant. Some practical problems in this field to be solved urgently, such as detector efficiency mismatch, side-channel effect and source imperfection, are propelling the birth of a more impeccable solution. In this paper, we establish a new framework of the security analysis driven by numerics where all the practical problems may be taken into account naturally. We apply this framework to several variations of the DL04 protocol considering real-world experimental conditions. Also, we propose two optimizing methods to process the numerical part of the framework so as to meet different requirements in practice. With these properties considered, we predict the robust framework would open up a broad avenue of the development in the field."
Analytic phase structures and thermodynamic curvature for the charged AdS black hole in alternative phase space,"In this paper, we visit the thermodynamic criticality and thermodynamic curvature of the charged AdS black hole in a new phase space. It is shown that when the square of the total charge of the charged black hole is considered as a thermodynamic quantity, the charged AdS black hole also admits a van der Waals-type critical behavior without the help of thermodynamic pressure and thermodynamic volume. Based on this, we study the fine phase structures of the charged AdS black hole with fixed AdS background in the new framework. On the one hand, we give the phase diagram structures of the charged AdS black hole accurately and analytically, which fills up the gap in dealing with the phase transition of the charged AdS black holes by taking the square of the charge as a thermodynamic quantity. On the other hand, we analyse the thermodynamic curvature of the black hole in two coordinate spaces. The thermodynamic curvatures obtained in two different coordinate spaces are equivalent to each other and are also positive. Based on an empirical conclusion under the framework of thermodynamic geometry, we speculate that when the square of charge is treated as an independent thermodynamic quantity, the charged AdS black hole is likely to present a repulsive between its molecules. More importantly, based on the thermodynamic curvature, we obtain a universal exponent at the critical point of phase transition."
Comparison of improved TMD and CGC frameworks in forward quark dijet production,"For studying small-x gluon saturation in forward dijet production in high-energy dilute-dense collisions, the improved TMD (ITMD) factorization formula was recently proposed. In the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) framework, it represents the leading term of an expansion in inverse powers of the hard scale. It contains the leading-twist TMD factorization formula relevant for small gluon’s transverse momentum kt, but also incorporates an all-order resummation of kinematical twists, resulting in a proper matching to high-energy factorization at large kt. In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of the ITMD formula quantitatively, for the case of quark dijet production in high-energy proton-proton(p+p) and proton-nucleus (p+A) collisions at LHC energies. We do so by comparing the quark-antiquark azimuthal angle ∆ϕ distribution to that obtained with the CGC formula. For a dijet with each quark momentum pt much larger than the target saturation scale, Qs, the ITMD formula is a good approximation to the CGC formula in a wide range of azimuthal angle. It becomes less accurate as the jet pt’s are lowered, as expected, due to the presence of genuine higher-twists contributions in the CGC framework, which represent multi-body scattering effects absent in the ITMD formula. We find that, as the hard jet momenta are lowered, the accuracy of ITMD start by deteriorating at small angles, in the high-energy-factorization regime, while in the TMD regime near ∆ϕ = π, very low values of pt are needed to see differences between the CGC and the ITMD formula. In addition, the genuine twists corrections to ITMD become visible for higher values of pt in p + A collisions, compared to p+p collisions, signaling that they are enhanced by the target saturation scale."
Bootstrapping boundary-localized interactions,"We study conformal boundary conditions for the theory of a single real scalar to investigate whether the known Dirichlet and Neumann conditions are the only possibilities. For this free bulk theory there are strong restrictions on the possible boundary dynamics. In particular, we find that the bulk-to-boundary operator expansion of the bulk field involves at most a ‘shadow pair’ of boundary fields, irrespective of the conformal boundary condition. We numerically analyze the four-point crossing equations for this shadow pair in the case of a three-dimensional boundary (so a four-dimensional scalar field) and find that large ranges of parameter space are excluded. However a ‘kink’ in the numerical bounds obeys all our consistency checks and might be an indication of a new conformal boundary condition."
Correlation functions in massive Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds and tests of dualities,"In this paper we discuss correlation function computations in massive topological Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds, extending old results of Vafa [1]. We then apply these computations to provide further tests of the nonabelian mirrors proposal and two-dimensional Hori-Seiberg dualities with (S)O± gauge groups and their mirrors."
Pentagon functions for scattering of five massless particles,"We complete the analytic calculation of the full set of two-loop Feynman integrals required for computation of massless five-particle scattering amplitudes. We employ the method of canonical differential equations to construct a minimal basis set of transcendental functions, pentagon functions, which is sufficient to express all planar and nonplanar massless five-point two-loop Feynman integrals in the whole physical phase space. We find analytic expressions for pentagon functions which are manifestly free of unphysical branch cuts. We present a public library for numerical evaluation of pentagon functions suitable for immediate phenomenological applications."
Near conformal perturbation theory in SYK type models,"We present a systematic procedure to extract the dynamics of the low energy soft mode in SYK type models with a single energy scale J and emergent reparametrization symmetry in the IR. This is given in the framework of the perturbative scheme of arXiv:1608.07567 based on a specific (off-shell) breaking of conformal invariance in the UV, adjusted to yield the exact large-N saddle point. While this breaking term formally vanishes on-shell, it has a non-trivial effect on correlation functions and the effective action. In particular, it leads to the Schwarzian action with a specific coupling to bi-local matter. The method is applied to the evaluation of O(1) corrections to the correlation function of bi-locals. As a byproduct we confirm precise agreement with the explicit, symmetry breaking procedure. We provide a verification in the large q limit (Liouville theory), where the correlators can be calculated exactly at all length scales. In this case, our scheme illuminates how the enhanced O(J) and the subleading O(1) contributions originate from the Schwarzian dynamics of the soft mode and its interaction with h = 2 (bi-local) matter."
Light dark photon dark matter from inflation,We discuss the possibility of producing a light dark photon dark matter through a coupling between the dark photon field and the inflaton. The dark photon with a large wavelength is efficiently produced due to the inflaton motion during inflation and becomes non-relativistic before the time of matter-radiation equality. We compute the amount of production analytically. The correct relic abundance is realized with a dark photon mass extending down to 10−21 eV.
Non-supersymmetric string models from anti-D3-/D7-branes in strongly warped throats,"This article discusses model-building scenarios including anti-D3-/D7-branes, in which supersymmetry is broken spontaneously, despite having no scale at which sparticles appear and standard supersymmetry is restored. If the branes are placed on singularities at the tip of warped throats in Calabi-Yau orientifold flux compactifications, they may give rise to realistic particle spectra, closed- and open-string moduli stabilisation with a Minkowski/de Sitter uplift, and a geometrical origin for the scale hierarchies. The paper derives the low-energy effective field theory description for such scenarios, i.e. a non-linear supergravity theory for standard and constrained supermultiplets, including soft supersymmetry-breaking matter couplings. The effect of closed-string moduli stabilisation on the open-string matter sector is worked out, incorporating non-perturbative and perturbative effects, and the mass and coupling hierarchies are computed with a view towards phenomenology."
Constructing massive on-shell contact terms,"The purely on-shell approach to effective field theories requires the construction of independent contact terms. Employing the little-group-covariant massive-spinor formalism, we present the first systematic derivation of independent four-point contact terms involving massive scalars, spin-1/2 fermions, and vectors. Independent three-point amplitudes are also listed for massive particles up to spin-3. We make extensive use of the simple relations between massless and massive amplitudes in this formalism. Our general results are specialized to the (broken-phase) particle content of the electroweak sector of the standard model. The (anti)symmetrization among identical particles is then accounted for. This work opens the way for the on-shell computation of massive four-point amplitudes."
Resource prioritization and balancing for the quantum internet,"The quantum Internet enables networking based on the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. Here, methods and procedures of resource prioritization and resource balancing are defined for the quantum Internet. We define a model for resource consumption optimization in quantum repeaters, and a strongly-entangled network structure for resource balancing. We study the resource-balancing efficiency of the strongly-entangled structure. We prove that a strongly-entangled quantum network is two times more efficient in a resource balancing problem than a full-mesh network of the traditional Internet."
Combined lentiviral- and RNA-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 delivery for efficient and traceable gene editing in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells,"The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a versatile tool for functional genomics and forward genetic screens in mammalian cells. However, it has been challenging to deliver the CRISPR components to sensitive cell types, such as primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), partly due to lentiviral transduction of Cas9 being extremely inefficient in these cells. Here, to overcome these hurdles, we developed a combinatorial system using stable lentiviral delivery of single guide RNA (sgRNA) followed by transient transfection of Cas9 mRNA by electroporation in human cord blood-derived CD34+ HSPCs. We further applied an optimized sgRNA structure, that significantly improved editing efficiency in this context, and we obtained knockout levels reaching 90% for the cell surface proteins CD45 and CD44 in sgRNA transduced HSPCs. Our combinatorial CRISPR/Cas9 delivery approach had no negative influence on CD34 expression or colony forming capacity in vitro compared to non-treated HSPCs. Furthermore, gene edited HSPCs showed intact in vivo reconstitution capacity following transplantation to immunodeficient mice. Taken together, we developed a paradigm for combinatorial CRISPR/Cas9 delivery that enables efficient and traceable gene editing in primary human HSPCs, and is compatible with high functionality both in vitro and in vivo."
Tongue Nodule as Primary Manifestation of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in an Immunocompetent Patient,"Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease considered an endemic public health problem in developing countries, where it is a reportable disease. Isolated oral manifestation is rare, and its clinical manifestations are variable. In this paper we describe an unusual case of an immunocompetent patient, 57-year-old man with a painless reddish submucosal nodule located on the tongue dorsum. Microscopical analysis showed chronic inflammatory infiltrate with macrophages containing leishmania in cytoplasmic vacuoles. PCR assays confirmed the diagnosis and patient was treated with meglumine antimoniate for 30 days. Absence of the parasite was confirmed by PCR. Thirteen years after treatment, a scar fibrosis persisted on the tongue dorsum. The case reported reveals that leishmaniasis should be considered in the diagnosis of tongue nodules in immunocompetent patients."
Simultaneous qualitative detection of ClO− and NO2− based on time differentiation with a Fe2+@N-CDs probe,"A sensitive and selective fluorescent nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) probe was synthesized by using glucosamine as a single reagent in a one-step hydrothermal treatment and was also characterized by UV-Vis spectrophotometer, fluorescence spectrophotometer, transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, X-ray diffractometer (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). N-CDs exhibited a superior water solubility and an excellent fluorescence characteristic and was used as a fluorophore to measure ClO− and NO2− based on their oxidation in the presence of Fe2+. The quenching mechanism of ClO− and NO2− to the system probe of Fe2+@N-CDs was also demonstrated. The detection limit of the probe to ClO− was 0.75 μM in the linear range of 1 to 17.5 μM and for NO2− was 0.85 μM with the linear range of 2.5 to 20 μM. Speciation analysis of ClO− and NO2− could be distinguished due to the different reactive response time to the system probe of Fe2+@N-CDs, and the accuracy was further confirmed by detecting them in actual river water and tap water samples."
Reveal heterogeneous motion states in single nanoparticle trajectory using its own history,"Single particle tracking (SPT) has long been utilized for investigation of complex system dynamics such as nanoparticle-cell interaction, however, the analysis of individual particle motions is always a difficult issue. Existing methods treat each data point or fragment on the recorded trajectory as an isolated “atom” and determine their relationship based on externally predefined models or physical states, which inevitably lead to oversimplification of the associated spatiotemporal complexity. Herein, inspired by the historical analysis in social science, we propose a modeless preprocessing framework for SPT analysis based on the “history” of the particle. This new strategy consists of 3 steps: (1) assign a “history” to each data point and construct successive overlapped historical vectors; (2) perform unsupervised clustering in the vector space to find their relative differences; (3) project differences back to the trajectory by coloring each point accordingly for visualization. As a result, the inner heterogeneity of the particle motion self-emerges as a colored trajectory, exhibiting a global picture of the local state transitions and providing valuable information for further model-based analysis. Since the complexity issues at various spatiotemporal scales have attracted increasing attention, and individual objects such as single molecules, cells, vehicles and even stars in the universe could all be treated as “single particles”, this presuppositionless data preprocessing approach could help the investigations of many complex systems in fundamental research."
A Semi-Direct Monocular Visual SLAM Algorithm in Complex Environments,"A novel monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm built on the semi-direct method is proposed to deal with some problems in complex environments, such as low-texture, moving objects and perceptual aliasing. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of direct and feature-based methods. On one hand, a direct method is used to track the camera poses and solve the feature alignment. On the other hand, ORB features in keyframes are extracted and matched for optimization and loop closure. To improve the localization accuracy in dynamic environments, a motion detection module that is robust to illumination change is adopted. In addition, for the sake of resolving the loop closure detection problem in perceptual aliasing scenes, this paper fuses the spatial information between two visual words into the bag of visual words (BoVW) model and employs an improved pyramid term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scoring match scheme. Experimental results prove that the proposed algorithm behaves better performance than ORB-SLAM with regard to overall accuracy and speed in complex environments."
Charakteristika und Outcome von 70 beatmeten COVID-19-Patienten,"Eine aktuelle, deutschlandweite Datenerhebung zeigte bei beatmeten Patienten mit COVID-19 eine Letalität von über 50 %. Auch am LMU Klinikum wurde eine große Anzahl an Patienten mit COVID-19 mit teils erheblicher Erkrankungsschwere intensivmedizinisch behandelt."
Building a Data Linkage Foundation for Mother–Child Pharmacoepidemiology Research,"Expanding our understanding of the effects of maternal medication exposure through research is a public health priority and will help inform both clinical and policy decision making, ultimately improving outcomes for pregnant women and their children."
Multifunctionality and Biodiversity of Forest Ecosystems,"This article dwells upon the current understanding of the multifunctionality of forest ecosystems and links between multifunctionality and biodiversity, as well as the trade-offs and synergy between the ecosystem functions (EFs) and services of forests. The relevance of studying ecosystem services (ES’s) is determined by the modern societal needs that have emerged as a result of global economic and population growth. Forest ecosystems provide multiple services simultaneously; i.e., they possess a multifunctionality trait. The majority of studies, however, focus on the relationships between biodiversity and individual ES’s. Therefore, the impact of biodiversity loss on ES’s is greatly underestimated due to the underdeveloped methodology and tools taking into account the multifunctionality of ecosystems. We propose a conceptual scheme of the linkages among biodiversity, multiple functions, and multiple services, including the factors affecting these links. The interdisciplinary concept of links and their introduction to support administrative decision-making necessitates addressing the following: identifying informative indicators of the links and assessing the synergies and trade-offs between various EFs. Reaching those objectives will allow us not only to obtain new fundamental knowledge about processes involved in the functioning of forest ecosystems, but also create markets for ES’s that have not been considered marketable previously and ensure steady, sustainable forest use."
Depth of Peat Burning and Carbon Loss during an Underground Forest Fire,"Among forest fires, underground (peat) fires lead in terms of the amount of material burned per unit area and, consequently, the impact on climate change, but they differ in the complexity of assessing the loss of soil carbon and its emissions to the atmosphere. Using the example of the 2010 forest and peat fire in Moscow oblast (an area of 9 ha with a variable original tree-stand composition), the depth of burnout and loss of soil carbon were determined by reconstructing the prefire soil surface along the root collar of stumps, as well as comparing the characteristics of peat on the burned and adjacent areas. The average (median) burnout depth was 15 ± 8 (14) cm, varying in different areas from 13 ± 5 (11) to 20 ± 9 (19) cm. The burnout depth increased with the relative surface height and was maximum in areas with a predominance of aspen. Based on the data of the layer-by-layer determination of the bulk density, ash content, and carbon content in peat, the dependences of the carbon stock on the peat thickness are obtained. Based on them, and according the depth of burning, the carbon losses are estimated, which amount to an average (median) of 9.8 ± 5.57 (9.22) kg m–2 for the burned-out areas, varying in different areas from 8.61 ± 3.75 (7.39) to 12.9 ± 6.18 (12.3) kg m–2, which is equivalent to a one-time emission of almost 400 t СО2 ha—1 and at least 1.5 times higher than the possible release of CO2 into the atmosphere from the loss of carbon biomass of a growing stand with a stem wood stock of more than 280 m3 ha–1. The results correspond to the upper limit of estimates of soil carbon losses obtained by foreign authors and confirm the underestimation of the factor of underground (peat) fires in the boreal zone in comparison with the tropics and in general when considering the influence of forest and peatland ecosystems on the gas composition of the atmosphere and climate."
Role of an Altitudinal Zonal Basis and Remote Sensing Data in the Sustainable Management of Mountain Forests,"This paper substantiates the necessity of improving the principles of using natural basis for ecosystem-focused forest management in mountain conditions using all the collected knowledge, regional databases, and new remote sensing facilities. The results of applying the spectral features of vegetation using the thermal range for studying the altitudinal differentiation of forest cover are given based on the example of the mountains of the Altai-Sayan region. Thus, forest-steppe, subtaiga light-coniferous small-leaved deciduous, mountain dark coniferous chern, mountain dark coniferous taiga, and subalpine classes of altitudinal belt complexes (ABC) can be defined in the Yenisei part of the Sayans. Particular forest-management systems should be used for each of them, taking into account the natural features of forests and their management purpose. One important task for mountain forestry and whole multipurpose forest use is to improve the ecological and geographical basis and present it in the form of medium-scale maps, which reflect not only the formational composition of forest cover, but also the altitudinal classes of ecosystems. Modern satellite remote sensing systems coupled with GIS technologies open up new possibilities for forest cover inventory, monitoring, and study methods. This makes it possible to introduce a high-quality natural basis into forest management, which is currently highly relevant at all levels of forest planning: from exploitation projects for separate forest plots to forest plans of federal subjects of the Russian Federation."
Net Primary Production of Carbon in Pine Forests on European North-East of Russia (Republic of Komi),"The accumulation of carbon of organic matter by forest phytocenoses during photosynthesis is their most important function, mitigating climate change on the Earth. The literature provides data that the territory of the Russian Federation is a large sink of atmospheric carbon. However, the estimates of the sink, as well as the values ​​of the net primary production (NPP) of forest ecosystems, vary widely. This paper presents materials describing the net carbon production of phytomass in pine forests of different types of growing conditions in the northern and middle taiga of the Komi Republic. Premature, mature, and old-growth pine forests of green moss, lichen, and sphagnum types have been studied at forest stations. The carbon sequestration by the forest stand is assessed by biological productivity using sample trees. The regression equations for the dependence of the increments of individual organs of a sample tree on the stem diameter at a height of 1.3 m are composed. A statistically significant relationship is found between these parameters, characterized by high trend approximation values ​​varying from 0.44 to 0.99 (at 95% significance level). It is calculated that, under the conditions of the European Russian northeast, the NPP of carbon in pine phytocenoses varies within the range of 1.9–4.5 t C ha–1 year–1. It is established that the tree stand accounts for 32–73% of the total NPP. With increasing soil moisture and moving northward, the participation of plants in the ground vegetation increases in the total NPP. It is noted that a significant part of the NPP of carbon of the tree layer of pine forests is formed by the photosynthetic apparatus and the stem wood. Based on these data, the conversion relations between NPP and wood volume/carbon stock in the stand for pine forests of the northern and middle taiga are derived."
Climatogenic Restrictions of Arid Forestry,"The creation of protective forests is especially difficult in arid regions of Russia, and global warming can further affect their ability to persist. In this study climatogenic changes in forest growing conditions are examined in the Northern Caspian region, taking into account that the functioning of forest stands is limited on historically treeless lands: authomorphic meliorated solonetz soils and calcisoles (by the extra moisture of winter snowfalls and the humidity levels during the vegetational period), as well as intrazonal hydromorphic gleyic kastanozems of the local relief depressions (by the inexhaustibility of freshwater lenses in salty subterranean waters based on its periodic resupply by the spring surface flow every 2–4 years). For forest stands established on automorphic soils, a prolonged period of annual draughts and mild winters with little snow deposit in forest lands has proven to be the most dangerous. During such periods, the large-scale death of trees is observed and many forest stands are ruined. For forest stands on hydromorphic soils, such periods prove to be just as dangerous because of the 15-year-long absence of spring surface flow. Such a climatogenic scenario of long-termed deterioration of forest growing conditions in the Northern Caspian region is similar to the southernmost regions of Russia that are currently totally unable to sustain forests, with unstable snow cover and frequent draughts."
Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation of Titanium Alloys To Protect Adjacent Aluminum Alloys Element from Contact Corrosion,"The plasma electrolytic oxidation of the titanium alloy OT4 was studied; the characteristics of the resulting coatings were determined–thickness, breakdown potential, corrosion current density, and X-ray phase; micro-X-ray spectral analysis was performed, and the morphology of the coatings was studied by scanning electron microscopy. We studied the effect of plasma electrolytic oxidation of OT4 and additional treatment of PEO coatings on the corrosion resistance of the aluminum alloy D16 (An.Ox.nchr, anodic treatment in chromate solutions) in contact with the titanium alloy in structurally similar samples."
Adsorption of a Series of Thiadiazole Derivatives on Low-Carbon Steel from Sulfuric Acid Solutions,"The adsorption and protective properties of three thiadiazole derivatives on St3 steel from 5 and 15% H2SO4 solutions have been studied by the method of impedance spectroscopy. A series of changes in absorbability and protective effect depending on the compound structure have been determined. Equivalent electrical circuits have been suggested, and numerical values of circuit parameters have been determined at the compounds' different concentrations. The degree of occupation of the electrode surface by the studied compounds at the corrosion potential has been calculated."
Effect of Corrosive Metabolites Produced by the Bacterium Escherichia coli on Zinc Corrosion,"A by-product of oxygen biotransformation during the life of bacteria is the superoxide ion \({\text{O}}_{2}^{ - }\), which quite easily, including nonenzymatically, can turn into the stable product H2O2, which, as is well known, may exhibit corrosive properties for metals. Thus, the vital products of bacterial can act on a metal not only as chemical agents, they can also electrochemically stimulate corrosion. To identify the nature of the elementary stages of biocorrosion, an attempt was made to simulate electrochemical corrosion of zinc using well-known electrochemical methods. Zinc corrosion occurs by two electrochemical mechanisms: corrosion by oxygen depolarization and oxidation of zinc by hydrogen peroxide. The limiting stage of the corrosion process is diffusion of the oxidizing agents to the zinc surface."
Corrosion Behavior of Aluminum alloy AD31 in the Presence of Potassium Permanganate in an Acidic Media,"The chronoamperometry method was used to study corrosion of the aluminum alloy AD31 in the presence of potassium permanganate in chloride-containing acidic media. A rotating disk electrode was used to establish the kinetic features, and the mechanisms of cathodic oxygen reduction on AD31 in permanganate-containing acidic solutions were proposed."
Nonreciprocal coherent coupling of nanomagnets by exchange spin waves,"Nanomagnets are widely used to store information in non-volatile spintronic devices. Spin waves can transfer information with low-power consumption as their propagations are independent of charge transport. However, to dynamically couple two distant nanomagnets via spin waves remains a major challenge for magnonics. Here we experimentally demonstrate coherent coupling of two distant Co nanowires by fast propagating spin waves in an yttrium iron garnet thin film with sub-50 nm wavelengths. Magnons in two nanomagnets are unidirectionally phase-locked with phase shifts controlled by magnon spin torque and spin-wave propagation. The coupled system is finally formulated by an analytical theory in terms of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our results are attractive for analog neuromorphic computing that requires unidirectional information transmission."
Pomegranate-like C60@cobalt/nitrogen-codoped porous carbon for high-performance oxygen reduction reaction and lithium-sulfur battery,"Porous carbon materials play essential roles in electrocatalysis and electrochemical energy storage. It is of significant importance to rationally design and tune their porous structure and active sites for achieving high electrochemical activity and stability. Herein, we develop a novel approach to tune the morphology of porous carbon materials (PCM) by embedding fullerene C60, achieving improved performance of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery. Owing to the strong interaction between C60 and imidazole moieties, pomegranate-like hybrid of C60-embedded zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) precursor is synthesized, which is further pyrolyzed to form C60-embedded cobalt/nitrogen-codoped porous carbon materials (abbreviated as C60@Co-N-PCM). Remarkably, the unique structure of C60@Co-N-PCM offers excellent ORR electrocatalytic activity and stability in alkaline solutions, outperforming the commercial Pt/C (20 wt.%) catalyst. Besides, C60@Co-N-PCM as a novel cathode delivers a high specific capacity of ∼ 900 mAh·g−1 at 0.2 C rate in Li-S batteries, which is superior to the pristine ZIF-67-derived PCM without embedding C60."
Geochemical constraints on the evolution of the lithospheric mantle beneath central and southern Vietnam,"We present comprehensive geochemical and isotopic (Sr-Nd-Hf) datasets for two suites of ultramafic rock in Vietnam, namely xenoliths of spinel lherzolite entrained in late Cenozoic alkali basalts, and Paleozoic ultramafic massifs that occur along the Tam Ky-Phuoc Son suture zone in central and southern Vietnam. The ultramafic massifs are the products of high degrees of melt extraction (up to 40%), and have relatively low equilibrium temperatures of 603 to 778 °C. The lherzolites are residues of relatively low degrees of fractional melting (< 1% up to 20%). The compositions of minerals in the xenoliths reveal that the late Cenozoic lithospheric mantle beneath central and southern Vietnam was hotter (825–1058 °C) than during the Paleozoic. The calculated trace element patterns of metasomatic melts that equilibrated with clinopyroxenes in the LREE-enriched xenoliths show enrichments in Th, U, and LREEs, and depletions in Nb. These data, together with the elevated Ti/Eu ratios of the clinopyroxenes, reflect the role of hydrous silicate melts as the main agents of metasomatism. The ultramafic rocks of the Paleozoic massifs contain spinel with TiO2 contents higher than expected for residual spinel, which suggests the influence of boninitic melt(s). In the lherzolite xenoliths, the clinopyroxenes have MORB-like depleted Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions (87Sr/86Sr = 0.70241–0.70416; εNd = +6.6 to 12.3; εHf = +13.1 to 25.1), suggesting metasomatic melts/fluids from upwelling asthenosphere. We suggest that subduction of the (Paleo-)Pacific Plate and continental collision during the Permian–Triassic played key roles in lithospheric replacement and thinning beneath central and southern Vietnam."
Spatial distribution and determinants of PM2.5 in China’s cities: fresh evidence from IDW and GWR,"While numerous studies have explored the spatial patterns and underlying causes of PM2.5 at the urban scale, little attention has been paid to the spatial heterogeneity affecting PM2.5 factors. In order to enrich this research field, we collected PM2.5 monitoring data from 367 cities across China in 2016 and combined inverse distance weighted interpolation (IDW) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. As a result, we could dynamically describe the spatial distribution pattern of urban PM2.5 at monthly, seasonal, and annual scales and investigate the spatial heterogeneity of the influential factors on urban PM2.5. Furthermore, in order to make the result more scientific and reasonable, the paper used selection.gwr function and bw.gwr function, respectively, to optimize model, thereby avoiding local collinearity caused by independent variables. The main results are as follows: (1) PM2.5 in Chinese cities is characterized as time-space non-equilibrium pattern. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River corner region, the Pearl River Delta region, and the northeast region have formed a pollution-concentrating core area with Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region as the axis, which brings greater difficulties and challenges to PM2.5 governance. (2) The effects of various factors of socio-economic activities on the concentration of PM2.5 have significant spatial heterogeneity among Chinese cities. (3) There is an inverted “U” curve between economic growth and PM2.5. When the per capita income reaches 47,000 yuan, the PM2.5 emission reaches the peak, which proves the existence of environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). These findings could provide a significant reference for policy makers in China to facilitate targeted and differentiated regional PM2.5 governance measures."
Meta-control of the exploration-exploitation dilemma emerges from probabilistic inference over a hierarchy of time scales,"Cognitive control is typically understood as a set of mechanisms that enable humans to reach goals that require integrating the consequences of actions over longer time scales. Importantly, using routine behaviour or making choices beneficial only at short time scales would prevent one from attaining these goals. During the past two decades, researchers have proposed various computational cognitive models that successfully account for behaviour related to cognitive control in a wide range of laboratory tasks. As humans operate in a dynamic and uncertain environment, making elaborate plans and integrating experience over multiple time scales is computationally expensive. Importantly, it remains poorly understood how uncertain consequences at different time scales are integrated into adaptive decisions. Here, we pursue the idea that cognitive control can be cast as active inference over a hierarchy of time scales, where inference, i.e., planning, at higher levels of the hierarchy controls inference at lower levels. We introduce the novel concept of meta-control states, which link higher-level beliefs with lower-level policy inference. Specifically, we conceptualize cognitive control as inference over these meta-control states, where solutions to cognitive control dilemmas emerge through surprisal minimisation at different hierarchy levels. We illustrate this concept using the exploration-exploitation dilemma based on a variant of a restless multi-armed bandit task. We demonstrate that beliefs about contexts and meta-control states at a higher level dynamically modulate the balance of exploration and exploitation at the lower level of a single action. Finally, we discuss the generalisation of this meta-control concept to other control dilemmas."
Schülerperspektiven auf Ergänzungsstunden als Maßnahme individueller Förderung,"Individuelle Förderung gilt als Merkmal guten Unterrichts, wobei individuelle Förderung als Sammelbegriff zu verstehen ist und in bildungswissenschaftlichen, bildungspolitischen und schulpraktischen Auseinandersetzungen unterschiedlich genutzt wird. Grundsätzlich ist darauf zu verweisen, dass individuelle Förderung unterbeforscht ist. Dies gilt sowohl zur Umsetzung individueller Förderung im Allgemeinen wie auch zu konkreten schulbezogenen Maßnahmen im Speziellen. Mit dieser Studie wird die Maßnahme ‚Ergänzungsstunden‘ (NRW) untersucht. Die ‚Ergänzungsstunden‘ sind an nordrhein-westfälischen Gymnasien Pflichtstunden, die verstärkt zur individuellen Förderung genutzt werden sollen und an den einzelnen Schulen unterschiedlich eingesetzt werden können. Während die Perspektive der Lehrpersonen auf individuelle Förderung bereits untersucht wurde, liegen Daten von Schüler/innen nur in sehr geringem Maße vor. So ist nicht beforscht, wie Schüler/innen Maßnahmen individueller Förderung wahrnehmen und wie sie diese bewerten. Dies erscheint aber insofern als relevant, als dass Schüler/innen wichtige Impulse für Schulentwicklungsprozesse unterstützen können, wenn sie in die Evaluation solcher Angebote einbezogen werden. Diese Studie stellt einen ersten Versuch dar, diese Forschungslücke zu schließen. 62 Unter- und Mittelstufen-Schüler/innen (Jahrgangsstufe 6–8) eines Gymnasiums wurden in zehn Gruppendiskussionen zur Umsetzung der ‚Ergänzungsstunden‘ an ihrer Schule befragt. Die Daten wurden mittels qualitativer Inhaltsanalyse ausgewertet. Die Daten verdeutlichen, dass die Befragten die Angebote individueller Förderung differenziert einschätzen können. Aus den Äußerungen der Schüler/innen lassen sich Impulse für die Schul- und Unterrichtsentwicklung ableiten, aber auch Implikationen für die weitere schulische und wissenschaftliche Praxis beschreiben."
"Isthmin1, a secreted signaling protein, acts downstream of diverse embryonic patterning centers in development","Extracellular signals play essential roles during embryonic patterning by providing positional information in a concentration-dependent manner, and many such signals, like Wnt, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), Hedgehog (Hh), and retinoic acid, act by being secreted into the extracellular space, thereby triggering receptor-mediated responses in other cells. Isthmin1 (ism1) is a secreted protein whose gene expression pattern coincides with that of early dorsal determinants, nodal ligand genes like sqt and cyc, and with fgf8 during various phases of zebrafish development. Ism1 functions in early embryonic patterning and development are poorly understood; however, it has recently been shown to interact with nodal pathway genes to control organ asymmetry in chicken. Here, we show that misexpression of ism1 deletion constructs disrupts embryonic patterning in zebrafish and exhibits genetic interactions with both Fgf and nodal signaling. Unlike Fgf and nodal pathway mutants, CRISPR/Cas9-engineered ism1 mutants did not show obvious developmental defects. Further, in vivo single molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) showed that Ism1 diffuses freely in the extra-cellular space, with a diffusion coefficient similar to that of Fgf8a; however, our measurements do not support direct molecular interactions between Ism1 and either nodal ligands or Fgf8a in the developing zebrafish embryo. Together, data from gain- and loss-of-function experiments suggest that zebrafish Ism1 plays a complex role in regulating extracellular signals during early embryonic development."
Archaeal communities of low and high microbial abundance sponges inhabiting the remote western Indian Ocean island of Mayotte,"Marine sponges are abundant and ecologically important components of coral reefs and have been shown to harbour exceptionally high microbial densities, which can differ substantially among sponge species. However, this dichotomy between high and low microbial abundance (HMA, LMA) sponges is still not fully understood, particularly as concerns the archaeal community. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing (using 454-pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene) how the archaeal community varies among known LMA (Stylissa carteri, and Stylissa massa), known HMA (Hyrtios erectus and Xestospongia testudinaria) and unknown HMA/LMA status sponge species (Ectyoplasia coccinea, Paratetilla bacca and Petrosia aff. spheroida) collected in a remote location in which very few sponge microbial composition studies have been previously performed (Mayotte, Comores archipelago, France) and comparing the results with those reported in four other geographical areas. Based on archaeal community composition, the known LMA sponges formed a distinct cluster together with Paratetilla bacca, Ectyoplasia coccinea and seawater while the known HMA sponge X. testudinaria formed a cluster with Petrosia aff. spheroida. The known HMA sponge H. erectus, in turn, had an intermediate archaeal community between HMA sponges and sediment samples. In addition to the above, we also showed significant compositional congruence between archaeal and bacterial communities sampled from the same sponge individuals. HMA sponges were mainly dominated by members assigned to the genus Nitrosopumilus while LMA sponges were mainly dominated by members assigned to the genus Cenarchaeum. In general, there was no clear difference in richness between HMA and LMA sponges. Evenness, however, was higher in HMA than LMA sponges. Whilst the present study corroborates some of the traits commonly associated with the HMA–LMA dichotomy (higher evenness in Mayotte HMA sponges), this was not consistent across geographical areas showing that more research is needed to fully understand the HMA/LMA dichotomy as concerns Archaea."
A chromosome-level reference genome of non-heading Chinese cabbage [Brassica campestris (syn. Brassica rapa) ssp. chinensis],"Non-heading Chinese cabbage (NHCC) is an important leafy vegetable cultivated worldwide. Here, we report the first high-quality, chromosome-level genome of NHCC001 based on PacBio, Hi-C, and Illumina sequencing data. The assembled NHCC001 genome is 405.33 Mb in size with a contig N50 of 2.83 Mb and a scaffold N50 of 38.13 Mb. Approximately 53% of the assembled genome is composed of repetitive sequences, among which long terminal repeats (LTRs, 20.42% of the genome) are the most abundant. Using Hi-C data, 97.9% (396.83 Mb) of the sequences were assigned to 10 pseudochromosomes. Genome assessment showed that this B. rapa NHCC001 genome assembly is of better quality than other currently available B. rapa assemblies and that it contains 48,158 protein-coding genes, 99.56% of which are annotated in at least one functional database. Comparative genomic analysis confirmed that B. rapa NHCC001 underwent a whole-genome triplication (WGT) event shared with other Brassica species that occurred after the WGD events shared with Arabidopsis. Genes related to ascorbic acid metabolism showed little variation among the three B. rapa subspecies. The numbers of genes involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis and catabolism were higher in NHCC001 than in Chiifu and Z1, due primarily to tandem duplication. The newly assembled genome will provide an important resource for research on B. rapa, especially B. rapa ssp. chinensis."
"Ontology, neural networks, and the social sciences","The ontology of social objects and facts remains a field of continued controversy. This situation complicates the life of social scientists who seek to make predictive models of social phenomena. For the purposes of modelling a social phenomenon, we would like to avoid having to make any controversial ontological commitments. The overwhelming majority of models in the social sciences, including statistical models, are built upon ontological assumptions that can be questioned. Recently, however, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have made their way into the social sciences, raising the question whether they can avoid controversial ontological assumptions. ANNs are largely distinguished from other statistical and machine learning techniques by being a representation-learning technique. That is, researchers can let the neural networks select which features of the data to use for internal representation instead of imposing their preconceptions. On this basis, I argue that neural networks can avoid ontological assumptions to a greater degree than common statistical models in the social sciences. I then go on, however, to establish that ANNs are not ontologically innocent either. The use of ANNs in the social sciences introduces ontological assumptions typically in at least two ways, via the input and via the architecture."
Agricultural impacts of climate change in Indiana and potential adaptations,"While all sectors of the economy can be impacted by climate variability and change, the agricultural sector is arguably the most tightly coupled to climate where changes in precipitation and temperature directly control plant growth and yield, as well as livestock production. This paper analyzes the direct and cascading effects of temperature, precipitation, and carbon dioxide (CO2) on agronomic and horticultural crops, and livestock production in Indiana through 2100. Due to increased frequency of drought and heat stress, models predict that the yield of contemporary corn and soybean varieties will decline by 8–21% relative to yield potential, without considering CO2 enhancement, which may offset soybean losses. These losses could be partially compensated by adaptation measures such as changes in cropping systems, planting date, crop genetics, soil health, and providing additional water through supplemental irrigation or drainage management. Changes in winter conditions will pose a threat to some perennial crops, including tree and fruit crops, while shifts in the USDA Hardiness Zone will expand the area suitable for some fruits. Heat stress poses a major challenge to livestock production, with decreased feed intake expected with temperatures exceeding 29 °C over 100 days per year by the end of the century. Overall, continued production of commodity crops, horticultural crops, and livestock in Indiana is expected to continue with adaptations in management practice, cultivar or species composition, or crop rotation."
Accuracy assessment of global ocean tide models in the South China Sea using satellite altimeter and tide gauge data,"In this study, to meet the need for accurate tidal prediction, the accuracy of global ocean tide models was assessed in the South China Sea (0°–26°N, 99°–121°E). Seven tide models, namely, DTU10, EOT11a, FES2014, GOT4.8, HAMTIDE12, OSU12 and TPXO8, were considered. The accuracy of eight major tidal constituents (i.e., Q1, O1, P1, K1, N2, M2, S2 and K2) were assessed for the shallow water and coastal areas based on the tidal constants derived from multi-mission satellite altimetry (TOPEX and Jason series) and tide gauge observations. The root mean square values of each constituent between satellite-derived tidal constants and tide models were found in the range of 0.72–1.90 cm in the deep ocean (depth>200 m) and 1.18–5.63 cm in shallow water area (depth<200 m). Large inter-model discrepancies were noted in the Strait of Malacca and the Taiwan Strait, which could be attributable to the complicated hydrodynamic systems and the paucity of high-quality satellite altimetry data. In coastal regions, an accuracy performance was investigated using tidal results from 37 tide gauge stations. The root sum square values were in the range of 9.35–19.11 cm, with the FES2014 model exhibiting slightly superior performance."
A continuously perturbed Dirichlet energy with area-preserving stationary points that ‘buckle’ and occur in equal-energy pairs,"We exhibit a family of convex functionals with infinitely many equal-energy \(C^1\) stationary points that (i) occur in pairs \(v_{\pm }\) satisfying \(\det \nabla v_{\pm }=1\) on the unit ball B in \({\mathbb {R}}^2\) and (ii) obey the boundary condition \(v_{\pm }=\text {id}\) on \( \partial B\). When the parameter \(\epsilon \) upon which the family of functionals depends exceeds \(\sqrt{2}\), the stationary points appear to ‘buckle’ near the centre of B and their energies increase monotonically with the amount of buckling to which B is subjected. We also find Lagrange multipliers associated with the maps \(v_{\pm }(x)\) and prove that they are proportional to \((\epsilon -1/\epsilon )\ln |x|\) as \(x \rightarrow 0\) in B. The lowest-energy pairs \(v_{\pm }\) are energy minimizers within the class of twist maps (see Taheri in Topol Methods Nonlinear Anal 33(1):179–204, 2009 or Sivaloganathan and Spector in Arch Ration Mech Anal 196:363–394, 2010), which, for each \(0\le r\le 1\), take the circle \(\{x\in B: \ |x|=r\}\) to itself; a fortiori, all \(v_{\pm }\) are stationary in the class of \(W^{1,2}(B;{\mathbb {R}}^2)\) maps w obeying \(w=\text {id}\) on \(\partial B\) and \(\det \nabla w=1\) in B."
Superspreading in early transmissions of COVID-19 in Indonesia,"This paper presents a study of early epidemiological assessment of COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Indonesia. The aim is to quantify heterogeneity in the numbers of secondary infections. To this end, we estimate the basic reproduction number \(\mathscr {R}_0\) and the overdispersion parameter \(\mathscr {K}\) at two regions in Indonesia: Jakarta–Depok and Batam. The method to estimate \(\mathscr {R}_0\) is based on a sequential Bayesian method, while the parameter \(\mathscr {K}\) is estimated by fitting the secondary case data with a negative binomial distribution. Based on the first 1288 confirmed cases collected from both regions, we find a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission. The basic reproduction number \(\mathscr {R}_0\) is estimated at 6.79 and 2.47, while the overdispersion parameter \(\mathscr {K}\) of a negative-binomial distribution is estimated at 0.06 and 0.2 for Jakarta–Depok and Batam, respectively. This suggests that superspreading events played a key role in the early stage of the outbreak, i.e., a small number of infected individuals are responsible for large numbers of COVID-19 transmission. This finding can be used to determine effective public measures, such as rapid isolation and identification, which are critical since delay of diagnosis is the most common cause of superspreading events."
Comprehensive phenotyping revealed transient startle response reduction and histopathological gadolinium localization to perineuronal nets after gadodiamide administration in rats,"Gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in clinical MRI since the mid-1980s. Recently, concerns have been raised that trace amounts of Gadolinium (Gd), detected in brains even long time after GBCA application, may cause yet unrecognized clinical consequences. We therefore assessed the behavioral phenotype, neuro-histopathology, and Gd localization after repeated administration of linear (gadodiamide) or macrocyclic (gadobutrol) GBCA in rats. While most behavioral tests revealed no difference between treatment groups, we observed a transient and reversible decrease of the startle reflex after gadodiamide application. Residual Gd in the lateral cerebellar nucleus was neither associated with a general gene expression pathway deregulation nor with neuronal cell loss, but in gadodiamide-treated rats Gd was associated with the perineuronal net protein aggrecan and segregated to high molecular weight fractions. Our behavioral finding together with Gd distribution and speciation support a substance class difference for Gd presence in the brain after GBCA application."
Vitamin D moderates the interaction between 5-HTTLPR and childhood abuse in depressive disorders,"A complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors determines the individual risk of depressive disorders. Vitamin D has been shown to stimulate the expression of the tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) gene, which is the rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin production in the brain. Therefore, we investigate the hypothesis that serum vitamin D levels moderate the interaction between the serotonin transporter promotor gene polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) and childhood abuse in depressive disorders. Two independent samples from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-LEGEND: n = 1 997; SHIP-TREND-0: n = 2 939) were used. Depressive disorders were assessed using questionnaires (BDI-II, PHQ-9) and interview procedures (DSM-IV). Besides serum vitamin D levels (25(OH)D), a functional polymorphism (rs4588) of the vitamin D-binding protein is used as a proxy for 25(OH)D. S-allele carriers with childhood abuse and low 25(OH)D levels have a higher mean BDI-II score (13.25) than those with a higher 25(OH)D level (9.56), which was not observed in abused LL-carriers. This significant three-way interaction was replicated in individuals with lifetime major depressive disorders when using the rs4588 instead of 25(OH)D (p = 0.0076 in the combined sample). We conclude that vitamin D relevantly moderates the interaction between childhood abuse and the serotonergic system, thereby impacting vulnerability to depressive disorders."
Surface Tension and Density of Liquid Hot Work Tool Steel W360 by voestalpine BÖHLER Edelstahl GmbH & Co KG Measured with an Electromagnetic Levitation Apparatus,"W360 is a hot work tool steel produced by voestalpine BÖHLER Edelstahl GmbH & Co KG, a special steel producer located in Styria, Austria. Surface tension and density of liquid W360 were studied as a function of temperature in a non-contact, containerless fashion using the oscillating drop method inside an electromagnetic levitation setup. For both, surface tension and density, a linear model was adapted to present the temperature dependence of these measures, including values for the uncertainties of the fit parameters found. The data obtained are compared to pure iron (with 91 wt% the main component of W360), showing an overlap for the liquid density while there is a significant difference in surface tension (− 5.8 % at the melting temperature of pure iron of 1811 K)."
Re-investigation of the Normal Spectral Emissivity at 684.5 nm of Solid and Liquid Molybdenum,"In this work, we present normal spectral emissivity data of solid and liquid molybdenum at a wavelength of 684.5 nm. The presented results are novel measurements on molybdenum, a material, which was already measured 15 years ago by our group. The present results indicate a lower emissivity in the liquid phase. The novel measurements were done within the European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research (EMPIR) project 17IND11 Hi-TRACE. The optimized measuring system is an ohmic pulse-heating apparatus combined with microsecond Division of Amplitude polarimetry."
Relationship between serum osteopontin levels and the severity of COVID-19 infection,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute inflammatory respiratory disease. Osteopontin (OPN) is a glycoprotein expressed in various cell types, such as bone, immune, smooth muscle, epithelial and endothelial cells. It also acts as a regulator of immune response. The aim of the present study was to reveal the place of serum osteopontin levels in predicting severity among patients with COVID-19."
Deep learning detection of informative features in tau PET for Alzheimer’s disease classification,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, typically characterized by memory loss followed by progressive cognitive decline and functional impairment. Many clinical trials of potential therapies for AD have failed, and there is currently no approved disease-modifying treatment. Biomarkers for early detection and mechanistic understanding of disease course are critical for drug development and clinical trials. Amyloid has been the focus of most biomarker research. Here, we developed a deep learning-based framework to identify informative features for AD classification using tau positron emission tomography (PET) scans."
Towards selective laser sintering of objects with customized mechanical properties based on ANFIS predictions,"Recently, the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) has been used extensively in modeling of manufacturing processes to save both optimization time and manufacturing costs. ANFIS is a powerful iterative tool for optimizing non-linear and multivariable manufacturing operations. In the present study, ANFIS is used to predict the optimum manufacturing parameters in selective laser sintering (SLS) of cement-filled polyamide 12 (PA12) composite. For this purpose, a set of cement-filled PA12 test specimens is manufactured by SLS technique with 8 different values of laser power (4.5–8 Watt) and 8 different weight fractions of white cement (5 %–40 %). Mechanical characterization of cement-filled PA12 is carried out to evaluate the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), compressive strength, and flexural properties. The experimental data are then divided into two groups; one group for training the ANFIS model and the other group for checking the validity of the identified model. The built ANFIS model was validated experimentally and comparison with experimental results revealed mean relative errors of 2.92 %, 3.84 %, 4.75 %, and 3.31 % in the predictions of UTS, compressive strength, flexural modulus, and flexural yield strength, respectively."
Force attenuation properties of shear-thickening polymer (STP)-based hip protector in simulated sideways fall,"Shear-thickening polymer (STP) has a unique property of increasing its viscosity with an increase in shear strain to attenuate the application of force, implying that it can be used as a material for hip protectors. This study introduces a new hip protector composed of STP and compares its force attenuation capacity to that of other commercial hip protectors in simulated sideways falls. The performance of the STP-based hip protector was analyzed against eight commercial hip protectors (Pelican, Posey, SafeHip, Hornsby, FallSafe, HipSaver, Impact Wear (Hard), Impact Wear (Soft)). The simulated sideways fall conditions were created by a drop weight impact testing system using an anatomical hip model. The machine was dropped from a 20 or 30 cm height resulting in impact energy of 25.1 J (low) or 44.1 J (moderate), respectively. At low impact energy, the commercial hip protectors showed an attenuation range from 21.6 % to 53.3 %, and the STP-based hip pad was able to attenuate the force by 42.7 %. At moderate impact energy, the commercial hip protectors showed an attenuation range from 23 % to 54.3 %, and the STP-based hip pad was able to attenuate the force by 32.6 %. The low coefficient of variance showed a high precision in the execution of the experiments. Although the STP-based hip protector was thinner than the average of commercial soft shell pads and retained comfortable fit, it showed comparable force attenuation capacity to the commercial ones for the low impact energy test. This study highlights that STP, in combination with a polyurethane foam layer, provides the best features in energy-absorption and shunting, showing that it can be used in hip protectors to gain a competitive advantage over others."
Vibration control of multi-story building structure by hybrid control using tuned liquid damper and active mass damper,"This study proposes a hybrid control methodology that combines tuned liquid damper (TLD) and active mass damper (AMD) to suppress vibrations of multi-story building structure effectively. To this end, a dynamic model that can predict the vibration of multi-story building structure coupled with TLD and AMD is derived using the energy approach. The TLD that is mainly designed to suppress the main natural mode is developed with a multi-degree-of-freedom model to investigate the effect of the TLD on natural modes of structure numerically. The AMD is an active vibration controller that can suppress remaining resonant peaks, including ones resulting from the application of the TLD as well as other higher modes of interest. In this way, the proposed control can utilize the advantages of TLD and AMD simultaneously. We set up an experimental apparatus to verify the performance of the hybrid control methodology. The numerical and experimental results show that the proposed hybrid control method can successfully suppress the vibrations of multi-story building structure. The dynamic model derived in this study can also accurately predict the actual behavior of the system."
Simulation of response characteristic of VTVL system with hybrid rocket engine,"To determine the suitability of the control performance of the VTVL system with hybrid rocket engine, simulations were done for the vertical and horizontal motion using various engine data. In the simulation, the thrust modulation characteristics of each engine were modeled with the same second-order transfer function in all cases. The results showed that the VTVL system with HRE showed better performance in terms of vertical motion error and touch down speed. In addition, this confirms the possibility for successful VTVL flight missions using HRE. In the next step, a better control algorithm and an efficient control technique will be attempted for developing the VTVL demonstrator."
A tuning scheme of cycle reference point for gas turbine adaptive performance simulation with field data,"To minimize the simulated performance error of gas turbines, traditional adaptive methods are mainly concerned with the tuning of cycle design point and component maps given by the manufacturer, usually ignoring the fact that performance at cycle design point may not match the field data due to the deviation between test-rig conditions and field conditions. In this paper, a new tuning scheme of the cycle reference point is proposed to minimize the simulated errors simultaneously at design point and off-design points. The scheme is composed of a backward iteration algorithm and a genetic algorithm. During the backward iteration, the field data at the maximum operating condition is selected to obtain the initial cycle reference point with several undetermined parameters. Further, the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the undetermined parameters. The accuracy of the proposed method was validated by the simulated performance of a PGT25+ gas turbine."
Numerical study on the effect of the tip clearance of a 100 HP axial fan on the aerodynamic performance and unsteady stall characteristics,"In this study, a numerical analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of the tip clearance on the aerodynamic performance, internal flow characteristics, and stall region characteristics of an axial fan. Three-dimensional steady and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) calculations were conducted with a shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model. Tip clearance ratios of 0, 0.01, and 0.02 were applied to the impeller. As the tip clearance ratio increased, the aerodynamic performance of the axial fan decreased at both the design and the off-design conditions. The correlation between the tip leakage vortex (TLV) and the flow angle of the velocity triangle was presented for the difference in the tip clearance and flow rate. As the flow rate increased, the differences in the aerodynamic performance induced by the tip clearance ratio decreased. As the tip clearance ratio increased, the size of the TLV increased and gradually moved in the circumferential direction to interfere with the main flow at the low flow rate. Meanwhile, the size of the TLV was similar and gradually moved in the axial direction even if the tip clearance ratio increased at the high flow rate. The pressure fluctuations were observed by the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) analysis to compare and analyze internal flow characteristics at the stall region and design point. The static pressure was converted to the appropriate magnitude. The locations of the highest magnitude were shown to be different at the stall region and the design point, respectively."
Size effect in flexural behaviour of unidirectional GFRP composites,"In this paper, the size effect in unidirectional (UD) laminated glass-fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) composites subjected to quasi-static bending loading was investigated: the sensitivity of a specimen’s mechanical behaviour and failure mechanism to its geometry was studied. Composite beams with different numbers of 0° unidirectional plies were tested and their post-deformation structures were analysed microscopically. In the subsequent simulations, the intraply damage was modelled using continuum damage mechanics, implemented as a user-defined VUMAT subroutine in ABAQUS/Explicit, while cohesive zone elements were employed to characterize the delamination between different plies. It was observed that the flexural failure triggered the multiple delaminations; their location was studied. The influence of the size effect on the bending response of the UD composite beams was analysed in depth. The findings of the current study can be used to design modern structures made of composite materials."
Design methodology and computational fluid analysis for the printed circuit steam generator (PCSG),"To introduce the printed circuit steam generator (PCSG), the design methods were developed, and the CFD analysis was performed. The design considerations were divided into three parts: thermal sizing, structural integrity evaluation, and specific design for water channels. The thermal sizing was performed by a 1D heat transfer analysis and the channel length was increased until it satisfied the target thermal power. The structural integrity was evaluated based on the ASME code and the calculated stresses were compared to the allowable stress. The flow instability, flow maldistribution, and fouling have negative effects on the performance. In order to prevent such phenomena, the mixing channel and orifice were designed. The CFD analysis on the final design of the PCSG was performed to evaluate the steam state at the outlet and flow distribution. Although a flow maldistribution (∼12 %) was observed, the steam state at the outlet was satisfied with the operating conditions."
Moisture diffusion coefficients of a PE/PA composite membrane in an enthalpy exchanger for heat and moisture recovery,"Paper membranes have long been used in an enthalpy exchanger. However, there has been a continuous concern on the durability or the anti-bacterial performance. In this study, heat and moisture transfer characteristics of a recently-developed PE/PA (polyethylene/polyacetate) composite membrane was investigated as a possible substitute to the paper membrane. Results showed that the diffusion coefficients of the PE/PA membrane (7.7 × 10−10 m2/s to 1.8 × 10−9 m2/s) were higher than those of the paper membrane (1.8 × 10−11 m2/s to 6.0 × 10−11 m2/s). Furthermore, the diffusion coefficient increased as relative humidity increased, reached a maximum at 50 % to 60 % and then decreased. For PE/PA membrane, the sorption constant increased as temperature increased, which was the reversed trend to the paper membrane. Successful prediction of the moisture transfer effectivenesses of the separate pseudo-counter flow enthalpy exchangers further strengthened the validity of the obtained diffusion coefficients."
Investigation of oxygen and water distributions in the modified parallel-serpentine cathode channels of a unit polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell,"In this paper, the measurement of water and oxygen distributions along the modified parallel serpentine cathode flow channels has been performed using a gas chromatograph (GC). Generally, it is difficult to directly profile oxygen and water distributions where water concentration nearly reaches saturation levels. Here, the measurement of high levels of water saturation in cathode channels was carefully performed according to operating conditions such as cell voltage and air stoichiometry. GC measurement was also carried out to understand the oxygen and water distributions under channel flooding conditions. In addition, the oxygen and water vapor distributions by GC measurements for the base-line case were compared with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results. For the entrance of the flow channel, the simulated results show a good agreement with the measured results. However, some discrepancy between calculated and experimental results is found for the flow channels near the cathode outlet."
Pomegranate-like C60@cobalt/nitrogen-codoped porous carbon for high-performance oxygen reduction reaction and lithium-sulfur battery,"Porous carbon materials play essential roles in electrocatalysis and electrochemical energy storage. It is of significant importance to rationally design and tune their porous structure and active sites for achieving high electrochemical activity and stability. Herein, we develop a novel approach to tune the morphology of porous carbon materials (PCM) by embedding fullerene C60, achieving improved performance of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery. Owing to the strong interaction between C60 and imidazole moieties, pomegranate-like hybrid of C60-embedded zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) precursor is synthesized, which is further pyrolyzed to form C60-embedded cobalt/nitrogen-codoped porous carbon materials (abbreviated as C60@Co-N-PCM). Remarkably, the unique structure of C60@Co-N-PCM offers excellent ORR electrocatalytic activity and stability in alkaline solutions, outperforming the commercial Pt/C (20 wt.%) catalyst. Besides, C60@Co-N-PCM as a novel cathode delivers a high specific capacity of ∼ 900 mAh·g−1 at 0.2 C rate in Li-S batteries, which is superior to the pristine ZIF-67-derived PCM without embedding C60."
Nonreciprocal coherent coupling of nanomagnets by exchange spin waves,"Nanomagnets are widely used to store information in non-volatile spintronic devices. Spin waves can transfer information with low-power consumption as their propagations are independent of charge transport. However, to dynamically couple two distant nanomagnets via spin waves remains a major challenge for magnonics. Here we experimentally demonstrate coherent coupling of two distant Co nanowires by fast propagating spin waves in an yttrium iron garnet thin film with sub-50 nm wavelengths. Magnons in two nanomagnets are unidirectionally phase-locked with phase shifts controlled by magnon spin torque and spin-wave propagation. The coupled system is finally formulated by an analytical theory in terms of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our results are attractive for analog neuromorphic computing that requires unidirectional information transmission."
Geochemical constraints on the evolution of the lithospheric mantle beneath central and southern Vietnam,"We present comprehensive geochemical and isotopic (Sr-Nd-Hf) datasets for two suites of ultramafic rock in Vietnam, namely xenoliths of spinel lherzolite entrained in late Cenozoic alkali basalts, and Paleozoic ultramafic massifs that occur along the Tam Ky-Phuoc Son suture zone in central and southern Vietnam. The ultramafic massifs are the products of high degrees of melt extraction (up to 40%), and have relatively low equilibrium temperatures of 603 to 778 °C. The lherzolites are residues of relatively low degrees of fractional melting (< 1% up to 20%). The compositions of minerals in the xenoliths reveal that the late Cenozoic lithospheric mantle beneath central and southern Vietnam was hotter (825–1058 °C) than during the Paleozoic. The calculated trace element patterns of metasomatic melts that equilibrated with clinopyroxenes in the LREE-enriched xenoliths show enrichments in Th, U, and LREEs, and depletions in Nb. These data, together with the elevated Ti/Eu ratios of the clinopyroxenes, reflect the role of hydrous silicate melts as the main agents of metasomatism. The ultramafic rocks of the Paleozoic massifs contain spinel with TiO2 contents higher than expected for residual spinel, which suggests the influence of boninitic melt(s). In the lherzolite xenoliths, the clinopyroxenes have MORB-like depleted Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions (87Sr/86Sr = 0.70241–0.70416; εNd = +6.6 to 12.3; εHf = +13.1 to 25.1), suggesting metasomatic melts/fluids from upwelling asthenosphere. We suggest that subduction of the (Paleo-)Pacific Plate and continental collision during the Permian–Triassic played key roles in lithospheric replacement and thinning beneath central and southern Vietnam."
Reflections on the 7th international Jerusalem conference on health policy in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak,"In 2019, a conference in Israel showcased new frontiers in technology in healthcare, highlighting research conducted in Israel as well as across the globe. At the time, no one realized how critical—and ubiquitous—some of these technologies would become. In the wake of a global pandemic, the ability to provide healthcare remotely has become ever more important. We explore some Israeli innovations and consider how healthcare may be permanently changed."
"Accuracy and precision of zero-echo-time, single- and multi-atlas attenuation correction for dynamic [11C]PE2I PET-MR brain imaging","A valid photon attenuation correction (AC) method is instrumental for obtaining quantitatively correct PET images. Integrated PET/MR systems provide no direct information on attenuation, and novel methods for MR-based AC (MRAC) are still under investigation. Evaluations of various AC methods have mainly focused on static brain PET acquisitions. In this study, we determined the validity of three MRAC methods in a dynamic PET/MR study of the brain."
Numerical study on indoor environment and thermal comfort in train station waiting hall with two different air-conditioning modes,"With the increasing size of the waiting hall, the large-area use of transparent envelope materials makes the interior surface temperature of the envelope too high, which puts forward higher requirements for the control of environment and thermal comfort indoors. In this paper, the characteristics of indoor temperature distribution, relative humidity distribution and thermal comfort under the all air system (AAs) and the radiant floor cooling and wall cooling combined with air supply system (RC/ASs) were investigated in the large spaces. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method was used, and the performance of the CFD model was validated by comparing the measured results with CFD simulation results in the AAs. The numerical results clearly showed that the temperature and relative humidity indoors could satisfy the design requirement both in the AAs and RC/ASs. The indoor air distribution in most areas under the RC/ASs was more uniform based on the indoor heat and humidity requirements under the cooling load of measured day. In the AAs, the total cooling capacity of air conditioning unit was the highest when indoor thermal comfort was the best, that meant that to achieve the best working condition, the air-conditioning system need high energy consumption. Meanwhile, the RC/ASs addressed the problem that the temperature around the seated passengers in the waiting area was relatively high in the AAs. This paper will provide reference for the air conditioning system design in the similar large spaces in the future."
Season dependent effects of urban environment on circadian clock of tree sparrow (Passer montanus),"Great efforts have been made recently to understand the effect(s) of urban environments on the circadian and seasonal physiology of wild animals, but the mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. Most laboratory studies and a few studies on animals in the wild suggest alterations occur in the physiological functions of organisms in urban habitats. Here, we addressed the effects of the interaction of seasons and urban environments on clock gene expression in three tissues of tree sparrows (Passer montanus). Tree sparrows (N = 30 per site per time of year) were procured from rural and urban habitats during periods corresponding to their three physiological states, i.e., June (longest photoperiod; reproductive phase), September (equinox photoperiod; refractory phase), and December (shortest photoperiod; sensitive phase). Birds (N = 5 per time per site per month) were sampled at six time points; ZT1, ZT5, ZT9, ZT13, ZT17, and ZT21 (ZT0 = sunrise time) and clock gene expression in the hypothalamus, pineal gland, and retina was studied. Our results show that there is persistence of the circadian clock in both rural and urban birds throughout the year. In urban birds Bmal1, Npas2, Per2, and Cry1 acrophases were advanced, compared to rural birds, while Clock acrophase was delayed, depending on the tissue and time of year. This difference could be because of changes in the availability, duration, and intensity of sunlight during different times of the year and/or differential photoreceptor sensitivities, differential physiological states, or a combination of all these factors. These important results reveal, for the first time in any species, season-dependent effects of an urban environment on the molecular machinery of the circadian clock."
"Association of fruit, pericarp, and epidermis traits with surface autofluorescence in green peppers","We investigated the association of blue fluorescence (excitation at 365 nm) with the traits of the fruit, pericarp, and epidermis in green peppers. The fruits were manually classified into two groups based on fluorescence brightness. The dark fluorescence group showed the accumulation of blue-absorbing pigments and a thicker cuticular structure, suggesting epidermal development."
New modeling of 3D quaternary type BaCuZnS-graphene-TiO2 (BCZS-G-T) composite for photosonocatalytic hydrogen evolution with scavenger effect,"For the efficient evolution of hydrogen, we designed a 3D quaternary BaCuZnS-graphene-TiO2 (BCZS-G-T) composite by an ultrasonic method. Herein, we prepared a quaternary material to minimize the bandgap energy and size. We characterized the “as-prepared” composites by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The high hydrogen evolution was attributed to the 3D quaternary BCZS-G-T composite with small bandgap energy because of its high photoelectron recombination properties. In addition, we demonstrated the combination effects with photocatalytic and sonocatalytic treatments with a scavenger. This work highlights the potential application of quaternary graphene-based composites in the field of energy conversion."
Insights into the stabilization of photolabile UV-absorbers in sunscreens,"Sunscreens are used to protect human skin against harmful UV radiation. Today there is a trend towards high sun protection factors (SPF) and good UVA protection. Methods for the assessment of SPF and UVA protection involve irradiation of the product, and the photostability properties of the sunscreen have an influence on its performance. Sunscreens often contain more than one UV filter. Some photolabile UV absorbers may be stabilized by the presence of other photostable UV-absorbers. Stabilization can be achieved just by a certain optical density due to the presence of such UV-filter substances. However, photostabilization may also be caused by quenching mechanisms, such as singlet–singlet or triplet–triplet energy transfer. Investigation of butyl methoxy dibenzoylmethane and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate as photolabile sunscreens in the presence of either octocrylene or bis ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine showed that both mechanisms may apply. With the systems butyl methoxy dibenzoylmethane plus octocrylene and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate plus bis ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine the quenching mechanism appears to be predominant."

The indoor air distribution in most areas under the RC/ASs was more uniform based on the indoor heat and humidity requirements under the cooling load of measured day. In the AAs, the total cooling capacity of air conditioning unit was the highest when indoor thermal comfort was the best, that meant that to achieve the best working condition, the air-conditioning system need high energy consumption. Meanwhile, the RC/ASs addressed the problem that the temperature around the seated passengers in the waiting area was relatively high in the AAs. This paper will provide reference for the air conditioning system design in the similar large spaces in the future."
Geometry and Maximum Width of a Stable Slope Considering the Arching Effect,"The stability of an arching slope in deformable materials above strong rocks strongly depends on the shape and width of the span. Equations for a free surface problem that incorporate these two parameters were derived using a simplified two-dimensional arching slope model, and were validated using physical model tests under 1g and centrifugal conditions. The results are used to estimate the maximum excavation width for a weak claystone slope in a lignite mine, for which we calculate a safety factor of 1.31."
"An Integrated Mass Balance Approach for Assessing Hydrocarbon Resources in a Liquid-Rich Shale Resource Play: An Example from Upper Devonian Duvernay Formation, Western Canada Sedimentary Basin","Petroleum resource assessment using reservoir volumetric approach relies on porosity and oil/gas saturation characterization by laboratory tests. In liquid-rich resource plays, the pore fluids are subject to phase changes and mass loss when a drilled core is brought to the surface due to volume expansion and evaporation. Further, these two closely related volumetric parameters are usually estimated separately with gas saturation inferred by compositional complementary law, resulting in a distorted gas to oil ratio under the circumstances of liquid hydrocarbon loss from sample. When applied to liquid-rich shale resource play, this can lead to overall under-estimation of resource volume, distorted gas and oil ratio (GOR), and understated resource heterogeneity in the shale reservoir. This article proposes an integrated mass balance approach for resource calculation in liquid-rich shale plays. The proposed method integrates bulk rock geochemical data with production and reservoir parameters to overcome the problems associated with laboratory characterization of the volumetric parameters by restoring the gaseous and light hydrocarbon loss due to volume expansion and evaporation in the sample. The method is applied to a Duvernay production well (14-16-62-21W5) in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) to demonstrate its use in resource evaluation for a liquid-rich play. The results show that (a) by considering the phase behavior of reservoir fluids, the proposed method can be used to infer the quantity of the lost gaseous and light hydrocarbons; (b) by taking into account the lost gaseous and light hydrocarbons, the method generates an unbiased and representative resource potential; and (c) using the corrected oil and gas mass for the analyzed samples, the method produces a GOR estimate close to compositional characteristics of the produced hydrocarbons from initial production in 14-16-62-21W5 well."
"Microscopic and Fractal Characterization of Organic Matter within Lacustrine Shale Reservoirs in the First Member of Cretaceous Qingshankou Formation, Songliao Basin, Northeast China","Understanding the occurrences of different fractions of organic matter in shale reservoirs is very important for the evaluation of shale oil. Lacustrine organic-rich shale samples from the first member of the Cretaceous Qingshankou Formation in the Songliao Basin were analyzed with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence spectral analysis. The results show that the occurrences of different organic components are related to the fabric of samples and vary with depth. The bulk content of light components is significantly higher than heavy components and exhibits a positive relationship with quartz and feldspar contents. Both light and heavy components are distributed parallel with the lamination in microscopic view in laminated samples, and randomly in massive samples. The maximum radius of light components in most of the samples is larger than 20 µm, while it is smaller for heavy components, indicating the micro fractionation from clay/organic lamina to quartz/feldspar lamina. The depth of enrichment of light components corresponds to the oil maturity of organic matter. Both the distribution of light and heavy components fits the same fractal model, with fractal dimensions ranging between 2.2 and 2.5. The CLSM results confirm that it can be a reliable tool for the “sweet spot” exploration."
Origin and Tectonic Implications of Post-Orogenic Lamprophyres in the Sulu Belt of China,"Lamprophyre dykes that crosscut different types of ultrahigh pressure (UHP) metamorphic rocks are widely distributed in the Triassic Sulu UHP orogenic belt. Although abundant studies have been performed on these dykes, their origin and petrogenesis remain topics of controversy. This study presents the results of a detailed field-based study of petrology, whole-rock geochemistry and zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopes on lamprophyre dykes exposed in the central Sulu UHP zone, aiming at shedding lights on their petrogenesis and providing clues on the geological evolution of eastern continental China during the Cretaceous. The lamprophyres are typically porphyritic, with phenocrysts dominantly composed of amphibole and clinopyroxene set in a lamprophyric matrix. The dykes have moderate SiO2 (47.70 wt.%–60.44 wt.%), variably high MgO (2.58 wt.%–8.28 wt.%) and Fe2O3T (4.88 wt.%–9.26 wt.%) contents with high Mg# of 49–66. Geochemically, they have enriched light rare earth element (REE) and flat heavy REE patterns ((La/Gd)N=5.14–10.56; (Dy/Yb)N=1.43–1.54) with negligible Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu*=0.83–1.10), and they show enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (e.g., Ba and K) but depletion in high-field strength elements (e.g., Nb, Ti and P). In-situ zircon U-Pb geochronology reveals that the lamprophyres have concordant ages of 120–115 Ma, demonstrating that the dykes emplaced in the Early Cretaceous. These zircons have εHf(t) values ranging from −26.0 to −11.0. Inherited zircons that occur in the dykes are dated to be Neoproterozoic, in line with the protolith ages of their host (i.e., the UHP rocks). An integration of these data allows us to propose that the lamprophyres were generated during the Cretaceous, by melting of subcontinental lithospheric mantle-derived metasomatite with enriched chemical compositions underneath the North China Craton. The metasomatite was formed mainly by peridotite-fluid/melt reactions, with the fluids/melts mainly liberated from subducted Yangtze continental crust during the Triassic. Regional extension, lithospheric thinning and mantle upwelling caused by rollback of the subducted paleo-Pacific plate is considered to account for the generation of the lamprophyres as well as the extensive arc-like magmatic rocks in eastern continental China during the Early Cretaceous."
Slope Stability Analysis Based on Group Decision Theory and Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation,"A slope stability evaluation method is proposed combining group decision theory, the analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. The index weight assignment of each evaluation element is determined by group decision theory and the analytic hierarchy process, and the membership degree of each indicator is determined based on fuzzy set theory. According to the weights and memberships, the membership degrees of the criterion layer are obtained by fuzzy operations to evaluate the slope stability. The results show that (1) the evaluation method comprehensively combines the effects of multiple factors on the slope stability, and the evaluation results are accurate; (2) the evaluation method can fully leverage the experience of the expert group and effectively avoid evaluation errors caused by the subjective bias of a single expert; (3) based on a group decision theory entropy model, this evaluation method can quantitatively evaluate the reliability of expert decisions and effectively improve the efficiency of expert group discussion; and (4) the evaluation method can transform the originally fuzzy and subjective slope stability evaluation into a quantitative evaluation."
Compound plasmonic vortex generation based on spiral nanoslits,"In view of wide applications of structured light fields and plasmonic vortices, we propose the concept of compound plasmonic vortex and design several structured plasmonic vortex generators. This kind of structured plasmonic vortex generators consists of multiple spiral nanoslits and they can generate two or more concentric plasmonic vortices. Different from Laguerre-Gaussian beam, the topological charge of the plasmonic vortex in different region is different. Theoretical analysis lays the basis for the design of radially structured plasmonic vortex generators and numerical simulations for several examples confirm the effectiveness of the design principle. The discussions about the interference of vortex fields definite the generation condition for the structured vortex. This work provides a design methodology for generating new vortices using spiral nanoslits and the advanced radially structured plasmonic vortices is helpful for broadening the applications of vortex fields."
Everlasting rhodamine dyes and true deciding factors in their STED microscopy performance,"The authors took an independent and closer look at the family of red-emitting rhodamine dyes known for a decade due to their excellent performance in STED microscopy. After the family was further extended, the true grounds of this performance became clear. Small-molecule protective agents and/or auxiliary groups were attached at two different sites of the dye’s scaffold. Thus, a rhodamine core, which is already quite photostable as it is, and an intramolecular stabilizer–a 4-nitrobenzyl or a 4-nitrobenzylthio group were combined to give potentially “everlasting dyes”. The fluorescence quantum yields (Φf) and the fluorescence lifetimes (τ) of the modified dyes were thoroughly measured with comparison to those of the parent dyes. The correlation of their STED performance with photostability and fluorescence color stability under illumination in water were explored. Unexpectedly, the anaerobic GSDIM (GOC) buffer proved unhelpful with respect to STED performance. It was demonstrated that, even dyes with a Φf of only 14–17% allow STED imaging with a sufficient photon budget and good signal-to-noise ratio. For the dyes with photostabilizing groups (PSG) the Φf values are 4–5 times lower than in the reference dyes, and lifetimes τ are also strongly reduced. Noteworthy are very high fluorescence color stability and constant or even increasing fluorescence signal under photobleaching in bulk aqueous solutions, which suggests a sacrificing role of the 4-nitrobenzyl-containing moieties. Straightforward and improved recipes for “last-minute” modifications and preparations of “self-healing” red-emitting fluorescent tags are described."
Physiological and biochemical responses driven by different UV-visible radiation in Osmundea pinnatifida (Hudson) Stackhouse (Rhodophyta),"Light, or visible radiation, serves as a source of energy for photosynthesis of plants and most algae. In addition, light and ultraviolet radiation (UV-A and UV-B) act as a biological signal, triggering several cellular processes that are mediated by photoreceptors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological and biochemical responses of Osmundea pinnatifida driven by different radiations through putative photoreceptors. For this, O. pinnatifida was grown under different radiation treatments composed by high intensity of light emitted by a low pressure sodium lamp (SOX), aiming to saturate photosynthesis, which was supplemented by low intensities of visible (red, green and blue) and ultraviolet radiation (UV-A and UV-B), in order to activate photoreceptors. Growth rates, photosynthesis, antioxidant activity, polyphenols, soluble proteins, phycobiliproteins, mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and carotenoids were evaluated during the experiment. Complementary UV-A radiation positively influenced growth rates after 15 days of experiment, although the presence of a peak of blue light in this treatment can also have contributed. UV-B radiation increased the concentration of zeaxanthin and chlorophyll a. The blue light caused the accumulation of chlorophyll a, violaxanthin, phycoerythrin and polyphenols on different days of the experiment. Phycoerythrin also increased under green and red light conditions. Our results showed that some compounds can be modulated by different radiation, and the involvement of photoreceptors is suggested. In red algae, photoreceptors sensitive to red, green and blue light have been identified, however little is known about UV photoreceptors. The presence of photoreceptors sensitive to UV radiation in O. pinnatifida is discussed."
A rhodamine-based dual chemosensor for the naked-eye detection of Hg2+ and enhancement of the fluorescence emission for Fe3+,"A novel fluorescent chemosensor based on trimesoyl chloride–rhodamine (TR) was successfully synthesized. Rising chromogenic and fluorogenic spectral enhancements could be observed in trimesoyl chloride–rhodamine (TR) probes when Hg2+ and Fe3+ were added, respectively. TR has shown selectivity for Hg2+ and Fe3+ with high sensitivity due to metal ion complexation induced photophysical “turn-on” signaling responses. The detection limit towards Hg2+ was 2.46 × 10−8 M as determined by the 3σ method. At the same time, fluorogenic spectral enhancements were observed in TR, which exhibits a superior sensitive and selective recognition towards Fe3+ with 4.11 × 10−8 M of the detection limit. The test strips were used for colorimetric and simple detection towards Hg2+, which might finally enable the advancement of the Hg2+ sensor in the field of on-site detection."

High fatigue resistance of a photochromic dithienylethene embedded into the pores of a metal–organic framework (MOF),"The incorporation of photochromic dyes into porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) is an attractive way to transfer the photochromic properties of the dye to a solid crystalline material. In this work, the well-known P-type chromophore 1,2-bis[2-methylbenzo[b]thiophen-3-yl]-3,3,4,4,5,5-hexafluoro-1-cyclopentene (DTE) is embedded in three different MOFs, namely MOF-5, MIL-68(In), and MIL-68(Ga). The successful filling of the MOF pores with the DTE guest was proven by X-ray powder diffraction, while the amount of the embedded guest molecules was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), liquid-state NMR and thermal analysis (DSC/TGA). The measurements reveal an unexpectedly low filling of the MOF pores with the DTE guest (e.g. in MOF-5 only every fifth MOF pore is filled with a guest molecule) as well as an inhomogeneous loading throughout the material. Reflection spectra clearly show the transitions of the colourless open-ring and the coloured closed-ring forms of the DTE guest upon UV (λ = 365 nm), blue (λ = 405 nm) and green (λ = 535 nm) light exposure, where the latter is usually suppressed in crystalline DTE. Remarkably, no fatigue after ten switching cycles was observed and a high thermal stability of the coloured closed-ring form (at 50 °C for 1 h) was achieved."
"Mixing Characteristics of Oil Inclusions with Different Thermal Maturities in the Wenliu Uplift, Dongpu Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, North China","Multiple types of oil inclusions with different fluorescence colors have been detected in the northern Dongpu depression. Recent evidences show that these inclusions may have been trapped simultaneously or during a very short period. Therefore, whether these oils were mixed before trapping is unknown. In this study, we analyzed the petrography and fluorescence spectral characteristics of oil inclusions in the Wenliu uplift in the northern Dongpu depression, and assessed the data with the oil mixing ratio curve obtained in the previous experiment. The results show that there are three types of oil inclusions (type I, type II and type III) with yellow, green and blue fluorescence colors, corresponding to low-mature, medium-mature and high-mature oil, respectively. The “pure” oil inclusions, do exist in type II and type III group of oil inclusions, showing the medium-mature oil was generated from the source rock rather than being formed by the mixture of high-mature and low-mature end oils. Most of the oil inclusions are mixtures of high-mature and medium-mature end oils from the sub-sags to the Wenliu uplift, the mixing degree increases to close to 50%. The oil between the Qianliyuan sub-sag and the Wenliu uplift was mainly mixed by medium mature oils, whereas the oil between the Liutun sub-sag and the Wenliu uplift was mainly mixed by high mature oil."
Characteristics of the Cretaceous Magmatism in Huanghua Depression and Their Relationships with Hydrocarbon Enrichment,"The Huanghua depression located in the hinterland of the Bohai Bay Basin in eastern China is a typical area for the research of multistage magmatic activities with hydrocarbon enrichment, many high-yield wells related to igneous rocks were discovered within the Cretaceous strata in recent years. However, the spatial and temporal distribution of Cretaceous igneous rocks remains unclear, and the relationships among magmatic sequence, lithology, and hydrocarbon enrichment have been poorly studied. In order to solve these problems, core observation, logging analysis, major element analysis, zircon U-Pb chronology, oil-bearing grade statistics and reservoir spaces analysis were used to subdivide the magmatism cycles and to investigate the characteristics of igneous reservoirs. Our results show that the Mesozoic magmatism in Huanghua depression started in 140.1±1.4 Ma and could be divided into two stages including the Early Cretaceous stage and Late Cretaceous stage. The Early Cretaceous magmatism principally developed basic-intermediate rocks in the north zone, and could be subdivided into 3 cycles with their forming ages of 140, 125–119, and 118–111 Ma, respectively. By contrast, the late stage mainly developed intermediate-acid rocks centralized in the south zone and formed at 75–70 Ma. The GR and SP curves are good indicators for the contrast of different lithologies, lithofacies and for magmatic sequences division. Intensive magmatism may have an advantage to form reservoirs, since basalt in cycle III in the Early Cretaceous and dacite porphyrite in the Late Cretaceous have great exploration potential. Lithology and tectonic fractures have an important influence on the formation of reservoir spaces and hydrocarbon enrichment. The characteristics of Cretaceous magmatism and igneous reservoirs in Huanghua depression and adjacent areas are summarized, providing important information for igneous reservoirs research and oil-gas exploration in the Cretaceous in related areas."
On-chip multiphoton Greenberger—Horne—Zeilinger state based on integrated frequency combs,"One of the most important multipartite entangled states, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state (GHZ), serves as a fundamental resource for quantum foundation test, quantum communication and quantum computation. To increase the number of entangled particles, significant experimental efforts should been invested due to the complexity of optical setup and the difficulty in maintaining the coherence condition for high-fidelity GHZ state. Here, we propose an ultra-integrated scalable on-chip GHZ state generation scheme based on frequency combs. By designing several microrings pumped by different lasers, multiple partially overlapped quantum frequency combs are generated to supply as the basis for on-chip polarization-encoded GHZ state with each qubit occupying a certain spectral mode. Both even and odd numbers of GHZ states can be engineered with constant small number of integrated components and easily scaled up on the same chip by only adjusting one of the pump wavelengths. In addition, we give the on-chip design of projection measurement for characterizing GHZ states and show the reconfigurability of the state. Our proposal is rather simple and feasible within the existing fabrication technologies and we believe it will boost the development of multiphoton technologies."
Boosting Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution: Purposely Constructing Direct Z-Scheme Photoanode by Modulating the Interface Electric Field,"Ti-Fe2O3 photoanode has received widespread attention in photoelectrochemical(PEC) water spilling because of its optimized oxidative and reductive capability of composites catalyst. However, its low efficiency could limit its development. Herein, in order to improve the efficiency of PEC water spilling, the all-solid-state direct Z-scheme Ti-ZnFe2O4/Ti-Fe2O3(TZFO/Ti-Fe2O3) nanorod arrays composited with the ideal energy band structure are synthesized by modulating the Fermi level of TZFO for PEC water splitting. The photophysical methods in this work, including the Kelvin probe measurement and transient photovoltage spectroscopy(TPV) measurement, are applied to explore the migration behavior of electric charges at the enhanced interface electric field. Finally, the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism of TZFO/Ti-Fe2O3 photoanode is proved successfully. Benefiting from the desirable charge transfer at interface electric field, the TZFO/Ti-Fe2O3 exhibits the outstanding photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction(OER) performance, and the photocurrent of 60TZFO/Ti-Fe2O3 photoanode reaches 2.16 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode(RHE), which is three times higher than that of pure Ti-Fe2O3 photoanode. This work provides a facile approach of modulating interface electric field to optimize the Z-scheme charge-transfer process."
Competition between fluorescence and triplet production ruled by nitro groups in one-arm and two-arm styrylbenzene heteroanalogues,"The competition between excited state deactivation processes in mono and double-arm push–pull systems bearing pyridine, furan or thiophene (electron donors) and nitro groups (electron acceptors) was investigated in several solvents through nanosecond and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Triplet population is the main deactivation pathway for the mono-arm compounds. The large triplet production is mainly ascribed to 3(n,π*) states almost isoenergetic to S1, introduced by nitro groups, as predicted by TD-DFT calculations. The large triplet population may indeed be exploited to produce long-lived excitons for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications. Two-arm furan and thiophene derivatives instead undergo strong ultrafast intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), which is responsible for their appreciable two-photon absorption cross-sections. In this case, significant fluorescence and singlet oxygen quantum yields are obtained, making these two compounds interesting as potential traceable photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy."

Microwave-assisted synthesis of 3D Bi2MoO6 microspheres with oxygen vacancies for enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity,"Oxygen vacancies (OVs) defects in metal oxide-based photocatalysts play a crucial role in improving the charge carrier separation efficiencies to enhance the photocatalytic performances. In this work, OVs were introduced in 3D Bi2MoO6 microspheres through a facile and fast microwave-assisted method via the modulation of tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA). EPR, Raman and XPS results demonstrated that large amounts of oxygen vacancies were formed on the surface of BMO microspheres. The photocatalytic properties of the samples were studied by degradation of tetracycline (TC) under visible light. The optimal Bi2MoO6 with OVs exhibited optimum photocatalytic activity, and the degradation rate was 7.0 times higher than that of pristine Bi2MoO6. This enhancement can be attributed to the 3D structure furnishing more surface active sites and suitable OVs defects favoring the electron–hole separation. Moreover, the defective Bi2MoO6 microspheres exhibit high stability because the photocatalytic activity remains almost unchanged after 5 cycles, making them favorable for practical applications. Finally, a possible visible light photocatalysis mechanism for the degradation of TC was tentatively proposed."
Luciferase isozymes from the Brazilian Aspisoma lineatum (Lampyridae) firefly: origin of efficient pH-sensitive lantern luciferases from fat body pH-insensitive ancestors,"Firefly luciferases usually emit green-yellow bioluminescence at physiological pH values. However, under acidic conditions, in the presence of heavy metals and, at high temperatures they emit red bioluminescence. To understand the structural origin of bioluminescence colors and pH-sensitivity, about 20 firefly luciferases have been cloned, sequenced and investigated. The proton and metal-binding site responsible for pH- and metal sensitivity in firefly luciferases was shown to involve the residues H310, E311 and E354 in firefly luciferases. However, it is still unclear how and why pH-sensitivity arose and evolved in firefly luciferases. Here, we cloned and characterized two novel luciferase cDNAs from the fat body and lanterns of the Brazilian firefly Aspisoma lineatum. The larval fat body isozyme (AL2) has 545 residues, and displays very slow luminescence kinetics and a pH-insensitive spectrum. The adult lantern isozyme (AL1) has 548 residues, displays flash-like kinetics and pH and metal sensitive bioluminescence spectra, and is at least 10 times catalytically more efficient than AL2. Thermostability and CD studies showed that AL2 is much more stable and rigid than the AL1 isozyme. Multialignment and modelling studies show that the E310Q substitution (E310 in AL2 and Q310 in AL1) may have been critical for the origin of pH-sensitivity in firefly luciferases. The results indicate that the lantern efficient flash-emitting pH-sensitive luciferases arose from less efficient glow-type pH-insensitive luciferases found in the fat body of ancestral larval fireflies by enzyme structure flexibilization and substitution at position 310."
"An Optimized Random Forest Model and Its Generalization Ability in Landslide Susceptibility Mapping: Application in Two Areas of Three Gorges Reservoir, China","Numerous researches have been published on the application of landslide susceptibility assessment models; however, they were only applied in the same areas as the models were originated, the effect of applying the models to other areas than the origin of the models has not been explored. This study is purposed to develop an optimized random forest (RF) model with best ratios of positive-to-negative cells and 10-fold cross-validation for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), and then explore its generalization ability not only in the area where the model is originated but also in area other than the origin of the model. Two typical counties (Fengjie County and Wushan County) in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China, which have the same terrain and geological conditions, were selected as an example. To begin with, landslide inventory was prepared based on field investigations, satellite images, and historical records, and 1 522 landslides were then identified in Fengjie County. 22 landslide-conditioning factors under the influence of topography, geology, environmental conditions, and human activities were prepared. Then, combined with 10-fold cross-validation, three typical ratios of positive-to-negative cells, i.e., 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10, were adopted for comparative analyses. An optimized RF model (Fengjie-based model) with the best ratios of positive-to-negative cells and 10-fold cross-validation was constructed. Finally, the Fengjie-based model was applied to Fengjie County and Wushan County, and the confusion matrix and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value (AUC) were used to estimate the accuracy. The Fengjie-based model delivered high stability and predictive capability in Fengjie County, indicating a great generalization ability of the model to the area where the model is originated. The LSM in Wushan County generated by the Fengjie-based model had a reasonable reference value, indicating the Fengjie-based model had a great generalization ability in area other than the origin of the model. The Fengjie-based model in this study could be applied in other similar areas/countries with the same terrain and geological conditions, and a LSM may be generated without collecting landslide information for modeling, so as to reduce workload and improve efficiency in practice."
Geochronology and Geochemistry of the 890 Ma I-Type Granites in the Southwestern Yangtze Block: Petrogenesis and Crustal Evolution,"The tectonic evolution of the southwestern Yangtze Block during the Early Neoproterozoic period is still controversial because of the limited quantities of 1 000–860 Ma magmatic rocks. In this study, our new LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating results demonstrate that the Yanbian granodiorites in the southwest Yangtze Block were emplaced at 894.6±7.4 Ma, representing the product of an 894 Ma magmatism. The Yanbian granodiorites are metaluminous to weak peraluminous with A/CNK values of 0.8–1.1, resembling I-type granitoids. They are characterized by right-inclined REE patterns with moderate to insignificant negative Eu anomalies (δEu=0.6–0.9). Their primitive mantle-normalized trace element patterns are characterized by depletion of Nb, Ta and Ti and weakly enrichment of Th. Considering the positive whole-rock εNd(t) (+5.8 to +6.8), we propose that these granodiorites originated from the partial melting of juvenile mafic lower crust. The Yanbian I-type granitoids have low Y and Nb contents similar to volcanic arc igneous rocks in the Y-Nb plot for tectonic discrimination. In conclusion, Early Neoproterozoic Yanbian granodiorites have generated in a compression setting in an active continental margin. Together with previous studies from the southwestern Yangtze Block, we suggest that the 894 Ma subduction-related Yanbian granodiorites represent the early stage of subduction at the southwestern margin of the Yangtze Block."
An Investigation of Dislocation in Olivine Phenocrysts from the Hawaiian Basalts,"Intracrystalline distortions (like undulose extinction, dislocations, and subgrain boundaries) in olivine from naturally-deformed peridotites are generally taken as signs of dislocation creep. However, similar features in olivine phenocrysts that have been found in basaltic magmas are still not well understood. In particular, whether subgrain boundaries in olivine phenocrysts arise from plastic deformation or grain growth is still debated (in the latter case, they are essentially grain boundaries but not subgrain boundaries. Therefore, we used hereinafter subgrain-boundary-like structures instead of subgrain boundaries to name this kind of intracrystalline distortion). Here we carried out a detailed study on dislocations and subgrain-boundary-like (SG-like) structures in olivine phenocrysts from two Hawaiian basaltic lavas by means of petrographic microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Abundant and complex dislocation substructures (free dislocations, dislocation walls, and dislocation tangles) were observed in the decorated olivine grains, similar to those in olivine from peridotite xenoliths entrained by the Hawaiian basalts. The measured average dislocation density is (2.9±1.3)×1011 m−2, and is three to five orders of magnitude higher than that in laboratory-synthesized, undeformed olivine. TEM observations on samples cut across the SG-like structures by FIB (focused ion beam) demonstrated that this kind of structures is made of an array of dislocations. These observations clearly indicate that these structures are real subgrain boundaries rather than grain boundaries. These facts suggest that the observed high dislocation densities and subgrain boundaries cannot result from crystal crystallization/growth, but can be formed by plastic deformation. These deformation features do not prove that the olivine phenocrysts (and implicitly mantle xenoliths) were deformed after their capture by the basaltic magmas, but can be ascribed to a former deformation event in a dunitic cumulate, which was formed by magmatic fractionation, then plastically deformed, and finally disaggregated and captured by the basaltic magma that brought them to the surface."
Copper-linked 1T MoS2/Cu2O Heterostructure for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution,"Metallic 1T phase molybdenum disulfide(1T MoS2) is an excellent catalyst due to the abundant active sites and good conductivity. However, complex synthesis and unstable nature of 1T MoS2 still limit its practical application. Herein, we propose a simple method to trigger the phase transition of MoS2. This phase transition is first predicted by density functional theory(DFT) calculations and then confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy(HRTEM). 1T MoS2/Cu2O heterostructure catalyst is then developed, showing enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution."
In situ Carbon Modification of g-C3N4 from Urea co-Crystal with Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity Towards Degradation of Organic Dyes Under Visible Light,"An in situ strategy was introduced for synthesizing carbon modified graphitic carbon nitride(g-C3N4) by using urea/4-aminobenzoic acid(PABA) co-crystal(PABA@Urea) as precursor materials. Via co-calcination of the PABA co-former and the urea in PABA@Urea co-crystals, C guest species were generated and compounded into g-C3N4 matrix in situ by replacing the lattice N of the carbon nitride and forming carbon dots onto its layer surface. The carbon modification dramatically enhanced visible-light harvesting and charge carrier separation. Therefore, visible light photo-catalytic oxidation of methylene blue(MB) pollution in water over the carbon modified g-C3N4 (C/g-C3N4) was notably improved. Up to 99% of methylene blue(MB) was eliminated within 60 min by the optimal sample prepared from the PABA@Urea co-crystal with a PABA content of 0.1%(mass ratio), faster than the degradation rate over bare g-C3N4. The present study demonstrates a new way to boost up the photocatalysis performance of g-C3N4, which holds great potential concerning the degradation of organic dyes from water."
Inverse multiobjective optimization: Inferring decision criteria from data,"It is a challenging task to identify the objectives on which a certain decision was based, in particular if several, potentially conflicting criteria are equally important and a continuous set of optimal compromise decisions exists. This task can be understood as the inverse problem of multiobjective optimization, where the goal is to find the objective function vector of a given Pareto set. To this end, we present a method to construct the objective function vector of an unconstrained multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) such that the Pareto critical set contains a given set of data points with prescribed KKT multipliers. If such an MOP can not be found, then the method instead produces an MOP whose Pareto critical set is at least close to the data points. The key idea is to consider the objective function vector in the multiobjective KKT conditions as variable and then search for the objectives that minimize the Euclidean norm of the resulting system of equations. By expressing the objectives in a finite-dimensional basis, we transform this problem into a homogeneous, linear system of equations that can be solved efficiently. Potential applications of this approach include the identification of objectives (both from clean and noisy data) and the construction of surrogate models for expensive MOPs."
Pairwise imitation and evolution of the social contract,"This paper studies the evolution of conventions in Stag Hunt games when agents’ behaviour depends on pairwise payoff comparisons. The results of two imitative decision rules are compared with each other and with those obtained when agents myopically best respond to the distribution of play. These rules differ in terms of their rationale, their requirements, and the extent to which they make individuals learn from others. Depending on payoffs and the interaction process being considered, best response learning can cause either the rewarding All Stag equilibrium or the inefficient All Hare equilibrium to emerge as the long-run convention. In contrast, pairwise imitation favours the emergence of the Pareto-inferior equilibrium. This result is robust to assuming assortative matching and some heterogeneity in decision rules."
Cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis 99mTc-DPD SPECT correlates with strain echocardiography and biomarkers,"Hereditary transthyretin-amyloid amyloidosis (ATTRv) is an underdiagnosed condition commonly manifesting as congestive heart failure. Recently, scintigraphy utilizing DPD as a tracer was shown to identify ATTRv and wild-type ATTR cardiomyopathy. The aim of this study was to determine the value of quantified scintigraphy utilizing 99mTc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (DPD) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT, and to correlate its uptake with well-established cardiac functional parameters."
Follow-up in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer: facts and future,"Patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) have high recurrence and progression rates in spite of tumor resection and adjuvant instillation therapy. To detect recurrences and progression, these patients remain under frequent follow-up. Follow-up, however, is not well defined. Frequency and duration of follow recommendations are based on low levels of evidence, which is illustrated by clear differences in these recommendations per guideline, even when specified per risk group. Additionally, follow-up is recommended with cystoscopy and cytology in selected patients, which both have clear limitations. Fact is that follow-up in NMIBC is too frequent, with low levels of evidence and suboptimal tools, and it is patient unfriendly and costly. Improved cystoscopy techniques are unproven or impractical in the outpatient follow-up setting. Urinary markers have been around for decades, but never widely used in clinical practice. New (epi)genetic markers, however, could play a significant role in future follow-up of NMIBC. They have been shown to have very high negative predictive values for recurrences in follow-up of NMIBC, especially high-grade recurrences. Several studies suggested that these markers could be used to adapt follow-up cystoscopy frequency. What still needs study and confirmation is the cost-effectiveness of the use of these markers, which is highly dependent on health care costs per country and marker price. In all, however, implementation of these new urinary markers after confirmation of current results might significantly reduce patient burden and health care costs in the near future without reducing quality."
Design of Novel Reactive Dyes Containing Cationic Groups: Mechanism and Application for Environmentally Friendly Cotton Dyeing,"In this work, four novel, high fixation reactive dyes containing cationic groups were synthesized using m-aminophenyltrimethylammonium salt or 4-(ethylsulfurate sulfonyl) aniline as the diazo component, 3-(N,N-diethylamino) acetanilide or 3′-aminoacetanilide as the coupling component and m-aminophenyltrimethylammonium salt or N-(2-aminoethyl) pyridinium chloride as the cationic group. The synthesized dyes containing multiple cationic groups were characterized by FT-IR and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. The spectral properties were measured by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. Compared with conventional reactive dyes containing cationic groups, the synthesized dyes exhibited good water solubility upon introduction of a quaternary ammonium into the chromophore. The structural design of synthetic azo dyes allows enhanced the water solubility due to the introduction of a cationic group. The dyeing properties of the synthesized dyes to cotton fabric were explored at various temperatures and salt and alkaline concentrations. The results showed that the synthesized dyes possessed good dyeing properties with nearly 80% fixation and good color fastness on cotton (3–5) in the absence of salt. The success of the salt-free dyeing of cotton fabric with these dyes is an excellent example of environmentally friendly cotton dyeing. This study provides an important platform for the design of novel reactive dyes for cotton dyeing to reduce effluent pollution."
Analysis of the Relationship between Breaking Stress and Whiteness in a New Hair Bleaching Method,"In order to investigate the relationship between breaking stress and whiteness in a bleaching treatment with laccase, hair samples from three biogeographically distinct populations were characterized by various chemical and physical techniques. Factors affecting whiteness and breaking stress were investigated by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The results reveal that whiteness and breaking stress after bleaching are primarily influenced by the diversity of concentration of metal ions and functional groups in the hair. The hair samples with lower content of metal ions obtain better whiteness and higher stress retention. The presence of OH functional group increases the final whiteness of the hair sample, while lack of that not only decreases the whiteness but also leads to more stress loss. In addition, the presence of the C-C functional group also decreases the whiteness."
Fabrication and Characterization of Moisture Slow-releasing Embroidered Electrode and ECG Monitoring Belt,"The microenvironmental humidity at the interface between the bioelectrical electrode and the human skin can affect the quality of the bioelectrical signal collected by the electrode. This paper utilized superabsorbent polyacrylic fiber as the base material to fabricate a novel moisture slow-releasing embroidered electrode. The moisture-locking capacity of polyester non-woven fabric (PENWF) substrate, polyacrylic non-woven fabric (PANWF) substrate, polyester-based electrode (PE-E) and polyacrylic-based electrode (PA-E) were compared in this paper. The non-woven fabric with polyacrylic fiber owned excellent moisture-locking capacity, so it could realize the slow-releasing of moisture and provide a suitable wet environment for the dry bioelectric electrode to collect ECG signals. With the extension of time, the amplitude of the ECG signal collected by PA-E did not change much, and only decreased by 17.1 % after evaporating for 10 h; but after evaporating for 10 h, the amplitude of the ECG signal collected by the PE-E decreased by 48.9 %. In addition, 5 mm, 10 mm, and 15 mm thick polyurethane sponge (PUS) filling materials were used to make the ECG monitoring belts, and their signal-to-noise ratios were analyzed under different states of static, swinging arms and walking. The 5 mm thick elastic filler material has the highest signal-to-noise ratio among the three thicknesses. It could collect ECG signals stably under swing arm and walking at a constant speed, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were 25.393 dB and 30.086 dB respectively. The polyurethane sponge filling materials with a thickness of 5 mm provided an appropriate pre-stress for the ECG signal dynamic measurement, which could provide a reference parameter for the production of smart ECG garment in the future."
Crystallization and Mechanical Properties of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polypropylene Composites Molded by Rapid Heat Cycle Molding,"The crystalline behavior and mechanical properties of PP/GF (glass fibers) composites molded by rapid heat cycle molding (RHCM) and conventional injection molding (CIM) were compared. SEM, DSC and XRD were utilized to study crystallization behavior of PP and PP/GF composites. Furthermore, universal testing machine was employed to investigate the mechanical properties. Results proved that higher degree of crystallinity and larger crystal size can be obtained in RHCM in comparison to CIM. GF can induce more crystal nuclei and then reduce the crystal size due to shear stress which is generated in polymer matrix around fibers. Nucleating agent (NA) has a positive effect on refine grains. The average crystal diameter of PP/NA/30 %GF is about 1.7 µm which is one-tenth of PP/30 %GF (14 µm) in RHCM. XRD tests illustrated that α-form crystal is the main crystal type for PP and PP/GF composites in RHCM and CIM. However, there is a little β-form crystal in RHCM for PP/GF composites without NA. NA accelerates the formation of α-form crystal and restrains the emergence of β-form crystal. The plastic parts obtained in RHCM exhibited higher strength and modulus compared with that obtained in CIM for both tensile and flexural tests."
"Production and Modification of Natural Bamboo Fibers from Four Bamboo Species, and Their Prospects in Textile Manufacturing","Four widely grown bamboo species, Bissetii, Giant Gray, Moso, and Red Margin, were studied for natural bamboo fiber (NBF) extraction using 36 routes with respective fiber yield percentages where total use of NaOH was less than 24 g/l in any specific processing route. The Red Margin species was found to have the most potential for NBF extraction. This study provides reports on moisture regain (average 8.0 %) and moisture content (average 7.5 %), incineration behavior, solubility properties, surface morphology, length and diameter of single NBF (10–13 µm), and fineness of NBFs from four plants and comparative results with conventional fibers. Yarns of NBFs blended with cotton were created and their tensile properties were tested. NBFs that were longer and coarser in initial stages, with high breaking tenacity of 63.74–138.63 N/Tex and lower elongation of 2.06–2.46 % were judged to be good for some textile applications. Finer and shorter NBFs provide a lower strength in the blended yarns than cotton fibers."
Fabrication and Characterization of Novel Antibacterial Ultrafine Nylon-6 Nanofibers Impregnated by Garlic Sour,"Antibacterial products have paid much more attraction all over global world. In this study, a novel and economical rout has been studied for antibacterial product, ultrafine nylon-6 (NY-6 NFS) nanofibers impregnated into garlic sour was synthesized by electrospinning method. The morphology of impregnated nanofiber mats was characterized by electron microscopy (SEM). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to analyze the chemical interaction of Nylon-6 nanofiber mats and garlic sour. The antibacterial activities of impregnated garlic sour samples G-1, G-2 and G-3 were evaluated against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria by using disc diffusion method. It was found that the garlic sour has played a vital role for antibacterial activity. The nanofiber mats impregnated into garlic sour showed excellent antibacterial activity. It was observed that the antimicrobial effect for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was more than 99 %. The excellent hydrophobic property which revealed water contact angle was examined with dropping method and TGA were examined excellent thermal degradation rate of NY-6 NFS and impregnated garlic sour samples. NY-6 NFS showed good mechanical strength according to ASTM D-638 standard. The obtained results indicate that the NY-6 NFS impregnated in garlic sour is a promising antibacterial product that can be utilized as antibacterial wound dressing."
"Design of an Instrument to Determine the Acoustic Characteristics of Non Wovens Made from Recycled Polyester, Jute and Flax","The influence of acoustic property of fabrics made from recycled polyethylene terephthalate (recycled PET), jute and flax fibres have been studied. Six different blended proportions (100 % Recycled PET, 100 % Jute, 100 % flax, 25 % jute: 25 % flax: 50 % recycled PET, 50 % jute: 25 % flax: 25 % recycled PET, 25 % jute: 50 % flax: 25 % recycled PET) of different grams per square meter 200, 400, 600 needle punched technique non woven fabrics have been produced and analyzed for their properties. The sound reduction of needle punched 50 % jute: 25 % flax: 25 % recycled PET non-woven has shown better performance among the six samples. The grams per square meter of the samples influence the sound reduction values of non woven fabric. Increase in gsm of the material also increases the sound reduction value. Among all the samples, the 50 % jute: 25 % flax: 25 % recycled PET non-woven sample produces good acoustic property in developed digital sound reduction tester and commercial sound impedance tube absorption co efficient value. Anova mathematical tool shows the there is a significant difference between input and output signal in the digital sound reduction tester. From the results, It is found that the sound reduction property of non woven fabrics increases and decreases with the types of fibre and grams per square meter of the samples. The jute non woven fabric can be used as good sound reduction material for various industrial applications."
"Hyaluronic Acid Fibres in Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis — Their Properties, Morphology and Stability","Different methods and materials can be used for peptide synthesis. One of the most common approaches is synthesis on a solid phase. In this paper, we describe fibres based on hyaluronic acid (HA) and their properties under solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) conditions. The fibres were prepared by wet spinning technology and were used to study their stability and mechanical properties under the reaction conditions for direct peptide synthesis or conjugation with a pre-synthesized peptide. Fibres in the form of a non-woven textile were then used as a proof of concept for the adhesion of cells on short cell-adhesion peptides. The methods, solvents and reaction conditions used showed no significant influence on the necessary stability of the HA fibres when the Fmoc/tBu strategy was applied. Furthermore, the stability of the HA fibres in aqueous solution was strongly improved. The stabilization and presence of cell-adhesive peptides supported the adhesion of cardiomyocyte cells, which confirmed the functionality of the modified textile. Therefore, HA carriers bearing peptides could be advantageously employed in various biomedical applications as repair patches."
"Study on Morphology, Thermal and Rheological Properties of Polypropylene/Poly(trimethylene terephthalate) Polyblend Fibers","In the present work, a systematic study of the variables affecting the production of polypropylene (PP)/poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) blend fibers such as the PTT and PP-g-MA compatibleizer ratios and take-up speed in the melt-spinning process was done. Modeling of the melt-spinning process was carried out by using a statistical approach based on response surface methodology (RSM) to achieve a mathematical model. The formation of the fibrillar structures through different steps of fiber formation was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The lowest mean diameter of nano-fibrils was achieved to be 63 nm, for the hot-drawn fibers consisting of 10 wt.% of PTT. The synergetic effect of the presence of PTT dispersed phase on the mechanical properties of PP fibers as a matrix was verified by observing a positive deviation from the blends linear law for the samples with 10 wt.% of PTT. The rheological evaluations suggested the formation of a fibril structure in the blends. The X-ray diffraction spectroscopy and DSC results showed that the presence of PTT significantly influenced the crystallinity of PP. Moreover, results indicated that the average crystal size of the PP matrix phase was affected by the presence of the PTT dispersed phase, which also confirmed its nucleating effect in the blend."
Surface Modification of Flax Fibers with Isocyanate and Its Effects on Fiber/Epoxy Interfacial Properties,"Natural fiber reinforced polymer composite has been widely used in various industry fields. Natural fiber treatment can effectively improve its mechanical and durability properties, and expands its applications. In the present study, isocyanate was proposed to treat flax fibers in order to reduce the hydrophilic properties of the fibers, and to enhance the bonding of flax fiber to epoxy matrix. The isocyanate treated fabric was evaluated with fourier transform infra-red (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and water uptake. The effects of the fiber treatment on the mechanical properties of flax fabric reinforced epoxy (FFRP) plates were investigated. FTIR and SEM analysis indicated that isocyanate reacts with flax fiber, forming a thin polymer layer on the fiber surface. The water absorption test showed that isocyanate treatment decreased the water uptake of the flax fabric by 4`-18 times compared to the control fabric. The flexural and tensile strength of FFRP with isocyanate solution treated fabrics were enhanced more than 20 %, attributed to the improved adhesion of fiber to epoxy. Based on the above results, the treatment method of flax fiber with isocyanate is considered as an effective approach to improve both hydrothermal ageing resistance and mechanical properties of FFRPs."
Chemical characteristics of wet precipitation at Peradeniya in Sri Lanka,"The purpose of this research was to study chemical characteristics of precipitation in Peradeniya (Latitude 6.973701, Longitude 79.915256), Kandy District in Sri Lanka. This study was conducted during 2012 to 2014, and wet precipitation was analyzed for pH, conductivity, Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, F−, Cl−, NO3−, SO42−, Pb, Cu, Mn, Al, Zn, and Fe for a total of 125 samples. Less than 2% events of acidic precipitation were recorded, and the VWA of the major ionic species present in precipitation samples were in the order of Ca2+ > Na+ > Cl− > NH4+ > SO42− > K+ > NO3− > Mg2+. Neutralization of acidity of precipitation is much more related to CaCO3 than NH3, and the presence of high content of Ca2+ strongly supports this fact. When considering marine contribution, SO42−/Na+, Ca2+/Na+, Mg2+/Na+, and K+/Na+ ratios are higher than the reference value suggesting that contribution of sources other than marine. Concentration of Zn is the highest while that of Mn is the lowest. Principal component analysis identified probable sources for major ionic and elemental sources as both natural and anthropogenic sources such as vehicular emission due to heavy traffic, waste incineration, bio mass burning, brass industry, and construction."
Global well-posedness and time-decay estimates for compressible Navier-Stokes equations with reaction diffusion,"We consider the full compressible Navier-Stokes equations with reaction diffusion. A global existence and uniqueness result of the strong solution is established for the Cauchy problem when the initial data is in a neighborhood of a trivially stationary solution. The appearance of the difference between energy gained and energy lost due to the reaction is a new feature for the flow and brings new difficulties. To handle these, we construct a new linearized system in terms of a combination of the solutions. Moreover, some optimal time-decay estimates of the solutions are derived when the initial perturbation is additionally bounded in L1. It is worth noticing that there is no decay loss for the highest-order spatial derivatives of the solution so that the long time behavior for the hyperbolic-parabolic system is exactly the same as that for the heat equation. As a byproduct, the above time-decay estimate at the highest order is also valid for compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The proof is accomplished by virtue of Fourier theory and a new observation for cancellation of a low-medium-frequency quantity."
BDNF influences neural cue-reactivity to food stimuli and food craving in obesity,"There is increasing evidence that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) impacts on the development of obesity. We are the first to test the hypothesis that BDNF levels might be associated with neural reactivity to food cues in patients suffering from obesity and healthy controls. We assessed visual food cue-induced neural response in 19 obese patients and 20 matched controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging and analyzed the associations between BDNF levels, food cue-reactivity and food craving. Whole-brain analysis in both groups revealed that food cues elicited higher neural activation in clusters of mesolimbic brain areas including the insula (food > neutral). Patients suffering from obesity showed a significant positive correlation between plasma BDNF levels and visual food cue-reactivity in the bilateral insulae. In addition, patients suffering from obesity with positive food cue-induced insula activation also reported significantly higher food craving than those with low cue-reactivity—an effect that was absent in normal weight participants. The present findings implicate that BDNF levels in patients suffering from obesity might be involved in food craving and obesity in humans. This highlights the importance to consider BDNF pathways when investigating obesity and obesity treatment."
"Early emergency readmission frequency as an indicator of short-, medium- and long-term mortality post-discharge from hospital","Frequent emergency readmissions, an indicator of quality of care, has been rising in England but the underlying reasons remain unclear. We examined the association of early readmissions with subsequent mortality in adults, taking into account the underlying presenting diagnoses and hospital length of stay (LOS). Data of alive-discharge episodes were prospectively collected between 01/04/2017 and 31/03/2019 in an National Health Service hospital, comprising 32,270 patients (46.1% men) aged 18–107 years (mean = 64.0, ± SD = 20.5 years). The associations of readmission frequency within 28 days of discharge and mortality within 30 days and 6 months of hospital discharge, and over a 2-year period were evaluated, adjusted for presenting diagnoses, LOS, age and sex during the first admission. Analysis of all patients 18–107 years (reference: no readmission) showed mortality within 30 days was increased for 1 readmission: event rate = 9.2%, odds ratio (OR) = 3.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.9–4.0), and ≥ 2 readmissions: event rate = 10.0%, OR = 2.6 (95%CI = 2.0–3.3), and within 6 months for 1 readmission: event rate = 19.6%, OR = 3.0 (95%CI = 2.7–3.4), and ≥ 2 readmissions: event rate = 27.4%, OR = 3.4 (95%CI = 2.9–4.0), and over a 2-year period for 1 readmission: event rate = 25.5%, hazard ratio = 2.2 (95%CI = 2.0–2.4), and ≥ 2 readmissions: event rate = 36.1%, hazard ratio = 2.5 (95%CI = 2.2–2.8). Within the age groups 18–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79 and ≥ 80 years, readmissions were also associated with increased risk of mortality within 3 months and 6 months of discharge, and over 2-year period. In conclusion, early hospital readmission predicts short-, medium- and long-term mortality post-discharge from hospital in adults aged 18–107 years, independent of underlying presenting conditions, LOS, age and sex. Further research focussing on safe discharge and follow-up patient care may help reduce preventable readmissions and post-discharge mortality."
"The Pericardial Body of Ciona intestinalis Contains Hemocytes and Degenerating Muscle Cells, But No Parasites","A ventral heart positioned posterior to the branchial basket and equipped with a pericardium is homologous in tunicates and their sister group, the craniates, yet the tunicate model organism Ciona intestinalis features a pericardial body, a structure peculiar to few ascidian species. Here, we set out to distinguish between two competing hypotheses regarding the function of the pericardial body found in the literature: (H1) The pericardial body performs a role in the removal of dysfunctional myocardial cells, and (H2) it is a specialized niche of the immune system involved in defense against parasites."

"China’s rural revitalization and development: Theory, technology and management","The urban-rural transformation from dichotomy to integration is a gradual process. Like rural areas in many countries, Chinese rural society is experiencing a decline in all spheres due to depopulation, aging, lack of economic opportunity, and so on. Aiming at solving the serious rural issues, China proposed the implementation of a rural revitalization strategy and the promotion of an integrated urban-rural development for the first time in 2017. This proposal marks the transformation of the urban-rural relationship, and the integrated urban-rural development reflects a significant conceptual change. Researches on issues of rural decline are urgently needed to determine the most effective method for rural revitalization and development from the perspective of the urban-rural dynamics. In this context, this paper focuses on studying the theory, technology and management of rural revitalization and development. We construct a theoretical framework for urban-rural integration based on population-land-industry-right between the urban and rural systems, regarding land engineering for land capacity building as the technical support and the rural land system reform and reconstruction as the policy support for management. This research will provide theoretical support for the implementation of China’s rural revitalization strategy."
Holocene aeolian activities linked to Indian summer monsoon in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River,"Widespread aeolian deposits on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) have provided valuable palaeoclimatic information. However, the primary factors (e.g., climate factors, human activity, and vegetation cover) controlling aeolian deposition remain elusive. In this paper, we use a dataset that comprises new and published ages of Holocene aeolian sand and loess in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River to identify the primary controlling factors and palaeoclimatic implications of aeolian deposition. Several intervals of enhanced aeolian accumulation centered at 8.5–7.8, 6.4–5.8, 4.5–4.0, 3.1–1.8, and 0.9 ka are identified, generally consistent with regional low rainfall events and weak Indian summer monsoon (ISM). This suggests that regional wetness, dominated by the ISM, may play a key role in modulating dust emissions and aeolian deposition on centennial timescales. Our results show that on centennial- to millennial-scales, ISM activity can be reconstructed by non-continuous aeolian deposits in the monsoon dominated TP."
Acetabular- and femoral orientation after periacetabular osteotomy as a predictor for outcome and osteoarthritis,"Periacetabular osteotomy is a successful treatment for hip dysplasia. The results are influenced, however, by optimal positioning of the acetabular fragment, femoral head morphology and maybe even femoral version as well as combined anteversion have an impact. In order to obtain better insight on fragment placement, postoperative acetabular orientation and femoral morphology were evaluated in a midterm follow-up in regard to functional outcome and osteoarthritis progression."
Praziquantel and Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding in Hepatic Schistosomiasis: A Quasi-Experimental Study,"There is a general consensus that widespread use of praziquantel in populations where schistosomiasis is endemic prevents development of hepatic schistosomiasis and its complications. However, a few studies have reported discordant findings linking praziquantel to the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in some patients with hepatic schistosomiasis and varices."
Evaluation of Different Processor Architecture Organizations for On-Site Electronics in Harsh Environments,"Microcontrollers to be used in harsh environmental conditions, e.g., at high temperatures or radiation exposition, need to be fabricated in robust technology nodes in order to operate reliably. However, these nodes are considerably larger than cutting-edge semiconductor technologies and provide less speed, drastically reducing system performance. In order to achieve low silicon area costs, low power consumption and reasonable performance, the processor architecture organization itself is a major influential design point. Parameters like data path width, instruction execution paradigm, code density, memory requirements, advanced control flow mechanisms etc., may have large effects on the design constraints. Application characteristics, like exploitable data parallelism and required arithmetic operations, have to be considered in order to use the implemented processor resources efficiently. In this paper, a design space exploration of five different architectures with MIPS- or ARM-compatible instruction set architectures, as well as transport-triggered instruction execution is presented. Using a 0.18 \(\upmu \)m SOI CMOS technology for high temperature and an exemplary case study from the fields of communication, i.e., powerline communication encoder, the influence of architectural parameters on performance and hardware efficiency is compared. For this application, a transport-triggered architecture configuration has an 8.5\(\times \) higher performance and 2.4\(\times \) higher computational energy efficiency at a 1.6\(\times \) larger total silicon area than an off-the-shelf ARM Cortex-M0 embedded processor, showing the considerable range of design trade-offs for different architectures."
Has the COVID-19 Crisis Affected the Growth of United States Food and Drug Administration Drug Approvals? The Answer is Not Yet! A Time Series (Forecasting) Study,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-19; HCoV-19; COVID-19) has affected all daily activities. Has it also affected the number of United States (FDA) drug approvals over time? The short answer from empirical time series forecasting is not yet. Care should be taken as the crisis continues through maintaining the scientific, economic, political, and social supportive structures to sustain momentum. This conclusion is based on analyzing the results of (non-overlapping) forecasting routines (viz., complex exponential smoothing, auto-regressive fractionally integrated moving average, extreme learning machine, and multi-layer perceptron) performed on longitudinal (1939-present) FDA (CDER) drug approvals taking into regard pre- and extant-COVID-19 eras. This is an initial study and there are caveats with the approach, and as such, all data and programs are provided to support replication of the results and furthering of the investigation."
Factors associated with a SARS-CoV-2 recurrence after hospital discharge among patients with COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: The proportion of recurrences after discharge among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported to be between 9.1% and 31.0%. Little is known about this issue, however, so we performed a meta-analysis to summarize the demographical, clinical, and laboratorial characteristics of non-recurrence and recurrence groups. Methods: Comprehensive searches were conducted using eight electronic databases. Data regarding the demographic, clinical, and laboratorial characteristics of both recurrence and non-recurrence groups were extracted, and quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted. Results: Ten studies involving 2071 COVID-19 cases were included in this analysis. The proportion of recurrence cases involving patients with COVID-19 was 17.65% (between 12.38% and 25.16%) while older patients were more likely to experience recurrence (weighted mean difference (WMD)=1.67, range between 0.08 and 3.26). The time from discharge to recurrence was 13.38 d (between 12.08 and 14.69 d). Patients were categorized as having moderate severity (odds ratio (OR)=2.69, range between 1.30 and 5.58), while those with clinical symptoms including cough (OR=5.52, range between 3.18 and 9.60), sputum production (OR=5.10, range between 2.60 and 9.97), headache (OR=3.57, range between 1.36 and 9.35), and dizziness (OR=3.17, range between 1.12 and 8.96) were more likely to be associated with recurrence. Patients presenting with bilateral pulmonary infiltration and decreased leucocyte, platelet, and CD4+ T counts were at risk of COVID-19 recurrence (OR=1.71, range between 1.07 and 2.75; WMD=−1.06, range between −1.55 and −0.57, WMD=−40.39, range between −80.20 and −0.48, and WMD=−55.26, range between −105.92 and −4.60, respectively). Conclusions: The main factors associated with the recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after hospital discharge were older age, moderate severity, bilateral pulmonary infiltration, laboratory findings including decreased leucocytes, platelets, and CD4+ T counts, and clinical symptoms including cough, sputum production, headache, and dizziness. These factors can be considered warning indicators for the recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 and might help the development of specific management strategies."
First among equals: co-hyperintensionality for structured propositions,"Theories of structured meanings are designed to generate fine-grained meanings, but they are also liable to overgenerate structures, thus drawing structural distinctions without a semantic difference. I recommend the proliferation of very fine-grained structures, so that we are able to draw any semantic distinctions we think we might need. But, in order to contain overgeneration, I argue we should insert some degree of individuation between logical equivalence and structural identity based on structural isomorphism. The idea amounts to forming an equivalence class of different structures according to one or more formal criteria and designating a privileged element as a representative of all the elements, i.e., a first among equals. The proposed method helps us to a cluster of notions of co-hyperintensionality. As a test case, I consider a recent objection levelled against the act theory of structured propositions. I also respond to an objection against my methodology."
"Evaluation of the importance of ornamental plants for pollinators in urban and suburban areas in Stuttgart, Germany","Urban landscapes are often characterized by a wide range of diverse flowering plants consisting of native and exotic plants. These flower-rich habitats have proven to be particularly valuable for urban pollinating insects. However, the ability of ornamental plants in supporting urban pollinator communities is still not well documented. For this study, we established flower beds at 13 different urban testing sites, which were planted with identical sets of ornamental garden plants. The pollinator visitation patterns were then observed throughout the summer seasons. Over a two-year period, a total of 10,565 pollinators were recorded with wild bees (> 50%, excluding bumblebees) being the most abundant pollinator group. Our results revealed that (I) the assortment of ornamental plants was visited by a high number of urban pollinators for collecting pollen and nectar, and (II) the pollinator abundance and composition varied significantly within the tested ornamental plants. These differences occurred not only among plant species but to the same extent among cultivars, whereby the number of pollinators was positively correlated with number of flowering units per plant. By using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) and redundancy analysis (RDA) we identified further significant impacts of the two variables year and location on the insect pollinator abundance and richness. Despite of the local and yearly variations, our approach provided a good and field-applicable method to evaluate the pollinator friendliness in ornamental plants. Such tools are urgently required to validate labels like ‘bee friendly’ or ‘pollinator friendly’ used by plant breeding companies."

Großelternbetreuung und COVID-19,
Corona-Krise: Staatsbeteiligungen bleiben eine problematische Intervention in den Markt,"Die Corona-Pandemie erfordert staatliche Eingriffe, um negative ökonomische Auswirkungen auf Konsumenten und Unternehmen abzumildern. Es bestehen jedoch auch Gefahren bei Interventionen durch den Staat: So können ineffiziente Strukturen konserviert werden, Märkte verzerrt und langfristig negative Struktureffekte ausgelöst werden. Deswegen ist es wichtig, dass der Staat bei seinen Interventionen auf Marktkonformität achtet. Das bedeutet, dass keine Strukturen geschaffen werden dürfen, die sich nicht auch am Markt hätten bilden können oder am Wettbewerbsrecht gescheitert wären.

N-Vinylcaprolactam grafting onto cotton gauze by gamma radiation for loading and controlled release of antibacterial silver nanoparticles,"To contribute to the development of new alternatives in the area of polymers for biomedical applications, the surface modification of a cotton gauze grafted with a N-vinylcaprolactam (NVCL) by ionizing gamma radiation was developed, in to provide it with more physical and chemical properties. To verify that the grafting was successful, the samples were analyzed and characterized by attenuated total reflectance, by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analysis. The grafted samples showed greater hydrophilicity and affinity with drugs, as well as a critical solution temperature between 33 and 40 °C; therefore, this material was implemented as administrator of AgNPs in controlled doses, thus obtaining a material with greater absorption, anti-inflammatory and with antimicrobial characteristics."
Self-Assembly and Electrochemical Characterization of Ferrocene-based Molecular Diodes for Solar Rectenna Device,"Bailey [1] proposed in 1972 that a nanoscale antenna coupled with a rectifier can harvest broad range electromagnetic radiation from visible to infrared. To incorporate this concept in practical systems, there were two main technological bottle necks that have to be overcome: antenna miniaturization and rectification in terahertz frequency. With current technology and equipment [2], we are proposing a third-generation rectenna-based solar cells composed of Ag nanocubes to harvest ambient visible and infrared electromagnetic waves coupled to ferrocene-based molecular diodes [3] capable of switching at terahertz frequency to convert this received energy into DC power. The function of these molecular diodes is two-fold: they rectify and provide an uniform nano-cavity between silver top electrode and gold bottom electrode. These nano-cavities are capable to support gap plasmon modes and absorption of light in both narrow and broad range, depending on the nanocube size and dispersion. A self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of ferrocene alkane-dithiol is deposited in this nano-cavity making it possible to form molecular sized nano-gaps well below the usual 3 nm, and this structure is robust and reproducible [4]. This SAM can be deposited directly or via a two-step click chemistry on the surface to have along with control over the orientation of the molecule. By tuning the orientation and position of the ferrocene moiety, the direction of rectification can be controlled [3]. Hence, the SAM does not only act as a rectifier but also provides mechanical support combining photonic and electrical properties. This paper focuses on studying the electrical and supramolecular structure of these molecular diode based SAMs."
Production of aluminum nanoparticles by wet mechanical milling,"One of the great challenges in the use of nanomaterials is their production at low costs and high yields. In this work aluminum nanoparticles, from aluminum powder, were produced by wet mechanical milling through a combination of different attrition milling conditions such as ball-powder ratio (BPR) and the amount of solvent used. It was observed that at 600 rpm with a BPR of 500/30 g for 12 h, it was possible to produce nanoparticles with a size close to 20 nm, while at 750 rpm with a BPR of 380/12.6 g for 12 h, nanoparticles of approximately 10 nm were obtained. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the milling product is an agglomeration of nanoparticles with different sizes. These results show the feasibility of obtaining aluminum nanoparticles by mechanical milling using only ethanol as solvent, avoiding hazardous by-products obtained from chemical routes, and the use of complicated methods such as laser ablation and arc discharge."
Coal gasification and composite ashes as partial replacements for Portland cement in concrete — strength and selected durability performance,"This study investigated the use of mixed weathered coal fine ash (MWA) and coal gasification ash (CGA), sourced from Sasol® Ltd, South Africa, as partial replacements (10%, 15% and 30% by mass) of Portland Cement (PC) in concrete. The objective was to assess the feasibility of using the ashes, which are generally of lower quality than FA, in concrete in order to avert their negative environmental impact i.e. disposal in heaps and landfills. Companion reference concretes were made using conventional fly ash (FA). Two water-to-binder (w/b) ratios (0.50 and 0.60) were used. The concretes were tested for compressive strength (7, 28 and 56 days) and durability (gas permeability and chloride resistance at 28 and 56 days). In general, the results strongly suggest that the ashes can be used in conventional structural concrete–both from strength and durability viewpoints. Aspects that require attention when they are used include decrease in both workability and rate of strength gain. The gas permeability of the CGA and MWA concretes were similar to those for FA at all replacement levels but a 15% replacement level gave higher chloride resistance."
Fluoride removal using a MgFe hydrotalcite and a MgFe oxide,"The present study investigates the adsorption of fluorides (F) by a hydrotalcite MgFe (HT MgFe) and an iron-based metal oxide (MgFe oxide). Both materials were synthesized by the coprecipitation method and were calcined at the same temperature HT MgFe, HTC MgFe, oxide MgFe and oxide MgFeC. Both solids were characterized by the XRD technique. Materials showed typical crystalline forms; in the case of HT MgFe, an octahedral crystalline form and for the oxide MgFe cubic crystalline form, the analysis of the BET method classifies the materials as mesoporous. In the adsorption study, it was determined that the optimal pH for adsorption is 7. Regarding the adsorption kinetics, the HTC MgFe and oxide MgFeC samples were adjusted to the pseudo-second order model, which describes the process as chemiadsorption; meanwhile, for the samples, isotherms were adjusted to the Langmuir model, which describes the material as homogeneous with a strong interaction between the sorbate and the sorbent."
Polycaprolactone based membranes for the degradation of diclofenac present in water samples using ZnO nanoparticles as the active agent,"Drug contamination in water is one of the current fields of study. Since 1990, the presence of drugs in drinking water has been a concern to scientists and public. In Mexico, these organic compounds are not efficiently removed in wastewater treatment plants; therefore, alternative methodologies have been studied that allow these compounds to have a high percentage of degradation or be completely degraded. One example of these techniques is heterogeneous photocatalysis which has obtained positive results in the degradation of drugs using ZnO nanoparticles. These are commonly selected for their electrical characteristics, even though they disperse in water and an additional unit operation is required to separate them from the liquid medium. To eliminate drugs with nano particles in a single stage, polycaprolactone-based membranes with adhered ZnO nanoparticles, by means of electrospinning, were prepared to degrade drugs such as diclofenac. The technique used has shown to efficiently break down diclofenac in 4 hours according to the capillary electrophoresis readings."
"Synthesis, characterization and optical properties of a series of copolymers bearing 1-ethynylpyrene and ethynylbenzene units","A novel series of copolymers were obtained from the copolymerization of 1-ethynylpyrene (EP) (known as pyrenylacetylene) and ethynylbenzene (EB) (named also phenylacetylene) with WCl6 as catalyst and toluene as solvent, using different monomer molar ratios EP/EB (80:20, 60:40, 50:50; 40:60, 20:80). The optical properties of the obtained copolymers Poly(EP-co-EB) were determined by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Absorption spectra of the copolymers Poly(EP-co-EB) showed that copolymers containing phenylacetylene units possess a lower degree of conjugation than the homopolymer trans-poly(1-ethynylpyrene) (trans-PEP), since they showed a twisted conformation. These results were confirmed by emission spectroscopy showing the formation of excimers for those copolymers containing high pyrene content."
Strength and ductility performance of corroded steel bars in concrete exposed to 2D chloride ingress,"This paper presents the residual tensile strength test results of corroded high yield steel bars. Single steel bars were embedded at a cover depth of 20 mm in 150 × 150 × 625 mm long cracked concrete beam specimens made with 70/30 PC/FA and 50/50 PC/SL binders with a constant w/b ratio of 0.40. The steel bars were placed in the cross-section centre and near the orthogonal edge of the beams, and selected beam faces epoxy-coated in order to simulate, respectively, 1D and 2D chloride ingress. The beams were subjected to 2-week wetting (with 5% NaCl) and 2-week air-drying cycles in the laboratory for 110 weeks after which the corroded steel bars were extracted, assessed for corrosion morphology, and tested in tension for ultimate strength, fracture strength and ductility performance. The steel bars in concretes exposed to 1D chloride ingress had isolated corrosion pits while both general and isolated corrosion pits were observed in specimens exposed to 2D chloride ingress. The residual ultimate and fracture tensile strengths, and ductility of corroded steel reinforcing bars in concretes exposed to 2D chloride ingress are lower than those for steel bars in concretes exposed to 1D chloride ingress."
"Characterization of inclusions and second-phase particles in high-Mn TWIP steels microalloyed with Ti, Ti/B, Nb, V and Mo, in as-solutioned condition","In recent years there has been an increase in the field of research of advanced steels that have excellent mechanical properties combining high strength with excellent ductility. Within this range of advanced steels are the stable austenitic phase steels at room temperature of twinning induced plasticity known as TWIP. An important aspect to highlight about TWIP steels is their addition with different microalloying elements, generally less than 0.20 wt. %, which are forming precipitated phases such as carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides, and directly or indirectly control and/or modify microstructure and mechanical properties in these steels. Microalloying elements can cause a higher degree of hardening due to the formation of precipitates and grain refinement. The present research work studies the inclusions and second-phase particles formed in Fe–21Mn–1.3Si–1.6Al TWIP steels microalloyed with Ti, Nb, V, Mo and Ti/B in as-solution condition. TWIP steels melted in induction furnace were homogenized and hot-rolled at 1200 °C with reduction of 60 %. Subsequently, rolled plates were solubilized at 1100 °C followed by water quench. Thermodynamics-based predictions of inclusions and second-phases of different TWIP steels were carried out using JMatPro®V.9.1.2. Metallographic characterization was carried out by light optical and scanning electron microscopies (LOM, SEM), while second-phase particles characterization was performed using energy dispersion spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Also, Vickers microhardness tests were carried out in accordance to ASTM E92 standard. In general, results showed the formation of inclusions of AlN and MnS at higher temperatures, which act as nuclei points for the precipitation particles of each type of microalloying element (TiN, TiC, Nb (C, N), VC and MoC) at lower temperatures. The studied TWIP steels exhibit similar microhardness values, since the microalloying elements are mostly dissolved in solid solution. The TWIP steels microalloyed with V and Ti exhibited the highest microhardness values."
Influence of Rare Earth Additions to an Inconel 718 Alloy,"This work analyzes the effect of rare earth additions to an Inconel 718 superalloy; for this purpose, two 8 kg ingots of a commercial composition of Inconel 718 were made in a vacuum induction furnace. One of them (In718) with the base composition and the other one (In718RE) with an addition of 0.04wt% of mischmetal (rare earths alloy based on cerium and lanthanum). Both alloys were cast into metallic molds into the vacuum chamber and let to solidify. The alloys were then solubilized for two hours at 1155 °C to eliminate deleterious phases, rolled at 1100 °C to get a reduction of 50% in thickness, then aged for 16 hours at 720 °C and 620 °C by 8 hours each. A complete microstructural characterization was undertaken by optical and electronic (SEM and TEM) microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Mechanical characterization was done by hardness tests, tensile and Charpy impact tests. Results show a slight improvement of the tensile and hardness values for the alloy with rare earth additions. However, no notorious difference was observed during the impact tests, since both alloys show the same values. These mechanical results are discussed in terms of the obtained microstructure. Both alloys are mainly composed by γ, γ´, γ´´ and carbides. It was observed that primary carbides nucleate rare earth particles; therefore, higher number of carbides and of larger size (according to a size distribution) are observed in the alloy with rare earth additions. The presence of such carbides prevents the grain growth during the thermomechanical processing which in turn improve the mechanical properties."
Covert eye-tracking: an innovative method to investigate compliance with instructions,"The present study introduces a covert eye-tracking procedure as an innovative approach to investigate the adequacy of research paradigms used in psychology. In light of the ongoing debate regarding ego depletion, the frequently used “attention-control video task” was chosen to illustrate the method. Most participants did not guess that their eyes had been monitored, but some participants had to be excluded due to poor tracking ratio. The eye-tracking data revealed that the attention-control instructions had a significant impact on the number of fixations, revisits, fixation durations, and proportion of long fixation durations on the AOIs (all BF10 > 18.2). However, number of fixations and proportions of long fixation durations did not mediate cognitive performance. The results illustrate the promise of covert eye-tracking methodology to assess task compliance, as well as adding to the current discussion regarding whether the difficulties of replicating “ego depletion” may be in part due to poor task compliance in the video task."
Zooming in Time—Exploring Students’ Interpretations of a Dynamic Tree of Life,"Central to evolution is the concept of a common ancestry from which all life has emerged over immense time scales, but learning and teaching temporal aspects of evolution remain challenging. This study investigated students’ interpretation of evolutionary time when engaging with a multi-touch tabletop application called DeepTree, a dynamic visualization of a phylogenetic tree. Specifically, we explored how interactive finger-based zooming (zooming “in” and “out”) influenced students’ interpretation of evolutionary time, and how temporal information and relationships were conceptualized during interaction. Transcript analysis of videotaped interview data from ten secondary school students while they interacted with DeepTree revealed that zooming was interpreted in two ways: as spatially orientated (movement within the tree itself), or as time-orientated (movement in time). Identified misinterpretations included perceiving an implicit coherent timeline along the y-axis of the tree, that the zooming time duration in the virtual tree was linearly correlated to real time, and that more branch nodes correspond to a longer time. Sources for erroneous interpretations may lie in transferring everyday sensory experiences (e.g., physical movements and observing tree growth) to understanding abstract evolution concepts. Apart from estimating the occurrence of dinosaurs, DeepTree was associated with an improvement in interpretation of relative order of evolutionary events. Although highly promising, zooming interaction in DeepTree does not facilitate an intuitive understanding of evolutionary time. However, the opportunity to combine visual and bodily action in emerging technologies such as Deep Tree suggests a high pedagogical potential of further development of zooming features for optimal scientific understanding."
Ambulatory end-stage liver disease in Ghana; patient profile and utility of alpha fetoprotein and aspartate aminotransferase: platelet ratio index,"End-stage liver disease (ESLD) is a major burden on public health, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important risk factor. We aimed to describe clinical characteristics of ESLD from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the performance of aspartate aminotransferase (AST)—platelet ratio index (APRI) and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) in Ghana."
Energy saving technology for sintering of black bricks from high-siliceous clay,"The low-temperature synthesis of bricks prepared from high-siliceous clays by the method of plastic molding of blanks was used. For the preparation of brick blanks, binary and ternary mixtures of high-siliceous clays, black sand, and bottle glass cullet were used. Gray-black low-porosity and high-porosity ceramics was obtained by sintering under conditions of oxygen deficiency. It has been established that to initiate plastic in mixtures containing high-siliceous clay, it is necessary to add montmorillonite/bentonite additives, carry out low-temperature sintering, and introduce low-melting glass additives with a melting point ranging from 750 to 800 °C. The performed investigations have shown that the sintering of mixtures with a total content of iron oxide of about 5 wt% under reducing conditions at Tsint. = 800°C for 8 h leads to the formation of glass ceramics consisting of quartz, feldspars, and a phase. The main sources of the appearance of a dark color is the formation of [Fe3+O4]4- and [Fe3+O6]9- anions in the composition of the glass phase and feldspars. By changing the contents of clay, sand, and glass in sintering, it is possible to obtain two types of ceramic materials: (a) in the form of building bricks and (b) in the form of porous fillers."
"Structural, thermal and morphological studies of bio-based straws under aerobic degradation process","The environmental problems caused by the persistence and improper disposal of single use plastics, have led the worldwide authorities to migrate into a sustainable production of bio-based materials, whose components need to be studied for proving their nature and to confirm their degradability. For this reason, the identification and monitoring degradation of five single use straws were assessed through FT-IR, TGA/DTA and SEM techniques which demonstrate that the straws tagged as biodegradable contain polymers of fossil origin in their formulation. Degradation of them was found to be influenced by polar groups, such as ester and glycosidic bonds of the biodegradable phase. The thermal stability decreased and the morphological characteristics as cracks and holes were detected after biodegradation."
Degradation of allura red dye using Fe-Zn metal nanoparticles obtained by phytosynthesis method.,"In the present work, the photocatalytic activity of metal Fe-Zn nanoparticles was evaluated through the degradation of the synthetic AZO colorant allura red. A Phytosynthesis method developed here takes advantage for the first time of the plant extract of Hydrocotyle ranunculoides as the reducing agent. A fitted Folin-Ciocalteu assay showed about 40% of total polyphenolic compounds used in the nanoparticles generation. UV-Vis and TEM analysis allowed identification of the nanoparticles as oxides of Fe and Zn. Finally, during measurement of the photocatalytic activity a load of 0.5 g/L was applied on a 15 μM solution of allura red as standard model pollutant, while environmental oxygen was used as the initiating agent. Tests showed a 66% degradation of the azo-type dye obeying a degradation kinetics of the first order after short times."
Mechanical and bio-lubricated friction performance of PA6G for gear applications,"The PA6G blue is a polymeric material for great versatility of engineering applications that required good mechanical and tribological properties such as gears. The focus of this study was to investigate the mechanical properties as well as the friction and wear resistance of a commercial PA6G blue under biodegradable external lubrication, to evaluate its potential use for gear applications. Firstly, the PA6G blue was characterized by FTIR analysis in order to identify the characteristic chemical groups of this polymer. The mechanical characterization was performed by tension and hardness tests according to the standards ASTM D638 and ASTM E10, respectively. Subsequently, friction tests were carried out on a tribometer with pin-on-disk configuration based on the ASTM G99 standard, in dry and lubricated conditions. Natural castor and canola oils were employed as bio-lubricants, as well as their mixture at 50% by volume. The results exhibited that the PA6G blue exhibit good mechanical performance as that required by gear fabrications. Besides, the friction performance showed a low friction coefficient of 0.11 in the dry condition that decreased about 50% in lubricated tests, obtaining a friction coefficient value of 0.054."
Alginate and alginate-zeolite beads for removal of cadmium present in water,"The use of ALG beads and ALG-ZEO beads for the removal of Cd2+ was evaluated in a batch system, was determined the effect of pH, kinetics and adsorption isotherm. The characterization was carried out by FTIR, SEM and EDS. The EDS analysis showed that the main elements are C, O and Ca, these are associated with the chemical composition of alginate while the ALG-ZEO bead showed characteristic crystals of the zeolite. Cd2+ adsorption was carried out at pH 6 using ALG beads and ALG-ZEO beads as adsorbent. The suggested mechanism to explain the removal of the Cd2+ ion was is through a chemisorption process. Finally the adsorption process was adjusted to kinetic and isotherm models."
Vanadium Additions to a High-Cr White Iron and its Effects on the Abrasive Wear Behavior.,"From the present study, vanadium additions up to 6.4% were added to a 14%Cr-3%C white iron, and the effect on the microstructure, hardness and abrasive wear were analysed. The experimental irons were melted in an open induction furnace and cast into sand moulds to obtain bars of 18, 25, and 37 mm thickness. The alloys were characterized by optical and electronic microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Bulk hardness was measured in the as-cast conditions and after a destabilization heat treatment at 900°C for 45 min. Abrasive wear resistance tests were undertaken for the different irons according to the ASTM G65 standard in both as-cast and heat-treated conditions under a load of 60 N for 1500 m. The results show that, vanadium additions caused a decrease in the carbon content in the alloy and that some carbon is also consumed by forming primary vanadium carbides; thus, decreasing the eutectic M7C3 carbide volume fraction (CVF) from 30% for the base iron to 20% for the iron with 6.4%V;but overall CVF content (M7C3 + VC) is constant at 30%. Wear behaviour was better for the heat-treated alloys and mainly for the 6.4%V iron. Such a behaviour is discussed in terms of the CVF, the amount of vanadium carbides, the amount of martensite/austenite in matrix and the amount of secondary carbides precipitated during the destabilization heat treatment."
Electrochemical Behavior of Carbon Steel Plates with a Protective Film Developed from Copper Nanoparticles,"Carbon steel has gained wide applications as a structural material due to its combination of strength, ductility, and low cost; in fact, this material has been studied as one of the proposals for the manufacture of radioactive waste containers in countries such as Japan, France, and the United States. One of the biggest problems of carbon steel is its susceptibility to general corrosion, while copper and its alloys, despite not having high mechanical resistance, are materials with good corrosion resistance properties. This work evaluates the reliability of protective films developed from copper nanoparticles to improve the corrosion resistance of carbon steel plates. The nanoparticles were synthesized by a chemical reduction method using copper sulphate (CuSO4) as a precursor, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as a reducing agent, and citric acid as an antioxidant. These nanoparticles were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), as well as by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) before and after being treated with citric acid. Finally, they were deposited on the carbon steel surface by Electrophoretic Deposition using a current of 0.5 mA/cm2. The protective capacity of the films developed from copper nanoparticles was evaluated by means of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and Linear Polarization Resistance techniques in 0.1 M HCl solution."
Makroökonomische Folgen der demografischen Alterung,"Der demografische Wandel ist in den meisten Industrienationen mit einer Alterung und Schrumpfung der Erwerbsbevölkerung verbunden. Daraus ergeben sich erhebliche Konsequenzen für zentrale makroökonomische Größen wie das Bruttoinlandsprodukt, die Arbeitsproduktivität, die Ersparnisse und Investitionen sowie den Leistungsbilanzsaldo. Angesichts des in den nächsten Jahrzehnten zu erwartenden demografischen Wandels müssen vor allem die stark alternden Länder Deutschland und Japan mit einer spürbaren Dämpfung des Wirtschaftswachstums rechnen. Allerdings kann z. B. der technologische Fortschritt in Form von Automatisierung und Digitalisierung diesen Entwicklungen entgegenwirken."
Der amerikanische Traum ist ausgeträumt,
Gleicht Schulbildung soziale Unterschiede aus?,"Bildungsungleichheit ist ein Hauptgrund dafür, dass Einkommensunterschiede über Generationen hinweg bestehen bleiben. Da das im Erwachsenenalter erzielte Einkommen mit kognitiven Fähigkeiten im Schulalter zusammenhängt, werden die schulischen Fähigkeiten von Kindern mit deren sozioökonomischem Hintergrund verglichen. Unsere Untersuchungen mit Paneldaten zu Schulkindern in Deutschland führen zu dem Ergebnis, dass Performanceunterschiede bereits zu Schulbeginn bestehen und die Lücken im Lauf der Schulzeit nicht geschlossen werden. Diese Ergebnisse sind relevant für politische Maßnahmen, die darauf zielen, die Einkommensmobilität zwischen Generationen zu erhöhen und Chancengleichheit zu schaffen. Frühkindliche Maßnahmen können helfen, bereits vor Schulbeginn bestehende Leistungsunterschiede zu verringern."
Zur Zukunft der EU-Finanzen nach Corona,"Im Zuge der Corona-Krise erfuhr die Finanzierungsgrundlage der EU größere Änderungen, die in der Frage resultieren, welche Form die zukünftige Finanzverfassung der EU annehmen wird. Der zusätzliche Wiederaufbaupakt mit einem Volumen von drei Vierteln des neuen mehrjährigen Finanzrahmens wird durch die erstmalige Verschuldung der EU selbst finanziert. Reicht dieses beispiellose fiskalische Volumen, um zukünftig im Wettbewerb mit China bestehen zu können? Oder braucht die EU eine Neuausrichtung: zum einen in Bezug auf Umfang und Differenzierung ihrer verschiedenen Aufgaben und zum anderen bezüglich der gleichen Rechte ihrer 27 Mitgliedstaaten? Die Umbrüche infolge der Corona-Krise sollten für eine größere Reform der EU-Finanzen genutzt werden."

Nonlocal nonlinear analysis of functionally graded plates using natural neighbour Galerkin method,"In the present work, flexural response of functionally graded plates subjected to transverse loads have been investigated using the meshless natural neighbor Galerkin method (NNGM). The plate formulation has been developed based on the Reddy’s (Mechanics of laminated composite plates and shells: theory and analysis, 2nd edition, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2014) third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT) using the von Kármán nonlinear strains. The governing equations of the TSDT have been derived accounting for the length scale/size effects considering the Eringen’s nonlocal stress-gradient model (Eringen in Microcontinuum filed theories—I: foundations and solids, Springer-Verlag, 1998). The C1 continuous shape functions have been computed using the sibson’s interpolant and generalizing a Bezier patch over the domain. The nonlocal nonlinear model of the resulting governing equations has been developed, and Newton’s iterative procedure is used for the solution of nonlinear algebraic equations. The mechanical properties of functionally graded plate are assumed to vary continuously through the thickness and obey a power-law distribution of the volume fraction of the constituents. The variation of volume fractions through the thickness have been computed using two different homogenization techniques, namely, the rule of mixtures and the Mori–Tanaka scheme. A detailed parametric study to show the effect of side-to-thickness ratio, power-law index, and nonlocal parameter on the load-deflection characteristics of plates have been presented. The central deflections obtained using (NNGM) have been compared with the results from literature based on finite element method. The results have been compared with the two homogenization schemes and also with results computed with the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) to show the accuracy of nonlocal nonlinear formulation based on TSDT."
Magnetic Textile Solid Phase Extraction of Cationic Dyes from Water Solutions,Magnetically responsive acrylic nonwoven textile impregnated with negatively charged κ-carrageenan was used as an adsorbent for the extraction of cationic dyes using magnetic textile solid phase extraction (MTSPE). Polysaccharide modified textile squares were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy; both techniques confirmed successful modification of textile fibers. The extracted dyes were analyzed by spectrophotometry of the dyes eluted at low pH and by image analysis of the dyed textile. Dyes in the concentration range 0.1–2 mg/l were successfully analyzed. It was clearly shown that MTSPE is an efficient preconcentration procedure for dye analysis.
One-Step Dyeing and Antimicrobial Finishing of PET Fabric with Novel 4-Arylazopyrazolone Disperse Dyes,"Azopyrazole disperse dyes 8–12 could be synthesized either by condensing ethyl 3-hydroxy-2-aryldiazenyl butenoates 3–7 with S-methyl hydrazine carbodithioate 1 or by coupling the parent pyrazole 2 with diazotized aniline, p-substituted anilines and/or 4-aminoantipyrine. These dyes were applied to polyester fabrics using a high-temperature dyeing method at 120 °C and displayed yellow to orange hues. Raman spectra of the dyed samples undoubtedly excluded ring dyeing and were found to agree with the proposed structures. The synthesized disperse dyes were found to possess very good dyeing properties, as indicated by color strength measurements, and all of them except dye 12 had a color strength (K/S) value ranging from 19–23. The dyed fabrics exhibited excellent fastness to washing and dry and wet rubbing as well as light fastness, which varied from moderate to very good. The antimicrobial activities of the synthesized pyrazoles 2 and 8–12 as well as the dyed fabric samples against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were measured, and the results showed very good activity."
FEA of Plain Woven Kevlar/Epoxy Composites Subjected to Normal and Oblique Impact with Multi-Scale Modelling,"High-performance Kevlar/epoxy plain woven composites are subjected to normal and oblique impact by a conical-cylindrical projectile. A multiscale modelling method which incorporates Micro-Meso-Macro transition approach is implemented to study the ballistic impact phenomena. This Macro Homogeneous-Meso heterogeneous modelling technique has been executed in this examination to develop the intricate weave design of the objective plate. A voxel-based non-conformal work has been utilized to comprehend the behavior of Representative Volume Element (RVE). The damage properties are implemented utilizing a user-defined function for the explicit analysis. The model is approved with the available literary works for Kevlar and carbon composites to feature the thorough inclusion of the technique. The model is considered for different oblique angles (0 °, 30 °, 45 °, 60 °) and its effects on energy absorption, damage mechanism and residual velocity are observed."
Development of High-Performance Composites with Molecular Weight Controlled Polyimide Oligomers End-Capped with Phenylethynyl Groups,"A series of molecular weight controlled polyimide oligomer (Oligo-PI) resins were developed via the polymerization of 4,4′-(1,3-phenylenedioxy)dianiline (TPE-R), 2,3′,3,4′-biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride (BPDA) and 4-phenylethynyl phthalic anhydride (PEPA). PEPA was served as the molecular weight controlling and reactive end-capping agent. Oligo-PI resins have an asymmetric and amorphous structure, which could make better processability to fabricate composites. To investigate the effect of molecular weight (MW) and chain extension structures of phenylethynyl groups by thermal curing on thermal and mechanical properties, carbon fabric reinforced Oligo-PIs (Oligo-PI/CFs) were prepared via hot press technique. Morphology, mechanical and thermal properties of Oligo-PI/CFs were measured by SEM, TGA, IZOD impact tester, and UTM (three-point bending test). As MW got higher and the ordered network structures were formed, the composite exhibited excellent thermal stability. Flexural strengths also increased by building the crosslinked structures. On the other hand, impact strengths were less influenced. Among Oligo-PI/CFs, Oligo-PI/CF-3 showed comparatively good performance. The mechanical properties of Oligo-PI/CF-3 (5 ply) was evaluated at both 25 °C and 200 °C. The composite maintained high strengths even at high temperatures, demonstrating the durability of Oligo-PI/CFs in harsh conditions utilized for the aerospace and military applications."
Valorization of Passion Fruit Stalk by the Preparation of Cellulose Nanofibers and Immobilization of Trypsin,"Fibers from passion fruit stalks were first recovered with a pulping and bleaching process. Two mechanical treatments were further applied to the fibers, homogenization (with and without ultrasound), and blender application. The effect of those treatments on fibers was evaluated. The chemical composition of the different stages of fibers undergoing treatment were measured according to TAPPI standards and were also analyzed by SEM, FTIR, and XRD. Trypsin was immobilized by adsorption and by covalent binding. The biocatalyst support-trypsin was evaluated in terms of immobilization yield, retention, and enzymatic activity. The experimental results demonstrated that the final cellulose concentration in the fibers was 44 % higher than that in the raw stalks. The cellulose nanofibers obtained by homogenization presented a size distribution between 20–200 nm, and the application of ultrasound did not show a significant effect on size (between 50 to 300 nm). Trypsin immobilized using glycidol presented an immobilization yield of 67 % and presented higher retention and enzymatic activity (1.17±0.05 U/mg protein and 44.0±2.0 %, respectively). These results show that passion fruit stalks can be successfully used as a source of cellulose nanofibers and also can be used as carriers for the immobilization of trypsin."
A Three-Bath Process for Dyeing Cotton with Bis-Azo Bi-Functional Reactive Dyes Based on Diazonium Salts,"Mono-azo dyes possessing a primary aromatic amino group have been shown to react with cotton by diazotization followed by treatment with soda ash at 60–65 °C thereby acting as monofunctional reactive dyes. Bis-azo dyes bearing two amino groups are expected to act as bi-functional reactive dyes and exhibit enhanced dye-cellulose fixation. This work shows that the difference in fixation exhibited by mono-azo and bis-azo dyes is statistically significant at 95 % confidence level in favor of the latter group. This work describes a three-bath dyeing process which reduced the amount of consumed water by 60.6 % and the environment factor by 62.2 %. The newly developed three-bath process also conserves energy by 74.1 %. Hence, a new class of bifunctional reactive dyes without externally attached reactive systems is, in principle, available. It will have the advantage of reducing raw materials and manufacturing costs. It also employs a sustainable reactive dyeing process."
Influence of Drying Conditions on the Wrinkling of Fabrics,"Wrinkles are formed in fabrics because of mechanical action and the physicochemical effects of water and heat during washing and drying processes. This study aims to identify the main drying conditions that affect the wrinkles by evaluating the smoothness appearance of various fabrics, under four different sets of drying conditions. It was found that the woven fabrics that had a low degree of freedom of yarn movement wrinkled more easily than the knit fabrics. Furthermore, depending on the hydrophilicity of the fibers, the degree of wrinkling was influenced by the temperature and humidity during the drying process. In particular, synthetic fibers with low glass transition temperatures (Tg) wrinkled more significantly at high drying temperatures. Wrinkles generated during the washing process could be partially removed by mechanical force during tumbling under the Heater and Heatpump(t) conditions. However, under the Heatpump(h) and Line Dry conditions, they tended to be fixed in drying processes with less or no applied mechanical force. Repeated washing and drying resulted in an increased degree of wrinkling in the hydrophilic laundry, particularly in the wool fabric, due to shrinkage and felting. It can be concluded that the drying temperature and mechanical force affect the formation of wrinkles. Wrinkle formation in synthetic fibers can thus be mitigated by controlling these factors, in consideration of the glass transition temperature of the fibers."
Durable Hydrophilic Modification of Wool Scales with Reactive Surfactants in Saturated Neutral Salt System,"In this study, a new reactive surfactant was synthesized from cyanuric chloride and Jeffamine ED-600 or ED-2003, and then applied to the pre-reduced wool fabric in saturated neutral salt solution at low temperature. This treatment condition inhibited the wool swelling, making the surfactant mainly covalently bond on the scales of wool. The structure of surfactant was confirmed by 13C NMR, and the modified wool fabrics were characterized by FTIR-ATR, XPS, and SEM after carefully washing with acetone and water. The wettability, liquid transport ability, antistatic and mechanical properties of the modified wool fabrics were also investigated. The results suggested that this modification method could significantly improve the hydrophilicity of wool surface, enhance the transport ability of liquid through the fabric and increase the antistatic properties of the fabric under low humidity conditions. Importantly, the modified fabric has robust washing fastness, with no serious damage to wool."
Structural Characterization and Mechanical Behaviour of Sodium Hydroxide-Treated Urena lobata Fiber Reinforced Polypropylene Matrix Composites,"The present study is on the production and characterization of untreated and treated Urena lobata (U. lobata) fiber reinforced polypropylene (PP) composites. The untreated and treated U. lobata/PP composites were produced by compression moulding at varying weight percents of the fibers (5, 10, 15, 20 25, 30, 35) wt%. The following characterizations were carried out on the treated and untreated U. lobata/PP composites; X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Due to enhanced fiber-matrix adhesion, attributed to increased fiber roughness and crystallinity, the alkaline treated U. lobata composites showed enhanced mechanical, structural and morphological properties over the untreated U. lobata reinforced composites. Furthermore, the 30 wt% fiber loading, gave the best combination of the mechanical properties, as improvement in tensile strength (2–22 %), percentage elongation (5–26 %), and impact strength (2–19 %) was observed for the treated fiber reinforced composite compositions. Consequently, the 30 wt.% Urena lobata/PP composite is recommended for the development of PMC based automobile components."
Lessons from a GWAS study of a wheat pre-breeding program: pyramiding resistance alleles to Fusarium crown rot,"Much has been published on QTL detection for complex traits using bi-parental and multi-parental crosses (linkage analysis) or diversity panels (GWAS studies). While successful for detection, transferability of results to real applications has proven more difficult. Here, we combined a QTL detection approach using a pre-breeding populations which utilized intensive phenotypic selection for the target trait across multiple plant generations, combined with rapid generation turnover (i.e. “speed breeding”) to allow cycling of multiple plant generations each year. The reasoning is that QTL mapping information would complement the selection process by identifying the genome regions under selection within the relevant germplasm. Questions to answer were the location of the genomic regions determining response to selection and the origin of the favourable alleles within the pedigree. We used data from a pre-breeding program that aimed at pyramiding different resistance sources to Fusarium crown rot into elite (but susceptible) wheat backgrounds. The population resulted from a complex backcrossing scheme involving multiple resistance donors and multiple elite backgrounds, akin to a MAGIC population (985 genotypes in total, with founders, and two major offspring layers within the pedigree). A significant increase in the resistance level was observed (i.e. a positive response to selection) after the selection process, and 17 regions significantly associated with that response were identified using a GWAS approach. Those regions included known QTL as well as potentially novel regions contributing resistance to Fusarium crown rot. In addition, we were able to trace back the sources of the favourable alleles for each QTL. We demonstrate that QTL detection using breeding populations under selection for the target trait can identify QTL controlling the target trait and that the frequency of the favourable alleles was increased as a response to selection, thereby validating the QTL detected. This is a valuable opportunistic approach that can provide QTL information that is more easily transferred to breeding applications."
Building national eco-cultural protection areas and the Xiangxi practice in Hunan Province,"Since 2007, the Chinese government has initiated the building of national eco-cultural protection areas (NECPAs), thereby embarking on a significant transformation of the model of intangible cultural heritage (ICH) protection in China. To understand the origin and outputs of this policy, this paper demonstrates the context of China’s NECPAs. It proposes a conceptual NECPA framework that mainly features regional overall ICH protection. This is followed by an examination of the case of Xiangxi in Western Hunan as a pilot zone for China’s eco-cultural protection. Xiangxi has performed much related work to promote NECPAs and made great progress in regional overall ICH protection. This insight suggests that there are benefits and costs associated with promotion of China’s NECPAs and regional overall ICH protection. Despite the advantages of institutional innovation, the unexpected side effects actually undermine the success of plan implementation."
Investigation on flood event variations at space and time scales in the Huaihe River Basin of China using flood behavior classification,"Flood is one of the severest natural disasters in the world and has caused enormous causalities and property losses. Previous studies usually focus on flood magnitude and occurrence time at event scale, which are insufficient to contain entire behavior characteristics of flood events. In our study, nine behavior metrics in five categories (e.g., magnitude, duration, timing, rates of changes and variability) are adopted to fully describe a flood event. Regional and interannual variations of representative flood classes are investigated based on behavior similarity classification of numerous events. Contributions of geography, land use, hydrometeorology and human regulation on these variations are explored by rank analysis method. Results show that: five representative classes are identified, namely, conventional events (Class 1, 61.7% of the total), low discharge events with multiple peaks (Class 2, 5.3%), low discharge events with low rates of changes (Class 3, 18.1%), low discharge events with high rates of changes (Class 4, 10.8%) and high discharge events with long durations (Class 5, 4.1%). Classes 1 and 3 are the major flood events and distributed across the whole region. Class 4 is mainly distributed in river sources, while Classes 2 and 5 are in the middle and down streams. Moreover, the flood class is most diverse in normal precipitation years (2006, 2008–2010 and 2015), followed by wet years (2007, 2013–2014), and dry years (2011 and 2012). All the impact factor categories explain 34.0%–84.1% of individual flood class variations. The hydrometeorological category (7.2%–56.9%) is the most important, followed by geographical (1.0%–6.3%), regulation (1.7%–5.1%) and land use (0.9%–2.2%) categories. This study could provide new insights into flood event variations in a comprehensive manner, and provide decision-making basis for flood control and resource utilization at basin scale."
Comparison of spatio-temporal transmission characteristics of COVID-19 and its mitigation strategies in China and the US,"Investigating the spatio-temporal transmission features and process of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mitigation strategies are of great practical significance to understand the development of COVID-19 and establish international cooperation for prevention and control. In this paper, the cumulative number of confirmed cases, number of confirmed cases per day and cumulative number of deaths, were used to compare transmission paths, outbreaks timelines, and coping strategies of COVID-19 in China and the US. The results revealed that: first, the COVID-19 outbreaks in both China and the US exhibited a 6-week initiation stage. In China, the COVID-19 erupted in late January. It lasted only a short period of time and was almost completely contained within 6–8 weeks. But the COVID-19 erupted in early March in the US and was still in the peak or post-peak stage. Second, in China, the COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan and spread to other regions of Hubei Province and then nationwide, exhibiting a cross(“+”)-shaped of spread with Wuhan city as the center. Importantly, the COVID-19 in China had a large concentration and there were no national outbreaks. In contrast, the COVID-19 in the US first spread through New York and the western and eastern coasts but has since emerged throughout the entire country. Third, the lack of emergency response planning in both countries in the early stage (about 6-week) hampered COVID-19 prevention. However, actively high-pressure prevention and control measures were used to basically control COVID-19 in early March in China. And then China has gradually resumed business and production activities. Unfortunately, the US government missed the best opportunity to contain the epidemic. Faced with the choice between economic recovery and coronavirus containment, the US removed the quarantine and restriction measures too early. The COVID-19 is continuing to spread in the country and blossom everywhere, still showing no signs of receding."
Baseline serum TSH levels predict the absence of thyroid dysfunction in cancer patients treated with immunotherapy,Immunotherapy against immune checkpoints has significantly improved survival both in metastatic and adjuvant setting in several types of cancers. Thyroid dysfunction is the most common endocrine adverse event reported. Patients who are at risk of developing thyroid dysfunction remain to be defined. We aimed to identify predictive factors for the development of thyroid dysfunction during immunotherapy.
"Low-quality animal by-product streams for the production of PHA-biopolymers: fats, fat/protein-emulsions and materials with high ash content as low-cost feedstocks","The rapid accumulation of crude-oil based plastics in the environment is posing a fundamental threat to the future of mankind. The biodegradable and bio-based polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) can replace conventional plastics, however, their current production costs are not competitive and therefore prohibiting PHAs from fulfilling their potential."
"Frailty Index, Hospital Admission and Number of Days Spent in Hospital in Nursing Home Residents: Results from the INCUR Study",To investigate the predictive capacity of an age-related deficit accumulation index (the so-called Frailty Index [FI] proposed by Rockwood) for hospital admission (HA) and number of days spent in hospital (DSH) among nursing home residents.
The Evolutionary Stage of Cognitive Frailty and Its Changing Characteristics in Old Adults,"This study aimed to explore the evolutionary stage of the elderly from the normal to the cognitive frailty, and to identify the important factors which influenced the changes of the cognitive frailty stage from the «physiological-psychological-social» perspective."
Alopecia in Harlequin mutant mice is associated with reduced AIF protein levels and expression of retroviral elements,"We investigated the contribution of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, in supporting hair growth. We report that pelage abnormalities developed during hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis in Harlequin (Hq) mutant mice. Fragility of the hair cortex was associated with decreased expression of genes encoding structural hair proteins, though key transcriptional regulators of HF development were expressed at normal levels. Notably, Aifm1 (R200 del) knockin males and Aifm1(R200 del)/Hq females showed minor hair defects, despite substantially reduced AIF levels. Furthermore, we cloned the integrated ecotropic provirus of the Aifm1Hq allele. We found that its overexpression in wild-type keratinocyte cell lines led to down-regulation of HF-specific Krt84 and Krtap3-3 genes without altering Aifm1 or epidermal Krt5 expression. Together, our findings imply that pelage paucity in Hq mutant mice is mechanistically linked to severe AIF deficiency and is associated with the expression of retroviral elements that might potentially influence the transcriptional regulation of structural hair proteins."
A Walnut Diet in Combination with Enriched Environment Improves Cognitive Function and Affects Lipid Metabolites in Brain and Liver of Aged NMRI Mice,"This in vivo study aimed to test if a diet enriched with 6% walnuts alone or in combination with physical activity supports healthy ageing by changing the oxylipin profile in brain and liver, improving motor function, cognition, and cerebral mitochondrial function. Female NMRI mice were fed a 6% walnut diet starting at an age of 12 months for 24 weeks. One group was additionally maintained in an enriched environment, one group without intervention served as control. After three months, one additional control group of young mice (3 weeks old) was introduced. Motor and cognitive functions were measured using Open Field, Y-Maze, Rotarod and Passive Avoidance tests. Lipid metabolite profiles were determined using RP-LC-ESI(-)-MS/MS in brain and liver tissues of mice. Cerebral mitochondrial function was characterized by the determination of ATP levels, mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial respiration. Expression of genes involved with mito- and neurogenesis, inflammation, and synaptic plasticity were determined using qRT-PCR. A 6% walnut-enriched diet alone improved spatial memory in a Y-Maze alternation test (p < 0.05) in mice. Additional physical enrichment enhanced the significance, although the overall benefit was virtually identical. Instead, physical enrichment improved motor performance in a Rotarod experiment (p* < 0.05) which was unaffected by walnuts alone. Bioactive oxylipins like hydroxy-polyunsaturated fatty acids (OH-PUFA) derived from linoleic acid (LA) were significantly increased in brain (p** < 0.01) and liver (p*** < 0.0001) compared to control mice, while OH-PUFA of α-linolenic acid (ALA) could only be detected in the brains of mice fed with walnuts. In the brain, walnuts combined with physical activity reduced arachidonic acid (ARA)-based oxylipin levels (p < 0.05). Effects of walnut lipids were not linked to mitochondrial function, as ATP production, mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial respiration were unaffected. Furthermore, common markers for synaptic plasticity and neuronal growth, key genes in the regulation of cytoprotective response to oxidative stress and neuronal growth were unaffected. Taken together, walnuts change the oxylipin profile in liver and brain, which could have beneficial effects for healthy ageing, an effect that can be further enhanced with an active lifestyle. Further studies may focus on specific nutrient lipids that potentially provide preventive effects in the brain."
On systems of parabolic variational inequalities with multivalued terms,"In this paper we present an analytical framework for the following system of multivalued parabolic variational inequalities in a cylindrical domain \(Q=\varOmega \times (0,\tau )\): For \(k=1,\dots , m\), find \(u_k\in K_k\) and \(\eta _k\in L^{p'_k}(Q)\) such that"
Statistical methods and models based on quality of experience distributions,"Due to biased assumptions on the underlying ordinal rating scale in subjective Quality of Experience (QoE) studies, Mean Opinion Score (MOS)-based evaluations provide results, which are hard to interpret and can be misleading. This paper proposes to consider the full QoE distribution for evaluating, reporting, and modeling QoE results instead of relying on MOS-based metrics derived from results based on ordinal rating scales. The QoE distribution can be represented in a concise way by using the parameters of a multinomial distribution without losing any information about the underlying QoE ratings, and even keeps backward compatibility with previous, biased MOS-based results. Considering QoE results as a realization of a multinomial distribution allows to rely on a well-established theoretical background, which enables meaningful evaluations also for ordinal rating scales. Moreover, QoE models based on QoE distributions keep detailed information from the results of a QoE study of a technical system, and thus, give an unprecedented richness of insights into the end users’ experience with the technical system. In this work, existing and novel statistical methods for QoE distributions are summarized and exemplary evaluations are outlined. Furthermore, using the novel concept of quality steps, simulative and analytical QoE models based on QoE distributions are presented and showcased. The goal is to demonstrate the fundamental advantages of considering QoE distributions over MOS-based evaluations if the underlying rating data is ordinal in nature."
Photocatalytic activity of TiO2 synthesized by anodization and anodic spark deposition,"Several photocatalysts, based on titanium dioxide, were synthesized by spark anodization techniques and anodic spark oxidation. Photocatalytic activity was determined by methylene blue oxidation and the catalytic activities of the catalysts were evaluated after 70 hours of reaction. Scanning Electron Microscopy and X Ray Diffraction analysis were used to characterize the catalysts. The photocatalyst prepared with a solution of sulfuric acid and 100 V presented the best performance in terms of oxidation of the dye (62%). The electric potential during the synthesis (10 V, low potential; 100 V, high potential) affected the surface characteristics: under low potential, catalyst presented smooth and homogeneous surfaces with spots (high TiO2 concentration) of amorphous solids; under low potential, catalyst presented porous surfaces with crystalline solids homogeneously distributed."
Sliding Wear Behavior of Ti-6Al-1.5V-1Mo-0.5Zr-0.1C Alloy Modified with Small Additions of Ru and Different V and Mo Contents.,"Titanium alloys have been successfully used in the energy industry due to their stability at high temperature service, good mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. The near-α Ti-6%Al-1.5%V-1.0%Mo-0.5%Zr-0.1%C alloy, has been successfully used in several parts for geothermal energy generation. Several studies have concluded that the wear behavior of Ti alloys is generally poor; however, the specific tribosystem must be analyzed. This work analyzes the additions of 0.3%Ru, and variations of the V and Mo contents on the wear performance of a Ti alloy. Different combinations of α+β and degrees of microstructural refinement were observed depending on the composition. Wear test were undertaken by using a dry sliding block-on-ring configuration under the ASTM G77 standard. Two different loads (7 and 25 N) were used against a M2 hardened steel ring as a counter face with a hardness of 790 HV. Results showed that for the 7N load, the wear behavior is related to the volume fraction and thickness of the α phase; on the other hand, for the 25N load tests, the wear losses are directly proportional to the bulk hardness of the alloys and the α plate thickness, for this condition, best wear performance was achieved by the alloy 3 which contains 1.0wt%V, 1.8wt% Mo and 0.25wt% Ru. From the experimental results of the present study, it has been found that the wear behavior is directly related to the microstructure, e.g. amount of phases, refinement degree, applied load, and, in a lesser extent to the bulk hardness."
Synthesis and characterization of La0.7Sr0.3Fe0.7Co0.3O3±δ by Sonochemistry,"Among different possible energy sources, in the search for fossil fuel substitutes, hydrogen and fuel cells are presented as one of the most promising alternatives, with great potential, in the development of devices for the generation of clean electrical energy. Recently, lanthanum based compounds have been studied due to their interesting transport properties, which led these products to be applied as possible cathode materials in a solid oxide fuel cell. In this work, a lanthanum based material with a perovskite structure, La0.7Sr0.3Fe0.7Co0.3O3±δ (LSFC), was synthesized, from nitrates, by sonochemistry. This product was structurally characterized by powder X-ray diffraction and morphological studies were obtained by scanning electron microscopy. Results showed a nanostructured material with a crystal size in de order of 14 nm and a cubic perovskite structure with cell parameters of a = 3.8927 Å. Morphological characterization indicated a porous material formed by grains of homogeneous size, pores had an average length of 17 nm and area of 36 nm2, showing a channel shape distribution."
Dry sliding wear of a Ni-based superalloy as a function of the aging time.,"From the present work, the wear behavior of aged Ni-based superalloy was analyzed under dry sliding conditions. Such alloy was melted in a vacuum induction furnace and cast into a ceramic mold. Then the alloy was solubilized at 1080°C for 4 hours and then aged at 760°C for 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 72 and 150 hours. The alloy was characterized as-cast and also in the heat-treated conditions by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Mechanical characterization included just Vickers hardness and wear resistance under dry sliding conditions by a block on ring configuration according to the ASTM G77 standard. Wear tests were undertaken for 2000 m at a speed of 0.7 ms−1 at two different loads (25 and 78 N). The worn samples were analyzed by an optical profiler to determine the wear volume and by SEM to analyze the worn surface and the microstructure below the worn surface. The main findings indicate the formation of an oxide layer mainly formed by Cr and Ni during sliding. The thickness of such a layer is about 10 μm for short aging times and about 5 μm for longer aging times. For this load, the wear resistance was 50% higher for the shorter aging times than that for the longer aging times. This behavior is described in terms of the thickness of the protecting layer, and on the availability of chromium to form such a layer since it forms Cr23C6 at long aging times. On the other hand, for a load of 78 N the wear behavior is in agreement with hardness. Wear resistance increases with aging time due to the higher precipitation of prime gamma phase."
Features of laser drilling of porous aluminosilicate ceramics,"Studies have shown that local laser heating/“drilling” of composite large-porous ceramics consisting of aluminosilicates and glass phase is based on melting and ablation processes that lead to the formation of holes in a porous specimen. The interaction of the components of the composite in the high-temperature heating zone is accompanied by the formation of glass-phase melt of new composition. The advance of the melt deep into the sample along channel-like pores of the main ceramic material depends on the viscosity of the melt (i.e., the irradiation mode) and the cooling rate of the melt (i.e., the thermo-physical properties of the ceramics and glass phase). The development of gas-dynamic impact in the laser heating zone leads not only to the ejection of a part of the melt from the channel, but also to the compaction of the ceramics adjacent to the walls of the vitrified channel. These effects depend heavily on the ceramic-to-glass phase ratio and the porosity of the initial ceramic. It has been established that “laser perforation” of highly porous aluminosilicate ceramics leads to the hardening of the coarse-porous ceramics due to the formation of holes with strong walls, consisting of layers of the glass phase and compacted ceramics in the sample."
Phenomenological Modeling of the Apparent Viscosity as a Function of the Degree of Curing of an EPDM Elastomer,"The moving die rheometer technique (MDR) is used to measure the elastic and viscous components of rubber. The analysis of the rheometry and the kinetic behavior can be used to obtain mathematical models to predict the viscosity of elastomers as a function of the temperature, the time and the degree of curing. These predictions allow the control, the optimization and the design of the process. In this research the phenomenological model of Kamal-Sourour was used to describe the curing kinetics, while the Carreau Macosko model was used to describe the viscous behavior of an ethylene - propylene diene industrial type compound (EPDM). The mathematical parameters for each model where determined by using non-linear regression techniques. Since the viscosity increases significantly while the curing rate decreases, we proposed a mathematical model based on the Carreau expression in order to consider the influence of the kinetic of curing in the apparent viscosity behavior. It was found that after the curing rate reaches its maximum the viscosity tends to infinity; that is, the chemical transition process known as fluidity point or gel point occurs in the vicinity of maximum curing rate. According to the results, it is concluded that rubber viscosity is well described by considering the curing variations; the fluidity point in the vulcanization process can also be obtained by the practical method of phenomenological approach."
Mechanical properties of calcium carbonate/eggshell particle filled polypropylene Composites,"Calcium carbonate is widely used as a filler material in the production of polymer matrix composites and studies have shown that eggshell contains about 94% calcium carbonate. The effect of calcium carbonate from eggshell particles in polypropylene was studied in this work and the result compared with unreinforced polypropylene. Industrially synthesized calcium carbonate/eggshell particles were used as filler in polypropylene matrix with varying mass fractions from 5 to 20 wt. % at 5 wt. % increment. The produced samples were mechanically characterized for indentation hardness and uniaxial tensile properties using a Rockwell hardness tester and universal mechanical testing machine respectively. These properties were measured at different compositions to determine its compositional dependence. Microstructural analysis of the composites top and fracture surface was also carried out using scanning electron microscope to examine possible failure mode. The results were compared to measure the effect of reinforcement and the replacement criteria for the conventional calcium carbonate. The results obtained showed that calcium carbonate reinforced polypropylene has its highest tensile strength, elastic modulus and modulus of rupture at 5 wt. %, ductility and modulus of resilience at 10 wt. %, and hardness at 15 wt. %. The results also showed that granulated eggshell can provided appreciable improvement in the mechanical properties of polypropylene as obtainable in mineral calcium carbonate reinforced polypropylene."
Silencing of DsbA-L gene impairs the PPARγ agonist function of improving insulin resistance in a high-glucose cell model,"Disulfide-bond A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L) is a molecular chaperone involved in the multimerization of adiponectin. Recent studies have found that DsbA-L is related to metabolic diseases including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and can be regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists; the specific mechanism, however, is uncertain. Furthermore, the relationship between DsbA-L and the novel adipokine chemerin is also unclear. This article aims to investigate the role of DsbA-L in the improvement of insulin resistance by PPARγ agonists in trophoblast cells cultured by the high-glucose simulation of GDM placenta. Immunohistochemistry and western blot were used to detect differences between GDM patients and normal pregnant women in DsbA-L expression in the adipose tissue. The western blot technique was performed to verify the relationship between PPARγ agonists and DsbA-L, and to explore changes in key molecules of the insulin signaling pathway, as well as the effect of chemerin on DsbA-L. Results showed that DsbA-L was significantly downregulated in the adipose tissue of GDM patients. Both PPARγ agonists and chemerin could upregulate the level of DsbA-L. Silencing DsbA-L affected the function of rosiglitazone to promote the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (PKB)/AKT pathway. Therefore, it is plausible to speculate that DsbA-L is essential in the environment of PPARγ agonists for raising insulin sensitivity. Overall, we further clarified the mechanism by which PPARγ agonists improve insulin resistance."
"Fetal growth, fetal development, and placental features in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: analysis based on fetal and placental magnetic resonance imaging","Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common endocrine-metabolic dysfunction in reproductiveaged women, may be involved in compromised pregnancy and offspring outcomes. This study aimed to investigate whether maternal PCOS affects fetal growth, fetal development, and placental features. Methods: This retrospective case-control study included 60 pregnant women with PCOS (PCOS group) and 120 healthy pregnant women without PCOS (control group). Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed followed by an ultrasound examination and indications for imaging, including known or suspected fetal pathology, history of fetal abnormality in previous pregnancy or in a family member, and concern for placenta accreta. Fetal MRI images were analyzed for head circumference (HC), abdomen circumference (AC), lung-to-liver signal intensity ratio (LLSIR, a prenatal marker of fetal lung maturity), lengths of liver and kidney diameters in fetuses, and placental relative signal intensity on T2-weighted single-shot fast spin echo (SSFSE) imaging (rSISSFSE), and placental relative apparent diffusion coefficient value (rADC). Data on height and weight of offspring were collected through telephone follow-up. Results: Compared to the control group, the PCOS group showed the following characteristics: (1) smaller biparietal diameter and femur length in fetuses (P=0.026 and P=0.005, respectively), (2) smaller HC in fetuses (evident after 32 weeks; P=0.044), (3) lower LLSIR and smaller dorsoventral length of liver in fetuses (evident before 32 weeks; P=0.005 and P=0.019, respectively), and (4) smaller placental thickness (evident before 32 weeks; P=0.017). No significant differences in placental rSISSFSE or rADC were observed between the groups (all P>0.05). No significant differences in height and weight of offspring during childhood existed between the groups (all P>0.05). Conclusions: There exist alterations of fetal growth, fetal development, and placental features from women with PCOS."
Kindlin-2 regulates skeletal homeostasis by modulating PTH1R in mice,"In vertebrates, the type 1 parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R) is a critical regulator of skeletal development and homeostasis; however, how it is modulated is incompletely understood. Here we report that deleting Kindlin-2 in osteoblastic cells using the mouse 10-kb Dmp1-Cre largely neutralizes the intermittent PTH-stimulated increasing of bone volume fraction and bone mineral density by impairing both osteoblast and osteoclast formation in murine adult bone. Single-cell profiling reveals that Kindlin-2 loss increases the proportion of osteoblasts, but not mesenchymal stem cells, chondrocytes and fibroblasts, in non-hematopoietic bone marrow cells, with concomitant depletion of osteoblasts on the bone surfaces, especially those stimulated by PTH. Furthermore, haploinsufficiency of Kindlin-2 and Pth1r genes, but not that of either gene, in mice significantly decreases basal and, to a larger extent, PTH-stimulated bone mass, supporting the notion that both factors function in the same genetic pathway. Mechanistically, Kindlin-2 interacts with the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PTH1R via aa 474–475 and Gsα. Kindlin-2 loss suppresses PTH induction of cAMP production and CREB phosphorylation in cultured osteoblasts and in bone. Interestingly, PTH promotes Kindlin-2 expression in vitro and in vivo, thus creating a positive feedback regulatory loop. Finally, estrogen deficiency induced by ovariectomy drastically decreases expression of Kindlin-2 protein in osteocytes embedded in the bone matrix and Kindlin-2 loss essentially abolishes the PTH anabolic activity in bone in ovariectomized mice. Thus, we demonstrate that Kindlin-2 functions as an intrinsic component of the PTH1R signaling pathway in osteoblastic cells to regulate bone mass accrual and homeostasis."
STAT3 ameliorates cognitive deficits by positively regulating the expression of NMDARs in a mouse model of FTDP-17,"In tauopathies, memory impairment positively strongly correlates with the amount of abnormal tau aggregates; however, how tau accumulation induces synapse impairment is unclear. Recently, we found that human tau accumulation activated Signal Transduction and Activator of Transcription-1 (STAT1) to inhibit the transcription of synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Here, overexpressing human P301L mutant tau (P301L-hTau) increased the phosphorylated level of Signal Transduction and Activator of Transcription-3 (STAT3) at Tyr705 by JAK2, which would promote STAT3 translocate into the nucleus and activate STAT3. However, STAT3 was found mainly located in the cytoplasm. Further study found that P301L-htau acetylated STAT1 to bind with STAT3 in the cytoplasm, and thus inhibited the nuclear translocation and inactivation of STAT3. Knockdown of STAT3 in STAT3flox/flox mice mimicked P301L-hTau-induced suppression of NMDARs expression, synaptic and memory impairments. Overexpressing STAT3 rescued P301L-hTau-induced synaptic and cognitive deficits by increasing NMDARs expression. Further study proved that STAT3 positively regulated NMDARs transcription through direct binding to the specific GAS element of NMDARs promoters. These findings indicate that accumulated P301L-hTau inactivating STAT3 to suppress NMDARs expression, revealed a novel mechanism for tau-associated synapse and cognition deficits, and STAT3 will hopefully serve as a potential pharmacological target for tauopathies treatment."
m6A RNA methylation-mediated HNF3γ reduction renders hepatocellular carcinoma dedifferentiation and sorafenib resistance,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 3γ (HNF3γ) is a hepatocyte nuclear factor, but its role and clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Herein, we report that HNF3γ expression is downregulated in patient HCC and inversely correlated with HCC malignancy and patient survival. Moreover, our data suggested that the HNF3γ reduction in HCC could be mediated by METTL14-dependent m6A methylation of HNF3γ mRNA. HNF3γ expression was increased during hepatic differentiation and decreased in dedifferentiated HCC cells. Interestingly, HNF3γ delivery promoted differentiation of not only HCC cells but also liver CSCs, which led to suppression of HCC growth. Mechanistic analysis suggested an HNF3γ-centered regulatory network that includes essential liver differentiation-associated transcription factors and functional molecules, which could synergistically facilitate HCC cell differentiation. More importantly, enforced HNF3γ expression sensitized HCC cells to sorafenib-induced growth inhibition and cell apoptosis through transactivation of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 expression, which are major membrane transporters for sorafenib uptake. Clinical investigation showed that patient-derived HCC xenografts with high HNF3γ expression exhibited a sorafenib response and patients with high HCC HNF3γ levels benefited from sorafenib therapy. Together, these results suggest that HNF3γ plays an essential role in HCC differentiation and may serve as a therapeutic target and predictor of sorafenib benefit in patients."
In-situ identification of material batches using machine learning for machining operations,"In subtractive manufacturing, differences in machinability among batches of the same material can be observed. Ignoring these deviations can potentially reduce product quality and increase manufacturing costs. To consider the influence of the material batch in process optimization models, the batch needs to be efficiently identified. Thus, a smart service is proposed for in-situ material batch identification. This service is driven by a supervised machine learning model, which analyzes the signals of the machine’s control, especially torque data, for batch classification. The proposed approach is validated by cutting experiments with five different batches of the same specified material at various cutting conditions. Using this data, multiple classification models are trained and optimized. It is shown that the investigated batches can be correctly identified with close to 90% prediction accuracy using machine learning. Out of all the investigated algorithms, the best results are achieved using a Support Vector Machine with 89.0% prediction accuracy for individual batches and 98.9% while combining batches of similar machinability."
Mehr Nachhaltigkeit im deutschen Leitindex DAX,"Im Rahmen der Aufarbeitung des Wirecard-Skandals wird auch eine Änderung der Kriterien zur Aufnahme in den deutschen Leitindex DAX diskutiert. Die bislang von der Deutschen Börse vorgesehenen Maßnahmen gehen in die richtige Richtung, sind aber nicht weitreichend genug. Es bedarf eines deutlichen Zeichens, dass sich künftig nur solche Unternehmen für den DAX qualifizieren können, die ein zumindest befriedigendes Maß an Nachhaltigkeit gemessen durch einen ESG-Risk-Score (Environment, Social, Governance) in ihrer Geschäftstätigkeit erreichen. Eine Simulation verdeutlicht, dass nach ESG-Kriterien seit langem kritisch betrachtete Unternehmen dem DAX nicht mehr angehören würden. Damit könnte mehr Kapital in nachhaltig wirtschaftende Unternehmen und Sektoren fließen."

"Kāma, Preman, and Bhakti in Śrīdhara’s Commentary on Kṛṣṇa and the Gopīs in the Bhāgavata Purāṇa","Although the Bhāgavata Purāṇa presents an innovative soteriology of emotion that explicitly identifies kāma as the gopīs’ path to union with Kṛṣṇa, a close reading of his commentary on the rāsalīlā (and other passages treating the gopīs) reveals how Śrīdhara introduces preman into the narrative, sharply distinguishing kāma and preman. Śrīdhara also states that Bhāgavata 10.29–33 portrays Kṛṣṇa’s “victory over kāma” and that devotees who hear and recite the rāsalīlā likewise attain victory over kāma as the reward for their Kṛṣṇa-bhakti. This article shows that such claims disregard the Bhāgavata’s unambiguous statements about the gopīs’ kāma, and thus deny the Purāṇa’s subversive soteriology that legitimates various emotional modes of bhakti in order to enable everyone, including women, to experience an intimate and unmediated relationship with Kṛṣṇa."
Measuring optokinetic after-nystagmus: potential for detecting patients with signs of visual dependence following concussion,"Concussed patients with chronic symptoms commonly report dizziness during exposure to environments with complex visual stimuli (e.g. supermarket aisles, busy crossroads). Such visual induced dizziness is well-known in patients with vestibular deficits, in whom it indicates an overreliance on visual cues in sensory integration. Considering that optokinetic after-nystagmus (OKAN) reflects the response of the central network integrating visual and vestibular self-motion signals (velocity storage network), we investigated OKAN in 71 patients [17 (23.9%) females, 30.36 ± 9.05 years old] who suffered from persistent symptoms after a concussion and presented clinical signs suggesting visual dependence. Data were retrospectively compared with 21 healthy individuals [13 (61.9%) females, 26.29 ± 10.00 years old]. The median values of the slow cumulative eye position and of the time constant of OKAN were significantly higher in patients than in healthy individuals (slow cumulative eye position: 124.15 ± 55.61° in patients and 77.87 ± 45.63° in healthy individuals—p = 0.012; time constant: 25.17 ± 10.27 s in patients and 13.95 ± 4.92 s in healthy individuals—p = 0.003). The receiving operating curve (ROC) estimated on the time constant had an overall area under the curve of 0.73. Analysis of the ROC suggests that a test measuring the OKAN time constant could obtain a sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity of 0.72 in determining the origin of the visual-related disturbances in those patients (threshold 16.6 s). In a subset of 43 patients who also performed the Sensory Organization Test (SOT), the proposed OKAN test was twice as sensitive as the SOT. This study suggests that concussed patients with persisting visual symptoms may have an underlying impairment of the velocity storage mechanism and that measuring the OKAN time constant can objectify such impairment."
Real-World Effectiveness Analysis of Switching From Liraglutide or Dulaglutide to Semaglutide in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The Retrospective REALISE-DM Study,Injectable semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) that was previously shown to be superior to liraglutide and dulaglutide in head-to-head comparisons in GLP-1 RA-naïve individuals. It is hypothesized that semaglutide will cause further reductions in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and weight in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients previously treated with liraglutide or dulaglutide. The REALISE-DM study provides the first real-world evidence of the effectiveness and tolerability of semaglutide in patients switching from another GLP-1 RA.
Build back better: Neustart transatlantischer Handelsbeziehungen?,
Die USA nach der Wahl,"Nachdem Joe Biden die Präsidentschaftswahlen in den USA für sich entscheiden konnte, stellt sich die Frage, wie sich die transatlantischen Beziehungen zwischen den USA und der Europäischen Union zukünftig entwickeln werden. Das Verhältnis zwischen der US-Administration unter Donald Trump und der EU war durch gegenseitiges Misstrauen geprägt, das sich in verbalen Attacken und konkret in Strafzöllen ausgewirkt hat. Nun schlägt Joe Biden versöhnlichere Töne an, weshalb die EU auf einen Neustart nicht nur der transatlantischen Handelsbeziehungen hoffen darf. Die Autorinnen und Autoren analysieren, wie sich die USA in den Jahren der Trump-Administration wirtschaftlich und gesellschaftlich entwickelt haben und geben einen Ausblick auf die zukünftigen Herausforderungen und Potenziale der transatlantischen Beziehungen."

Spatiotemporal analysis of COVID-19 risk in Guangdong Province based on population migration,"Population migration, especially population inflow from epidemic areas, is a key source of the risk related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. This paper selects Guangdong Province, China, for a case study. It utilizes big data on population migration and the geospatial analysis technique to develop a model to achieve spatiotemporal analysis of COVID-19 risk. The model takes into consideration the risk differential between the source cities of population migration as well as the heterogeneity in the socioeconomic characteristics of the destination cities of population migration. It further incorporates a time-lag process based on the time distribution of the onset of the imported cases. In theory, the model will be able to predict the evolutional trend and spatial distribution of the COVID-19 risk for a certain time period in the future and provide support for advanced planning and targeted prevention measures. The research findings indicate the following: (1) The COVID-19 epidemic in Guangdong Province reached a turning point on January 29, 2020, after which it showed a gradual decreasing trend. (2) Based on the time-lag analysis of the onset of the imported cases, it is common for a time interval to exist between case importation and illness onset, and the proportion of the cases with an interval of 1–14 days is relatively high. (3) There is evident spatial heterogeneity in the epidemic risk; the risk varies significantly between different areas based on their imported risk, susceptibility risk, and ability to prevent the spread. (4) The degree of connectedness and the scale of population migration between Guangdong’s prefecture-level cities and their counterparts in the source regions of the epidemic, as well as the transportation and location factors of the cities in Guangdong, have a significant impact on the risk classification of the cities in Guangdong. The first-tier cities — Shenzhen and Guangzhou — are high-risk regions. The cities in the Pearl River Delta that are adjacent to Shenzhen and Guangzhou, including Dongguan, Foshan, Huizhou, Zhuhai, Zhongshan, are medium-risk cities. The eastern, northern, and western parts of Guangdong, which are outside of the metropolitan areas of the Pearl River Delta, are considered to have low risks. Therefore, the government should develop prevention and control measures that are specific to different regions based on their risk classification to enable targeted prevention and ensure the smooth operation of society."
"Monitoring thermal field, humidity field and energy balance over heterogeneous surfaces in the typical valley-city","Land use and land cover (LULC) alteration has changed original energy balance and heat fluxes between land and atmosphere, and thus affects the structure characteristics of temperature and humidity fields over urban heterogeneous surfaces in different spatio-temporal scales. Lanzhou is the most typical river valley city of China, it is chosen as the case study. Typical river valley terrain, rapid urbanization and severe air pollution have caused unique urban climate and urban heat island (UHI) effects in Lanzhou. Firstly, the spatial structure characteristics and dynamic evolution of temperature and humidity fields in autumn are simulated by mobile measurement experiment and GIS spatial analysis method. The results show that temperature and humidity fields have significant dynamic change within a day, and have multiple center and multiple intensity level characteristics. Then, LULC and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are extracted from remote sensing images, the distribution patterns of temperature and humidity fields have close relationships with LULC and NDVI. Moreover, there is a significant positive correlation between impervious surface area and thermal field intensity. A positive correlation between NDVI value and humidity field intensity has been found as well as a negative correlation between NDVI value and thermal field intensity. Finally, heat fluxes and energy balance characteristics between ground and atmosphere are analyzed based on the Bowen-ratio System experiments. This study could provide theoretical support and practical guidance for urban planning, urban eco-environment construction and air pollution prevention of river valley city."
Exploring temporal heterogeneity in an intercity travel network: A comparative study between weekdays and holidays in China,"A largely unexplored application of “Big Data” in urban contexts is using human mobility data to study temporal heterogeneity in intercity travel networks. Hence, this paper explores China’s intercity travel patterns and their dynamics, with a comparison between weekdays and holidays, to contribute to our understanding of these phenomena. Using passenger travel data inferred from Tencent Location Big Data during weekdays (April 11–15, 2016) and National Golden Week (October 1–7, 2016), we compare the spatial patterns of Chinese intercity travel on weekdays and during Golden Week. The results show that the average daily intercity travel during Golden Week is significantly higher than that during weekdays, but the travel distance and degree of network clustering are significantly lower. This indicates temporal heterogeneity in mapping the intercity travel network. On weekdays, the three major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou take prominent core positions, while cities that are tourism destinations or transportation hubs are more attractive during Golden Week. The reasons behind these findings can be explained by geographical proximity, administrative division (proximity of cultural and policy systems), travel distance, and travel purposes."
Simulating cross-sectional geometry of the main channel in response to changes in water and sediment in Lower Yellow River,"To understand the non-equilibrium morphological adjustment of a river in response to environmental changes, it is essential to (i) accurately identify how past conditions of water and sediment have impacted current morphological adjustment of the river, and (ii) establish a corresponding simulation for non-equilibrium conditions. Based on discharge and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) as well as 82 cross-sectional data items for the Huayuan-kou-Lijin reach of the Lower Yellow River in the period 1965–2015, the process of adjustment of the geometry of the main channel (area, width, depth, and geomorphic coefficient), and its responses to changes in discharge and SSC for different reaches are statistically analyzed. Following this, a delayed response model (DRM) of the geometry of the main channel subjected to variations in discharge and SSC is established using a multi-step analytical model, with the discharge and SSC as the main controlling factors. The results show that the area, width, and depth of the main channel decreased initially, then increased, decreased again, and finally increased again. These features of the geometry of the channel were positively correlated with the 4-year moving average discharge and negatively with the 4-year moving average SSC. The geomorphic coefficient for the Huayuankou-Sunkou reach exhibited a trend of decrease, whereas that of the Sunkou-Lijin reach decreased initially, then increased, decreased again, and finally increased again. Except for the Huayuankou-Gaocun reach in 1965–1999, the coefficient was negatively correlated with the 4-year moving average discharge and positively with SSC. The simulated values of the morphological parameters of the main channel for all sub-reaches obtained using the DRM agreed well with the measured values. This indicates that the DRM can be used to simulate the process of response of the cross-sectional geometry of the main channel to variations in the water and sediment. The results of the model show that the adjustment of the geometry of the main channel was affected by the discharge and the SSC at present (30%) as well as for the previous 7 years (70%). The proposed model offers insights into the mechanism whereby past water and sediment influence the current morphological adjustment of the river, and provides an effective method for predicting the magnitude and trend of the geometry of the main channel under different flow conditions."
Bose–Einstein Condensation Beyond the Gross–Pitaevskii Regime,"We consider N bosons in a box with volume one, interacting through a two-body potential with scattering length of the order \(N^{-1+\kappa }\), for \(\kappa >0\).

"Disentangling general achievement levels and subject-specific strengths and weaknesses in mathematics, reading, and science","The paper uses data from the combined TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) and PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) assessment in 2011 to explore the subject-specific strengths and weaknesses among fourth grade students worldwide. Previous research came to the conclusion that students only differed in overall achievement levels and did not exhibit subject-specific strengths and weaknesses. This research did, however, not control for differences in overall performance levels when searching for profile differences. Therefore, the present study uses factor mixture analysis to study qualitatively different performance profiles in mathematics, reading, and science while controlling for differences in performance levels. Our findings suggest that the majority of students do not show pronounced strengths and weaknesses and differ mainly in performance levels across mathematics, reading, and science. At the same time, a smaller share of students does indeed show pronounced subject-specific strengths and weaknesses. This result does not represent an artefact, but we find clear and theory-conforming associations between the identified profiles and covariates. We find evidence for cross-country differences in the frequency of subject-specific strengths and weaknesses and gender differences, as well as differences between students who do not or only sometimes speak the language of test at home."

Improved Dyeing of Meta-aramid Based on Particle Flow Dyeing Mechanism Using Hot-pressing Dyeing Method,"In this study, a combined dyeing method by integrating the advantages of both carrier dyeing and hot-pressing dyeing was utilized for the dyeing of meta-aramid. A rapid dyeing with increased mechanical properties of the fibers was achieved for the meta-aramid fiber. A so-called particle flow mechanism involving both N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and dye molecules was proposed to explain the accelerating effect of this unique dyeing method. The mechanical properties and thermodynamic stability of the fiber after hot-pressing were both increased. XRD results showed increased corresponding fiber crystallinity. TEM showed that the disperse dyes were well dispersed in DMAc. Cross-sectional optical photographs of dyed fibers revealed that the dyes were successfully carried into the interior of the fiber under the synergic effect of temperature and pressure. Combined with hot-pressing dyeing, the dyeing cycle for the meta-aramid could be greatly shortened and the amounts of dyes and carriers could be significantly reduced."

Bayesian stochastic multi-scale analysis via energy considerations,"Multi-scale processes governed on each scale by separate principles for evolution or equilibrium are coupled by matching the stored energy and dissipation in line with the Hill-Mandel principle. We are interested in cementitious materials, and consider here the macro- and meso-scale behaviour of such a material. The accurate representations of stored energy and dissipation are essential for the depiction of irreversible material behaviour, and here a Bayesian approach is used to match these quantities on different scales. This is a probabilistic upscaling and as such allows to capture, among other things, the loss of resolution due to scale coarsening, possible model errors, localisation effects, and the geometric and material randomness of the meso-scale constituents in the upscaling. On the coarser (macro) scale, optimal material parameters are estimated probabilistically for certain possible behaviours from the class of generalised standard material models by employing a nonlinear approximation of Bayes’s rule. To reduce the overall computational cost, a model reduction of the meso-scale simulation is achieved by combining unsupervised learning techniques based on a Bayesian copula variational inference with functional approximation forms."
Systematic Study of the Effect of Incorporation of Carbon Nanotubes into GexSe1-x Glass System,"We have successfully synthesized GexSe1-x (x = 0.225) glass samples and incorporated commercially produced (Protein Mods) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into the glass samples. We investigated the glass transition temperature (Tg) using modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC). CNTs, being a very hygroscopic material as well as oxygen absorbing material, needed to be cleaned under vacuum with the hot water-bath to get rid of contaminants. We used contaminant-free CNTs for our study. The same cleaning process was used to prepare GexSe1-x (x = 0.225) glass samples with and without CNTs. The base GexSe1-x (x = 0.225) glass sample has a Tg of 220°C. The Tg was found to be independent of starting materials (germanium and selenium) from different sources as well as hot water-bath temperature. The Tg was found to be lower when 5% CNT’s by mass was added to the base GexSe1-x (x = 0.225) glass sample. For 10% incorporation, the Tg was found to increase from that of 5% and it was found to decrease from that of 10% when 15% CNTs was added to the base glass sample. We also found that the Tg for GexSe1-x (x = 0.225) glass samples with the incorporation of 5% not-cleaned CNTs was 10oC higher, indicating the sensitivity of Tg on contaminants. Further, it was found that the variation of Tg with the incorporation of bulk carbon into the GexSe1-x (x = 0.225) glass samples was inconsistent compared to the contaminant-free CNTs incorporation."
The effect of density and surface topography on the coefficient of friction of polytetrafluoroethylene films,"Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film is observed to increase surface roughness during annealing. Longer annealing times leads to greater surface roughness. The coefficient of friction of PTFE film is affected by the shape of microscale sized particles on the film surface. In this study, we investigate the coefficient of friction of PTFE films using a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model based on experimental observations. We observe how the variation in PTFE chain length and film density affect the topography of PTFE films. We also investigate how these properties of PTFE, and the indenter radius affect the coefficient of friction observed during surface scratch. We find that short PTFE chain lengths create a dense film with greater particle spacing, but longer chains form a mesh structure which reduces the density and creates overlapping portions of particles in the film. We develop a convolutional neural network to classify PTFE film surface and predict the coefficient of friction of a modeled film based solely on the equilibrated film topography. The accuracy of the network was seen to increase when the density and images of internal fiber orientation were added as input features. These results indicate that the coefficient of friction of PTFE films in part is governed by the internal structure of the film."
Titanium nanoparticles phytosynthesized from Eichhornia crassipes leaf extract and their antimicrobial activity.,"In this study, we reported an environmentally friendly technique for the synthesis of titanium nanoparticles using Eichhornia crassipes leaf extract as a non-toxic reducing agent and efficient stabilizer.

On the other hand TiNPs were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, EDS (Dispersive Energy X-ray Spectroscopy), SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), and TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy). It was found that TiNPs exhibit high crystallinity whit rutile titania structure. TEM analysis shows the nanoparticle size in the range from 22 to 44 nm, antimicrobial study was performed by plate count technique witch showed >99% mortality for E. coli bacteria studied after 24 h of incubation."
Effect of Fe (II) concentration on metronidazole degradation by Fenton process: Performance and Kinetic study,"Metronidazole (MNZ) is an antibiotic drug to be carcinogenic and mutagenic. The present work was focused on MNZ degradation using the Fenton process, in batch studies. Five initial concentrations of MNZ (0.5, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg/L), three Fe (II) concentrations (2.94, 5.88 and 11.66 μM), 29.4 μM H2O2, and three pH (3.5, 5 and 7) were evaluated at a reaction time of 5 min. A statistical factorial design using the program Minitab 18® was used to study the MNZ degradation. The best experimental conditions to degrade MNZ at 100% was 2.94 μM Fe2+ and pH of 3.5. Three kinetic models were used to study the degradation profile of MNZ at 2.94 μM Fe2+ and 29.4 μM H2O2, such as the first-order, the second-order, and BMG kinetic model. The BMG kinetic model was the best model to describe the MNZ degradation by Fenton process. On other hand, the optimal pH for MNZ degradation was 3.5, independently of the molar ratio Fe2+/H2O2 evaluated. At pH 5, degradation efficiencies decreased significantly, while at pH 7 the lowest degradation of MNZ was observed. Finally, the Fenton process showed the potential to degrade metronidazole."
"Transmittance, Absorbance and Emission of Ga related Defects in Ga-doped ZnO Nanocrystal Films","ZnO films grown by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis with different Ga contents in the range of 1.0-6.5 at% on quartz substrates have been studied. The ZnO:Ga films were annealed at 400°C for 4h in a nitrogen flow. Morphology, emission, transmittance, absorbance and electrical resistivity were controlled. It is revealed that with a small content of Ga ≤ 4.0 at%, the ZnO:Ga films maintain a flat morphology, their transmittance increases to 86% together with the increase of the ZnO optical bandgap to 3.28 eV and the intensity enlargement of the near band edge (NBE) emission band A (3.188 eV). Furthermore, the new NBE emission band B (3.072 eV) appears in photoluminescence (PL) spectra at Ga contents ≥ 1.5 at%. Simultaneously, the process of decreasing electrical resistivity becomes saturating. The last effect is attributed to the self-compensation effect in n-type ZnO:Ga films related to the generation of acceptor type complexes (VZn2- - GaZn+). The thermal quenching of the PL intensities of the A and B PL bands is studded at 18-290K, which allows assigning the PL band A to the LO-phonon replica of the free exciton emission and the band B to the emission in donor-acceptor pairs: shallow donors - acceptor complexes (VZn2- - GaZn+). The NBE emission intensity drops and the ZnO optical bandgap demonstrates the shift to a lower energy at Ga doping up to ≤ 6.5 at%. Optimal Ga concentrations have been estimated to produce ZnO:Ga films with flat morphology, high optical transmittance and bright NBE emission."
Removal of triclosan by CTAB-modified zeolite-rich tuff from aqueous solutions,"Triclosan (TCS) adsorption behavior by a modified zeolite with Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) was evaluated factoring in pH, contact time, and TCS initial concentration in a batch system. Natural clinoptilolite-type zeolite from Sonora, Mexico was conditioned with a sodium chloride solution, and, subsequently, modified with CTAB. All the zeolites were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Electron Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), and the Zero Point Charge (pHZPC). It was found that the morphological and structural properties of natural zeolite were not affected after treatment with cationic surfactant. Furthermore, adsorption process efficiency was enhanced by the presence of CTAB, obtaining TCS maximum adsorption capacity at an optimal pH of 9.0. In this context, the positively charged surface of the modified zeolite and the anionic triclosan species present were decisive. Kinetics data were well adjusted to a pseudo-second order model with a TCS adsorption capacity of 1.430 ± 0.051 mg g−1 at an equilibrium time of 18 h. Isotherm results were best adjusted to the Langmuir model with a qmax = 2.027 mg g−1 using an initial Co concentration of 18.0 mg L−1, and reaching an equilibrium Ce concentration of 0.559 mg L−1. The mechanism for the adsorption of TCS by CTAB-modified zeolite was proposed to be electrostatic attractions between the group of partial positive charge of CTAB and the anionic species of triclosan. Consequently, CTAB-modified zeolites could be used as effective adsorbents for triclosan removal."
Self-aligned Copper Oxide Passivation Layer — A Study on the Reliability Effect,"The reliability of the plasma etched copper lines with the self-aligned copper oxide passivation layer has been studied with the electromigration stress method. The oxide passivation layer was prepared by plasma oxidation, which covers the entire exposed copper line to prevent the surface oxidation under the ambient condition. The void formation and growth process reflect the line broken mechanism. Voids formed from grain boundary depletion and grain thinning were monitored by optical microscopes. The line failure times with respect to line width and current density were measured. The addition of the oxide passivation layer shortened the lifetime due to the poor heat transfer and copper diffusion, which accelerated the formation and growth of the voids. The narrow line has a longer lifetime than the wide line because of the fewer grain boundaries for flux divergence to form voids. The copper oxide passivation layer was formed self-aligned to the copper line. It also gettered copper atoms diffused from the bulk copper film."
Influence of Rice Husk Ash on Characteristics of Earth Cement Blocks,"This paper presents an experimental study on the characteristics of earth cement blocks with Rice Husk Ash (RHA) as a partial replacement to cement. The replacement of RHA content is limited to 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% by mass of the total binder in the earth cement block. The experiments on earth cement blocks investigate the compressive strength and flexural tensile strength for mechanical properties and water absorption, sorption rate and erosion against water spray for its durability. Due to the high content of SiO2 in RHA with great reactivity, a significant increase in the compressive and flexural tensile strength of earth cement blocks was observed up to 10% RHA content. However, the durability of earth cement blocks becomes adverse with the increasing percentage of RHA replacement, but within the allowable limit. The experimental results indicate that to some extent, RHA based earth cement blocks have a significant potential for reduction in cement used in the construction industry."
Influence of Soil Grading on the Mechanical Behavior of Earth Cement Blocks,"The characteristics of earth cement blocks depend on soil composition, grading of the soil, cement-soil ratio and water content, etc… In the present study, an experimental program is conducted to evaluate the influence of soil grading in the mechanical properties of earth cement blocks. Five gradings of soil used for the preparation of earth cement blocks. Soil grading effect on following properties of earth-cement blocks such as block density, compressive strength in wet and dry condition, flexural tensile strength in wet and dry condition, and water absorption was compared. Results show that the properties of the earth cement blocks are dependent upon the fine content and uniformity coefficient of the soil. The increase in the finer content in mortar improves water absorption, compressive strength and flexural tensile strength."
