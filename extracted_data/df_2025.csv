"Evaluation of the Validity of Water Storage Tanks and the Impact of Water’s Physical, Chemical, and Biological Characteristics","Water storage tanks are widely used in all buildings (offices, hospitals, schools, etc.). To maintain good water quality, storage tanks must be periodically maintained and cleaned; otherwise, many problems can arise, rendering the water unsafe for use. This study evaluated the water quality at the University Of Technology (UOT) in Baghdad, Iraq, in 2023. Water samples were periodically taken from various sites within the university, including the main supply sources and tanks. The primary elements evaluated were bacterial growth (total coliform test, E. coli test, and total viable count [CFU/mL]), and various chemical and physical parameters (pH, EC, salinity, total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, total hardness, Ca+, Mg++, and heavy metals [Cd, Cu, Fe, and Pb]) were investigated using different devices to assess water quality and obtain a water quality index (WQI). Results showed some increased values of calcium concentrations (Ca+), electrical conductivity (EC), and TDS, especially at the end points of sampling. Bacterial growth was observed at the main supply point, whereas heavy metal values (Cu, Cd, and Pb) were not detected. Fe values were also within acceptable limits. Generally, the quality of the water used at the university can be classified as good."
Hydraulic Design Optimization and Performance Analysis of Piano Key Weirs: A Study of Geometric Factors and Staged Configurations,"A piano key weir is a modern modified type of labyrinth weir (a type of nonlinear weir). This type of weir increases the amount of discharge by increasing the crest length with inclined entrances and exits that reduce the amount of sediment. A piano key weir is the best option if the base length or width is specified. Owing to the novelty of the weir, the complexity of its dimensions, and the resulting flow, there is no specific design or criteria for its use, with a dearth of studies on it. The current study examined the impact of geometric factors, including (L/W, Ht/P) for constant (Wi/Wo = 1) and (Bo/B = 0.5), on the discharge coefficient for Type B under free-flow circumstances. The study also examined the capability of the stages in the side crest of the piano key weir (∆P⁄P and ∆L⁄L) and their effects on hydraulic capacity. The flow properties of several stages of piano key weir (Type B) designs were investigated on a laboratory scale, and relationships between head discharges were developed. The results showed that the use of holes (stages) in the sides of the inlet and outlet keys increased the discharge capacity and the discharge coefficient of a modified piano key weir in comparison to a standard piano key weir, by increasing the length and depth of the hole while controlling the amount of discharge coming out in the case of low depths."
The Evaluation of Mechanical Properties for Laminated Composite Materials with Different Fiber Orientation,"Multilayer laminated composites are often effective. The test procedure development and experimental setup focused on identifying damage mechanisms during the testing of laminated composite specimens. The manufacturing process of multilayer composite materials uses orthogonal fiberglass, random fiberglass, and carbon fibers. A central layer of woven unidirectional carbon fiber fabric (SikaWrap-300 C), along with two layers on top and bottom featuring different fiber orientations of random fibers and glass fiber, was used to create the recipes. The results show the absorbed energy, the impact strength, and the orientation of two layers of glass fiber with (0°/90°) s fiber orientation; these have the maximum absorbed energy (14.89 J) and impact strength (248.1 kJ/m2) due to the symmetrical arrangement of layers and uniform distribution of energy through layers. Conversely, the orientation of two layers of glass fiber with (0°/90°) 2 have minimum absorbed energy (1.63 J) and impact strength (50.3 kJ/m2) because of the unsymmetrical arrangement of layers. Flexural results with different layer orientations showed that the 90° orientation of the two layers of glass fiber proved to be the most efficient for offering resistance and stiffness to the multilayer composite material."
Upgrading Bio-Oil Properties from Date Stones by Co-Pyrolysis with Waste Tires Rubber in a Fixed-Bed Reactor,"This study examined the co-pyrolysis of an equivalent blend of date stones (DS) and waste tires (WT). Co-pyrolysis of the DSWT blend was performed in a batch reactor under an inert atmosphere. Operating conditions, including pyrolysis temperature (400–600 °C), pyrolysis period (30–150 min), feed particle size (20–60 mesh), and heating rate (10–30 °C/min), were optimized to ensure maximum liquid fuel yield. Under the typical conditions of pyrolysis (500 °C, 1 h, 20/°C heating rate, and 1.12 mm particle size), the highest yield of liquid fuel was 64.10%, while the yield of pyrolytic liquid from the separate pyrolysis of DS and WT under the same conditions was 49.20 and 51.55%, respectively. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), ultimate analysis, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) were employed to identify the liquid fuel. The GC–MS showed that aromatics (mono- and poly-aromatics, 32.11%) and D-limonene derivatives (30.97%) were the major components of the liquid fuel. Unsaturated hydrocarbons (13.25%), S-containing compounds (8.10%), oxygenated hydrocarbons (11.06%), and saturated hydrocarbons (3.20%) were also present in the fuel. The percentage of O-compounds in the liquid oil obtained from the co-pyrolysis was much less than that observed in the liquid oil obtained from DS pyrolysis, suggesting that the co-pyrolysis of DS and synthetic wastes like WT could be a potential method of upgrading the crude bio-oil produced from the pyrolysis of DS. The co-pyrolysis of DS and WT upgraded the properties of the fuel produced by decreasing its O-compound content."
Hydrothermal Liquefaction of Animal By-Products Using a Chromium-Loaded Hβ Zeolite Catalyst,"Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is an environmentally friendly technology for converting wet biomass into biocrude, and animal by-products (ABP) are an efficient source of biofuel for recycling and disposal. The hydrothermal liquefaction process directly utilizes ABP biomass in the wet state. Hydrothermal liquefaction experiments of ABP biomass were performed using a high-pressure batch reactor in the presence of a chromium-modified zeolite Hβ catalyst. In this study, the catalyst samples were characterized before and after regeneration, and it was noted that adding chromium increased the peak intensity of the Hβ zeolite and decreased its surface area and pore size. All samples contained a homogeneous spherical crystallinity and a very narrow particle size dispersion to produce the optimum biomass-to-liquid conversion rates, and it is commonly recommended to employ it during the HTL process to upgrade the biocrude. At 250 °C, a catalyst concentration of 10%, and a residence time of 45 min, a maximum biocrude yield of 68% was achieved. To determine the chemical components present in biocrude oil and aqueous phase products through gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC–MS), demonstrating that increasing temperature increases the yield of free fatty acids, cyclic compounds, and amides because of protein and triglyceride interactions. The composition of the resulting biocrude differed significantly at 250 °C, and due to lipid hydrolysis, there was a noticeable quantity of glycerol in the aqueous phase."
Elimination of Lead (II) Ions from Aqueous Solution by Clay-Biochar Composite Prepared from Kaolin and Date Seeds,"This paper reports the co-pyrolysis of kaolin clay (KC)/date seeds (DS) for developing a novel activated kaolin clay mineral-biochar (KC-BC) composite to be used in the adsorptive elimination (AE) of lead (II, Pb2+) from contaminated water. An optimal KC-BC was synthesized by the co-pyrolysis of a blend containing KC and DS in the ratio of 1:3 at 600 °C for 1 h and at the heating rate of 10 °C/min. This KC-BC was characterized through X-ray diffractometry, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive analysis X-ray, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis. The as-prepared KC-BC exhibited a BET surface area of 59.88 m2/g and a mean pore diameter of 11.42 nm, indicating its mesoporous structure. Superior AE % of 100 mg/L Pb2+ solution (95.10%) was obtained using 0.30 g of KC-BC at 35 °C for 210 min. The adsorption studies indicated that the Langmuir isotherm and the pseudo second-order kinetic model best described the adsorption of Pb2+ by the prepared KC-BC. Finally, the regeneration of the KC-BC for multiple cycles was explored as well."
Effect of Biodiesel Produced from Sunflower Oil on Engine Emissions Characteristics,"Biodiesel has an impact on exhaust gas emissions in compression ignition engines as it reduces exhaust emissions that pollute the environment and contribute to global warming. Additionally, biodiesel fuel is considered a renewable energy source, unlike fossil diesel, which pollutes the environment and is non-renewable. The current experimental study aims to examine biodiesel production from sunflower oil and its effect on the exhaust emissions of compression ignition engines. The esterification technique was used in the preparation, and the biodiesel yield percentage reached 92%. A biodiesel-to-diesel blend in the proportions of B0, B10, B20, B30, and B40 was utilized. The experiment used a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm and a variable torque range from 0 to 10 Nm. The results indicate the following changes compared to fossil diesel: a 0.067% decrease in HC emissions, a 0.022% decrease in CO emissions, a 1.40% increase in NOx emissions, and a 0.433% increase in CO2 emissions. Additionally, there was a 9.75 °C increase in EGT due to changes in the properties of biodiesel, such as density, high viscosity, and low calorific value compared to normal diesel properties."
The Impact of the Project (The University of Anbar is a Green Oasis) on Improving Vegetation Cover,"This study’s purpose was to observe and monitor the vegetation cover and drought situation at the site (The University of Anbar) and evaluate the project’s (The University of Anbar is a Green Oasis) impact as well as the efficiency of remote sensing and satellite image technologies in monitoring this phenomenon. To monitor and evaluate the changes in the vegetation cover in the study area both before the project began in 2021 and after its operations commenced, the indices and indicators of NDVI, EVI, SAVI, NDMI, and moisture stress were utilized. The five indices illustrated the project’s favorable impact on the location. The study demonstrates that despite the varying normality of moisture indicators, the vegetation indices show greater normalcy, highlighting the region’s sustained improvement in plant cover over time."
Impact of Benzyl Adenine (BA) Spraying and Nitrogen Fertilizer Addition on the Growth and Active Substance Content of Avena sativa L.,"The field experiment was conducted at the second agricultural research station, which is affiliated with the College of Agriculture at Al-Muthanna University. This study took place during the winter agricultural season of 2022–2023. The experiment involved investigating the impact of two variables. The first factor under consideration was nitrogen, which was applied at four different levels (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg N ha−1). The nitrogen was added in three separate application stages: after emergence, during the elongation stage, and at the booting stage. The second factor examined in this study was benzyl adenine, which was applied to the plant at four different concentrations (0, 100, 150, and 200 mg L−1). The application of benzyl adenine was carried out in two separate batches. The first batch was applied during the elongation stage, and the second batch was applied at the booting stage. The experiment was conducted using a split-plot design with three replications following an RCBD. The main plots were assigned to different nitrogen fertilization levels, while the subplots were assigned to various benzyl adenine spraying treatments. The findings showed notable disparities in the effects of nitrogen addition, particularly in the treatment with a nitrogen application rate of 120 kg N h−1, affecting plant height, leaf area, and flavonoid content. The study's findings also revealed significant variations in the effects of benzyl adenine spraying. The treatment of 200 mg L−1 demonstrated the highest mean values for plant height, leaf area, carbohydrate content, and nitrogen content."
Design and Evaluation of the Hybrid Solar Cooker Performance in Baghdad City,"The cooking process is considered one of the most important daily activities that consume a lot of energy and may be accompanied by harmful emissions. Solar cooking is an energy-saving cooking process utilizing the abundance of solar energy that can be used. In this research, solar cooking technology was implemented using a hybrid technology that combined two processes converting solar energy into heat; a solar evacuated tube and a solar box were both utilized to increase the temperature of the solar box. The findings show the tube contributing to raising the box’s temperature by about 15% as used in November, lasting from 9:00 AM until 3:00 PM, when the ambient temperatures averaged 20 °C. This study showed positive results regarding the cooking of several types of food in the city of Baghdad (44.361–33.312)."
The Influence of Mono-Rhamnolipid Produced by Pseudomonas Guguanensis on Seed Germination and Growth in the Presence of Crude Oil,"With growing environmental concern, interest in the research and development of environmentally friendly substances has only increased. Microbial surfactants are nontoxic and biodegradable bioproducts that provide sustainable solutions in agricultural applications due to their many benefits over synthetic counterparts. Their utilization necessitates substantial research into their impact on plant development. The present study aimed to assess the effect of mono-rhamnolipid produced by Pseudomonas guguanensis strain Iraqi ZG. K. M on seed germination of red cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under in-vitro conditions, and then evaluate its effect on seed germination and growth of both plant species in the presence of a lethal concentration (3%) of crude oil. Different concentrations of mono-rhamnolipid ranging from 0.25 to 1.00 g/l were evaluated, with distilled water acting as a control. The study found that applying 0.25 g/l of mono-rhamnolipid to seeds before germination could significantly stimulate, accelerate, and improve their germination and growth, with similar effects when in the presence of 3% crude oil. Thus, this biological molecule demonstrated a promising result in bioremediating crude oil, thereby promoting seed germination and plant growth."
Investigation Study of Impact-Absorbed Energy and Flexural Strength of Multi-layer Composite Materials,"To investigate and measure the energy absorption processes in prospective automobile applications of composite materials, test procedures for progressive crush testing on composite plate specimens were developed. Some liquid hardening materials for the recipe include Sikadur-52 LP epoxy. Three types of fabrics were used with different arrangements of layers: Kevlar with three layers of epoxy, carbon fiber with three layers of epoxy, and fiberglass with random glass in three layers with epoxy. Multi-layer composites offer several benefits over conventional laminated materials, including good resistance attributes and economical processing. Kevlar and carbon fibers can absorb more energy, thereby permitting a body to penetrate the object. A three-layer arrangement of carbon fiber, Kevlar, and fiberglass absorbs more energy in impact tests and exhibits high flexural strength. Arrange 5 represents the layer’s arrangement (GF/KF/CF), which absorbs more energy than other samples due to high impact strength (208.10 kJ/m2). Conversely, arrange 4 (CF, KF, GF) absorbs the least energy (75.35 kJ/m2). Additionally, the former exhibits high flexural strength (0.9 kN), while the latter has the lowest (0.42 kN). The current arrangements may be considered the best, especially when exposed to various loads in engineering applications."
Ecology and Biodiversity of Epiphytic Algae (Non-diatoms) on Typha Domingensis Pers. In the Upper Euphrates River Between Haditha Dam and Al Baghdadi in Western Iraq,"This research aimed to determine the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of epiphytic non-diatom cells attached to the Typha domingensis plant and their connection to the water quality of the upper Euphrates river. The physical and chemical characteristics of the river water were examined. The water was found to be warm, slightly alkaline, firm, moderately turbid, and well ventilated, and the concentration of calcium was higher than the concentration of magnesium. The concentrations of chloride, sodium, potassium, nitrate, and phosphate did not exceed local and international permitted limits. A total of 112 epiphytic non-diatom species were found on the Typha domingensis plant, with Chlorophyceae (72 species, 65%) dominating the Cyanophyceae (36 species, 32%) and 3 species (3%) being isolated. The study showed a discrepancy in the quality and density of algae cells between the sites studied, with the highest total number of 1091 cells per 103/gm at site 1 (Haditha Dam) and the lowest total number of 600 cells per 103/gm at the rest of the sites. A range of biodiversity indices were applied, including the Shannon Diversity Index, richness index, evenness index, and the Jaccard index. These described the waters of the upper Euphrates river as having less to medium biodiversity and being moderately polluted with homogenization in the distribution of non-diatoms species adhesive to the Typha domingensis plant. According to the results, the nature and geography of the study sites affected the quality of the river water and the density of the epiphytic non-diatoms attached to the host plant."
"Determining Radon Gas Concentrations in Tobacco Varieties Sold in the Regional Market, Iraq","This study attempted to determine radon gas concentrations in several tobacco varieties. Twenty-three different brands of cigarette tobacco were gathered from various businesses located in local marketplaces using the nuclear track detector LR-115 type II procedures. An LR-115 type II sensor was etched with NaOH solution at 60 °C for 1 h at the end of the exposure duration. The tracks of alpha particles were counted using a light microscope with magnification. Concentrations of radon ranged from 0.913 to 514.637 Bq/m3, with a mean value of 184.929 Bq/m3. The maximum value was found in the sample from UAE (T21), while the minimum value was found in that from Egypt (T16). The findings of this study indicate that high concentrations of radon gas in cigarettes pose a substantial risk to human health, including the risk of lung cancer, and, as a consequence, may increase the number of fatalities caused by high radon doses. In all tobacco cigarette brands, a high relationship was observed between radon concentrations and lung cancer per million people annually."
"Modeling and Analysis of Land Surface Temperature Variations in Basrah Governorate, Iraq, Using Remote Sensing Data and Geomatics Techniques","This study was conducted within the administrative boundaries of Basrah Governorate, Iraq, covering a total area of approximately 354.450 km2 from the southern borders of Al-Haritha District to the northern borders of Al-Qurnah District along the Shatt al-Arab River and its surrounding areas. The field data on daily temperature values were collected from the Al-Qurnah meteorological station. Surface temperature values in the study area were calculated and modeled by deriving thermal energy values from the 10th spectral band (Band 10) of Landsat-8 satellite imagery using the thermal energy balance algorithm. The study’s results showed a strong correlation between the temperature values obtained from the meteorological station and the values calculated from remote sensing data using the thermal energy balance algorithm, with the correlation coefficients ranging from 0.950 to 0.982. Furthermore, there was a noticeable temporal variation in surface temperature values in the months of January and July for the years 2018–2022. Generally, the highest temperature values were recorded in July, while the lowest values were recorded in January for all the study years. The results also demonstrated a clear spatial variation in temperature values according to the location of each category. The values generally decreased in areas close to the Shatt al-Arab River and in regions with higher soil moisture content and good vegetation cover. In contrast, they increased in arid and urban areas."
"Levels of Heavy Metals in Wastewater Inlets in the Cites of Heet, Rammadi, and Fallujah in Iraq","The research aimed to assess the concentration of Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn in wastewater in three cities in the Anbar governorate (Heet, Ramadi, and Fallujah) in Iraq. The water samples were collected from four wastewater inlets in these cities in June 2023, and the concentration of Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn in them were measured using the atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The obtained results showed that measured metal concentration means take the following descending order: Cr > Co > Pb > Ni > Cd > . This means that the concentration of all the heavy metals (except Zn) in the wastewater in the study area exceeds Iraqi and United States Environmental Protection Agency standards. A correlation matrix analysis showed a significant positive correlation between Pb and Zn (p < 0.05). This correlation is interpreted in the context of a common source or origin. The study found that the concentration of Cd, Co, Cr, and Ni decreased in the wastewater at the inlet in Fallujah. The concentration of Pb and Zn. The spatial distribution showed a similar pattern for the concentration of Pb and Zn, and this may reflect the same sources that release them. This study recommends that, for environmental sustainability, plants be established for treating wastewater before its release into the Euphrates River."
Evaluation of Heavy Metal Pollution in Sariyah River by Using (HPI) and (MI) Indices,"The current study aimed to assess the water quality of Sariyah River and its contamination with some metals, and assess the possibility of using it for drinking purpose. This study was conducted by using two indices to evaluate the quality of water pollution with a number of heavy metals, which including: Metal Index (MI) and Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI). Five sampling sites were selected during the winter and the summer seasons along the Sariyah River, from the beginning of the pumping station (Jalali) to the end of the river in Buhriz District. Five heavy metals were analysed by using Atomic Absorption Spectrometer, the metals including: cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and boron (B). The results shown that the average values of (HPI) index were (559.80) and (770.36) for the winter and summer seasons, respectively. This indicates that water of Sariyah River is seriously polluted by the examined heavy metals and cannot be used for domestic purpose without treatment. The mean values of the (MI) index were (22.58) and (27.27) for the winter and summer seasons, respectively; and were classified under the seriously affected category (>6) which also indicates that this water cannot be used for drinking purposes. This paper also revealed the effects of human-made sources on the water quality of the studied river."
Theoretical Foundations and Country Experience for Mixed Land Use,"Mixed-use has become a prominent land-use concept in modern urban planning and design due to the urban planning practices that emerged after World War II. These practices involved segregating different land uses, resulting in many urban challenges, including but not limited to urban sprawl, inefficient land utilization, traffic congestion, and environmental pollution. This study aims to elucidate the notion of mixed land use, tracing its historical origins and fundamental theoretical underpinnings. Additionally, it examines notable international instances where the principles of mixed land use have been implemented and evaluates their influence on cities’ urban development. The primary issue encountered in this research pertains to the need to analyze the concept of mixed-use and its significance in advancing metropolitan regions. The research posits that mixed-use areas are influential in cities’ fostering urban, economic, and social development inside the city. Consequently, this study aims to develop a theoretical framework based on mixed-use and its importance. The research is categorized into two axes to achieve its objective, where the second axis focuses on the critical cities that implemented the mixed-use principle and examined the efficacy of the approach in urban development. The study focuses on mixed use of land to achieve sustainability in cities. The concept of mixed-use was clarified as the principle that includes the different uses in one area, as the history of the emergence of this concept explained its importance to the city, residents, and investors, as well as in achieving the principles of sustainability."
Reporting the Progression of Laminar Single-Phase Flow in a Double-Pipe Heat Exchanger via a Horizontal Tube,"Overcoming challenges in the context of smooth surfaces when employing forced convection with horizontally oriented circular tubes is complex, and this is because very low heat fluxes are required to counteract buoyancy effects and prevent an increase in. Past research mainly focused on the heat transfer coefficient in laminar regions of convection and paid minimal attention to forced convection in these systems. This research aimed to investigate the attributes of heat transfer coefficients in certain forced convection circumstances. Smooth, circular test sections with a diameter of 0.01 m and a length of two meters, featuring both inlet and outlet flows, were employed for this purpose. R-113 was used as the working fluid, with an inlet temperature of 22 °C. The investigation yielded various findings, including Nusselt numbers ranging from 5.50 to 7.11, Reynolds numbers ranging from 948.42 to 2263.38, and heat inputs ranging from 25 to 150 W. The extent of the laminar flow zone, determined by analyzing the development of the laminar region, was assessed for all heat experiments."
Evaluation of the Diffusion Results of the Azolla Fodder Crop in Nineveh Governorate,"This research aimed to assess the evaluation of the diffusion results of the Azolla fodder crop in Nineveh Governate as well as the arrangement of the fields concerned with such evaluation: diffusion range capacity, agricultural land area (possession), economic return, sustainability, productivity (yield), cultivated fodder crops, and farmers’ satisfaction. It also aimed to identify the order degree of the evaluation's field items and the differences in the evaluation based on certain variables: level of education, importance of agricultural activity, type of workers on the farm, years practicing the agricultural work, and source of irrigation water. To achieve these aims, a validated area questionnaire was prepared and many books, publications and interviews with specialists were read. The research community consisted of 100% (70) of the Azolla farmers in Nineveh Governorate. The most significant results in the diffusion of the Azolla fodder crop to Azolla farmers were medium to large. The most significant conclusions were that all the research variables play a strong role in the assessment of the diffusion of the Azolla fodder crop to Azolla farmers in the Nineveh Governate."
