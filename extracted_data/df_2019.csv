Extreme vocabulary learning,"Regarding extreme value theory, the unseen novel classes in the open-set recognition can be seen as the extreme values of training classes. Following this idea, we introduce the margin and coverage distribution to model the training classes. A novel visual-semantic embedding framework — extreme vocabulary learning (EVoL) is proposed; the EVoL embeds the visual features into semantic space in a probabilistic way. Notably, we adopt the vast open vocabulary in the semantic space to help further constraint the margin and coverage of training classes. The learned embedding can directly be used to solve supervised learning, zero-shot learning, and open set recognition simultaneously. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework against conventional ways."
Promoting an Internal Market-Oriented Culture (IMOC) in Healthcare Services,"It is essential for healthcare service organizations to develop and promote an organizational culture that focuses on their frontline employees. The aim of this study is to explore one such frontline-focused organizational culture concept, which is labeled as internal market-oriented culture (IMOC). The study examines both potential factors that promotes IMOC as well as potential outcomes of IMOC. The concept of IMOC was tested in a quantitative study were frontline employees in public hospitals participated. The findings reveal that both management focus on employees and interdepartmental cooperation promotes an organization’s IMOC. IMOC was found to have a direct effect on frontline employees’ overall job satisfaction and turnover intentions. In addition, the relationship between IMOC and employees’ turnover intentions was found to be mediated by employees’ job satisfaction. No previous research has focused on how to promote IMOC in healthcare services, which makes this study a unique contribution to service research."
Co-creation of Service Recovery and Post-Recovery Responses: The Impact of Cultural Values Orientations and Outcome Favorability,"It is now well established from a variety of studies, that service recovery is essential for service providers to retrieve the customer’s satisfaction after the service failure. Recent evidence suggests that the co-creation of service recovery has a positive outcome for both service providers and customers. However, very little is currently known about the impact of customers’ cultural orientations in implementing co-creation of service recovery. In the present research, using an experimental design, first we examined the impact of co-creation on the perception of outcome favorability for the customers with high/low cultural values orientations and second, we measure the influence of perception of outcome favorability on the customer’s post-recovery responses. The result revealed that the co-creation of recovery attributes is indeed associated with a higher perception of outcome favorability for customers with higher cultural values. The result also indicated that the customer’s perception of outcome favorability is positively associated with satisfaction and repurchase intention."
Is the subtropical jet shifting poleward?,"The tropics are expanding poleward at about \(0.5{^\circ }\) per decade in observations. This poleward expansion of the circulation is consistently reported using Hadley cell edge metrics and lower-atmospheric tropical edge metrics. However, some upper-atmospheric tropical metrics report smaller trends that are often not significant. One such upper-atmospheric metric is the subtropical jet latitude, which has smaller trends compared to the Hadley cell edge. In this study we investigate the robustness of the weak trends in the subtropical jet position by introducing a new method for locating the subtropical jet, and examining the trends and variability of the subtropical jet latitude. We introduce the tropopause gradient method based on the peak gradient in potential temperature along the dynamic tropopause. Using this method we find the trends in the subtropical jet latitude are indeed much smaller than \(0.5{^\circ }\) per decade, consistent with previous studies. We also find that natural variability within the subtropical jet latitude would not prevent trends from being detected if they were similar to the Hadley cell edge, as trends greater than 0.24\({^\circ }\) per decade could reliably be detected using monthly data or 0.09\({^\circ }\) per decade using daily data. Despite the poleward expansion of the tropics, there is no robust evidence to suggest the subtropical jet is shifting poleward in either hemisphere. Neither the current diagnostic methods nor natural variability can account for the small subtropical jet trends. The most likely explanation, which requires further investigation, is that the subtropical jet position is not tied dynamically to the Hadley cell edge."
High-order algorithms for riesz derivative and their applications (IV),"The main goal of this article is to establish a new 4th-order numerical differential formula to approximate Riesz derivatives which is obtained by means of a newly established generating function. Then the derived formula is used to solve the Riesz space fractional advection-dispersion equation. Meanwhile, by the energy method, it is proved that the difference scheme is unconditionally stable and convergent with order 𝓞(τ2 + h4). Finally, several numerical examples are given to show that the numerical convergence orders of the numerical differential formulas and the finite difference scheme are in line with the theoretical analysis."
Robust stability analysis of LTI systems with fractional degree generalized frequency variables,"A novel linear time-invariant (LTI) system model with fractional degree generalized frequency variables (FDGFVs) is proposed in this paper. This model can provide a unified form for many complex systems, including fractional-order systems, distributed-order systems, multi-agent systems and so on. This study mainly investigates the stability and robust stability problems of LTI systems with FDGFVs. By characterizing the relationship between generalized frequency variable and system matrix, a necessary and sufficient stability condition is firstly presented for such systems. Then for LTI systems with uncertain FDGFVs, we present a robust stability method in virtue of zero exclusion principle. Finally, the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper is demonstrated by analyzing the robust stability of gene regulatory networks."

Mass-conserving tempered fractional diffusion in a bounded interval,"Transient anomalous diffusion may be modeled by a tempered fractional diffusion equation. A reflecting boundary condition enforces mass conservation on a bounded interval. In this work, explicit and implicit Euler schemes for tempered fractional diffusion with discrete reflecting or absorbing boundary conditions are constructed. Discrete reflecting boundaries are formulated such that the Euler schemes conserve mass. Conditional stability of the explicit Euler methods and unconditional stability of the implicit Euler methods are established. Analytical steady-state solutions involving the Mittag-Leffler function are derived and shown to be consistent with late-time numerical solutions. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and usefulness of the proposed numerical schemes."
"Clinical risk prediction with random forests for survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (RF-SLAM) data analysis","Clinical research and medical practice can be advanced through the prediction of an individual’s health state, trajectory, and responses to treatments. However, the majority of current clinical risk prediction models are based on regression approaches or machine learning algorithms that are static, rather than dynamic. To benefit from the increasing emergence of large, heterogeneous data sets, such as electronic health records (EHRs), novel tools to support improved clinical decision making through methods for individual-level risk prediction that can handle multiple variables, their interactions, and time-varying values are necessary."
Liver fibrosis and accelerated immune dysfunction (immunosenescence) among HIV-infected Russians with heavy alcohol consumption - an observational cross-sectional study,"The multifactorial mechanisms driving negative health outcomes among risky drinkers with HIV may include immunosenescence. Immunosenescence, aging of the immune system, may be accentuated in HIV and leads to poor outcomes. The liver regulates innate immunity and adaptive immune tolerance. HIV-infected people have high prevalence of liver-related comorbidities. We hypothesize that advanced liver fibrosis/cirrhosis is associated with alterations in T-cell subsets consistent with immunosenescence."
Validation of serrated polyps (SPs) in Swedish pathology registers,"Little is known about the natural history of serrated polyps (SPs), partly due to the lack of large-scale epidemiologic data.

The aim of this study was to estimate the ED95 for oxytocin infusion after a bolus at elective caesarean delivery (CD) in nonlaboring parturients."
The experiences of early postpartum Shenzhen mothers and their need for home visit services: a qualitative exploratory study,"The early postpartum period is the most stressful period for a new mother, who is assuming new roles and responsibilities in life, and must deal with the demands from her newborn baby and her own care needs. Little is known about whether the current postnatal care services provided by hospitals and community centers meet the needs of women. The aim of this study was to identify the experiences of women in Shenzhen and the problems that they encountered during the first 6 weeks after giving birth; and to explore their expressed needs with regard to postnatal care services."
"Effect of pregnancy induced hypertension on adverse perinatal outcomes in Tigray regional state, Ethiopia: a prospective cohort study","The prevalence of pregnancy-induced hypertension in Ethiopia ranges from 2.2 to 18.3%.

Removal of large middle molecules via haemodialysis with medium cut-off membranes at lower blood flow rates: an observational prospective study,"Online haemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) may improve middle molecular clearance in contrast to conventional haemodialysis (HD). However, OL-HDF requires higher convective flows and cannot sufficiently remove large middle molecules. This study evaluated the efficacy of a medium cut-off (MCO) dialyser in removing large middle molecular uraemic toxins and compared it with that of conventional high-flux (HF) dialysers in HD and predilution OL-HDF."

The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of pre-contrast T1 and cartilage thickness when assessing knee joint cartilage quality with dGEMRIC.
Students with specific learning disabilities experiences of pre-registration physiotherapy education: a qualitative study,"Attainment gaps for students with disabilities have been noted in pre-registration physiotherapy courses in the UK. Previous research suggests disclosure, lack of staff knowledge and poor communication between University and placement sites may be relevant, but these are limited to small case studies with students with visual or physical disabilities. The purpose of this study was to explore disabled physiotherapy students’ experiences of their education in order to elucidate factors that may influence success."
Gorham-Stout disease of the malleolus: a rare case report,"Gorham-Stout disease, also known as vanishing bone disease, idiopathic massive osteolysis, is a rare entity of unknown etiopathology. This disease is characterized by destruction of osseous matrix and proliferation of lymphatic vascular structures and associated with massive regional osteolysis. It has a variable clinical presentation and is commonly considered as a benign disease with a progressive tendency and an unpredictable prognosis. The diagnosis is made by exclusion and based on combination with histological, radiological, and clinical features. Despite that several therapeutic options have shown certain efficacy, the effective treatment still remains controversial and there is no standard treatment to be recommended."
Dental anomalies and orthodontic characteristics in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism,"Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is a rare and inherited disease caused by mutations in the GNAS-gene or upstream of the GNAS complex locus.

Tumor burden and location as prognostic factors in patients treated by iodine seed implant brachytherapy for localized prostate cancers,"Iodine seed implant brachytherapy is indicated for low risk and selected favorable intermediate risk prostate cancers. A percentage of positive biopsies > 50% is usually considered as a contra-indication, and the tumor location could also influence the treatment efficacy. We studied the association of the percentage of positive biopsy cores, and tumor location, with progression-free survival."
Recommendations for application of the functional evidence PS3/BS3 criterion using the ACMG/AMP sequence variant interpretation framework,"The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) clinical variant interpretation guidelines established criteria for different types of evidence. This includes the strong evidence codes PS3 and BS3 for “well-established” functional assays demonstrating a variant has abnormal or normal gene/protein function, respectively. However, they did not provide detailed guidance on how functional evidence should be evaluated, and differences in the application of the PS3/BS3 codes are a contributor to variant interpretation discordance between laboratories. This recommendation seeks to provide a more structured approach to the assessment of functional assays for variant interpretation and guidance on the use of various levels of strength based on assay validation."
Digital twins to personalize medicine,"Personalized medicine requires the integration and processing of vast amounts of data. Here, we propose a solution to this challenge that is based on constructing Digital Twins. These are high-resolution models of individual patients that are computationally treated with thousands of drugs to find the drug that is optimal for the patient."
Mercury increase in Lake Champlain fish: links to fishery dynamics and extreme climatic events,"Mercury concentrations in Lake Champlain fish increased (2011–2017) for the first time in more than two decades. The increase, however, was not consistent among species or throughout the lake. Mercury concentrations in smallmouth bass and yellow perch from the three Main Lake segments increased significantly while concentrations in the eastern portions of the lake (Northeast Arm and Malletts Bay) remained unchanged or decreased; mercury concentrations in white perch remained unchanged. Factors examined to explain the increase included: atmospheric deposition, lake temperature, chlorophyll-a, fishery dynamics, lake flooding and loading of total suspended solids (TSS). This paper examines how each factor has changed between study periods and the spatial variability associated with the change. We hypothesize fishery dynamics, flooding and TSS loading may be partially responsible for the increase in fish mercury. Both growth efficiency and biomass of fish suggest mercury concentrations would increase in the Main Lake segments and decrease in the eastern portion of the lake. Additionally, two extreme climate events in 2011 resulted in extensive flooding and a four-fold increase in annual TSS loading, both potentially increasing biotic mercury with the impact varying spatially throughout the lake. Changes to the fishery and disturbance caused by extreme climatic events have increased biotic mercury and the processes responsible need further study to identify possible future scenarios in order to better protect human and wildlife health."
Cardiovascular autonomic testing in the work-up of cerebellar ataxia: insight from an observational single center study,"Cerebellar ataxias are a heterogeneous group of disorders of both genetic and non-genetic origin. In sporadic cases, two entities are recognized: multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type (MSA-C) and SAOA (sporadic adult-onset ataxia). The presence of severe cardiovascular autonomic failure reliably distinguishes MSA-C from other ataxias, but it may appear only late in the disease course."
Global Asymptotic Synchronization of a Class of BAM Neural Networks with Time Delays via Integrating Inequality Techniques,"In this paper, the authors are concerned with global asymptotic synchronization for a class of BAM neural networks with time delays. Instead of using Lyapunov functional method, LMI method and matrix measure method which are recently widely applied to investigating global exponential/ asymptotic synchronization for neural networks, two novel sufficient conditions on global asymptotic synchronization of above BAM neural networks are established by using a kind of new study method of global synchronization: Integrating inequality techniques. The method and results extend the study of global synchronization of neural networks."
Formation Tracking for Nonlinear Multi-agent Systems with Input and Output Quantization via Adaptive Output Feedback Control,"Signal quantization can reduce communication burden in multi-agent systems, whereas it brings control challenge to multi-agent formation tracking. This paper studies the output feedback control problem for formation tracking of multi-agent systems with both quantized input and output. The agents are described by a nonlinear dynamic model with unknown parameters and immeasurable states. To estimate immeasurable states and solve the uncertainties, state observers are developed by using dynamic high-gain tools. Through proper parameter designs, an output feedback quantized controller is established based on quantized output signals, and the quantization effect on the control system is eliminated. Stability analysis proves that, with the proposed control scheme, multi-agent systems can track the reference trajectory while forming and maintaining the desired formation shape. In addition, all the signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded. Finally, the numerical simulation and practical experiment are provided to verify the theoretical analysis."

It aims to have a better understanding about the (non-) rational decision logic of the CEOs and founders shaping the internationalization processes of 45 Paraguayan software firms. This study uses an observational, comparative descriptive, and a descriptive, correlational-research design based on a survey with the CEOs and founders of 45 Paraguayan software firms. The results suggest a significant correlational impact of decision-makers’ characteristics on the software firm’s internationalization and calls for further collaboration with high-tech firms from different industries in emerging as well as developed markets."
Hedging ship price risk using freight derivatives in the drybulk market,"We show that a fixed-maturity time-weighted Forward Freight Agreement (FFA) portfolio should be used to proxy the expected future earnings of a vessel. We investigate the corresponding hedging efficiency when using a portfolio of FFA prices to hedge ship price risk of both static hedge ratios calculated using Ordinary Least Squares estimation and the dynamic hedge ratios generated from a dynamic conditional correlation GARCH (1,1) model. We find that the hedging efficiency is greater for newer vessels than older vessels and that the static hedge ratio outperforms the dynamic hedge ratio. Our work is an extension of earlier empirical work which has only considered the hedging efficiency of varying-maturity calendar FFA contracts for a single vessel age."
"Purification and characterization of fat body lipase from the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)","Insect lipid mobilization and transport are currently under research, especially lipases and lipophorin because of their roles in the production of energy and lipid transport at a flying activity.

Infrared stripe correction algorithm based on wavelet decomposition and total variation-guided filtering,"Stripe non-uniformity severely affects the quality of infrared images. It is challenging to remove stripe noise in low-texture images without blurring the details. We propose a single-frame image stripe correction algorithm that removes infrared noise while preserving image details. Firstly, wavelet transform is used for multi-scale analysis of the image. At the same time, Total variation model is used for small window to smooth the original image. The small-scale total variation model can well preserve the edge information of the image, but it will leave stripe noise. Therefore, according to the prior knowledge of the vertical component of the stripe noise, the spatial filtering is finally performed: the smoothed image is used as the guide image for the stripe noise denoising. It is possible to prevent the lead filter from mistaking the strong stripe noise as edge detail, resulting in corrected image residual streak noise. The algorithm is systematically evaluated by experiments on simulated images and original infrared images, as well as compared with the current advanced infrared stripe non-uniformity correction algorithms. It is proved that our algorithm can better eliminate stripe noise and preserve edge details."

Physiological and biochemical responses of soybean (Glycine max L.) to cysteine application under sea salt stress,"Shortage of water is a major problem facing Egypt; thus, it becomes necessary to use non-traditional sources of water such as saline water in irrigation. Overcoming the adverse effects of saline water and enhancing plant tolerance to salinity stress is the main challenge for increasing plant growth and productivity. Using a natural compound such as cysteine amino acid has an important effect in alleviating the adverse effect of salinity stress on different plant crops."
Antibacterial effect of metallic nanoparticles on Streptococcus mutans bacterial strain with or without diode laser (970 nm),"The main etiological agent for dental caries is Streptococcus mutans bacterial strain. Recently, metallic nanoparticles and diode laser have been introduced as a new method in bacterial decontamination. Nanoparticles have very small particles size that has greater surface area and exert their antimicrobial effect by interacting with the negatively charged bacterial cell wall, while lasers have become increasingly popular in dentistry due to their multiple uses, and one such important application is tooth disinfection."
Toxicological implications of the fruit of Harungana madagascariensis on wistar rats,"The unopened buds of the fruit of Harungana madagascariensis is used in the treatment of anaemia and skin diseases in traditional medicine. Hence, this study aims to scientifically evaluate the effects of oral administration of the fruit extract of Harungana madagascariensis on haematological, biochemical and histological parameters in Wistar rats."
Synthesis of mono- and dimethoxylated polychlorinated biphenyl derivatives starting from fluoroarene derivatives,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are environmental pollutants implicated in a variety of adverse health effects, including cancer and noncancer diseases in animals and humans. PCBs are metabolized to hydroxylated compounds, and some of these PCB metabolites are more toxic than the parent PCBs. Unfortunately, most PCB metabolites needed for toxicological studies are not available from commercial sources. Moreover, it is challenging to synthesize PCB metabolites because starting materials with suitable substitution patterns are not readily available. Here, we report the novel synthesis of a variety of mono- and dimethoxyarene derivatives from commercially available fluoroarenes via nucleophilic aromatic substitution with sodium methoxide. This reaction provided good to excellent yields of the desired methoxylated products. Suzuki coupling of selected mono- and dimethoxy haloarenes with chlorinated phenylboronic acids yielded methoxylated derivatives of PCB 11, 12, 25, 35, and 36 in low to good yields. Crystal structures of 3,3′-dichloro-2,5-dimethoxy-1,1′-biphenyl and 3′,5-dichloro-2,3-dimethoxy-1,1′-biphenyl confirmed the substitution pattern of both compounds. This synthesis strategy provides straightforward access to a range of mono- and dimethoxylated PCB derivatives that were not readily accessible previously."
New Homogeneous Dataset of Solar EUV Synoptic Maps from SOHO/EIT and SDO/AIA,"Synoptic maps of solar EUV intensities have been constructed for many decades in order to display the distribution of the different EUV emissions across the solar surface, with each map representing one Carrington rotation (i.e. one rotation of the Sun). This article presents a new solar EUV synoptic map dataset based on full-disk images from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SOHO/EIT) and Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA). In order to remove the significant and complicated drift of EIT and AIA EUV intensities due to sensor degradation, we construct the synoptic maps in standardized intensity scale. We describe a method of homogenizing the SOHO/EIT maps with SDO/AIA maps by transforming the EIT intensity histograms to AIA levels. The new maps cover the years from 1996 to 2018 with 307 SOHO/EIT and 116 SDO/AIA synoptic maps, respectively. These maps provide a systematic and homogeneous view of the entire solar surface in four EUV wavelengths, and are well suited, e.g., for studying long-term coronal hole evolution."
The Determinants of Subjective Well-Being in a Developing Country: The Ecuadorian Case,"In this study, we identify some individual and contextual factors potentially affecting subjective well-being in developing countries and check their effect in the Ecuadorian case. Ecuador is an oil country where attempts have been made to overcome deep social and territorial inequalities by placing human well-being at the core of public policy through the National Plan for Good Living. By means of ordinary least squares and ordered logit with clustered standard errors, as well as multilevel ordered logit models, we find that oil-dependent territories negatively affect well-being. Moreover, women and indigenous people report lower well-being, while personal income, education, housing quality, institutional trust, health insurance and social relationships can improve it. From a policy perspective, we find that basic unmet needs still need to be fulfilled to increase well-being, and further improvements of the institutional framework, redistributive system and inclusion policies are required. In this respect, we observe that Good Living-based policy accurately addresses these elements and, therefore, has great potential for application in other countries with similar characteristics."
Costs and long-term outcomes following pulmonary vein isolation for atrial fibrillation in elderly patients using second-generation cryoballoon vs. open-irrigated radiofrequency in China,Limited comparative data are available regarding catheter ablation (CA) of atrial fibrillation (AF) using second-generation cryoballoon (CB-2) vs. radiofrequency (RF) ablation in elderly patients (> 75 years old). The present study aimed to compare the costs and clinical outcomes in elderly patients using these two strategies.
Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Polish version of the Spine Functional Index,"The purpose of this study was a cross-cultural adaptation of the Spine Functional Index to produce a Polish version (SFI-PL).

"Photometric and spectroscopic monitoring, radial velocities and evolutionary status of the chromospherically active, close eclipsing binaries ST Centauri and V0775 Centauri","We have combined photometric and spectroscopic observations of two very close eclipsing binary systems, ST Centauri and V775 Centauri, to determine their evolutionary state from calculations of masses and radii and other properties. Spectral types were determined and radial velocities calculated from spectra obtained with the Australian National University’s 2.3 m telescope and Wide Field Spectrograph. The spectral type of the ST Cen primary component is F8 IV and the secondary is F8-8.5 IV. The ST Cen mean masses and radii of \(1.40 \pm 0.05\ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\) and \(1.38 \pm 0.10\ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\) and \(2.2 \pm 0.1\ \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\) and \(2.13 \pm 0.08\ \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\) for the primary and secondary components respectively, indicate that they are close to terminal age on the Main Sequence. Although the spectra of V775 Cen appeared to be single lined, the broadening function method enabled us to determine the radial velocities of the faint secondary component as well as those of the primary star. The mean masses and radii of the V775 Cen components are \(1.65 \pm 0.31\ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\) and \(0.72 \pm 0.29\ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\) and \(1.68 \pm 0.11\ \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\) and \(1.24 \pm 0.08\ \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\) for components 1 and 2 respectively. Our data show that V775 Cen is a close Algol binary system, with a secondary component that has evolved beyond terminal age Main Sequence, has filled its inner critical equipotential surface and is transferring mass to the primary star. The masses and radii of both components of V775 Cen are smaller than those of other Algol binary systems. Although the primary component of V775 Cen is on the Main Sequence, its spectral type is F0/F1 class IV. Both systems displayed episodes of photospheric and chromospheric activity. This was evident in the H\(\alpha\) lines of ST Cen and the Na I D lines of the components in both systems. Narrow Na I D lines between those of the binary components suggest that circumbinary gas is present."
Functional Analysis of Sheep POU2F3 Isoforms,"POU domain class 2 transcription factor 3 (POU2F3) plays an important role in keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Our previous study identified four sheep POU2F3 transcript variants (POU2F3-1, POU2F3-2, POU2F3-3, and POU2F3-4), encoding three POU2F3 protein isoforms (POU2F3-1, POU2F3-2, and POU2F3-3). However, the functional differences among the three POU2F3 isoforms remain unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the tissue expression pattern of the four POU2F3 transcript variants in sheep and to investigate the functional differences in cell proliferation among the three POU2F3 isoforms. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the four POU2F3 transcripts were ubiquitously expressed in all tested adult sheep tissues, and POU2F3-1 exhibited higher expression level than the other three POU2F3 transcript variants in skin (P < 0.05). Cell proliferation assay showed that overexpression of any one of the three POU2F3 isoforms significantly inhibited the proliferation of sheep fetal fibroblasts and HaCaT cells at 48 and 72 h after transfection (P < 0.05). POU2F3-3 had less inhibitory effect on cell proliferation than POU2F3-1 and POU2F3-2 (P < 0.05), and POU2F3-1 and POU2F3-2 had similar inhibitory effects (P > 0.05). Dual luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that overexpression of any one of the three POU2F3 isoforms significantly inhibited the promoter activities of keratin 14 (KRT14) and matrix metalloproteinase 19 (MMP19) genes (P < 0.05). POU2F3-3 had less inhibitory effect on the promoter activities of KRT14 and MMP19 genes than POU2F3-1 and POU2F3-2 (P < 0.05), and POU2F3-1 and POU2F3-2 had similar inhibitory effects (P > 0.05). These results suggest three sheep POU2F3 isoforms have similar functional effects, but to a different extent."
The influence of long-term cadmium exposure on the male advertisement call of Xenopus laevis,"Cadmium (Cd) is a non-essential environmental endocrine-disrupting compound found in water and a potential threat to aquatic habitats. Cd has been shown to have various short-term effects on aquatic animals; however, evidence for long-term effects of Cd on vocal communications in amphibians is lacking. To better understand the long-term effects of low-dose Cd on acoustic communication in amphibians, male Xenopus laevis individuals were treated with low Cd concentrations (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/L) via aqueous exposure for 24 months. At the end of the exposure, the acoustic spectrum characteristics of male advertisement calls and male movement behaviors in response to female calls were recorded. The gene and protein expressions of the androgen receptor (AR) were determined using Western blot and RT-PCR. The results showed that long-term Cd treatment affected the spectrogram and formant of the advertisement call. Compared with the control group, 10 μg/L Cd significantly decreased the first and second formant frequency, and the fundamental and main frequency, and increased the third formant frequency. One and 10-μg/L Cd treatments significantly reduced the proportion of individuals responding to female calls and prolonged the time of first movement of the male. Long-term Cd treatment induced a downregulation in the AR protein. Treatments of 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/L Cd significantly decreased the expression of AR mRNA in the brain. These findings indicate that long-term exposure of Cd has negative effects on advertisement calls in male X. laevis."
A field pilot-scale study on heavy metal-contaminated soil washing by using an environmentally friendly agent—poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA),"In this study, a farmland contaminated by heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Ni, and Cr) was selected to evaluate the performance of poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) on the removal of heavy metals in soil washing. The highest heavy metal concentrations at the contaminated site were Cu: 1180 mg/kg, Zn: 1450 mg/kg, Ni: 287 mg/kg, and Cr: 316 mg/kg. Batch experiments designed by Taguchi Method were conducted first to assess the effect of different washing conditions on the removal of heavy metals in laboratory. The results of batch experiments show that factors that affected the removal efficiency of heavy metals was of the order γ-PGA concentration > washing time > liquid/soil ratio > rotational speed. The optimal operating parameters for heavy metal removal were γ-PGA 3.5%, liquid/soil ratio 15/1, washing time 60 min, and rotational speed 100 rpm. Under the optimal conditions, up to 50.7% of the major target metal, Cu, was removed. Heavy metals in the soil were mainly Fe-Mn oxide bound and organically bound. On-site treatment using the optimal operating parameters caused 54.3% of Cu removal. When the soil was washed 3 times by γ-PGA, the removal efficiency of Cu was improved to 74.3%. After the treatment, the change in soil bacterial number was insignificant, indicating that γ-PGA is an environmentally friendly washing reagent."
Removal of nickel from aqueous solution using synthesized IL/ZnO NPs,"In this paper, the removal of nickel from aqueous solution was studied using zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) and zinc oxide nanoparticles functionalized ionic liquid (IL/ZnO NPs) by batch adsorption and solid phase extraction (SPE) methods, respectively. The synthesized IL/ZnO NPs was characterized by FT-IR, SEM, XRD, XPS, and DLS techniques. The optimum conditions were experimentally determined by varying the parameters such as feed concentration, contact time, adsorbent dosage, pH, and temperature using both the adsorbents. From the optimum conditions, it was found that the feed concentration is 10 ppm, contact time is 120 min, adsorbent dosage is 0.2 g, pH is 6, and temperature is 60 °C with the maximum percentage removal of 81% for ZnO Nps, whereas, for IL/ZnO NPs, the feed concentration is 10 ppm, contact time is 90 min, adsorbent dosage is 0.1 g, pH is 6, and temperature is 60 °C with the maximum percentage removal of 92.5%. On comparison with the results, IL/ZnO NPs was an efficient adsorbent for the removal of nickel from aqueous solution as well as the effluents of electroplating and stainless steel industries. The percentage removal of nickel was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The sorbents were regenerated and reused effectively."
Application of agronomical approaches to rehabilitating territories of the Republic of Belarus affected by the Chernobyl disaster,"The environmental radiation pollution resulting from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 is one of the main factors limiting agriculture in the eastern regions of Belarus. In the first decade after the accident, the need to mitigate the effects of radiation had a key role in the implementation of countermeasures. As a result, there are widespread areas of high soil fertility potential in the contaminated zone. Today there is a possibility to include new crops (e.g. sugar beet [Beta vulgaris L.]) into regular crop rotation to increase the effectiveness of agriculture and to use the accumulated soil fertility potential. The article discusses a possible agronomic approach to estimating specific fields (working plots) at the scale of agricultural enterprises for placement of sugar beet. The territory of the Mahilyow region of the Republic of Belarus was examined from the perspective of soil suitability to the cultivation of sugar beet. Along with estimating radionuclide accumulation by sugar beet roots, the areas of soils suitable for sugar beet within agricultural enterprises were calculated for selected districts. It was revealed that sugar beet has low ability to absorb radiocaesium and radiostrontium from soils. The contamination density does not restrict the possibility for placement of sugar beet. Instead, soil fertility, specifically content of plant-available phosphorus and boron, was the limiting factor in that. Based on data from field experiments and soil fertility data, a number of enterprises were selected where sugar beet could be included into crop rotations to high economic effect."
Identification of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes for food safety on two different cadmium contaminated soils,"Over the last decade, human population has been facing great challenges in ensuring appropriate supply of food free from cadmium (Cd) contamination. Selection of genetically low-Cd wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes, with a large biomass and high accumulation of Cd in straw but low-Cd concentration in grains, is an inventive approach of phytoremediation while keeping agricultural production in moderately contaminated soils. In this study, variations in Cd uptake and translocation among the 30 wheat genotypes in two different sites were investigated in field experiments. Significant differences in grain Cd concentration were observed between the two sites, with averaged values of 0.048 and 0.053 mg kg−1 DW, respectively. Based on straw Cd accumulation, grain Cd concentration, and TFrs, Bainong207 and Aikang58 for site A and Huaimai23 and Yannong21 for site B are promising candidates of low-Cd genotypes, which have considerable potential in achieving phytoremediation while keeping agricultural production on moderately or slightly Cd-polluted soil. The results indicate that it is possible to select the optimal low-Cd genotypes of wheat for different soil types by taking consideration of the effect of soil-wheat genotype interaction on grain Cd concentration."
Effects of fuel types and fuel sulfur content on the characteristics of particulate emissions in marine low-speed diesel engine,"The emission of particulate matter from ships does great harm to human health and atmospheric environment. Sulfur emission regulations also affect particulate matter emissions due to fuel change. Particulate matter (PM) emitted from low-speed, two-stroke, large-power diesel engine were studied in test-bed experiments. Experiments were conducted at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% load with heavy fuel oil (HFO, 3.36%m/m S) and a lighter marine diesel oil (MDO, 0.1%m/m S). The experiments revealed that using MDO could decrease the mass emission factors (EFs) of PM compared to HFO due to the fuel quality and content; however, there was no obvious difference for the number EFs of PM. The main particle when using HFO consists sulfates and bound water, and the hydrate sulfur increased with the increased engine loads. Then, another 21% is organic carbon (OC). Emission factors for inorganic elements were also studied in particles from combustion of HFO and MDO. The EFs of OC and elemental carbon (EC) were affected by engine loads, fuel type, fuel sulfur content (FSC), and combustion conditions. The size distribution of OC was similar to EC, and there were two clearly peaks for every particulate matter sample. The key effect factor for EFs of PM with marine fossil fuels was FSC."
Synthesis of mono- and dimethoxylated polychlorinated biphenyl derivatives starting from fluoroarene derivatives,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are environmental pollutants implicated in a variety of adverse health effects, including cancer and noncancer diseases in animals and humans. PCBs are metabolized to hydroxylated compounds, and some of these PCB metabolites are more toxic than the parent PCBs. Unfortunately, most PCB metabolites needed for toxicological studies are not available from commercial sources. Moreover, it is challenging to synthesize PCB metabolites because starting materials with suitable substitution patterns are not readily available. Here, we report the novel synthesis of a variety of mono- and dimethoxyarene derivatives from commercially available fluoroarenes via nucleophilic aromatic substitution with sodium methoxide. This reaction provided good to excellent yields of the desired methoxylated products. Suzuki coupling of selected mono- and dimethoxy haloarenes with chlorinated phenylboronic acids yielded methoxylated derivatives of PCB 11, 12, 25, 35, and 36 in low to good yields. Crystal structures of 3,3′-dichloro-2,5-dimethoxy-1,1′-biphenyl and 3′,5-dichloro-2,3-dimethoxy-1,1′-biphenyl confirmed the substitution pattern of both compounds. This synthesis strategy provides straightforward access to a range of mono- and dimethoxylated PCB derivatives that were not readily accessible previously."
Controllable drilling parameter optimization for roller cone and polycrystalline diamond bits,"Oil well drilling data from 23 oil wells in northern Iraq are analyzed and optimized controllable drilling parameters are found. The most widely used Bourgoyne and Young (BY) penetration rate model have been chosen for roller cone bits, and parameters were extracted to adjust for other bit types. In this regard, the collected data from real drilling operation have initially been averaged in short clusters based on changes in both lithology and bottom hole assemblies. The averaging was performed to overcome the issues related to noisy data negative effect and the lithological homogeneity assumption. Second, the Dmitriy Belozerov modifications for polycrystalline diamond bits compacts have been utilized to correct the model to the bit weight. The drilling formulas were used to calculate other required parameters for the BYM. Third, threshold weight for each cluster was determined through the relationship between bit weight and depth instead of the usual Drill of Test. Fourth, coefficients of the BYM were calculated for each cluster using multilinear regression. Fifth, a new model was developed to find the optimum drill string rotation based on changes in torque and bit diameter with depth. The above-developed approach has been implemented successfully on 23 oil wells field data to find optimum penetration rate, weight on bit and string rotation."
Global Asymptotic Synchronization of a Class of BAM Neural Networks with Time Delays via Integrating Inequality Techniques,"In this paper, the authors are concerned with global asymptotic synchronization for a class of BAM neural networks with time delays. Instead of using Lyapunov functional method, LMI method and matrix measure method which are recently widely applied to investigating global exponential/ asymptotic synchronization for neural networks, two novel sufficient conditions on global asymptotic synchronization of above BAM neural networks are established by using a kind of new study method of global synchronization: Integrating inequality techniques. The method and results extend the study of global synchronization of neural networks."
Formation Tracking for Nonlinear Multi-agent Systems with Input and Output Quantization via Adaptive Output Feedback Control,"Signal quantization can reduce communication burden in multi-agent systems, whereas it brings control challenge to multi-agent formation tracking. This paper studies the output feedback control problem for formation tracking of multi-agent systems with both quantized input and output. The agents are described by a nonlinear dynamic model with unknown parameters and immeasurable states. To estimate immeasurable states and solve the uncertainties, state observers are developed by using dynamic high-gain tools. Through proper parameter designs, an output feedback quantized controller is established based on quantized output signals, and the quantization effect on the control system is eliminated. Stability analysis proves that, with the proposed control scheme, multi-agent systems can track the reference trajectory while forming and maintaining the desired formation shape. In addition, all the signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded. Finally, the numerical simulation and practical experiment are provided to verify the theoretical analysis."
"Short- and medium-term impact of bariatric surgery on the activities of CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2 in morbid obesity","Morbid obesity and bariatric surgery induce anatomical, physiological and metabolic alterations that may alter the body’s disposition of drugs. Current literature on this topic is limited and sometimes inconsistent. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a superfamily of enzymes that metabolize around 75% of all marketed drugs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of body mass index and bariatric surgery on CYP activities. Firstly, we evaluated the in vivo activity of 4 major CYP isoenzymes (CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2) in normal weight, overweight, and morbidly obese individuals. Secondly, we assessed the short- (1 month) and medium-term (6 month) effects of the most commonly employed bariatric surgery techniques (laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) on the activity of these enzymes. CYP3A4 activity was lower in morbidly obese individuals, compared to normal-weight controls. Interestingly, bariatric surgery normalized CYP3A4 activity. In comparison with normal-weight controls, morbidly obese individuals had higher CYP2D6 activity, which was only observed in individuals with two functional alleles for this isoenzyme. Neither body mass index nor surgery had significant effects on CYP2C9 and CYP1A2 activities. Overall, no relevant differences in CYP activities were found between surgical techniques. In conclusion, further studies should evaluate whether the observed alterations in CYP3A4 activity will require dose adjustments for CYP3A4 substrates especially in morbidly obese individuals before and after bariatric surgery."
Protein-bound uremic toxins are associated with cognitive function among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis,"Patients with chronic kidney disease have a greater risk of cognitive impairment. Cerebral uremic solute accumulation causes uremic encephalopathy; however, the association of protein-bound uremic toxins on cognitive function remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the association of two protein-bound uremic toxins, namely indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), on cognitive function in patients receiving hemodialysis (HD) for at least 90 days. Circulating free form IS and PCS were quantified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) were used to evaluate cognitive function. In total, 260 HD patients were recruited with a mean age of 58.1 ± 11.3 years, of which, 53.8% were men, 40% had diabetes, and 75.4% had hypertension. The analysis revealed that both free IS and free PCS were negatively associated with the CASI score and MMSE. After controlling for confounders, circulating free IS levels persisted to be negatively associated with MMSE scores [β = −0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI): −1.16 to −0.08] and CASI scores (β = −1.97, 95% CI: −3.78 to −0.16), mainly in the CASI domains of long-term memory, mental manipulation, language ability, and spatial construction. However, there was no correlation between free PCS and total MMSE or total CASI scores after controlling for confounders. In conclusion, circulating free form IS, but not PCS is associated with lower cognitive function test scores in HD patients. Thus, a further study is needed to evaluate whether a decrease in free IS levels can slow down cognitive decline in HD patients."
Defining the root endosphere and rhizosphere microbiomes from the World Olive Germplasm Collection,"The bacterial and fungal communities from the olive (Olea europaea L.) root systems have not yet been simultaneously studied. We show in this work that microbial communities from the olive root endosphere are less diverse than those from the rhizosphere. But more relevant was to unveil that olive belowground communities are mainly shaped by the genotype of the cultivar when growing under the same environmental, pedological and agronomic conditions. Furthermore, Actinophytocola, Streptomyces and Pseudonocardia are the most abundant bacterial genera in the olive root endosphere, Actinophytocola being the most prevalent genus by far. In contrast, Gp6, Gp4, Rhizobium and Sphingomonas are the main genera in the olive rhizosphere. Canalisporium, Aspergillus, Minimelanolocus and Macrophomina are the main fungal genera present in the olive root system. Interestingly enough, a large number of as yet unclassified fungal sequences (class level) were detected in the rhizosphere. From the belowground microbial profiles here reported, it can be concluded that the genus Actinophytocola may play an important role in olive adaptation to environmental stresses. Moreover, the huge unknown fungal diversity here uncovered suggests that fungi with important ecological function and biotechnological potential are yet to be identified."
Mechanistic Understanding of the Interactions of Cationic Conjugated Oligo- and Polyelectrolytes with Wild-type and Ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli,"An in-depth understanding of cell-drug binding modes and action mechanisms can potentially guide the future design of novel drugs and antimicrobial materials and help to combat antibiotic resistance. Light-harvesting π-conjugated molecules have been demonstrated for their antimicrobial effects, but their impact on bacterial outer cell envelope needs to be studied in detail. Here, we synthesized poly(phenylene) based model cationic conjugated oligo- (2QA-CCOE, 4QA-CCOE) and polyelectrolytes (CCPE), and systematically explored their interactions with the outer cell membrane of wild-type and ampicillin (amp)-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli). Incubation of the E. coli cells in CCOE/CCPE solution inhibited the subsequent bacterial growth in LB media. About 99% growth inhibition was achieved if amp-resistant E. coli was treated for ~3–5 min, 1 h and 6 h with 100 μM of CCPE, 4QA-CCOE, and 2QA-CCOE solutions, respectively. Interestingly, these CCPE and CCOEs inhibited the growth of both wild-type and amp-resistant E. coli to a similar extent. A large surface charge reversal of bacteria upon treatment with CCPE suggested the formation of a coating of CCPE on the outer surface of bacteria; while a low reversal of bacterial surface charge suggested intercalation of CCOEs within the lipid bilayer of bacteria."
Obesity-induced nucleosome release predicts poor cardio-metabolic health,"While circulating nucleosome levels are high in obese mouse models, it is unknown where these nucleosomes originate from and whether they are a marker of cardio-metabolic health in humans. Here, we aimed to determine whether an association exists between circulating nucleosomes and the risk of developing obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and/or a dysfunctional cardiovascular performance."
Interval between secondary cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy is not associated with survivals in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer,"Secondary cytoreductive surgery (SCS) is possible in selected patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The goal of SCS is complete resection, although chemotherapy is always followed. Delayed intervals between primary debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy was reported to be associated with poorer survivals, however, the role of intervals in recurrent disease is still unknown."
A novel three-dimensional echocardiographic method for device size selection in patients undergoing ASD trans-catheter closure,"Proper device size selection is a crucial step for successful ASD device closure. The current gold standard for device size selection is balloon sizing. Balloon sizing can be tedious, time consuming and increase fluoroscopy and procedure times as well as risk of complications. We aimed to establish a simple and accurate method for device size selection using three-dimensional echocardiographic interrogation of the ASD.This is a prospective observational study conducted over a period of 12 months. All patients underwent 2D TTE, three-dimensional echocardiographic assessment of the IAS and transesophageal echocardiogram. Comparison between echocardiographic variables was done using independent sample t test. Linear correlation was established between three dimensional echocardiographic variables and respective variables of device size and 2D TTE and TEE measurements."
Role of three-dimensional ultrasound in females with obstructed defecation (in comparison with defecography),"Growing attention of pelvic floor disorders has led to development of new imaging techniques, with increasing importance of ultrasonography. The 3DUS technique is considered an accessible tool for imaging of the posterior pelvic compartment. The purpose of this study is to highlight the role of 3D ultrasound in evaluation of obstructed defecation in females and comparing the findings with defecography."
Robust stability analysis of LTI systems with fractional degree generalized frequency variables,"A novel linear time-invariant (LTI) system model with fractional degree generalized frequency variables (FDGFVs) is proposed in this paper. This model can provide a unified form for many complex systems, including fractional-order systems, distributed-order systems, multi-agent systems and so on. This study mainly investigates the stability and robust stability problems of LTI systems with FDGFVs. By characterizing the relationship between generalized frequency variable and system matrix, a necessary and sufficient stability condition is firstly presented for such systems. Then for LTI systems with uncertain FDGFVs, we present a robust stability method in virtue of zero exclusion principle. Finally, the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper is demonstrated by analyzing the robust stability of gene regulatory networks."
High-order algorithms for riesz derivative and their applications (IV),"The main goal of this article is to establish a new 4th-order numerical differential formula to approximate Riesz derivatives which is obtained by means of a newly established generating function. Then the derived formula is used to solve the Riesz space fractional advection-dispersion equation. Meanwhile, by the energy method, it is proved that the difference scheme is unconditionally stable and convergent with order 𝓞(τ2 + h4). Finally, several numerical examples are given to show that the numerical convergence orders of the numerical differential formulas and the finite difference scheme are in line with the theoretical analysis."
Porous functions,"A new approach to modeling the geometric structure of real materials based on a new type of functions–porous functions–is introduced. The general concept, basic operations, operations of calculus, visualization and interpretations, and potential applications of porous functions are outlined."
Mass-conserving tempered fractional diffusion in a bounded interval,"Transient anomalous diffusion may be modeled by a tempered fractional diffusion equation. A reflecting boundary condition enforces mass conservation on a bounded interval. In this work, explicit and implicit Euler schemes for tempered fractional diffusion with discrete reflecting or absorbing boundary conditions are constructed. Discrete reflecting boundaries are formulated such that the Euler schemes conserve mass. Conditional stability of the explicit Euler methods and unconditional stability of the implicit Euler methods are established. Analytical steady-state solutions involving the Mittag-Leffler function are derived and shown to be consistent with late-time numerical solutions. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and usefulness of the proposed numerical schemes."
"Photometric and spectroscopic monitoring, radial velocities and evolutionary status of the chromospherically active, close eclipsing binaries ST Centauri and V0775 Centauri","We have combined photometric and spectroscopic observations of two very close eclipsing binary systems, ST Centauri and V775 Centauri, to determine their evolutionary state from calculations of masses and radii and other properties. Spectral types were determined and radial velocities calculated from spectra obtained with the Australian National University’s 2.3 m telescope and Wide Field Spectrograph. The spectral type of the ST Cen primary component is F8 IV and the secondary is F8-8.5 IV. The ST Cen mean masses and radii of \(1.40 \pm 0.05\ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\) and \(1.38 \pm 0.10\ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\) and \(2.2 \pm 0.1\ \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\) and \(2.13 \pm 0.08\ \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\) for the primary and secondary components respectively, indicate that they are close to terminal age on the Main Sequence. Although the spectra of V775 Cen appeared to be single lined, the broadening function method enabled us to determine the radial velocities of the faint secondary component as well as those of the primary star. The mean masses and radii of the V775 Cen components are \(1.65 \pm 0.31\ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\) and \(0.72 \pm 0.29\ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\) and \(1.68 \pm 0.11\ \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\) and \(1.24 \pm 0.08\ \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\) for components 1 and 2 respectively. Our data show that V775 Cen is a close Algol binary system, with a secondary component that has evolved beyond terminal age Main Sequence, has filled its inner critical equipotential surface and is transferring mass to the primary star. The masses and radii of both components of V775 Cen are smaller than those of other Algol binary systems. Although the primary component of V775 Cen is on the Main Sequence, its spectral type is F0/F1 class IV. Both systems displayed episodes of photospheric and chromospheric activity. This was evident in the H\(\alpha\) lines of ST Cen and the Na I D lines of the components in both systems. Narrow Na I D lines between those of the binary components suggest that circumbinary gas is present."
Functional Analysis of Sheep POU2F3 Isoforms,"POU domain class 2 transcription factor 3 (POU2F3) plays an important role in keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Our previous study identified four sheep POU2F3 transcript variants (POU2F3-1, POU2F3-2, POU2F3-3, and POU2F3-4), encoding three POU2F3 protein isoforms (POU2F3-1, POU2F3-2, and POU2F3-3). However, the functional differences among the three POU2F3 isoforms remain unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the tissue expression pattern of the four POU2F3 transcript variants in sheep and to investigate the functional differences in cell proliferation among the three POU2F3 isoforms. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the four POU2F3 transcripts were ubiquitously expressed in all tested adult sheep tissues, and POU2F3-1 exhibited higher expression level than the other three POU2F3 transcript variants in skin (P < 0.05). Cell proliferation assay showed that overexpression of any one of the three POU2F3 isoforms significantly inhibited the proliferation of sheep fetal fibroblasts and HaCaT cells at 48 and 72 h after transfection (P < 0.05). POU2F3-3 had less inhibitory effect on cell proliferation than POU2F3-1 and POU2F3-2 (P < 0.05), and POU2F3-1 and POU2F3-2 had similar inhibitory effects (P > 0.05). Dual luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that overexpression of any one of the three POU2F3 isoforms significantly inhibited the promoter activities of keratin 14 (KRT14) and matrix metalloproteinase 19 (MMP19) genes (P < 0.05). POU2F3-3 had less inhibitory effect on the promoter activities of KRT14 and MMP19 genes than POU2F3-1 and POU2F3-2 (P < 0.05), and POU2F3-1 and POU2F3-2 had similar inhibitory effects (P > 0.05). These results suggest three sheep POU2F3 isoforms have similar functional effects, but to a different extent."
New Homogeneous Dataset of Solar EUV Synoptic Maps from SOHO/EIT and SDO/AIA,"Synoptic maps of solar EUV intensities have been constructed for many decades in order to display the distribution of the different EUV emissions across the solar surface, with each map representing one Carrington rotation (i.e. one rotation of the Sun). This article presents a new solar EUV synoptic map dataset based on full-disk images from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SOHO/EIT) and Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA). In order to remove the significant and complicated drift of EIT and AIA EUV intensities due to sensor degradation, we construct the synoptic maps in standardized intensity scale. We describe a method of homogenizing the SOHO/EIT maps with SDO/AIA maps by transforming the EIT intensity histograms to AIA levels. The new maps cover the years from 1996 to 2018 with 307 SOHO/EIT and 116 SDO/AIA synoptic maps, respectively. These maps provide a systematic and homogeneous view of the entire solar surface in four EUV wavelengths, and are well suited, e.g., for studying long-term coronal hole evolution."

A field pilot-scale study on heavy metal-contaminated soil washing by using an environmentally friendly agent—poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA),"In this study, a farmland contaminated by heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Ni, and Cr) was selected to evaluate the performance of poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) on the removal of heavy metals in soil washing. The highest heavy metal concentrations at the contaminated site were Cu: 1180 mg/kg, Zn: 1450 mg/kg, Ni: 287 mg/kg, and Cr: 316 mg/kg. Batch experiments designed by Taguchi Method were conducted first to assess the effect of different washing conditions on the removal of heavy metals in laboratory. The results of batch experiments show that factors that affected the removal efficiency of heavy metals was of the order γ-PGA concentration > washing time > liquid/soil ratio > rotational speed. The optimal operating parameters for heavy metal removal were γ-PGA 3.5%, liquid/soil ratio 15/1, washing time 60 min, and rotational speed 100 rpm. Under the optimal conditions, up to 50.7% of the major target metal, Cu, was removed. Heavy metals in the soil were mainly Fe-Mn oxide bound and organically bound. On-site treatment using the optimal operating parameters caused 54.3% of Cu removal. When the soil was washed 3 times by γ-PGA, the removal efficiency of Cu was improved to 74.3%. After the treatment, the change in soil bacterial number was insignificant, indicating that γ-PGA is an environmentally friendly washing reagent."
The influence of long-term cadmium exposure on the male advertisement call of Xenopus laevis,"Cadmium (Cd) is a non-essential environmental endocrine-disrupting compound found in water and a potential threat to aquatic habitats. Cd has been shown to have various short-term effects on aquatic animals; however, evidence for long-term effects of Cd on vocal communications in amphibians is lacking. To better understand the long-term effects of low-dose Cd on acoustic communication in amphibians, male Xenopus laevis individuals were treated with low Cd concentrations (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/L) via aqueous exposure for 24 months. At the end of the exposure, the acoustic spectrum characteristics of male advertisement calls and male movement behaviors in response to female calls were recorded. The gene and protein expressions of the androgen receptor (AR) were determined using Western blot and RT-PCR. The results showed that long-term Cd treatment affected the spectrogram and formant of the advertisement call. Compared with the control group, 10 μg/L Cd significantly decreased the first and second formant frequency, and the fundamental and main frequency, and increased the third formant frequency. One and 10-μg/L Cd treatments significantly reduced the proportion of individuals responding to female calls and prolonged the time of first movement of the male. Long-term Cd treatment induced a downregulation in the AR protein. Treatments of 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/L Cd significantly decreased the expression of AR mRNA in the brain. These findings indicate that long-term exposure of Cd has negative effects on advertisement calls in male X. laevis."

"Dengue Outbreak Response and Control in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan: A Mixed Methods Study","Since 2008, dengue fever outbreaks had occurred repeatedly in various districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province of Pakistan. Most importantly the outbreak of 2017 caused 70 deaths, about 121,083 suspected and 24,938 confirmed cases in 23 districts of KP. In 2018, an abrupt decline in suspected and confirmed dengue cases was observed and 2018 was declared as dengue outbreak free. This study characterizes and explores the control and response measure activities of the outbreak. In addition, we explored the challenges faced and lessons learned for control of future dengue outbreaks from the perspectives of health authorities and dengue response staff in the KP province of Pakistan."
Peculiarities of pseudogap in Y0.95Pr0.05Ba2Cu3O7−δ single crystals under pressure up to 1.7 GPa,"The effect of hydrostatic pressure up to P = 1.7 GPa on the fluctuation conductivity σ′(T) and pseudogap ∆*(T) in Y0.95Pr0.05Ba2Cu3O7−δ single crystal with critical temperature Тс = 85.2 K (at P = 0) was investigated. The application of pressure leads to the increase in Tc with dTc/dP = +1.82 K∙GPa−1 while the resistance decreases as dlnρ(100 K)/dP = −(10.5 ± 0.2) %∙GPa−1. Regardless of the pressure, in the temperature interval from Tc to T0 (~88 K at P = 0) the behaviour of σ′(T) is well described by the Aslamazov – Larkin (AL – 3D) fluctuation theory, and above the T0 by the Lawrence – Doniach theory (LD). The Maki-Thompson (MT – 2D) fluctuation contribution is not observed. This indicates the presence of structural defects in the sample induced by Pr. Here it is determined for the first time that when the pressure is applied to the Y1−xPrxBa2Cu3O7−δ single crystal, the pseudogap increases as dlnΔ*/dP = 0.17 GPa–1."
"Composition, Diversity and Functional Analysis of the Modern Microbiome of the Middle Triassic Cava Superiore Beds (Monte San Giorgio, Switzerland)","Organic-rich laminated shales and limestones from the Monte San Giorgio (Lugano Prealps, Switzerland) are known as famous fossil lagerstätten for excellently preserved fossils from the Middle Triassic Period. The various bituminous shales from Monte San Giorgio are thermally immature and rich in diverse organic compounds, which provide unique substrates for active soil microbial communities. We selected the Cava superior beds of the Acqua del Ghiffo site for this study. To investigate its microbial structure and diversity, contig assembly, Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) clustering, and rarefaction analysis were performed for bacterial 16S rDNA preparations from bituminous and non-bituminous limestone strata with the MetaAmp pipeline. Principal coordinates analysis shows that the microbial communities from the bituminous strata differ significantly from limestone samples (P < 0.05 Unifrac weighted). Moreover, metagenomic tools could also be used effectively to analyze the microbial communities shift during enrichment in specific growth media. In the nutrient-rich media, one or few taxa, mainly Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, were enriched which led to the drastic diversity loss while oligotrophic media could enrich many taxa simultaneously and sustain the richness and diversity of the inoculum. Piphillin, METAGENassist and MicrobiomeAnalyst pipeline also predicted that the Monte San Giorgio bituminous shales and oligotrophic enriched microbiomes degrade complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons."
Origin of the São Paulo Yellow Fever epidemic of 2017–2018 revealed through molecular epidemiological analysis of fatal cases,"The largest outbreak of yellow fever of the 21st century in the Americas began in 2016, with intense circulation in the southeastern states of Brazil, particularly in sylvatic environments near densely populated areas including the metropolitan region of São Paulo city (MRSP) during 2017–2018. Herein, we describe the origin and molecular epidemiology of yellow fever virus (YFV) during this outbreak inferred from 36 full genome sequences taken from individuals who died following infection with zoonotic YFV. Our analysis revealed that these deaths were due to three genetic variants of sylvatic YFV that belong the South American I genotype and that were related to viruses previously isolated in 2017 from other locations in Brazil (Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia and Rio de Janeiro states). Each variant represented an independent virus introduction into the MRSP. Phylogeographic and geopositioning analyses suggested that the virus moved around the peri-urban area without detectable human-to-human transmission, and towards the Atlantic rain forest causing human spill-over in nearby cities, yet in the absence of sustained viral transmission in the urban environment."
Vortex-induced vibration wind energy harvesting by piezoelectric MEMS device in formation,"A silicon chip integrated microelectromechanical (MEMS) wind energy harvester, based on the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) concept, has been designed, fabricated, and tested as a proof-of-concept demonstration. The harvester comprises of a cylindrical oscillator attached to a piezoelectric MEMS device. Wind tunnel experiments are conducted to measure the power output of the energy harvester. Additionally, the energy harvester is placed within a formation of up to 25 cylinders to test whether the vortex interactions of multiple cylinders in formation can enhance the power output. Experiments show power output in the nanowatt range, and the energy harvester within a formation of cylinders yield noticeably higher power output compared to the energy harvester in isolation. A more detailed investigation conducted using computational fluid dynamics simulations indicates that vortices shed from upstream cylinders introduce large periodic transverse velocity component on the incoming flow encountered by the downstream cylinders, hence increasing VIV response. For the first time, the use of formation effect to enhance the wind energy harvesting at microscale has been demonstrated. This proof-of-concept demonstrates a potential means of powering small off-grid sensors in a cost-effective manner due to the easy integration of the energy harvester and sensor on the same silicon chip."
Transparency and stability of low density stellar plasma related to Boltzmann statistics and to thermal bremsstrahlung,The stability of low density stellar plasma is analyzed for a star with a spherical symmetry which is in equilibrium between the gravitational attractive forces and the repulsive pressure forces of an ideal electron gas where the analysis is developed by the use of Boltzmann statistics. Fundamental results are obtained for the radius and total mass of such star and its gravitational forces are large due to the extreme large volume. The absorption and emission of radiation for extremely low density star plasmas is very small over the entire electro-magnetic spectrum.
Aluminum Matrix Composites Manufactured using Nitridation-Induced Self-Forming Process,"Conventional manufacturing processes for aluminum matrix composites (AMCs) involve complex procedures that require unique equipment and skills at each stage. This increases the process costs and limits the scope of potential applications. In this study, a simple and facile route for AMC manufacturing is developed, a mixture of Al powder and the ceramic reinforcement is simply heated under nitrogen atmosphere to produce the composite. During heating under nitrogen atmosphere, the surface modification of both Al and the reinforcement is induced by nitridation. When the oxide layer covering Al powder surface is transformed to nitrides, temperature in the local region increases rapidly, resulting in a partial melt of Al powder. The molten Al infiltrates into the empty space among Al powder and reinforcement, thereby enabling consolidation of powders without external forces. It is possible to fabricate AMCs with various types, sizes, volume fractions, and morphologies of the reinforcement. Furthermore, the manufacturing temperature can be lowered below the melting point of Al (or the solidus temperature for alloys) because of the exothermic nature of the nitridation, which prevents formation of un-wanted reactants. The relative simplicity of this process will not only provide sufficient price competitiveness for the final products but also contribute to the expansion of the application scope of AMCs."
Screening history and FIGO-stages among Danish women with cervical cancer in 2012–2014: a register-based study,"The objective was to examine whether attendance in the mass cervical screening programme has implications for the prognosis when cervical cancer is diagnosed. We performed a retrospective analysis of all cases of cervical cancer between 1st of January 2012 and 31st of December 2014 in the Region of Southern Denmark. The cases were retrieved from the Danish National Pathology Registry, PatoBank. Odds ratios (OR) with confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for attendees versus non-attendees of the screening programme by using χ2-test. 216 patients were included in the study. 61.6% of the study population had not attended the screening programme. Patients who had attended the programme were characterised by disease in low stage (OR = 3.14, 95% CI; 1.66 to 5.92), treatment with surgery alone (OR = 2.63, 95% CI; 1.49 to 4.64) and a lower risk of death (OR = 0.36, 95% CI; 0.15 to 0.87). Adenocarcinomas were more often detected among attendees of the programme compared to squamous cell carcinomas (OR = 4.06, 95% CI; 2.03 to 8.14). Statistically significant results regarding relapse of cancer (OR = 0.62, 95% CI; 0.23 to 1.68, p = 0.47) and lymph node metastases (OR = 0.62, 95% CI; 0.32 to 1.21, p = 0.19) were not found. Cervical cancer detected in women who had attended the mass cervical screening programme prior to the diagnosis, was shown to have a statistically significant lower FIGO stage (p = 0.0004) and was therefore linked to less extensive treatment options. Continued focus on increasing the participation rate of the programme is of importance, as the nonattendance rate continues to be high."
"Risk of yellow fever virus importation into the United States from Brazil, outbreak years 2016–2017 and 2017–2018","Southeast Brazil has experienced two large yellow fever (YF) outbreaks since 2016. While the 2016–2017 outbreak mainly affected the states of Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais, the 2017–2018 YF outbreak primarily involved the states of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro, the latter two of which are highly populated and popular destinations for international travelers. This analysis quantifies the risk of YF virus (YFV) infected travelers arriving in the United States via air travel from Brazil, including both incoming Brazilian travelers and returning US travelers. We assumed that US travelers were subject to the same daily risk of YF infection as Brazilian residents. During both YF outbreaks in Southeast Brazil, three international airports—Miami, New York-John F. Kennedy, and Orlando—had the highest risk of receiving a traveler infected with YFV. Most of the risk was observed among incoming Brazilian travelers. Overall, we found low risk of YFV introduction into the United States during the 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 outbreaks. Decision makers can use these results to employ the most efficient and least restrictive actions and interventions."
First experimental evidence for olfactory species discrimination in two nocturnal primate species (Microcebus lehilahytsara and M. murinus),"Olfactory communication is highly important for nocturnal mammals, especially for solitary foragers, but knowledge is still limited for nocturnal primates. Mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) are nocturnal solitary foragers with a dispersed lifestyle and frequently use chemo-sensory signalling behaviour for governing social interactions. Different mouse lemur species can co-occur in a given forest but it is unknown whether olfaction is involved in species recognition. We first screened 24 captive mouse lemurs (9 M. murinus, 15 M. lehilahytsara) for their olfactory learning potential in an experimental arena and then tested the species discrimination ability with urine odour in an operant conditioning paradigm in four individuals. The majority of the screened animals (75%) did not pass the screening criteria within a 2-week test period. However, all four final test animals, two M. murinus and two M. lehilahytsara, were successfully trained in a 5-step-conditioning process to reliably discriminate conspecific from heterospecific urine odour (requiring an overall median of 293 trials). Findings complement previous studies on the role of acoustic signalling and suggest that olfaction may be an important additional mechanism for species discrimination."
Nafamostat and sepimostat identified as novel neuroprotective agents via NR2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonism using a rat retinal excitotoxicity model,"In addition to its role in the treatment of pancreatitis, the serine protease inhibitor nafamostat exhibits a retinal protective effect. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this effect are unknown. In this study, the neuroprotective effects of nafamostat and its orally active derivative sepimostat against excitotoxicity were further characterised in vitro and in vivo. In primary rat cortical neurons, nafamostat completely suppressed N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced cell death. Intravitreal injection of nafamostat and sepimostat protected the rat retina against NMDA-induced degeneration, whereas the structurally related compounds, gabexate and camostat, did not. The neuroprotective effects of nafamostat and the NR2B antagonist ifenprodil were remarkably suppressed by spermidine, a naturally occurring polyamine that modulates the NR2B subunit. Both nafamostat and sepimostat inhibited [3H]ifenprodil binding to fractionated rat brain membranes. Thus, nafamostat and sepimostat may exert neuroprotective effects against excitotoxic retinal degeneration through NMDA receptor antagonism at the ifenprodil-binding site of the NR2B subunit."
Defining the root endosphere and rhizosphere microbiomes from the World Olive Germplasm Collection,"The bacterial and fungal communities from the olive (Olea europaea L.) root systems have not yet been simultaneously studied. We show in this work that microbial communities from the olive root endosphere are less diverse than those from the rhizosphere. But more relevant was to unveil that olive belowground communities are mainly shaped by the genotype of the cultivar when growing under the same environmental, pedological and agronomic conditions. Furthermore, Actinophytocola, Streptomyces and Pseudonocardia are the most abundant bacterial genera in the olive root endosphere, Actinophytocola being the most prevalent genus by far. In contrast, Gp6, Gp4, Rhizobium and Sphingomonas are the main genera in the olive rhizosphere. Canalisporium, Aspergillus, Minimelanolocus and Macrophomina are the main fungal genera present in the olive root system. Interestingly enough, a large number of as yet unclassified fungal sequences (class level) were detected in the rhizosphere. From the belowground microbial profiles here reported, it can be concluded that the genus Actinophytocola may play an important role in olive adaptation to environmental stresses. Moreover, the huge unknown fungal diversity here uncovered suggests that fungi with important ecological function and biotechnological potential are yet to be identified."
"Short- and medium-term impact of bariatric surgery on the activities of CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2 in morbid obesity","Morbid obesity and bariatric surgery induce anatomical, physiological and metabolic alterations that may alter the body’s disposition of drugs. Current literature on this topic is limited and sometimes inconsistent. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a superfamily of enzymes that metabolize around 75% of all marketed drugs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of body mass index and bariatric surgery on CYP activities. Firstly, we evaluated the in vivo activity of 4 major CYP isoenzymes (CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2) in normal weight, overweight, and morbidly obese individuals. Secondly, we assessed the short- (1 month) and medium-term (6 month) effects of the most commonly employed bariatric surgery techniques (laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) on the activity of these enzymes. CYP3A4 activity was lower in morbidly obese individuals, compared to normal-weight controls. Interestingly, bariatric surgery normalized CYP3A4 activity. In comparison with normal-weight controls, morbidly obese individuals had higher CYP2D6 activity, which was only observed in individuals with two functional alleles for this isoenzyme. Neither body mass index nor surgery had significant effects on CYP2C9 and CYP1A2 activities. Overall, no relevant differences in CYP activities were found between surgical techniques. In conclusion, further studies should evaluate whether the observed alterations in CYP3A4 activity will require dose adjustments for CYP3A4 substrates especially in morbidly obese individuals before and after bariatric surgery."
Protein-bound uremic toxins are associated with cognitive function among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis,"Patients with chronic kidney disease have a greater risk of cognitive impairment. Cerebral uremic solute accumulation causes uremic encephalopathy; however, the association of protein-bound uremic toxins on cognitive function remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the association of two protein-bound uremic toxins, namely indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), on cognitive function in patients receiving hemodialysis (HD) for at least 90 days. Circulating free form IS and PCS were quantified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) were used to evaluate cognitive function. In total, 260 HD patients were recruited with a mean age of 58.1 ± 11.3 years, of which, 53.8% were men, 40% had diabetes, and 75.4% had hypertension. The analysis revealed that both free IS and free PCS were negatively associated with the CASI score and MMSE. After controlling for confounders, circulating free IS levels persisted to be negatively associated with MMSE scores [β = −0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI): −1.16 to −0.08] and CASI scores (β = −1.97, 95% CI: −3.78 to −0.16), mainly in the CASI domains of long-term memory, mental manipulation, language ability, and spatial construction. However, there was no correlation between free PCS and total MMSE or total CASI scores after controlling for confounders. In conclusion, circulating free form IS, but not PCS is associated with lower cognitive function test scores in HD patients. Thus, a further study is needed to evaluate whether a decrease in free IS levels can slow down cognitive decline in HD patients."
Mechanistic Understanding of the Interactions of Cationic Conjugated Oligo- and Polyelectrolytes with Wild-type and Ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli,"An in-depth understanding of cell-drug binding modes and action mechanisms can potentially guide the future design of novel drugs and antimicrobial materials and help to combat antibiotic resistance. Light-harvesting π-conjugated molecules have been demonstrated for their antimicrobial effects, but their impact on bacterial outer cell envelope needs to be studied in detail. Here, we synthesized poly(phenylene) based model cationic conjugated oligo- (2QA-CCOE, 4QA-CCOE) and polyelectrolytes (CCPE), and systematically explored their interactions with the outer cell membrane of wild-type and ampicillin (amp)-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli). Incubation of the E. coli cells in CCOE/CCPE solution inhibited the subsequent bacterial growth in LB media. About 99% growth inhibition was achieved if amp-resistant E. coli was treated for ~3–5 min, 1 h and 6 h with 100 μM of CCPE, 4QA-CCOE, and 2QA-CCOE solutions, respectively. Interestingly, these CCPE and CCOEs inhibited the growth of both wild-type and amp-resistant E. coli to a similar extent. A large surface charge reversal of bacteria upon treatment with CCPE suggested the formation of a coating of CCPE on the outer surface of bacteria; while a low reversal of bacterial surface charge suggested intercalation of CCOEs within the lipid bilayer of bacteria."
Complement activation in individuals with previous subclinical Lyme borreliosis and patients with previous Lyme neuroborreliosis,Lyme borreliosis (LB) is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and infection may lead to not only a large variety of clinical manifestations but also a subclinical outcome. The aim of the present study was to investigate if there is a constitutional difference in complement activation between individuals with previous subclinical Lyme borreliosis (SB) and patients previously diagnosed with Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB).
Immunogenic cell death by neoadjuvant oxaliplatin and radiation protects against metastatic failure in high-risk rectal cancer,High rates of systemic failure in locally advanced rectal cancer call for a rational use of conventional therapies to foster tumor-defeating immunity.
Does Being Transported by Emergency Medical Services Improve Compliance with the Surviving Sepsis Bundle and Mortality Rate? A Retrospective Cohort Study,"This study aimed to investigate the relationship between patients with severe sepsis or septic shock being transported to the Emergency Department (ED) by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and the compliance with the 3-h sepsis resuscitation bundle [Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC)], and to compare the management and laboratory results of patients transported by EMS or non-EMS transport."
Design and application of adaptive PID controller based on asynchronous advantage actor–critic learning method,"To address the problems of the slow convergence and inefficiency in the existing adaptive PID controllers, we propose a new adaptive PID controller using the asynchronous advantage actor–critic (A3C) algorithm. Firstly, the controller can train the multiple agents of the actor–critic structures in parallel exploiting the multi-thread asynchronous learning characteristics of the A3C structure. Secondly, in order to achieve the best control effect, each agent uses a multilayer neural network to approach the strategy function and value function to search the best parameter-tuning strategy in continuous action space. The simulation results indicate that our proposed controller can achieve the fast convergence and strong adaptability compared with conventional controllers."
Screening of halogenated phenolic compounds in plasma and serum from marine wildlife,"The growing knowledge of the impact of halogenated phenolic compounds on hormonal and metabolic systems has led to an increased interest in the exposure and potential effects of these compounds in wildlife. In the present study, a screening procedure was developed to detect and quantify halogenated phenolic compounds in serum and plasma from marine wildlife. A mass spectral library containing selective ion monitoring data was created using gas chromatography electron capture negative ionization mass spectrometry. The selective ion monitoring data in the library were accompanied with retention indices to increase the specificity of each entry in the library. The library together with the developed extraction procedure and optimized instrumental settings can be used for the detection of 52 different halogenated phenolic compounds of environmental concern, including 23 hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls and 24 hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers. The instrument limit of detection for the compounds included in the library ranged from 30 to 320 fg/injection, with a median detection limit of 90 fg/injection. The average recovery of 11 different halogenated phenolic compounds, from four species of marine wildlife, was 66 ± 14%. A full-scan mass spectral library was also created containing an additional seven compounds. Gray seals, long-tailed ducks, and two species of fish from the Baltic Sea were screened for halogenated phenolic compounds using the developed procedure. A total of 33 compounds included in the library were detected and quantified."
Artificial Neural Network for Modeling Thermal Conductivity of Biodiesels with Different Metallic Nanoparticles for Heat Transfer Applications,"Thermal conductivity of two types of nanobiodiesels (NBs) was investigated theoretically and experimentally. The first type of NBs (C4-Au) was composed of C4 biodiesel (purchased from Biofuels of Mexico) filled with Au nanoparticles (Au-NPs) and the second type (SB-Ag) was composed of soybean biodiesel (SB) filled with Ag nanoparticles (Ag-NPs). It has been demonstrated in the literature that the addition of Au-NPs or Ag-NPs to biodiesel can lead to a significant increase in thermal properties. The photothermal techniques were used to determine the thermal diffusivity (D), thermal effusivity (e), and thermal conductivity (k) of biodiesel filled with Au-NPs or Ag-NPs for different concentrations. For about two decades, researchers have made the effort to predict the enhancement of the thermal conductivity of nanofluids based on experiments and several theoretical models have been proposed. One of these analytical models, which have allowed researchers to calculate the thermal conductivity of the nanofluids, is the Hamilton–Crosser Model. This model is based on the classical theory of compounds and mixtures containing particles in the order of millimeters or micrometers and fails dramatically in predicting the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. In that sense, the Hamilton–Crosser model (H–C) cannot represent adequately the enhancement in k as a function of NP’s concentration. Then, the artificial neural network (ANN) modeling method was used to predict the thermal conductivity of the two NBs studied in this work."
Seasonal forecasting of tropical cyclones in the North Indian Ocean region: the role of El Niño-Southern Oscillation,"In this study, we have investigated the contribution of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to the North Indian Ocean (NIO) tropical cyclone (TC) activity and seasonal predictability. A statistical seasonal prediction model was developed for the NIO region tropical cyclone genesis, trajectories and landfalls using the Southern Oscillation index (SOI: as a metric of ENSO) as a predictor. The forecast model utilised kernel density estimation (KDE), a generalised additive model (GAM), Euler integration, and a country mask. TCs from the Joint Typhoon Warning Centre were analysed over the 35-year period from 1979 to 2013. KDE was used to model the distribution of cyclone genesis points and the cyclone tracks were estimated using the GAM, with velocities fit as smooth functions of location according to ENSO phase and TC season. The best predictor lead time scales for TC forecast potential were assessed from 1 to 6 months. We found that the SOI (as a proxy for ENSO) is a good predictor of TC behaviour 2-months in advance (70% skill). Two hindcast validation methods were applied to assess the reliability of the model. The model was found to be skillful in hindcasting NIO region TC activity for the pre and post monsoon season. The distribution of TC genesis, movement and landfall probabilities over the study period, as well as the hindcast probabilities of TC landfall during ENSO events, matched well against observations over most of the study domain. Overall, we found that the phase of ENSO has the potential to improve NIO region TC seasonal forecast skill by about 15% over climatological persistence."
A 9-year experience study of single-port micro-laparoscopic repair of pediatric inguinal hernia using a simple needle,"As laparoscopic techniques and equipments improve, laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair has been gaining popularity. The objective of the study was to summarize 9 years of experience using a single-port micro-laparoscopic approach to repair pediatric inguinal hernias with a simple hernia needle."
An update on hepatitis C virus genotype distribution in Jordan: a 12-year retrospective study from a tertiary care teaching hospital in Amman,Nucleic acid hybridization (NAH) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a practical and reliable tool for virus genotyping. Genotype assignment is an important factor in the prediction of treatment success in chronic hepatitis C patients. The aim of this study was to determine the genotype distribution among HCV clinical isolates in Jordan between 2007 and 2018.
Association between vitamin D plasma concentrations and VDR gene variants and the risk of premature birth,"Premature birth is the main cause of mortality in children under 1 year, and vitamin D deficiency during gestation is associated with prematurity. The effects of vitamin D are mediated by its receptor, which is encoded by the VDR gene. VDR variants—such as single nucleotide variation (SNV)—are associated with increased risk of prematurity, but there are conflicting results. We evaluated serum vitamin D concentrations and the frequency of TaqI/A > G, BsmI/C > T, ApaI/C > A, and FokI/A > T VDR variants in mothers and preterm (PTN) and full-term (FTN) newborns."
Parental attachment and depressive symptoms in pregnancies complicated by twin-twin transfusion syndrome: a cohort study,"Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a highly morbid condition in which treatment exists, but the pregnancy remains high-risk until delivery. It may have serious sequelae, including fetal death, and in the longer term, neurodevelopmental problems. The aim of this study is to assess antenatal and postnatal parental attachment and depressive symptoms in those with pregnancies affected by TTTS."
"Urinary tract infections in pregnancy in a rural population of Bangladesh: population-based prevalence, risk factors, etiology, and antibiotic resistance","Urinary tract infection (UTI) in pregnancy, including asymptomatic bacteriuria, is associated with maternal morbidity and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth and low birthweight. In low-middle income countries (LMICs), the capacity for screening and treatment of UTIs is limited. The objective of this study was to describe the population-based prevalence, risk factors, etiology and antimicrobial resistance patterns of UTIs in pregnancy in Bangladesh."
Perinatal outcomes in Finnish twins: a retrospective study,"To establish the changes in perinatal morbidity and mortality in twin pregnancies in Finland, a retrospective register research was conducted. Our extensive data from a 28-year study period provide important information on the outcome of twin pregnancies in Finland that has previously not been reported to this extent."
Pathogenetic approach to the treatment of functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract and their intersection: results of the Russian observation retrospective program COMFORT,"The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of the novel complex drug, consisting of released-active form of antibodies to S-100 protein, tumor necrosis factor-α and histamine, (Kolofort) under outpatient conditions in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and FD-IBS overlap."
Multifractal analysis of human canine teeth at nano scale: atomic force microscopy studies,"The aim of the present study is to explore the 3-D micromorphology of human canine teeth materials using multifractal analysis through atomic force microscopy (AFM). The 3-D surfaces of ten extracted canine teeth of a group of 40 year old men were studied (enamel, inter enamel, inter dentin, and cementum) by AFM images in tapping mode and on square areas of 1 μm × 1 μm (512 × 512 points). The AFM images and surface multifractal analysis confirm the dependency of surface micromorphology to their structure–property of these materials across the length scales of the teeth structural architecture. Surface statistical parameters and hence, multifractal approach have been considered as reliable and sensitive tools for quantifying the 3-D surface microtexture changes of human canine teeth materials. The surface of inter dentin had the most irregular topography (the width spectrum Δα = 2.8361, value bigger than all the other Δα sample values), while the most regular topography (the width spectrum Δα = 2.6804, value lower than all the other sample values) was found in cementum. It has been concluded that multifractal analyses can be used as mathematical tools to explore the 3-D micromorphology of human canine teeth materials."
Dynamic Characteristics of Deep Dolomite Under One-Dimensional Static and Dynamic Loads,"The failure characteristics of rock subjected to impact disturbance under one-dimensional static axial compression are helpful for studying the problems of pillar instability and rock burst in deep, high geostress surrounding rock under blasting disturbances. Improved split Hopkinson pressure bar equipment was used for one-dimensional dynamic–static combined impact tests of deep-seated dolomite specimens under axial compression levels of 0, 12, 24, and 36 MPa. The experimental results demonstrate that the dolomite specimens exhibit strong brittleness. The dynamic strength always maintains a strong positive correlation with the strain rate when the axial compression is fixed; when the strain rate is close, the dynamic elasticity modulus and peak strength of the specimens first increase and then decrease with the increase in axial compression, and the peak value appears at 24 MPa. The impact resistance of specimens can be enhanced when the axial compression is 12 or 24 MPa, but when it increases to 36 MPa, the damage inside the specimen begins to cause damage to the dynamic rock strength. Prior to the rock macroscopic failure, the axial static load changes the rock structure state, and it can store strain energy or cause irreversible damage."
Papal visits and abortions: evidence from Italy,"We investigate the impact of papal visits to Italian provinces on abortions from 1979 to 2012. Using administrative data, we find a 10–20% decrease in the number of abortions that commences in the 3rd month and persists until the 14th month after the visits. However, we find no significant change in the number of live births. A decline in unintended pregnancies best explains our results. Papal visits generate intense local media coverage, and likely make salient the Catholic Church’s stance against abortions. We show that papal visits lead to increased church attendance, and that the decline in abortions is greater when the Pope mentions abortion in his speeches."
FCAA special issue–In memory of late professor Wen Chen (FCAA–Volume 22–6–2019),
Dispersion analysis for wave equations with fractional Laplacian loss operators,"Several wave equations for power-law attenuation have a spatial fractional derivative in the loss term. Both one-sided and two-sided spatial fractional derivatives can give causal solutions and a phase velocity dispersion which satisfies the Kramers–Kronig relation. The Chen–Holm and the Treeby–Cox equations both have the two-sided fractional Laplacian derivative, but only the latter satisfies this relation. There also exists several seemingly different expressions for the phase velocity for these equations and it is shown here that they are approximately equivalent. Causality of the Chen–Holm equation has also been a topic of some discussion and it is found that despite the lack of agreement with the Kramers–Kronig relation, it is still causal."
A time-space Hausdorff derivative model for anomalous transport in porous media,
Discovering a universal variable-order fractional model for turbulent Couette flow using a physics-informed neural network.,"The first fractional model for Reynolds stresses in wall-bounded turbulent flows was proposed by Wen Chen [2]. Here, we extend this formulation by allowing the fractional order α(y) of the model to vary with the distance from the wall (y) for turbulent Couette flow. Using available direct numerical simulation (DNS) data, we formulate an inverse problem for α(y) and design a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to obtain the fractional order. Surprisingly, we found a universal scaling law for α(y+), where y+ is the non-dimensional distance from the wall in wall units. Therefore, we obtain a variable-order fractional model that can be used at any Reynolds number to predict the mean velocity profile and Reynolds stresses with accuracy better than 1%."

LINE-1 ORF2p expression is nearly imperceptible in human cancers,"Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1, L1) is the major driver of mobile DNA activity in modern humans. When expressed, LINE-1 loci produce bicistronic transcripts encoding two proteins essential for retrotransposition, ORF1p and ORF2p. Many types of human cancers are characterized by L1 promoter hypomethylation, L1 transcription, L1 ORF1p protein expression, and somatic L1 retrotransposition. ORF2p encodes the endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities required for L1 retrotransposition. Its expression is poorly characterized in human tissues and cell lines."
Profiling of the germline mutation BRCA1: p.Ile1845fs in a large cohort of Han Chinese breast cancer,"Breast cancer is a one of the malignant carcinomas partially caused by genetic risk factors. Germline BRCA1 gene mutations are reportedly associated with breast cancers. Identification of BRCA1 mutations greatly improves the preventive strategies and management of breast cancer. The aim of our study was to investigate the frequency of the deleterious BRCA1: p.Ile1845fs variant in breast carcinomas, as well as the correlation between p.Ile1845fs variant with clinicopathological parameters and clinical outcomes."
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound findings of adult renal cell carcinoma associated with Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusion: comparison with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma,To investigate the contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) findings of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) associated with Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusion (Xp11.2/TFE3) in adult patients by comparison with those of clear cell RCC (ccRCC) and papillary RCC (pRCC).
"Rapid, efficient, and economical synthesis of PET tracers in a droplet microreactor: application to O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([18F]FET)","Conventional scale production of small batches of PET tracers (e.g. for preclinical imaging) is an inefficient use of resources. Using O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([18F]FET), we demonstrate that simple microvolume radiosynthesis techniques can improve the efficiency of production by consuming tiny amounts of precursor, and maintaining high molar activity of the tracers even with low starting activity."
Soil replacement combined with subsoiling improves cotton yields,"Long-term rotary tillage has led to the deterioration of cotton production in northern China. This deterioration is due to the disturbance of topsoil, a dense plough pan at the 20–50 cm depth, and the decreased water storage capacity. A 2-yr field experiment was performed from 2014 to 2015 to explore a feasible soil tillage approach to halting the deterioration. The experiment consisted of four treatments: replacing the topsoil from the 0–15 cm layer with the subsoil from the 15–30 cm layer (T1); replacing the topsoil from the 0–20 cm layer with the subsoil from the 20–40 cm layer and subsoiling at the 40–55 cm layer (T2); replacing the topsoil from the 0–20 cm layer with the subsoil from the 20–40 cm layer and subsoiling at the 40–70 cm layer (T3); and conventional surface rotary tillage within 15 cm as the control (CK)."
Introduction to the standard reference data of electron energy loss spectra and their database: eel.geri.re.kr,"Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) is an analytical technique that can provide the structural, physical and chemical information of materials. The EELS spectra can be obtained by combining with TEM at sub-nanometer spatial resolution. However, EELS spectral information can’t be obtained easily because in order to interpret EELS spectra, we need to refer to and/or compare many reference data with each other. And in addition to that, we should consider the different experimental variables used to produce each data. Therefore, reliable and easily interpretable EELS standard reference data are needed."

The effect of three-dimensional cultured adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell–conditioned medium and the antiaging effect of cosmetic products containing the medium,"Recently, investigators have been trying to apply the by-products as well as stem cells themselves to various fields such as pharmaceuticals, medical devices, quasi-drug, cosmetis, etc. We aimed to comfirm the anti-senescence effect of 3D cultured adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell–conditioned medium (3D cultured ADMSCs-CM) and develop them as cosmetic raw materials for anti-aging purposes."
Availability Analysis of a Repairable Series-Parallel System with Redundant Dependency,"This paper investigates the steady-state availability of a repairable series-parallel system with redundant dependency. The different types of components and repairmen are taken into account, the failure rate of the operating component varies as the number of other failed components and the repair rate of the failed component is constant in each parallel redundant subsystem. To quantify the redundant dependency, a modified failure dependence function is introduced to determine the failure rate of the components in each subsystem. Markov theory and matrix analysis method are used to get the steady-state probability vector of each subsystem and the steady-state availability of the entire system. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the obtained results and to analyze the effect of redundant dependency class on the system availability."
"Once bitten, twice shy? Lessons learned from an experiment to liberalize price regulations for dental care","In 2012, The Netherlands established the so-called “free market experiment”, which allowed providers of dental care to set the prices for their dental services themselves. The introduction of market mechanisms is intended to improve the quality of care and to contribute to cost containment, but increasing health expenditures for citizens have been observed in this context. Using large-volume health insurance claims data and exploiting the 2012 experiment in Dutch dental care, we identified the effects of a liberalization of service prices. Using pooled regression with individual fixed effects, we analyzed changes in utilization patterns of prevention-oriented dental services in response to the experiment as well as the elasticities in demand in response to variations in out-of-pocket (OOP) prices. We found substantial increases in prices and patients’ OOP contributions for dental services following the liberalization with differences in increases between types of services. In response to the experiment, the proportion of treatment sessions containing preventive-oriented services decreased significantly by 3.4% among adults and by 5.3% for children and adolescents. Estimates of short-run price elasticities of demand for different services point towards differences in price sensitivity. One potential explanation for the observed variations in prices and utilization could be different extents of asymmetric information for first-stage and follow-on services. Price liberalization seems to have affected the composition of treatment sessions towards a decreasing use of preventive services, suggesting a shift in the reason for seeing a dental care provider from a regular-preventive perspective to a symptom-based restorative approach."
Precious metal recoveries in secondary copper smelting with high-alumina slags,"Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) represents a significant urban resource for precious metals. To maximize the recoveries and sustainable use of these metals, their behavior needs to be characterized in the secondary copper smelting of WEEE. The current study experimentally determined the distributions of gold, silver, platinum and palladium between copper alloy and FeOx–SiO2–Al2O3/FeOx–SiO2–Al2O3–CaO slags (LCu/s[M] = [M]Copper/[M]Slag) over the oxygen partial pressure range of 10−5 – 10−10 atm at 1300 °C. In addition, the equilibria of copper alloy, slag and Al–Fe spinel system are presented and discussed. The experiments were conducted employing an equilibration—drop-quenching technique followed by major element analysis with Electron Probe MicroAnalysis (EPMA) and trace element analysis with sensitive Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The results showed that the distribution coefficient of silver increased from 10 to 103 as a function of decreasing oxygen partial pressure. For gold, platinum and palladium, the distribution coefficients were at minimum 105. Lime addition improved the recovery of silver notably and had a small positive effect on gold recovery into copper. Overall, the precious metals can be recovered very efficiently in copper alloy via secondary copper smelting with alumina-rich iron-silicate slags."
Electro-fluidic timer for event control in paper-based devices,"In this paper, we present a simple yet smart electro-fluidic platform that enables automatic time control in a very affordable and simple manner. The system is based on the electric detection of a fluid front when it crosses a particular area of a paper strip. The detection can be used to trigger the sequential activation or deactivation of different electronic modules (heating of molecular diagnostics, time interval detection, or readout of test results) with an accuracy within the range of minutes. The whole system is implemented with a few number of discrete electronic components such as transistors, resistors and capacitors that, if required, can be totally fabricated using printed electronics technology. This platform opens new possible applications for paper-based point-of care (POC) diagnostic devices and enables the possibility of these devices to introduce time control functions without the need for any external instrumentation and human action."
"Service Science: Past, Present, and Future","Research in Service Science has evolved significantly for the past decade, and the current research reviews research in this area. Specifically, I investigated research from the past, present, which focused on the definition of topics of Service Science research, and discuss future research directions for the topic. In earlier years, research in Service Science was defined as a convergence discipline for service innovation, and the research was based on service-dominant logic against goods-dominant logic. These narrow definitions and studies are not consistent with the essence of the service, and are not enough to lead the tremendous changes in the current economy where service is dominant. Therefore, I have incorporated the essence of service to redefine Service Science as a new discipline. Service studies that renew the paradigm of existing disciplines, including profound research on the nature of human life, are defined in the new Service Science discipline. Topics such as service theory/philosophy, service economy/society, service management, service engineering, service technology, and service design are defined as specific topics for research in Service Science. In the near future, I expect more active research in service theory/philosophy, and therefore, I provide results from primary research in this area. We expect this to be a foundation for future research in this area. Taken together, we believe Service Science would be one of the new disciplines that would lead the future."
The Effect of Social Network Centrality on Knowledge Sharing,"Many companies have been carrying out various knowledge management attempts, hoping that employees share their knowledge voluntary with other members and make synergy. From this point of view, many previous studies have explored the factors that affect individuals’ intention to share knowledge. In this study, we tried to discover the factors affecting from the roles and positions of individuals within the social network. To identify the roles and positions, we used three centrality measures (degree/closeness/betweenness) that can be calculated using Social Network Analysis (SNA). The research findings showed that the network roles and positions of individuals significantly affect their knowledge sharing intentions within and outside the teams. Since the high degree centrality provides a member with the position as a leader or a hub, one tries to actively participate in knowledge sharing within and outside the team in order to maintain the network position. A member who can quickly interact with many other members within a team (high closeness centrality) is more interested in knowledge sharing within the team than knowledge sharing outside the team. Since betweenness centrality offers a member various resources outside the team, a member who has high betweenness centrality plays a crucial role in disseminating and regulating knowledge among multiple teams. The members who play important roles in the network want to engage in knowledge sharing activities more actively than other members to maintain the benefits they can have in the network."

"Parental magma, magmatic stratigraphy, and reef-type PGE enrichment of the 2.44-Ga mafic-ultramafic Näränkävaara layered intrusion, Northern Finland","About 20 mafic-ultramafic layered intrusions in the northern Fennoscandian shield were emplaced during a widespread magmatic event at 2.5–2.4 Ga. The intrusions host orthomagmatic Ni-Cu-PGE and Cr-V-Ti-Fe deposits. We update the magmatic stratigraphy of the 2.44-Ga Näränkävaara mafic-ultramafic body, northeastern Finland, on the basis of new drill core and outcrop observations. The Näränkävaara body consists of an extensive basal dunite (1700 m thick), and a layered series comprising a peridotitic–pyroxenitic ultramafic zone (600 m thick) and a gabbronoritic–dioritic mafic zone (700 m thick). Two reversals are found in the layered series. The composition of the layered series parental magma was approximated using a previously unidentified marginal series gabbronorite. The parental magma was siliceous high-Mg basalt with high MgO, Ni, and Cr, but also high SiO2 and Zr, which suggests primary magma contamination by felsic crust. Cu/Pd ratio below that of primitive mantle implies PGE-fertility. The structural position of the marginal series indicates that the thick basal dunite represents an older wallrock for the layered intrusion. A subeconomic reef-type PGE-enriched zone is found in the border zone between the ultramafic and mafic zones and has an average thickness of 25 m with 150–250 ppb of Pt + Pd + Au. Offset-type metal distribution and high sulfide tenor (50–300 ppm Pd) and R-factor (105) suggest reef formation by sulfide saturation induced by fractional crystallization. The reef-forming process was probably interrupted by influx of magma related to the first reversal. Metal ratios suggest that this replenishing magma was PGE-depleted before emplacement."
A new approach for satisfactory pensions with no guarantees,"The increase in longevity, the ultra-low interest rates and the guarantees associated to pension benefits have put significant strain on the pension industry. Consequently, insurers need to be in a financially sound position while offering satisfactory benefits to participants. In this paper, we propose a pension design that goes beyond the idea of annuity pools and unit-linked insurance products. The purpose is to replace traditional guarantees with low volatility, mainly achieved by collective smoothing algorithms and an adequate asset management. With the aim of offering security to the insured, we discuss the optimisation of some key variables of the proposed pension product to target both a satisfactory level of the initial pension and stable pension payments over time. By combining such well-known products as unit-linked and annuities, we show that it is possible to design a pension product with both high-expected return and low risk for the policyholder. However, differently than in the classical unit-linked framework, we do not allow the individuals to choose the underlying funds. Instead, the funds are under the surveillance of an insurance company’s professional risk management, which induces better informed decisions."
Culture-independent and culture-dependent analyses of the bacterial community in the phycosphere of cyanobloom-forming Microcystis aeruginosa,"Confocal and scanning electron microscopic observations have previously shown the strong bacterial association of Microcystis aeruginosa cells on their surfaces. DNA-based analyses of the associated bacterial communities were carried out using two M. aeruginosa strains grown in the laboratory and eight newly collected cyanobacterial bloom samples. M. aeruginosa was the most predominant species (66–100%) within the phylum Cyanobacteria. Rhizobium, Hydrogenophaga and Brevundimonas species were commonly found, and Flavobacterium species were present in all the cyanobacterial bloom samples. In total, 396 colonies from various samples were screened, revealing that most culturable bacteria belonged to the class Alphaproteobacteria (19%) including Rhizobium, Brevundimonas, and Porphyrobacter species. The genetic variation among the M. aeruginosa strains and different habitat conditions may have led to the presence of distinct bacterial populations among the tested samples. Among all the tested seven culturable isolates, Rhizobium sp. MK23 showed the best growth-promotion effect on the axenic M. aeruginosa strains. H2O2 was observed to be produced during the growth of M. aeruginosa PCC7806 under light conditions, this strain was more resistant to H2O2 when associated with Rhizobium sp. MK23. Our data suggested that Rhizobium species along with other associated bacteria might help the growth of M. aeruginosa by decomposing H2O2 under the aerobic growing conditions."
An inhibitor of apoptosis protein (EsIAP1) from Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis regulates apoptosis through inhibiting the activity of EsCaspase-3/7-1,"Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) maintain the balance between cell proliferation and cell death by inhibiting caspase activities and mediating immune responses. In the present study, a homolog of IAP (designated as EsIAP1) was identified from Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis. EsIAP1 consisted of 451 amino acids containing two baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains with the conserved Cx2 Cx6 Wx3 Dx5 Hx6 C motifs. EsIAP1 mRNA was expressed in various tissues and its expression level in hemocytes increased significantly (p < 0.01) at 12–48 h after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. In the hemocytes, EsIAP1 protein was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. The hydrolytic activity of recombinant EsCaspase-3/7-1 against the substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA decreased after incubation with rEsIAP1. Moreover, rEsIAP1 could directly combine with rEsCaspase-3/7-1 in vitro. After EsIAP1 was interfered by dsRNA, the mRNA expression and the hydrolytic activity of EsCaspase-3/7-1 increased significantly, which was 2.26-fold (p < 0.05) and 1.71-fold (p < 0.05) compared to that in the dsGFP group, respectively. These results collectively demonstrated that EsIAP1 might play an important role in apoptosis pathway by regulating the activity of EsCaspase-3/7-1 in E. sinensis."
Optimizing the role of impact ionization in conventional insulators,"A mechanism for multiple carrier generation through impact ionization (IA) proposed earlier for bulk systems of strongly correlated insulators is generalized to the case of conventional insulators that contain localized bands a few eV above and below the highest occupied band. Specifically, we study the case of hybridization of localized orbitals with more dispersive bands near the Fermi level, where the generated multiple carriers, which ultimately decay to the edges of the dispersive bands by means of IA processes, acquire lighter mass and this could allow their more efficient separation before recombination. We argue that this may be applicable to the case of halide perovskites and it could be one of the reasons for their observed photovoltaic efficiency. We discuss the criteria one should use to uncover the appropriate material in order to harvest the optimum effect of IA for the spectrum of the solar photon energy distribution."
Transcription factor Tlx1 marks a subset of lymphoid tissue organizer-like mesenchymal progenitor cells in the neonatal spleen,"The spleen is comprised of spatially distinct compartments whose functions, such as immune responses and removal of aged red blood cells, are tightly controlled by the non-hematopoietic stromal cells that provide regionally-restricted signals to properly activate hematopoietic cells residing in each area. However, information regarding the ontogeny and relationships of the different stromal cell types remains limited. Here we have used in vivo lineage tracing analysis and in vitro mesenchymal stromal cell assays and found that Tlx1, a transcription factor essential for embryonic spleen organogenesis, marks neonatal stromal cells that are selectively localized in the spleen and retain mesenchymal progenitor potential to differentiate into mature follicular dendritic cells, fibroblastic reticular cells and marginal reticular cells. Furthermore, by establishing a novel three-dimensional cell culture system that enables maintenance of Tlx1-expressing cells in vitro, we discovered that signals from the lymphotoxin β receptor and TNF receptor promote differentiation of these cells to express MAdCAM-1, CCL19 and CXCL13, representative functional molecules expressed by different subsets of mature stromal cells in the spleen. Taken together, these findings indicate that mesenchymal progenitor cells expressing Tlx1 are a subset of lymphoid tissue organizer-like cells selectively found in the neonatal spleen."
A prospective three-year follow-up study on the clinical significance of anti-neuronal antibodies in acute psychiatric disorders,"The clinical significance of anti-neuronal antibodies for psychiatric disorders is controversial. We investigated if a positive anti-neuronal antibody status at admission to acute psychiatric inpatient care was associated with a more severe neuropsychiatric phenotype and more frequent abnormalities during clinical work-up three years later. Patients admitted to acute psychiatric inpatient care who tested positive for N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2) and/or glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) antibodies (n = 24) were age – and sex matched with antibody-negative patients (1:2) from the same cohort (n = 48). All patients were invited to follow-up including psychometric testing (e.g. Symptom Checklist-90-Revised), serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling, EEG and 3 T brain MRI. Twelve antibody-positive (ab+) and 26 antibody-negative (ab−) patients consented to follow-up. Ab+ patients had more severe symptoms of depression (p = 0.03), psychoticism (p = 0.04) and agitation (p = 0.001) compared to ab− patients. There were no differences in CSF analysis (n = 6 ab+/12 ab−), EEG (n = 7 ab+/19 ab−) or brain MRI (n = 7 ab+/17 ab−) between the groups. In conclusion, anti-neuronal ab+ status during index admission was associated with more severe symptoms of depression, psychoticism and agitation at three-year follow-up. This supports the hypothesis that anti-neuronal antibodies may be of clinical significance in a subgroup of psychiatric patients."
The chick pallium displays divergent expression patterns of chick orthologues of mammalian neocortical deep layer-specific genes,"The avian pallium is organised into clusters of neurons and does not have layered structures such as those seen in the mammalian neocortex. The evolutionary relationship between sub-regions of avian pallium and layers of mammalian neocortex remains unclear. One hypothesis, based on the similarities in neural connections of the motor output neurons that project to sub-pallial targets, proposed the cell-type homology between brainstem projection neurons in neocortex layers 5 or 6 (L5/6) and those in the avian arcopallium. Recent studies have suggested that gene expression patterns are associated with neural connection patterns, which supports the cell-type homology hypothesis. However, a limited number of genes were used in these studies. Here, we showed that chick orthologues of mammalian L5/6-specific genes, nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 2 and connective tissue growth factor, were strongly expressed in the arcopallium. However, other chick orthologues of L5/6-specific genes were primarily expressed in regions other than the arcopallium. Our results do not fully support the cell-type homology hypothesis. This suggests that the cell types of brainstem projection neurons are not conserved between the avian arcopallium and the mammalian neocortex L5/6. Our findings may help understand the evolution of pallium between birds and mammals."
Innate immune responses through Toll-like receptor 3 require human-antigen-R-mediated Atp6v0d2 mRNA stabilization,"Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) recognizes double-stranded RNA derived from virus and its synthetic analogue, polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)]. Upon poly(I:C) binding, TLR3 activates transcription factors to express inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon. TLR3 is located in the endosomes and its recognition of poly(I:C) and activation of downstream signaling is regulated by endosomal acidification. However, the mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation in TLR3-mediated innate responses remains unclear. Here, we focused on Human antigen R (HuR, also known as ELAVL1) that recognizes and binds to the 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) of target mRNAs, thereby protecting them from mRNA degradation, and found that HuR-deficient murine macrophage cells showed significantly reduced Ifnb1 mRNA expression after poly(I:C) stimulation. HuR-deficient cells also showed a marked reduction in the expression of Atp6v0d2 mRNA, which encodes a subunit of vacuolar-type H+ ATPase (V-ATPase), and therefore reduced endosomal acidification. HuR associated with the 3′UTR of Atp6v0d2 mRNA and the stability of Atp6v0d2 mRNA was maintained by its association with HuR. Taken together, our results suggest that HuR stabilizes Atp6v0d2 mRNA, which is required for the TLR3-mediated innate immune responses."
Allo-HSCT recipients with invasive fungal disease and ongoing immunosuppression have a high risk for developing tuberculosis,"Patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are at high risk of acquiring tuberculosis (TB) due to a status of immunosuppression. We conducted a nested case control study to investigate the incidence and risk factors for TB after allo-HSCT. Between 2012 and 2017, 730 consecutive allo-HSCT recipients were enrolled, and 14 patients (1.92%) were diagnosed with TB. Relatively, 54 allo-HSCT recipients were selected as control. Patients who suffered TB had a significantly higher 3-year non-relapse mortality rate than the control group (30.36% vs 5.39%, P < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, invasive fungal disease (HR 4.87, 95% CI 1.39–17.09), treatment with a relatively high dose of prednisone (HR 10.34, 95% CI 1.12–95.47) and treatment with tacrolimus (HR 4.79, 95% CI 1.18–19.44) were identified independent risk factors for TB occurrence post allo-HSCT (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, donor type, dose and type of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) administrated, as well as treatment intensity, did not alter the incidence of TB. Therefore, allo-HSCT recipients with unexplained fever, especially those who suffer from invasive fungal disease and ongoing immunosuppression with a relatively high dose of prednisone or tacrolimus, are at a high-risk of developing active TB. Closely Monitoring TB occurrence, making a timely diagnosis and administering the proper treatment may be beneficial to those high-risk patients."
Predicting the flow stress and dominant yielding mechanisms: analytical models based on discrete dislocation plasticity,"Dislocations are the carriers of plasticity in crystalline materials. Their collective interaction behavior is dependent on the strain rate and sample size. In small specimens, details of the nucleation process are of particular importance. In the present work, discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations are performed to investigate the dominant yielding mechanisms in single crystalline copper pillars with diameters ranging from 100 to 800 nm. Based on our simulations with different strain rates and sample size, we observe a transition of the relevant nucleation mechanism from “dislocation multiplication” to “surface nucleation”. Two physics-based analytical models are established to quantitatively predict this transition, showing a good agreement for different strain rates with our DDD simulation data and with available experimental data. Therefore, the proposed analytical models help to understand the interplay between different physical parameters and nucleation mechanisms and are well suitable to estimate the material strength for different material properties and under given loading conditions."
Therapeutic effects of statins against lung adenocarcinoma via p53 mutant-mediated apoptosis,"The p53 gene is an important tumour suppressor gene. Mutant p53 genes account for about half of all lung cancer cases. There is increasing evidence for the anti-tumour effects of statins via inhibition of the mevalonate pathway. We retrospectively investigated the correlation between statin use and lung cancer prognosis using the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database, mainly focusing on early-stage lung cancer. This study reports the protective effects of statin use in early-stage lung cancer patients regardless of chemotherapy. Statin treatments reduced the 5-year mortality (odds ratio, 0.43; P < 0.001) in this population-based study. Significantly higher levels of cellular apoptosis, inhibited cell growth, and regulated lipid raft content were observed in mutant p53 lung cancer cells treated with simvastatin. Further, simvastatin increased the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway, promotes mutant p53 protein degradation, and decreased motile activity in lung cancer cells with p53 missense mutations. These data suggest that statin use in selected lung cancer patients may have clinical benefits."
Ferroelectric Tunneling Junctions Based on Aluminum Oxide/ Zirconium-Doped Hafnium Oxide for Neuromorphic Computing,"Ferroelectric tunneling junctions (FTJs) with tunable tunneling electroresistance (TER) are promising for many emerging applications, including non-volatile memories and neurosynaptic computing. One of the key challenges in FTJs is the balance between the polarization value and the tunneling current. In order to achieve a sizable on-current, the thickness of the ferroelectric layer needs to be scaled down below 5 nm. However, the polarization in these ultra-thin ferroelectric layers is very small, which leads to a low tunneling electroresistance (TER) ratio. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a new type of FTJ based on metal/Al2O3/Zr-doped HfO2/Si structure. The interfacial Al2O3 layer and silicon substrate enable sizable TERs even when the thickness of Zr-doped HfO2 (HZO) is above 10 nm. We found that F-N tunneling dominates at read voltages and that the polarization switching in HZO can alter the effective tunneling barrier height and tune the tunneling resistance. The FTJ synapses based on Al2O3/HZO stacks show symmetric potentiation/depression characteristics and widely tunable conductance. We also show that spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can be harnessed from HZO based FTJs. These novel FTJs will have high potential in non-volatile memories and neural network applications."
Colloidal Liquid Crystals Confined to Synthetic Tactoids,"When a liquid crystal forming particles are confined to a spatial volume with dimensions comparable to that of their own size, they face a complex trade-off between their global tendency to align and the local constraints imposed by the boundary conditions. This interplay may lead to a non-trivial orientational patterns that strongly depend on the geometry of the confining volume. This novel regime of liquid crystalline behavior can be probed with colloidal particles that are macro-aggregates of biomolecules. Here we study director fields of filamentous fd-viruses in quasi-2D lens-shaped chambers that mimic the shape of tactoids, the nematic droplets that form during isotropic-nematic phase separation. By varying the size and aspect ratio of the chambers we force these particles into confinements that vary from circular to extremely spindle-like shapes and observe the director field using fluorescence microscopy. In the resulting phase diagram, next to configurations predicted earlier for 3D tactoids, we find a number of novel configurations. Using Monte Carlo Simulations, we show that these novel states are metastable, yet long-lived. Their multiplicity can be explained by the co-existence of multiple dynamic relaxation pathways leading to the final stable states."
[18F]SPA-RQ/PET Study of NK1 receptors in the Whole Body of Guinea Pig and Rat,"There is a substantial interest in the development of NK1 substance P antagonists as potential treatments for various neuropsychiatric and somatic disorders. The aim of this study was to determine whether [18F]SPA-RQ can be utilized as a tool for studying the whole body distribution and function of NK1 receptors in preclinical settings. The compound was injected into guinea pigs with or without premedication with a NK1 receptor antagonist (NK1A-2). For comparison, we included two rats in the study, as the affinity of antagonists for NK1 receptors is known to vary between species. The whole body biodistribution of the tracer was determined at several time points. The tracer showed specific binding in organs compatible with the known location of NK1-receptors. Premedication with a NK1 antagonist led to an inhibited uptake of [18F]SPA-RQ in several organs of guinea pigs, notably intestine, pancreas, urinary bladder, uterus, skin and lung. Specific binding was also seen in both cortex and striatum. In contrast, negligible specific binding was observed in the rat brain with [18F]SPA-RQ, whereas the tracer uptake in peripheral tissues was similar to that seen in guinea pigs. We conclude that [18F]SPA-RQ/PET is a useful tool to study the distribution and function of peripherally located NK1 receptors e.g. in different disease models."
Molecular Geometry Prediction using a Deep Generative Graph Neural Network,"A molecule’s geometry, also known as conformation, is one of a molecule’s most important properties, determining the reactions it participates in, the bonds it forms, and the interactions it has with other molecules. Conventional conformation generation methods minimize hand-designed molecular force field energy functions that are often not well correlated with the true energy function of a molecule observed in nature. They generate geometrically diverse sets of conformations, some of which are very similar to the lowest-energy conformations and others of which are very different. In this paper, we propose a conditional deep generative graph neural network that learns an energy function by directly learning to generate molecular conformations that are energetically favorable and more likely to be observed experimentally in data-driven manner. On three large-scale datasets containing small molecules, we show that our method generates a set of conformations that on average is far more likely to be close to the corresponding reference conformations than are those obtained from conventional force field methods. Our method maintains geometrical diversity by generating conformations that are not too similar to each other, and is also computationally faster. We also show that our method can be used to provide initial coordinates for conventional force field methods. On one of the evaluated datasets we show that this combination allows us to combine the best of both methods, yielding generated conformations that are on average close to reference conformations with some very similar to reference conformations."
"Ferric Carboxymaltose in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anaemia: an effective, safe and cost- sparing alternative to blood transfusion","Anaemia is highly prevalent in cancer patients, adversely affects quality of life and impacts survival. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, with iron deficiency being a major and potentially treatable contributor. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and economic impact of ferric carboxymaltose in chemotherapy-induced anaemia. This prospective cohort study between 2015–2016 of chemotherapy-treated patients for solid tumours, grade ≥2 anaemia and iron deficiency evaluated hematopoietic response four weeks after ferric carboxymaltose treatment. Transfusion rate of all cancer patients treated at our ambulatory unit during the two-year study period (2015–2016) was compared to a retrospective cohort (2013–2014) who received blood transfusion only. Between 2015–2016, 99 patients were included and treated with ferric carboxymaltose, the majority of whom (n = 81) had relative iron deficiency. Mean haemoglobin concentrations improved from 9.2 [6.7–10.8] g/dL to 10.6 [7.8–14.2] g/dL four weeks after treatment. A 26% reduction in the transfusion rate was observed from control retrospective to the prospective study group including ferric carboxymaltose treated patients [relative risk 0.74 (95% CI:0.66–0.83)]. The cost analysis showed a benefit for the use of ferric carboxymaltose in chemotherapy-induced anaemia. This study shows that ferric carboxymaltose is an effective, cost-saving support treatment, reducing the need for allogeneic transfusions saving blood units which are a limited resource."
"Physical working conditions and subsequent disability retirement due to any cause, mental disorders and musculoskeletal diseases: does the risk vary by common mental disorders?","Physical work exposures and common mental disorders (CMD) have been linked to increased risk of work disability, but their joint associations with disability retirement due to any cause, mental disorders or musculoskeletal diseases have not been examined."
Significant influencing factors and practical solutions in improvement of clinical nursing services: a Delphi study,Clinical services evaluation with specific indicators are very helpful to identify improvable points. This study was conducted to analyze the factors affecting the quality of clinical nursing services and offer practical solutions for accreditation of clinical nursing services.
Infection prevention preparedness and practices for female sterilization services within primary care facilities in Northern India,"In 2014, 16 women died following female sterilization operations in Bilaspur, a district in central India. In addition to those 16 deaths, 70 women were hospitalized for critical conditions (Sharma, Lancet 384,2014). Although the government of India’s guidelines for female sterilization mandate infection prevention practices, little is known about the extent of infection prevention preparedness and practice during sterilization procedures that are part of the country’s primary health care services. This study assesses facility readiness for infection prevention and adherence to infection prevention practices during female sterilization procedures in rural northern India."
Pneumonia prevention in the elderly patients: the other sides,"Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality from infection in elderly patients. The increased frequency of pneumonia among elderly subjects can be explained by the physiological changes linked to the progressive aging of the respiratory tree and the diminished immunological response. A spiral of event leads to frailty, infection and possible death; preventing pneumonia consists of controlling the risk factors. Dysphagia, which is associated with malnutrition and dehydration, is recognized as one of the major pathophysiological mechanism leading to pneumonia and its screening is crucial for the pneumonia risk assessment. The impairment in the oropharyngeal reflexes results in stagnation of foreign material in the lateral cavities of the pharynx which may then get aspirated repeatedly in the lungs and cause pneumonia. Pneumonia prevention starts with lifestyle modifications such as alcohol and tobacco cessation. A careful review of the risk–benefit of the prescribed medication is critical and adaptation may be required in elders with multiple morbidities. Respiratory physiotherapy and mobilization improve the functional status and hence may help reduce the risk of pneumonia. Maintaining teeth and masticatory efficiency is important if malnutrition and its consequences are to be avoided. Daily oral hygiene and regular professional removal of oral biofilm can prevent the onset of periodontitis and can avoid an oral environment favoring the colonization of respiratory pathogens than can then be aspirated into the lungs."
Supercapsular percutaneously-assisted total hip (SuperPath) versus posterolateral total hip arthroplasty in bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head: a pilot clinical trial,"The supercapsular percutaneously-assisted total hip arthroplasty (SuperPath) was proposed to be minimally invasive and tissue sparing with possible superior postoperative outcomes to traditional approaches of total hip arthroplasty (THA). Here, we compared the short-term outcomes of staged THA with the SuperPath or through posterolateral approach (PLA) for bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH)."
Probing bulk viscous matter-dominated model in Brans-Dicke theory,"We explore a matter-dominated model with bulk viscosity in Brans-Dicke theory to interpret the observed cosmic accelerating expansion phenomena. We obtain the exact solution of the field equations by taking constant bulk viscous coefficient (which potentially could explain the present accelerated expansion of the Universe) and Brans-Dicke scalar field proportional to some power of the scale factor. The model is studied statistically using the available astronomical data and then compare using the tools taken from information criterion. Using the best-fit values of model parameters we find that the model shows transition from decelerated phase to accelerated phase. The effective equation of state parameter is within the quintessence region (\(-1\leq \omega <0\)). Thus, the model shows quintessence behavior and approaches to \(\varLambda \)CDM model in late time. It does not cross the phantom divide line and hence it is free from big-rip singularity. The viscous model also alleviates the age problem. We discuss two diagnostic parameters, namely statefinder and \(Om(z)\) and compare the model with the existing models by plotting the trajectories. We also apply Akaike information criterion \((\mathit{AIC})\) and Bayesian information criterion \((\mathit{BIC})\) to discriminate the viscous model based on the penalization associated to the number of parameters. The analyses based on the \(\mathit{AIC}\) indicates that there is less support for the viscous model when compared to the \(\varLambda \)CDM model, while those based on the \(\mathit{BIC}\) indicates that there is strong evidence against it in favor of the \(\varLambda \)CDM model."
Effect of Ni ion release on the cells in contact with NiTi alloys,"Nickel-titanium alloys have been used in medical applications for several years; however, biocompatibility of the material remains controversial. In the present study, the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in contact with the nitinol used in two different heat treatment  surface modifications—helium and hydrogen. The amount of Ni ions released from these alloys in contact with HUVEC was measured in media and in the cells by ICP-MS. An increased release of Ni ions was detected in He alloy compared with H2 alloy modification with an elevation with the metal exposition duration (24 h vs. 72 h). The cells contained the Ni ions in both selected alloy modifications with the lower levels in H2 alloys. To evaluate the potential of multiple metal applications, similar values were observed in media and in cell suspension for all surface modification combinations. The model analysis of effect of metal ion release on distant cells in the body showed that the concentration is interestingly similar to concentrations in cells in direct contact with the metal alloy. The cells are able to regulate the concentration of Ni ions within the cell. According to our best knowledge, the study for the first time describes the presence of Ni ions released from nitinol directly in the cells. In the case of the H2 modification, the lowest levels of Ni ions were detected both in medium and in the cells, which likely increases the biocompatibility of the nitinol alloy."
"Ferulic acid prevents oxidative stress, inflammation, and liver injury via upregulation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling in methotrexate-induced rats","Liver injury is one of the adverse effects of methotrexate (MTX). Ferulic acid (FA) is an antioxidant phytochemical that confers hepatoprotective efficacy; however, its effect against MTX hepatotoxicity remains unexplored. This study investigated the role of FA in modulating oxidative stress, inflammation, Nrf2/HO-1 signaling, and PPARγ in MTX-administered rats. Following oral FA supplementation for 15 days, rats received a single dose of MTX at day 16 and samples were collected at day 19. MTX provoked multiple histological manifestations, including degenerative changes, steatosis, inflammatory cells infiltration and hemorrhage, and altered serum transaminases, bilirubin, and albumin. Reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and nitric oxide were increased in the liver of rats that received MTX. FA prevented all histological alterations, ameliorated liver function markers, suppressed oxidative stress, and boosted antioxidants in MTX-induced rats. FA reduced serum TNF-α and IL-1β, and hepatic NF-κB p65, Bax, and caspase-3, whereas increased Bcl-2, Nrf2, NQO1, HO-1, and PPARγ. In conclusion, FA prevented MTX hepatotoxicity by activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling and PPARγ, and attenuating oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death."
Characterization of the copper resistance mechanism and bioremediation potential of an Acinetobacter calcoaceticus strain isolated from copper mine sludge,"Bioremediation is one of the most effective ways for removal of heavy metals and restoration of contaminated sites. This study investigated the copper (Cu) resistance mechanism and bioremediation potential of an Acinetobacter calcoaceticus strain KW3 isolated from sludge of Cu mine. The effect of Cu concentrations on the bacterial growth, biomass, and adsorption capacity, as well as the effect of contact time on the adsorption process was evaluated in a batch biosorption test. The strain exhibited strong tolerance of Cu, and the minimal inhibitory concentration was around 400 mg Cu2+ L−1, at which the maximum adsorption capacity was 14.1 mg g−1 dry cell mass. Cell walls and intracellular soluble components adsorbed 51.2% and 46.6% of Cu2+, respectively, suggesting that the strain not only adsorbed Cu2+ on the surface but also metastasized ions into cells. The adsorption and kinetic data were well fitted with Freundlich isotherm and Pseudo-second-order models, suggesting that cell surface had a high affinity for Cu2+ and the chemisorption could be the main adsorption mechanism. Scanning electron microscope and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis revealed that hydroxyl, carboxylic, amide, sulfate, and phosphate on cell walls might be involved in the biosorption process. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry revealed that some oxidoreductases, in particular Cu resistance protein A (CopA) expression levels, were upregulated. Antioxidant defense and P1B-type ATPases CopA efflux might play a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and intracellular detoxification. To our knowledge, this is the first time that Cu resistance mechanisms, especially intracellular enzymatic mechanisms, were identified in an A. calcoaceticus KW3 strain."
An environmental assessment model of construction and demolition waste based on system dynamics: a case study in Guangzhou,"At present, China is in the rapid development stage of urbanization, and construction activities are becoming more frequent. This is accompanied by a large amount of construction and demolition waste (C&DW), which raises many problems with its governance, such as occupying valuable land resources, causing air pollution, and consuming raw materials. In this study, taking Guangzhou as an example, the system dynamics principle was used to establish an environmental assessment model of C&DW, and Vensim software was used to simulate and analyze the environmental, economic, and social impacts of various disposal methods of C&DW. The results showed that (1) among all waste disposal methods, landfill disposal had the highest greenhouse gas emissions. It was estimated that the greenhouse gas emissions from landfill disposal will account for 75% of the total emissions in 2030, while the greenhouse gas emissions from recycling disposal will only account for 0.5%. (2) The simulation results showed that, according to the current data, the land area occupied by waste landfills and illegal dumping in 2030 will be about 4.88 million m2, and the economic loss caused by land loss and global warming will account for 9.1% of Guangzhou’s GDP in 2030, which is equivalent to the national economy of a regional city with a less developed economy. (3) Enhanced supervision could significantly reduce the amount of illegal dumping, but its effect on landfill disposal and recycling would be very limited. According to the results of the simulation analysis, some suggestions were put forward to improve the environmental, economic, and social impact of C&DW disposal in Guangzhou."
Radical scavenging and antiproliferative effect of novel phenolic derivatives isolated from Nerium indicum against human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7)—an in silico and in vitro approach,"Multiple drug resistance and increased side effects due to allopathic drugs has warned scientific community with a global alarm to identify molecules from natural sources to combat diseases with minimum or no side effects. The present investigation was aimed to identify and isolate secondary metabolites from traditionally used Nerium indicum using conventional column chromatography which led to the isolation of two compounds, C-I (fractions NB4f1) and C-II (fractions NC13b1). Further characterized, it is elucidated using spectral data and identified as N-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-2-methoxy-2-phenyl-acetamide, molecular formula C15H15NO3, and molecular weight 257.3 (C-I) and N-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-2-phenyl-N-phenylacetyl-acetamide, molecular formula C22H19NO3, and molecular weight 345.4 (C-II). Further, the isolated compounds were investigated using in silico approach by Autodock tool with four different proteins specific for cancer and in vitro assessed cell proliferation, and apoptosis against human breast cancer MCF 7 cell line. The results of the in silico model demonstrated potent binding affinity of both compounds with the proteins representing that the isolated molecules could be a drug of choice for cancer. Further, the isolated compounds revealed significant inhibition of cell proliferation (IC50 values 21 μg/mL for C-I, 19 μg/mL for C-II) with induced apoptosis with nuclear condensation effect on the MCF 7 cells in in vitro condition even at very low concentration. Compound treatment to MCF-7 cell line represented bright fetches indicating condensed chromatins and higher level of nuclear fragmentation with DAPI staining, indicating higher cell death due to induced apoptosis and confirmed using flow cytometry analysis representing inhibition of cell proliferation at S phase."
Large eddy simulation of the hydrodynamic behavior of horizontal side jets in compound open channels with vegetated floodplain,"Understanding the hydrodynamic behavior of side jets in compound open channels with vegetated floodplain is crucial to jet dilution, sediment transport, and bank stability. Large eddy simulation was used to study horizontal side jets in compound open channels with vegetated floodplain. Predicted mean velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, and secondary currents were compared with experimental data, with a good agreement between measured and calculated data. Analyses of bed shear stress showed that vegetation in the floodplain increases the total drag and decreases bed shear stress, thus governing sediment transport and protecting the bank. The transport mechanism was quantitatively investigated by the quadrant analysis, concentration, and Reynolds flux. The ejection and sweep events were major contributors to the momentum and scalar flux transport. Analyses of concentration and Reynolds flux showed that the secondary flow influenced the spreading of the jet and the location of the concentration peaks, and the distribution of concentration and Reynolds flux did not strictly follow Fickian law in the whole region due to the effect of secondary flow on the concentration distributions. Additionally, the typical vortexes and spatiotemporal evolution of vortex structures in compound open channels, especially those near the junction between the main channel and floodplain, were successfully demonstrated."
Influence of feature rankers in the construction of molecular activity prediction models,"In the construction of activity prediction models, the use of feature ranking methods is a useful mechanism for extracting information for ranking features in terms of their significance to develop predictive models. This paper studies the influence of feature rankers in the construction of molecular activity prediction models; for this purpose, a comparative study of fourteen rankings methods for feature selection was conducted. The activity prediction models were constructed using four well-known classifiers and a wide collection of datasets. The ranking algorithms were compared considering the performance of these classifiers using different metrics and the consistency of the ranked features."
Empirical correlation for viscoelastic and viscoplastic deformation of structural planes under different normal stress conditions,"The creep behavior of rock mass, including structural plane creep and rock creep, is different from that of intact rock. It is generally recognized that the characteristics of structural planes play a crucial role in such creep behavior. However, currently there are few comprehensive systematic studies on the rheological properties of structural planes, including experimental and theoretical aspects. In this paper, marble with green schist’s weak structural planes from the Jinping secondary hydropower station were selected as samples, and multi-stage loading shear creep tests were carried out in order to analyze the shear creep characteristics of such structural planes under different normal stress conditions. The test results showed that the shear creep process of structural planes can be divided into three stages, namely the attenuation stage, the constant stage, and the accelerated creep stage. Furthermore, the degree of structural plane development and normal stress level have a great influence on the creep behavior of rock mass. Moreover, based on the testing results, we established a nonlinear viscoelastic-plastic shear creep model by adding a new rheological element to the classic Nishihara model. In addition, the comparison between the test data and the fitting curve showed that this new model could describe the viscoelastic and viscoplastic deformation of weak structural planes more accurately."
Lessons in Casual Sex: Narratives of Young Swedish Women,"This study focuses on the narratives of four young Swedish women who were interviewed about their experiences of heterosexual casual sex. The analyses are based on a phenomenological approach and provide insight into a highly complex sexual practice, which the participants often portray as having lacked transparent communication, balance of power, and satisfying sex—three key dimensions of an everyday “sexual democracy.” However, the participants also claim to have dealt with these problematic issues, hence pointing to the socializing role that early sexual experiences have for young women. Thus, if the participants’ own perspectives of events are accepted, sexual empowerment might best be understood as individually colored, experience-based, developmental processes rather than as something that is brought about primarily through collective, formal sex education."
"Parental magma, magmatic stratigraphy, and reef-type PGE enrichment of the 2.44-Ga mafic-ultramafic Näränkävaara layered intrusion, Northern Finland","About 20 mafic-ultramafic layered intrusions in the northern Fennoscandian shield were emplaced during a widespread magmatic event at 2.5–2.4 Ga. The intrusions host orthomagmatic Ni-Cu-PGE and Cr-V-Ti-Fe deposits. We update the magmatic stratigraphy of the 2.44-Ga Näränkävaara mafic-ultramafic body, northeastern Finland, on the basis of new drill core and outcrop observations. The Näränkävaara body consists of an extensive basal dunite (1700 m thick), and a layered series comprising a peridotitic–pyroxenitic ultramafic zone (600 m thick) and a gabbronoritic–dioritic mafic zone (700 m thick). Two reversals are found in the layered series. The composition of the layered series parental magma was approximated using a previously unidentified marginal series gabbronorite. The parental magma was siliceous high-Mg basalt with high MgO, Ni, and Cr, but also high SiO2 and Zr, which suggests primary magma contamination by felsic crust. Cu/Pd ratio below that of primitive mantle implies PGE-fertility. The structural position of the marginal series indicates that the thick basal dunite represents an older wallrock for the layered intrusion. A subeconomic reef-type PGE-enriched zone is found in the border zone between the ultramafic and mafic zones and has an average thickness of 25 m with 150–250 ppb of Pt + Pd + Au. Offset-type metal distribution and high sulfide tenor (50–300 ppm Pd) and R-factor (105) suggest reef formation by sulfide saturation induced by fractional crystallization. The reef-forming process was probably interrupted by influx of magma related to the first reversal. Metal ratios suggest that this replenishing magma was PGE-depleted before emplacement."
"Physical working conditions and subsequent disability retirement due to any cause, mental disorders and musculoskeletal diseases: does the risk vary by common mental disorders?","Physical work exposures and common mental disorders (CMD) have been linked to increased risk of work disability, but their joint associations with disability retirement due to any cause, mental disorders or musculoskeletal diseases have not been examined."
Precious metal recoveries in secondary copper smelting with high-alumina slags,"Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) represents a significant urban resource for precious metals. To maximize the recoveries and sustainable use of these metals, their behavior needs to be characterized in the secondary copper smelting of WEEE. The current study experimentally determined the distributions of gold, silver, platinum and palladium between copper alloy and FeOx–SiO2–Al2O3/FeOx–SiO2–Al2O3–CaO slags (LCu/s[M] = [M]Copper/[M]Slag) over the oxygen partial pressure range of 10−5 – 10−10 atm at 1300 °C. In addition, the equilibria of copper alloy, slag and Al–Fe spinel system are presented and discussed. The experiments were conducted employing an equilibration—drop-quenching technique followed by major element analysis with Electron Probe MicroAnalysis (EPMA) and trace element analysis with sensitive Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The results showed that the distribution coefficient of silver increased from 10 to 103 as a function of decreasing oxygen partial pressure. For gold, platinum and palladium, the distribution coefficients were at minimum 105. Lime addition improved the recovery of silver notably and had a small positive effect on gold recovery into copper. Overall, the precious metals can be recovered very efficiently in copper alloy via secondary copper smelting with alumina-rich iron-silicate slags."
Multifractal analysis of human canine teeth at nano scale: atomic force microscopy studies,"The aim of the present study is to explore the 3-D micromorphology of human canine teeth materials using multifractal analysis through atomic force microscopy (AFM). The 3-D surfaces of ten extracted canine teeth of a group of 40 year old men were studied (enamel, inter enamel, inter dentin, and cementum) by AFM images in tapping mode and on square areas of 1 μm × 1 μm (512 × 512 points). The AFM images and surface multifractal analysis confirm the dependency of surface micromorphology to their structure–property of these materials across the length scales of the teeth structural architecture. Surface statistical parameters and hence, multifractal approach have been considered as reliable and sensitive tools for quantifying the 3-D surface microtexture changes of human canine teeth materials. The surface of inter dentin had the most irregular topography (the width spectrum Δα = 2.8361, value bigger than all the other Δα sample values), while the most regular topography (the width spectrum Δα = 2.6804, value lower than all the other sample values) was found in cementum. It has been concluded that multifractal analyses can be used as mathematical tools to explore the 3-D micromorphology of human canine teeth materials."
Papal visits and abortions: evidence from Italy,"We investigate the impact of papal visits to Italian provinces on abortions from 1979 to 2012. Using administrative data, we find a 10–20% decrease in the number of abortions that commences in the 3rd month and persists until the 14th month after the visits. However, we find no significant change in the number of live births. A decline in unintended pregnancies best explains our results. Papal visits generate intense local media coverage, and likely make salient the Catholic Church’s stance against abortions. We show that papal visits lead to increased church attendance, and that the decline in abortions is greater when the Pope mentions abortion in his speeches."
Dynamic Characteristics of Deep Dolomite Under One-Dimensional Static and Dynamic Loads,"The failure characteristics of rock subjected to impact disturbance under one-dimensional static axial compression are helpful for studying the problems of pillar instability and rock burst in deep, high geostress surrounding rock under blasting disturbances. Improved split Hopkinson pressure bar equipment was used for one-dimensional dynamic–static combined impact tests of deep-seated dolomite specimens under axial compression levels of 0, 12, 24, and 36 MPa. The experimental results demonstrate that the dolomite specimens exhibit strong brittleness. The dynamic strength always maintains a strong positive correlation with the strain rate when the axial compression is fixed; when the strain rate is close, the dynamic elasticity modulus and peak strength of the specimens first increase and then decrease with the increase in axial compression, and the peak value appears at 24 MPa. The impact resistance of specimens can be enhanced when the axial compression is 12 or 24 MPa, but when it increases to 36 MPa, the damage inside the specimen begins to cause damage to the dynamic rock strength. Prior to the rock macroscopic failure, the axial static load changes the rock structure state, and it can store strain energy or cause irreversible damage."

Significant influencing factors and practical solutions in improvement of clinical nursing services: a Delphi study,Clinical services evaluation with specific indicators are very helpful to identify improvable points. This study was conducted to analyze the factors affecting the quality of clinical nursing services and offer practical solutions for accreditation of clinical nursing services.
Infection prevention preparedness and practices for female sterilization services within primary care facilities in Northern India,"In 2014, 16 women died following female sterilization operations in Bilaspur, a district in central India. In addition to those 16 deaths, 70 women were hospitalized for critical conditions (Sharma, Lancet 384,2014). Although the government of India’s guidelines for female sterilization mandate infection prevention practices, little is known about the extent of infection prevention preparedness and practice during sterilization procedures that are part of the country’s primary health care services. This study assesses facility readiness for infection prevention and adherence to infection prevention practices during female sterilization procedures in rural northern India."
Survival benefits of neoadjuvant chemo(radio)therapy versus surgery first in patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a highly lethal malignancy. Neoadjuvant chemo(radio)therapy [NAC(R)T] is recommended to use for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) and high-risk resectable pancreatic cancer (RPC), but no high-level evidence exists."
Is in vivo and ex vivo irradiation equally reliable for individual Radiosensitivity testing by three colour fluorescence in situ hybridization?,Individual radiosensitivity is influencing the outcome of radiation therapy. A general ex vivo testing is very work-intensive. It is of interest to see if a significant prediction concerning the sensitivity can be made by in vivo irradiation during radiation treatment.
Therapeutic effect of whole brain radiotherapy on advanced NSCLC between EGFR TKI-naïve and TKI-resistant,The development of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) has dramatically improved the prognosis of patients with EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical outcome with or without EGFR-TKI resistance before WBRT and the sequence between EGFT-TKIs and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who developed multiple brain metastases (BMs).
On the Relationships Between Sunspot Number and Solar Radio Flux at 10.7 Centimeters,"Regression analysis and neural network training procedures are used to study the relationship between sunspot number (SSN) and solar flux at 10.7 cm (F10.7). Measurements of SSN and F10.7 for the periods from December 1963 to January 2019 (including the periods from Solar Cycles 20 to 24) were used. The value of correlation coefficient between SSN and F10.7 for the entire data used in the study is 0.95, showing that the parameters are well correlated. Results from the study reveal that there are remarkable differences on the relationship between SSN and F10.7 during the four solar cycle phases of low (-activity), high (-activity), ascending, and descending. The relationships are identical for the ascending and descending phases when the SSNs are lower than about 150, but the regression curves diverge as the SSNs increase beyond that limit. A conspicuously changed relationship between SSN and F10.7 is also observed for years 2014 and 2015 in which the annual SSN-versus-F10.7 plots for those years are visibly above those of the prior years. The results indicate that F10.7 values can be predicted from SSNs using neural networks, with root-mean-square errors of about 13.68 solar flux units. Results from the neural network procedure also indicate that a newly introduced solar cycle phase index (defined to indicate the phase of the solar cycle in which given observations belong) was effective in improving the neural network predictions."
"Associations between Adolescents’ Interpersonal Relationships, School Well-being, and Academic Achievement during Educational Transitions","A youth’s ability to adapt during educational transitions has long-term, positive impacts on their academic achievement and mental health. Although supportive relationships with parents, peers, and teachers are protective factors associated with successful educational transitions, little is known about the reciprocal link between the quality of these interpersonal relationships and school well-being, with even less known about how these two constructs affect academic achievement. This longitudinal study examined how the quality of interpersonal relationships and school well-being worked together to affect academic achievement during the transition from primary school to lower secondary school. Data were collected from 848 Finnish adolescents (54% girls, mean age at the outset 12.3 years) over the course of sixth and seventh grade. The results support a transactional model illustrating the reciprocal associations between the quality of interpersonal relationships and school well-being during the transition to lower secondary school. As such, the presence of high quality interpersonal relationships promoted higher academic achievement through increased school well-being, whereas high school well-being promoted higher subsequent academic achievement through increased quality of interpersonal relationships. Overall, the results suggest that promoting learning outcomes and helping adolescents with challenges during educational transitions is a critical part of supporting school well-being and the formation of high-quality interpersonal relationships."
Symbiosis extended: exchange of photosynthetic O2 and fungal-respired CO2 mutually power metabolism of lichen symbionts,"Lichens are a symbiosis between a fungus and one or more photosynthetic microorganisms that enables the symbionts to thrive in places and conditions they could not compete independently. Exchanges of water and sugars between the symbionts are the established mechanisms that support lichen symbiosis. Herein, we present a new linkage between algal photosynthesis and fungal respiration in lichen Flavoparmelia caperata that extends the physiological nature of symbiotic co-dependent metabolisms, mutually boosting energy conversion rates in both symbionts. Measurements of electron transport by oximetry show that photosynthetic O2 is consumed internally by fungal respiration. At low light intensity, very low levels of O2 are released, while photosynthetic electron transport from water oxidation is normal as shown by intrinsic chlorophyll variable fluorescence yield (period-4 oscillations in flash-induced Fv/Fm). The rate of algal O2 production increases following consecutive series of illumination periods, at low and with limited saturation at high light intensities, in contrast to light saturation in free-living algae. We attribute this effect to arise from the availability of more CO2 produced by fungal respiration of photosynthetically generated sugars. We conclude that the lichen symbionts are metabolically coupled by energy conversion through exchange of terminal electron donors and acceptors used in both photosynthesis and fungal respiration. Algal sugars and O2 are consumed by the fungal symbiont, while fungal delivered CO2 is consumed by the alga."
Sex differences in brain structure: a twin study on restricted and repetitive behaviors in twin pairs with and without autism,"Females with autism spectrum disorder have been reported to exhibit fewer and less severe restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests compared to males. This difference might indicate sex-specific alterations of brain networks involved in autism symptom domains, especially within cortico-striatal and sensory integration networks. This study used a well-controlled twin design to examine sex differences in brain anatomy in relation to repetitive behaviors."
CSF biomarkers of neuroinflammation in distinct forms and subtypes of neurodegenerative dementia,"In neurodegenerative dementias (NDs) such as prion disease, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), protein misfolding leads to the tissue deposition of protein aggregates which, in turn, trigger neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers have the potential to reflect different aspects of these phenomena across distinct clinicopathological subtypes and disease stages."
An epigenome-wide association study of sex-specific chronological ageing,"Advanced age is associated with cognitive and physical decline and is a major risk factor for a multitude of disorders. There is also a gap in life expectancy between males and females. DNA methylation differences have been shown to be associated with both age and sex. Here, we investigate age-by-sex differences in blood-based DNA methylation in an unrelated cohort of 2586 individuals between the ages of 18 and 87 years, with replication in a further 4450 individuals between the ages of 18 and 93 years."
Exome sequencing reveals a high prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder variants in a diverse population-based biobank,"Pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) lead to increased risk of breast, ovarian, and other cancers, but most variant-positive individuals in the general population are unaware of their risk, and little is known about prevalence in non-European populations. We investigated BRCA1/2 prevalence and impact in the electronic health record (EHR)-linked BioMe Biobank in New York City."
Achieving Comprehensive Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect,"The United States has developed a comprehensive array of child abuse and neglect (CAN) prevention resources and has allocated funding to provide these resources. Policy makers, practitioners, and advocates are committed to CAN prevention. However, the current paradigm used to prevent CAN is inadequate for four reasons. First, system-level policies and infrastructure are not fully aligned with children’s needs for a safe and stable upbringing. Second, access to effective CAN prevention resources is not ubiquitous. Third, most people do not have clear roles in preventing CAN in their everyday lives. Fourth, fear of stigma prevents caregivers from seeking support and accessing services. We must shift the paradigm so that all policies promote child well-being, every family has equitable access to all opportunities, and every individual feels entitled to advocate for and engage in CAN prevention. By embedding an adapted Health Belief Model (aHBM) into an ecological model, we can improve policies, behaviors, and beliefs at all levels of the social ecology in order to shift the paradigm. In order to scale knowledge and advocacy for preventing CAN to the population, we propose a strategy that increases system collaboration, leverages existing infrastructure, and adopts multi-source funding models that invest in prevention services to inoculate society against CAN."
Optimization and scale-up production of Zika virus ΔNS1 in Escherichia coli: application of Response Surface Methodology,"Diagnosing Zika virus (ZIKV) infections has been challenging due to the cross-reactivity of induced antibodies with other flavivirus. The concomitant occurrence of ZIKV and Dengue virus (DENV) in endemic regions requires diagnostic tools with the ability to distinguish these two viral infections. Recent studies demonstrated that immunoassays using the C-terminal fragment of ZIKV NS1 antigen (ΔNS1) can be used to discriminate ZIKV from DENV infections. In order to be used in serological tests, the expression/solubility of ΔNS1 and growth of recombinant E. coli strain were optimized by Response Surface Methodology. Temperature, time and IPTG concentration were evaluated. According to the model, the best condition determined in small scale cultures was 21 °C for 20 h with 0.7 mM of IPTG, which predicted 7.5 g/L of biomass and 962 mg/L of ΔNS1. These conditions were validated and used in a 6-L batch in the bioreactor, which produced 6.4 g/L of biomass and 500 mg/L of ΔNS1 in 12 h of induction. The serological ELISA test performed with purified ΔNS1 showed low cross-reactivity with antibodies from DENV-infected human subjects. Denaturation of ΔNS1 decreased the detection of anti-ZIKV antibodies, thus indicating the contribution of conformational epitopes and confirming the importance of properly folded ΔNS1 for the specificity of the serological analyses. Obtaining high yields of soluble ΔNS1 supports the viability of an effective serologic diagnostic test capable of differentiating ZIKV from other flavivirus infections."
From civilian service to military service: what led policy-makers to remove nursing care from field units of the Israeli defense force (IDF) and return it later?,"From the very onset, Israeli military nurses served in supporting positions on the front lines, shoulder to shoulder with men. When the IDF was established in 1948, nurses were sent to serve near areas of conflict and were not included in compulsory military service in field units. Once the military hospitals were closed in 1949, nursing in the Medical Corps lost a clear military purpose, and its main contribution was in the civilian arena. From 1949 until 2000, most recruited military nurses operated their mandatory service mainly in a civilian framework according to the integration agreement between the ministry of defense to the ministry of health. Between 2000 to 2018, military nurses served at home front military clinics and in headquarters jobs at the Medicine Corps. In2018, the Medical Corps decided to integrate military nurses into the Israeli military service in order to cope with the shortage of military physicians, among other things, and ensure appropriate availability of medical and health services for military units.. This study examines, for the first time, the considerations that led to the closure of military hospitals and the transfer of the military service of nurses in the IDF to the Ministry of Health in 1949 and the decision in 2018 to return the military nurses to the field’s military battalions."
Multi-revolution low-thrust trajectory optimization using symplectic methods,"Optimization of low-thrust trajectories that involve a larger number of orbit revolutions is considered as a challenging problem. This paper describes a high-precision symplectic method and optimization techniques to solve the minimum-energy low-thrust multi-revolution orbit transfer problem. First, the optimal orbit transfer problem is posed as a constrained nonlinear optimal control problem. Then, the constrained nonlinear optimal control problem is converted into an equivalent linear quadratic form near a reference solution. The reference solution is updated iteratively by solving a sequence of linear-quadratic optimal control sub-problems, until convergence. Each sub-problem is solved via a symplectic method in discrete form. To facilitate the convergence of the algorithm, the spacecraft dynamics are expressed via modified equinoctial elements. Interpolating the non-singular equinoctial orbital elements and the spacecraft mass between the initial point and end point is proven beneficial to accelerate the convergence process. Numerical examples reveal that the proposed method displays high accuracy and efficiency."
Objectivity and Perspectival Content,"What is objectivity? What would it take to have objective representations and do we (humans) have what it takes? This paper aims to contribute to answering these questions. To this end, it isolates one relevant sense of objectivity and proposes a generalization of standard frameworks of representational content in order to engage with the question in a way that is rhetorically fair. Armed with a general conception of perspectival content, taken from the literature on centred or de se content, the paper articulates one necessary condition for objective representation: the possession of objective concepts and therefore objective contents. Two ways of meeting (or approximately meeting) this condition are discussed in an exploratory way."
"Nutraceuticals, antioxidant pigments, and phytochemicals in the leaves of Amaranthus spinosus and Amaranthus viridis weedy species","Six selected weedy Amaranthus genotypes (three accessions from each species of A. viridis and A. spinosus) were evaluated in terms of nutrients, minerals, antioxidant constituents and antioxidant activity for the possibilities of weedy species as a vegetable cultivar in a randomized complete block design with three replications. As leafy vegetable, Weedy Amaranthus has remarkable protein, dietary fiber, carbohydrates, Ca, K, Mg, P, S, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Na, Mo, B, chlorophylls, β-cyanins, β-xanthins, betalains, β-carotene, vitamin C, TPC, TFC, and TAC (DPPH and ABTS+) compared to any cultivated species. The A. viridis genotype WAV7 and A. spinosus genotype WAS13 had the highest nutrients, pigments, vitamins, phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidant. Hence, these two weedy accessions could be used as an antioxidant profile enriched cultivar with high nutritional and antioxidant activity. Pigments, β-carotene, vitamin C, phenolics, and flavonoids had strong antioxidant activity and played a vital role in the antioxidant activity of weedy Amaranthus genotypes. Weedy species are an excellent source of phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidants that have many pharmacological and medicinal effects of their traditional applications and detoxify ROS and offered huge prospects for feeding the antioxidant-deficient community to cope with the hidden hunger and attaining nutritional and antioxidant sufficiency."
How much does the rainfall temporal resolution affect rainfall thresholds for landslide triggering?,"In many areas of the world, the prediction of rainfall-induced landslides is usually carried out by means of empirical rainfall thresholds. Their definition is complicated by several issues, among which are the evaluation and quantification of diverse uncertainties resulting from data and methods. Threshold effectiveness and reliability strongly depend on the quality and quantity of rainfall measurements and landslide information used as input. In this work, the influence of the temporal resolution of rainfall measurements on the calculation of landslide-triggering rainfall thresholds is evaluated and discussed. For the purpose, hourly rainfall measurements collected by 172 rain gauges and geographical and temporal information on the occurrence of 561 rainfall-induced landslides in Liguria region (northern Italy) in the period 2004–2014 are used. To assess the impact of different temporal resolutions on the thresholds, rainfall measurements are clustered in increasing bins of 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h. A comprehensive tool is applied to each dataset to automatically reconstruct the rainfall conditions responsible for the failures and to calculate frequentist cumulated event rainfall–rainfall duration (ED) thresholds. Then, using a quantitative procedure, the calculated ED thresholds are validated. The main finding of the work is that the use of rainfall measurements with different temporal resolutions results in considerable variations of the shape and the validity range of the thresholds. Decreasing the rainfall temporal resolution, thresholds with smaller intercepts, higher slopes, shorter ranges of validity and higher uncertainties are obtained. On the other hand, it seems that the rainfall temporal resolution does not influence the validation procedure and the threshold performance indicators. Overall, the use of rainfall data with coarse temporal resolution causes a systematic underestimation of thresholds at short durations, resulting in relevant drawbacks (e.g. false alarms) if the thresholds are implemented in operational systems for landslide prediction."
“Spotting the signs” of trafficking recruitment online: exploring the characteristics of advertisements targeted at migrant job-seekers,"Despite considerable concern about how human trafficking offenders may use the Internet to recruit their victims, arrange logistics or advertise services, the Internet-trafficking nexus remains unclear. This study explored the prevalence and correlates of a set of commonly-used indicators of labour trafficking in online job advertisements. Taking a case study approach, we focused on a major Lithuanian website aimed at people seeking work abroad. We examined a snapshot of job advertisements (n = 430), assessing both their general characteristics (e.g. industry, destination country) and the presence of trafficking indicators. The vast majority (98.4%) contained at least one indicator, suggesting certain ""indicators"" may in fact be commonplace characteristics of this labour market. Inferential statistical tests revealed significant but weak relationships between the advertisements’ characteristics and the number and nature of indicators present. While there may be value in screening job advertisements to identify potential labour trafficking and exploitation, additional information is needed to ascertain actual labour trafficking. We conclude with an outlook on automated approaches to identifying cases of possible trafficking and a discussion of the benefits and ethical concerns of a data science-driven approach."

Process of implementing and delivering the Prevention of Delirium system of care: a mixed method preliminary study,"Delirium is a frequent complication of hospital admission among older people. Multicomponent interventions which can reduce incident delirium by ≈one-third are recommended by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence. Currently, a standardised delirium prevention system of care suitable for adoption in the UK National Health Service does not exist. The Prevention of Delirium (POD) system of care is a theory informed, multicomponent intervention and systematic implementation process which includes a role for hospital volunteers. We report POD implementation and delivery processes in NHS hospital wards, as part of a feasibility study."
Burden of acute kidney injury and 90-day mortality in critically ill patients,"Mortality rates associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) vary among critically ill patients. Outcomes are often not corrected for severity or duration of AKI. Our objective was to analyse whether a new variable, AKI burden, would outperform 1) presence of AKI, 2) highest AKI stage, or 3) AKI duration in predicting 90-day mortality."
HIV screening in men and women in Senegal: coverage and associated factors; analysis of the 2017 demographic and health survey,"Despite the adoption of the provider-initiated HIV testing strategy, the rate of HIV testing is still very low in sub-Saharan Africa.

Transforming Business Education through Social Innovation: from Exalting Heroes to Engaging our Humanity,"Our world is faced with complex challenges that include poverty, hunger, lack of education, gender inequality, sustainability, and climate change. These issues cannot be addressed by government action alone and requires the business world play an important role. Despite the many effort of companies to address social responsibility in the last decade however, capitalism continues to suffer a crisis of trust. Many organizations lack the awareness, mindset, frameworks, and knowledge to efficiently and effectively make progress in providing solutions to these systemic challenges, while also ensuring business performance. The authors argue that business schools are uniquely positioned and have a responsibility to contribute to this cause as educators of the business leaders of tomorrow. A landscape survey of social entrepreneurship / social innovation (SE/SI) education with 66 institutions of higher education and in-depth interviews with 8 social intrapreneurs from diverse career tracks reveals significant challenges as well as opportunities for creating this paradigm shift in business schools. This research uses insights from these two studies to provide an overview of the current state of SE/SI in business education and provides recommendations for institutions of higher education to pave a pathway forward for future leaders who will use business to create positive social change."
Location histogram privacy by Sensitive Location Hiding and Target Histogram Avoidance/Resemblance,"A location histogram is comprised of the number of times a user has visited locations as they move in an area of interest, and it is often obtained from the user in the context of applications such as recommendation and advertising. However, a location histogram that leaves a user’s computer or device may threaten privacy when it contains visits to locations that the user does not want to disclose (sensitive locations), or when it can be used to profile the user in a way that leads to price discrimination and unsolicited advertising (e.g., as “wealthy” or “minority member”). Our work introduces two privacy notions to protect a location histogram from these threats: Sensitive Location Hiding, which aims at concealing all visits to sensitive locations, and Target Avoidance/Resemblance, which aims at concealing the similarity/dissimilarity of the user’s histogram to a target histogram that corresponds to an undesired/desired profile. We formulate an optimization problem around each notion: Sensitive Location Hiding (\({ SLH}\)), which seeks to construct a histogram that is as similar as possible to the user’s histogram but associates all visits with nonsensitive locations, and Target Avoidance/Resemblance (\({ TA}\)/\({ TR}\)), which seeks to construct a histogram that is as dissimilar/similar as possible to a given target histogram but remains useful for getting a good response from the application that analyzes the histogram. We develop an optimal algorithm for each notion, which operates on a notion-specific search space graph and finds a shortest or longest path in the graph that corresponds to a solution histogram. In addition, we develop a greedy heuristic for the \({ TA}\)/\({ TR}\) problem, which operates directly on a user’s histogram. Our experiments demonstrate that all algorithms are effective at preserving the distribution of locations in a histogram and the quality of location recommendation. They also demonstrate that the heuristic produces near-optimal solutions while being orders of magnitude faster than the optimal algorithm for \({ TA}\)/\({ TR}\)."
"Groundwater net discharge rates estimated from lake level change in Badain Jaran Desert, Northwest China","Over a hundred sizable lakes, some even larger than ~1 km2, are distributed across the lowlands between megadunes in the southeastern Badain Jaran Desert (BJD), northwest China. With rather limited precipitation and hardly any surface runoff, these lakes are fed mainly by groundwater. However, the source of the groundwater and the groundwater discharge rates to these lakes are poorly understood. Water level and temperature of four representative lakes in the southeastern BJD were monitored continuously between 2013 and 2017. Water surface evaporation and rainfall in this area were also measured. Combining these acquired data, groundwater discharge rates were estimated using water balance models. The results show that the four lakes have similar recharge and discharge patterns, but at different average net groundwater discharge rates ranging from 1.79 to 3.09 mm d−1. The lake level variation mainly depends on groundwater discharge and lake surface evaporation. We found that diurnal lake level variation may be controlled by earth tide and atmospheric pressure change, and is five times greater than the evaporation. The desert precipitation and deep confined groundwater with high temperature were found also recharging the desert lakes. An Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method was used to identify the lake level trend. All lake levels increased over the last four years, except one decreased in 2015 and 2016. The lake levels’ increasing trend is synchronously similar with the precipitation in north China. This study analyzes annual and seasonal lake level variations, and also finds the diurnal water cycle between the groundwater and lake water for the first time."
The relation of work-related factors with ambulatory blood pressure and nocturnal blood pressure dipping among aging workers,"Individuals with reduced nocturnal blood pressure (BP) dipping are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared to persons with normal BP dipping. Although the relation of work-related factors and BP has been studied extensively, very little is known of the association between work-related factors and 24-h BP patterns in aging workers. We examined the cross-sectional relation of work-related risk factors, including occupational status, work-time mode, job demands and job control, with ambulatory BP in aging workers, focusing on nocturnal BP dipping."
Modeling and Solving a Multi-Period Inventory Fulfilling and Routing Problem for Hazardous Materials,"Any potential damage may be severe once an accident occurs involving hazardous materials. It is therefore important to consider the risk factor concerning hazardous material supply chains, in order to make the best inventory routing decisions. This paper addresses the problem of hazardous material multi-period inventory routing with the assumption of a limited production capacity of a given manufacturer. The goal is to achieve the manufacturer’s production plan, the retailer’s supply schedule and the transportation routes within a fixed period. As the distribution of hazardous materials over a certain period is essentially a multiple travelling salesmen problem, the authors formulate a loading-dependent risk model for multiple-vehicle transportation and present an integer programming model to maximize the supply chain profit. An improved genetic algorithm considering two dimensions of chromosomes that cover the aforementioned period and supply quantity is devised to handle the integer programming model. Numerical experiments carried out demonstrate that using the proposed multi-period joint decision-making can significantly increase the overall profit of the supply chain as compared to the use of single period decision repeatedly, while effectively reducing its risk."
Electrostatic Tuning of Anion Attraction from the Cytoplasm to the Pore of the CFTR Chloride Channel,"Anions enter from the cytoplasm into the channel pore of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channel not via a central pathway but via a single lateral portal or fenestration. High Cl− conductance is dependent on electrostatic attraction of cytoplasmic Cl− ions by four positively charged amino acid side-chains located within this portal. Here we use a mutagenic approach to investigate the functional effects of transplanting or supplementing these positive charges at nearby portal-lining sites. Using patch clamp recording, we find that the functionally important positive charges at K190 and R303 can be transplanted to four nearby sites (N186, L197, W356, and A367) with little loss of Cl− conductance. Introduction of additional positive charge at these sites had almost no effect on Cl− conductance, but did increase the sensitivity to channel block by intracellular suramin and Pt(NO2)42− anions. We suggest that it is the number of positive charges within the portal, rather than their exact location, that is the most important factor influencing Cl− conductance. The portal appears well optimized in terms of charge distribution to maximize Cl− conductance."
Cross-spectral palmprint recognition with low-rank canonical correlation analysis,"As an important biometric trait, palmprint has been widely studied in individual identification. With the popularity of palmprint recognition, many palmprint acquisition devices with different spectra have been designed and applied into practical application, so it is difficult to ensure that the spectra of collectors are consistent during training and testing, which leads to the challenge of cross-spectral palmprint images classification. To address this problem, this paper presents a domain adaptive method based on subspace learning, i.e., low-rank canonical correlation analysis (LRCCA). The proposed method seeks to find the common subspace of cross-spectral palmprint images and capture the low-rank structural relationships in data simultaneously. We perform the experiment on the multi-spectral palmprint dataset with 12 cross-spectral palmprint recognition tasks. The experimental results show that our method achieves the promising results in both identification and verification and outperforms the classical transfer learning methods and deep canonical component analysis (DCCA)."
Viscoelastic analysis of the creep characteristics of interlayered rock specimens under uniaxial compression,"Creep properties of interlayered rock mass often encountered in rock engineering, significantly affect the safety and long-term stability of practical engineering. In this study, the theoretical equations of creep strain for interlayered rock specimens when the uniaxial compression loading was applied perpendicular to or parallel with bedding plane were derived. The laws of viscoelastic deformation for soft-hard interlayered rock specimens, soft-soft interlayered rock specimens and hard-hard interlayered rock specimens were also discussed, respectively. The creep deformation characteristics obtained from the numerical simulation and the theoretical analyses were consistent, confirming the correctness of the calculation method proposed in this paper. The results showed that the viscoelastic deformation of interlayered rock specimens was not only related to the volume ratio of rock layers, but it also was affected by the spatial position of the layered structure. In addition, creep properties of hard and soft rock layers were characterized by stable creep model and unstable creep model, respectively. The influences of volume content, number of strips, buried depth, spacing and angle of soft rock interlayer on the creep properties of soft-hard interlayered rock specimens were also analyzed."
Modification of an aggressive model of Alport Syndrome reveals early differences in disease pathogenesis due to genetic background,"The link between mutations in collagen genes and the development of Alport Syndrome has been clearly established and a number of animal models, including knock-out mouse lines, have been developed that mirror disease observed in patients. However, it is clear from both patients and animal models that the progression of disease can vary greatly and can be modified genetically. We have identified a point mutation in Col4a4 in mice where disease is modified by strain background, providing further evidence of the genetic modification of disease symptoms. Our results indicate that C57BL/6J is a protective background and postpones end stage renal failure from 7 weeks, as seen on a C3H background, to several months. We have identified early differences in disease progression, including expression of podocyte-specific genes and podocyte morphology. In C57BL/6J mice podocyte effacement is delayed, prolonging normal renal function. The slower disease progression has allowed us to begin dissecting the pathogenesis of murine Alport Syndrome in detail. We find that there is evidence of differential gene expression during disease on the two genetic backgrounds, and that disease diverges by 4 weeks of age. We also show that an inflammatory response with increasing MCP-1 and KIM-1 levels precedes loss of renal function."
Characterization of the complete chloroplast genome sequence of Dalbergia species and its phylogenetic implications,"The pantropical plant genus Dalbergia comprises approximately 250 species, most of which have a high economic and ecological value. However, these species are among the most threatened due to illegal logging and the timber trade. To enforce protective legislation and ensure effective conservation of Dalbergia species, the identity of wood being traded must be accurately validated. For the rapid and accurate identification of Dalbergia species and assessment of phylogenetic relationships, it would be highly desirable to develop more effective DNA barcodes for these species. In this study, we sequenced and compared the chloroplast genomes of nine species of Dalbergia. We found that these chloroplast genomes were conserved with respect to genome size, structure, and gene content and showed low sequence divergence. We identified eight mutation hotspots, namely, six intergenic spacer regions (trnL-trnT, atpA-trnG, rps16-accD, petG-psaJ, ndhF-trnL, and ndhG-ndhI) and two coding regions (ycf1a and ycf1b), as candidate DNA barcodes for Dalbergia. Phylogenetic analyses based on whole chloroplast genome data provided the best resolution of Dalbergia, and phylogenetic analysis of the Fabaceae showed that Dalbergia was sister to Arachis. Based on comparison of chloroplast genomes, we identified a set of highly variable markers that can be developed as specific DNA barcodes."
Passenger sequences can promote interlaced dimers in a common variant of the maltose-binding protein,"The maltose-binding protein (MBP) is one of the most frequently used protein tags due to its capacity to stabilize, solubilize and even crystallize recombinant proteins that are fused to it. Given that MBP is thought to be a highly stable monomeric protein with known characteristics, fused passenger proteins are often studied without being cleaved from MBP. Here we report that a commonly used engineered MBP version (mutated to lower its surface entropy) can form interlaced dimers when fused to short protein sequences derived from the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) or the homologous protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2). These MBP dimers still bind maltose and can interconvert with monomeric forms in vitro under standard conditions despite a contact surface of more than 11,000 Å2. We demonstrate that both the mutations in MBP and the fused protein sequences were required for dimer formation. The FAK and PYK2 sequences are less than 40% identical, monomeric, and did not show specific interactions with MBP, suggesting that a variety of sequences can promote this MBP dimerization. MBP dimerization was abrogated by reverting two of the eight mutations introduced in the engineered MBP. Our results provide an extreme example for induced reversible domain-swapping, with implications for protein folding dynamics. Our observations caution that passenger-promoted MBP dimerization might mislead experimental characterization of the fused protein sequences, but also suggest a simple mutation to stop this phenomenon."
Detection of Potato ring rot Pathogen Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus by Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay,"Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus (CMS) is an important bacterial plant pathogen causing potato ring rot disease. Rapid diagnosis of CMS is crucial because of the economic losses caused by serious harvest losses. Although there are serological tests used in the rapid diagnosis of CMS, they are not widely used because of their low sensitivity. The DNA-based PCR methods, which are highly sensitive, do not have the possibility of on-site diagnosis, especially since they require serious laboratory infrastructure. In recent years, scientists have been working on alternative amplification methods to develop DNA-based point of care (POC) diagnostic methods. Accordingly, the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method, which was developed in the early 2000s, provides an important convenience for DNA-based tests to use in the field. Due to the unique design of primers, more amplification products could be create in a shorter time than conventional amplification methods without needing a temperature cycle, and it can be applied with the aid of a simple heater without requiring a laboratory environment. In this study, efficient LAMP method for the detection of CMS has optimized. For device-independent detection of LAMP products, colorimetric method and LFD has used."
Anti-protozoal activity of extracts from chicory (Cichorium intybus) against Cryptosporidium parvum in cell culture,"Cryptosporidium spp. are responsible for severe public health problems and livestock production losses. Treatment options are limited to only one drug available for human and bovine cryptosporidiosis, respectively, and both drugs exhibit only partial efficacy. Sesquiterpene lactones (SL) are plant bioactive compounds that function as a defence mechanism against herbivores. SL have demonstrated anti-parasitic properties against a range of parasitic taxa but knowledge about their anti-Cryptosporidium efficacy is limited. The effect of SL-rich leaf and root extracts from chicory (Cichorium intybus cv. Spadona) was investigated using human colon adenocarcinoma (HCT-8) cells infected with Cryptosporidium parvum. C. parvum oocysts were inoculated onto the cell monolayer and i) incubated for 4 hours with extracts (leaf and root extracts 300, 150, 75, 37.5, 18.75 and 9.375 μg/mL) in triplicates followed by incubation in bioactive free media (sporozoite invasion assays) or ii) incubated for 4 hours in bioactive free media followed by 48-hours incubation with extracts (growth inhibition assays). Extract toxicity on HCT-8 cells was assessed via water-soluble tetrazolium (WST)-1 assay prior to quantifying parasitic growth via immunofluorescence. Both extracts demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition in the growth inhibition assays (p = < 0.0001 for both extracts) but not in the invasion assays. Anti-parasitic activity did not appear to be solely related to SL content, with the extract with lower SL content (leaf) exhibiting higher inhibition at 300 μg/ml. However, given the limited treatment options available for Cryptosporidium spp., our study encourages further investigation into the use of chicory extracts to identify novel active compound(s) inhibiting these protozoa."
Bleomycin hydrolase regulates the release of chemokines important for inflammation and wound healing by keratinocytes,"Bleomycin hydrolase (BLMH) is a well-conserved cysteine protease widely expressed in several mammalian tissues. In skin, which contains high levels of BLMH, this protease is involved in the degradation of citrullinated filaggrin monomers into free amino acids important for skin hydration. Interestingly, the expression and activity of BLMH is reduced in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis, and BLMH knockout mice acquire tail dermatitis. Apart from its already known function, we have discovered a novel role of BLMH in the regulation of inflammatory chemokines and wound healing. We show that lowered BLMH levels in keratinocytes result in increased release of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL8 and GROα, which are upregulated in skin from AD patients compared to healthy individuals. Conditioned media from keratinocytes expressing low levels of BLMH increased chemotaxis by neutrophils and caused a delayed wound healing in the presence of low-level TNFα. This defective wound healing was improved by blocking the shared receptor of CXCL8 and GROα, namely CXCR2, using a specific receptor antagonist. Collectively, our results present a novel function of BLMH in regulating the secretion of chemokines involved in inflammation and wound healing in human keratinocytes."
Response of Near-Inertial Shear to Wind Stress Curl and Sea Level,"Near-inertial waves (NIWs) contain a pronounced portion of shear energy in the internal wave field and is of great importance to deep ocean mixing. However, accurate simulation of NIWs remains a challenge. Here we analyzed 3-year long mooring observation of velocity profiles over 80–800 m to study the responses of near-inertial downward shear to varying wind stress curls and sea level anomalies (SLAs). It is demonstrated that moderate (even weak) cyclone makes more contributions to enhanced shear below the pycnocline than very strong cyclone. Because very strong curl can stall the downward propagation of large shear. The large positive and negative SLAs cause the accumulation of large shear in the lower and upper parts of the pycnocline through inducing downwelling and upwelling motions, respectively. Time variation of near-inertial shear was strongly influenced by cases of large curls and interannual variation of SLA, and thus did not follow the seasonal variation of wind stress. Our analyses suggest that matched fields of wind stress curl and SLA, and well representing the ocean response to moderate cyclone are needed in simulating the role of NIWs on mixing."
Effects of Chikungunya virus immunity on Mayaro virus disease and epidemic potential,"Mayaro virus (MAYV) causes an acute febrile illness similar to that produced by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an evolutionary relative in the Semliki Forest virus complex of alphaviruses. MAYV emergence is typically sporadic, but recent isolations and outbreaks indicate that the virus remains a public health concern. Given the close phylogenetic and antigenic relationship between CHIKV and MAYV, and widespread distribution of CHIKV, we hypothesized that prior CHIKV immunity may affect MAYV pathogenesis and/or influence its emergence potential. We pre-exposed immunocompetent C57BL/6 and immunocompromised A129 or IFNAR mice to wild-type CHIKV, two CHIKV vaccines, or a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine, and challenged with MAYV. We observed strong cross-protection against MAYV for mice pre-exposed to wild-type CHIKV, and moderately but significantly reduced cross-protection from CHIKV-vaccinated animals. Immunity to other alphavirus or flavivirus controls provided no protection against MAYV disease or viremia. Mechanistic studies suggested that neutralizing antibodies alone can mediate this protection, with T-cells having no significant effect on diminishing disease. Finally, human sera obtained from naturally acquired CHIKV infection cross-neutralized MAYV at high titers in vitro. Altogether, our data suggest that CHIKV infection can confer cross-protective effects against MAYV, and the resultant reduction in viremia may limit the emergence potential of MAYV."
High heritability of coral calcification rates and evolutionary potential under ocean acidification,"Estimates of heritability inform evolutionary potential and the likely outcome of many management actions, but such estimates remain scarce for marine organisms. Here, we report high heritability of calcification rate among the eight most dominant Hawaiian coral species under reduced pH simulating future ocean conditions. Coral colonies were sampled from up to six locations across a natural mosaic in seawater chemistry throughout Hawaiʻi and fragmented into clonal replicates maintained under both ambient and high pCO2 conditions. Broad sense heritability of calcification rates was high among all eight species, ranging from a low of 0.32 in Porites evermanni to a high of 0.61 in Porites compressa. The overall results were inconsistent with short-term acclimatization to the local environment or adaptation to the mean or ideal conditions. Similarly, in ‘local vs. foreign’ and ‘home vs. away’ tests there was no clear signature of local adaptation. Instead, the data are most consistent with a protected polymorphism as the mechanism which maintains differential pH tolerance within the populations. Substantial individual variation, coupled with high heritability and large population sizes, imply considerable scope for natural selection and adaptive capacity, which has major implications for evolutionary potential and management of corals in response to climate change."
Predicting Effective Diffusivity of Porous Media from Images by Deep Learning,"We report the application of machine learning methods for predicting the effective diffusivity (De) of two-dimensional porous media from images of their structures. Pore structures are built using reconstruction methods and represented as images, and their effective diffusivity is computed by lattice Boltzmann (LBM) simulations. The datasets thus generated are used to train convolutional neural network (CNN) models and evaluate their performance. The trained model predicts the effective diffusivity of porous structures with computational cost orders of magnitude lower than LBM simulations. The optimized model performs well on porous media with realistic topology, large variation of porosity (0.28–0.98), and effective diffusivity spanning more than one order of magnitude (0.1 ≲ De < 1), e.g., >95% of predicted De have truncated relative error of <10% when the true De is larger than 0.2. The CNN model provides better prediction than the empirical Bruggeman equation, especially for porous structure with small diffusivity. The relative error of CNN predictions, however, is rather high for structures with De < 0.1. To address this issue, the porosity of porous structures is encoded directly into the neural network but the performance is enhanced marginally. Further improvement, i.e., 70% of the CNN predictions for structures with true De < 0.1 have relative error <30%, is achieved by removing trapped regions and dead-end pathways using a simple algorithm. These results suggest that deep learning augmented by field knowledge can be a powerful technique for predicting the transport properties of porous media. Directions for future research of machine learning in porous media are discussed based on detailed analysis of the performance of CNN models in the present work."
Ginsenoside Rb1 exerts antiarrhythmic effects by inhibiting INa and ICaL in rabbit ventricular myocytes,"Ginsenoside Rb1 exerts its pharmacological action by regulating sodium, potassium and calcium ion channels in the membranes of nerve cells. These ion channels are also present in cardiomyocytes, but no studies have been reported to date regarding the effects of Rb1 on cardiac sodium currents (INa), L-type calcium currents (ICaL) and action potentials (APs). Additionally, the antiarrhythmic potential of Rb1 has not been assessed. In this study, we used a whole-cell patch clamp technique to assess the effect of Rb1 on these ion channels. The results showed that Rb1 inhibited INa and ICaL, reduced the action potential amplitude (APA) and maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax), and shortened the action potential duration (APD) in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on the inward rectifier potassium current (IK1), delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) or resting membrane potential (RMP). We also designed a pathological model at the cellular and organ level to verify the role of Rb1. The results showed that Rb1 abolished high calcium-induced delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs), depressed the increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), relieved calcium overload and protected cardiomyocytes. Rb1 can also reduce the occurrence of ventricular premature beats (VPBs) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) in ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury."
Acquisition of chopstick-operation skills with the non-dominant hand and concomitant changes in brain activity,"Despite their common use as eating utensils in East Asia, chopsticks require complex fine motor-skills for adequate operation and are thus most frequently used with the dominant hand; however, the effect of training time on the proficiency of using chopsticks with the non-dominant hand, as well as the brain activity underlying changes in skill, remain unclear. This study characterised the effect of time spent training in chopstick operation with the non-dominant hand on chopstick-use proficiency and the related brain activity to obtain data that may help individuals who are obliged to change handedness due to neurological disease to learn to use their non-dominant hand in performing daily activities. Thirty-two healthy right-handed students were randomly allocated to training (n = 16) or control (n = 16) groups; the former received 6 weeks of training in chopstick use with their non-dominant (left) hand, and the latter received none. After training, significant improvements in the execution speed and smoothness of upper extremity joints were observed in the training group. Moreover, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity significantly decreased, and bilateral premotor cortex activity significantly increased across training. These results indicated that 6 weeks of chopstick training with the non-dominant hand effectively improved chopstick operation."
Regulatory Role of PlaR (YiaJ) for Plant Utilization in Escherichia coli K-12,"Outside a warm-blooded animal host, the enterobacterium Escherichia coli K-12 is also able to grow and survive in stressful nature. The major organic substance in nature is plant, but the genetic system of E. coli how to utilize plant-derived materials as nutrients is poorly understood. Here we describe the set of regulatory targets for uncharacterized IclR-family transcription factor YiaJ on the E. coli genome, using gSELEX screening system. Among a total of 18 high-affinity binding targets of YiaJ, the major regulatory target was identified to be the yiaLMNOPQRS operon for utilization of ascorbate from fruits and galacturonate from plant pectin. The targets of YiaJ also include the genes involved in the utilization for other plant-derived materials as nutrients such as fructose, sorbitol, glycerol and fructoselysine. Detailed in vitro and in vivo analyses suggest that L-ascorbate and α-D-galacturonate are the effector ligands for regulation of YiaJ function. These findings altogether indicate that YiaJ plays a major regulatory role in expression of a set of the genes for the utilization of plant-derived materials as nutrients for survival. PlaR was also suggested to play protecting roles of E. coli under stressful environments in nature, including the formation of biofilm. We then propose renaming YiaJ to PlaR (regulator of plant utilization)."
Developing a Fuzzy Verification Method of Performance Improvement Using Satisfaction Index,"Performance evaluation matrix (PEM) has captured many scholars’ attention and has been widely used to a variety of industry fields to evaluate their efficiency performance. The data mainly come from the collection of questionnaires in which customers’ varied opinions are enquired; however, Likert scale will be modified to fuzzy linguistic scale due to some uncertainty aspect in the linguistic data. In contrast, the major flaw of some researches was that they failed to present a verification approach with statistical inference to confirm the effectiveness of the improvement. Regarding to the related issues, Chen et al. (2018a) use discrimination index in reliance section to establish fuzzy membership function; subsequently, they propose fuzzy hypothesis testing to locate critical-to-quality (CTQ) so as to make further improvement. Following the same logic, this paper uses the identical process to develop the fuzzy verification method of the improvement efficiency for CTQ. Finally, this paper puts forward a numerical example to demonstrate application of the proposed verification model. The result means that there is sufficient evidence showing that performance improvement is poor and non-effective. Thus, manager should adopt otherwise measures to improve. Obviously, the method proposed particularly highlights the reduction of sampling error, shies away from the complexity inherent in fuzzy semantic collection, overcomes the uncertainty in the collected data, and increases the reliability of evaluation method."
Protective effects of fennel essential oil against oxidative stress and genotoxicity induced by the insecticide triflumuron in human colon carcinoma cells,"The increased use of pesticides is the origin of multiple damages to the environment and to humans; thus, the search for new strategies to reduce or even protect the toxic effects caused by these synthetic products became a necessity. In this context, our study attempted to evaluate the protective effects of fennel essential oil (FEO), the main essential oil extracted from Faeniculum vulgare Mill., a plant with aromatic, flavorful, and medicinal uses, against toxicity induced by an insecticide—triflumuron (TFM)—in human carcinoma cells (HCT116). Our methodological approach consists of the cytotoxicity assay starting with the cell viability test, the ROS generation, the malondialdehyde (MDA) production, the DNA fragmentation, and the measurement of some antioxidant enzymes activities such as catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Also, we measured the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. The outcome of the current study showed clearly that after 2 h of HCT 116 cell pretreatment with FEO, there were increase in cell viability, reduction in ROS generation, and modulation in CAT and SOD activities induced by TFM. In the same manner, significant decreases in MDA levels were found. Mainly, the results indicated a perceptible decrease in DNA damages and a significant reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential loss. Our work demonstrates that FEO can be an important protector against toxic effects induced by TFM in HCT 116 cells."
Determining the carrying capacity and environmental risks of livestock and poultry breeding in coastal areas of eastern China: an empirical model,"The scale of regional livestock and poultry breeding (LPB) is generally not determined by the supporting capacity (fodder supply), but by the environmental carrying capacity of wastes from the LPB. The soil’s own nutrient-supplying capacity used to be overlooked, which consequently produced an inaccurate result of carrying capacity estimation of the LPB. An empirical method was, therefore, employed to evaluate the soil’s own nutrient-supplying capacity and further determine the carrying capacity and environmental risks of the LPB accurately. Thirteen counties along the coast of Jiangsu were selected to conduct this study, according to the framework of planting-breeding balance. Our results indicate that, including the soil’s own nutrient-supplying capacity in the estimation of the carrying capacity of the LPB, it can reduce the original carrying capacity by 50%. This suggests that our empirical method can significantly increase the accuracy of estimating the carrying capacity of the LPB. The carrying capacity of the LPB in the study area varies from 1.5 to 48.08 pigs/hm2, with a mean of 14 pigs/hm2 based on phosphorus (P) balance. Furthermore, four sub-regions (Ganyu, Dongtai, Dafeng, and Guannan) that have a high P pollution risk should focus on controlling the scale of the LPB. The nitrogen (N) pollution risk in the study area is generally low. Results suggest that the soil’s own nutrient-supplying capacity plays an important role in estimating the carrying capacity of the LPB accurately. This study can provide insights on reducing environmental risks of the LPB, which may be beneficial for decision makers."
Manure amendment increased the abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs but suppressed the type I methanotrophs in rice paddies,"Methane (CH4) emission is the consequence of CH4 production and consumption performed by methanogens and methanotrophs, respectively. Fertilization is an important factor that regulates the behavior of methanogens and methanotrophs; however, the effect of manure and rice straw addition combined with inorganic fertilizers on these communities is not well understood. This study aimed to explore how manure and rice straw amendments together with inorganic fertilizers influenced the methanogenic and methanotrophic communities in a 31-year fertilized rice paddy. Manure amendment significantly increased the abundance of mcrA and pmoA genes by 61.2% and 63.3% compared with the unfertilized control, whereas inorganic NPK fertilization alone or rice straw addition did not affect their abundances. Manure and rice straw amendments greatly decreased the Shannon index and ACE index of the methanogenic communities, whereas inorganic NPK fertilization alone increased the ACE index of the methanotrophic communities compared with the unfertilized control. Methanosarcinaceae and Methylococcaceae dominated at the family level, representing 23.1–35.0% and 48.7–67.2% of the total reads, for the methanogenic and methanotrophic communities, respectively. Application of manure together with inorganic fertilizers suppressed the Methanocellales methanogens and the type I methanotrophs (Methylococcus and Methylobacter). Fertilization greatly altered the community structure of methanogens and methanotrophs, and manure addition had more apparent effects than rice straw. Moreover, total nitrogen, soil organic carbon, available phosphorus, and available potassium correlated significantly to the abundance, composition, and community structure of methanogens and methanotrophs. In conclusion, our study revealed that long-term manure amendment in combination with inorganic fertilizers significantly increased the abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs, but suppressed the type I methanotrophs in rice paddies."
Effects of Chikungunya virus immunity on Mayaro virus disease and epidemic potential,"Mayaro virus (MAYV) causes an acute febrile illness similar to that produced by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an evolutionary relative in the Semliki Forest virus complex of alphaviruses. MAYV emergence is typically sporadic, but recent isolations and outbreaks indicate that the virus remains a public health concern. Given the close phylogenetic and antigenic relationship between CHIKV and MAYV, and widespread distribution of CHIKV, we hypothesized that prior CHIKV immunity may affect MAYV pathogenesis and/or influence its emergence potential. We pre-exposed immunocompetent C57BL/6 and immunocompromised A129 or IFNAR mice to wild-type CHIKV, two CHIKV vaccines, or a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine, and challenged with MAYV. We observed strong cross-protection against MAYV for mice pre-exposed to wild-type CHIKV, and moderately but significantly reduced cross-protection from CHIKV-vaccinated animals. Immunity to other alphavirus or flavivirus controls provided no protection against MAYV disease or viremia. Mechanistic studies suggested that neutralizing antibodies alone can mediate this protection, with T-cells having no significant effect on diminishing disease. Finally, human sera obtained from naturally acquired CHIKV infection cross-neutralized MAYV at high titers in vitro. Altogether, our data suggest that CHIKV infection can confer cross-protective effects against MAYV, and the resultant reduction in viremia may limit the emergence potential of MAYV."

Ginsenoside Rb1 exerts antiarrhythmic effects by inhibiting INa and ICaL in rabbit ventricular myocytes,"Ginsenoside Rb1 exerts its pharmacological action by regulating sodium, potassium and calcium ion channels in the membranes of nerve cells. These ion channels are also present in cardiomyocytes, but no studies have been reported to date regarding the effects of Rb1 on cardiac sodium currents (INa), L-type calcium currents (ICaL) and action potentials (APs). Additionally, the antiarrhythmic potential of Rb1 has not been assessed. In this study, we used a whole-cell patch clamp technique to assess the effect of Rb1 on these ion channels. The results showed that Rb1 inhibited INa and ICaL, reduced the action potential amplitude (APA) and maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax), and shortened the action potential duration (APD) in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on the inward rectifier potassium current (IK1), delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) or resting membrane potential (RMP). We also designed a pathological model at the cellular and organ level to verify the role of Rb1. The results showed that Rb1 abolished high calcium-induced delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs), depressed the increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), relieved calcium overload and protected cardiomyocytes. Rb1 can also reduce the occurrence of ventricular premature beats (VPBs) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) in ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury."
Integrative genomics reveal a role for MCPIP1 in adipogenesis and adipocyte metabolism,"Obesity is considered a serious chronic disease, associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-induced protein-1 (MCPIP1) is an RNase decreasing stability of transcripts coding for inflammation-related proteins. In addition, MCPIP1 plays an important role in the regulation of adipogenesis in vitro by reducing the expression of key transcription factors, including C/EBPβ. To elucidate the role of MCPIP1 in adipocyte biology, we performed RNA-Seq and proteome analysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing wild-type (WTMCPIP1) and the mutant form of MCPIP1 protein (D141NMCPIP1). Our RNA-Seq analysis followed by confirmatory Q-RT-PCR revealed that elevated MCPIP1 levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes upregulated transcripts encoding proteins involved in signal transmission and cellular remodeling and downregulated transcripts of factors involved in metabolism. These data are consistent with our proteomic analysis, which showed that MCPIP1 expressing adipocytes exhibit upregulation of proteins involved in cellular organization and movement and decreased levels of proteins involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Moreover, MCPIP1 adipocytes are characterized by decreased level of insulin receptor, reduced insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation, as well as depleted Glut4 level and impaired glucose uptake. Overexpression of Glut4 in 3T3-L1 cells expressed WTMCPIP1 rescued adipogenesis. Interestingly, we found decreased level of MCPIP1 along with an increase in body mass index in subcutaneous adipose tissue. The presented data show a novel role of MCPIP1 in modulating insulin sensitivity in adipocytes. Overall, our findings demonstrate that MCPIP1 is an important regulator of adipogenesis and adipocyte metabolism."
Obstacles open the door — Negative shocks can motivate individuals to focus on opportunities,"By responding to the call for research on negative career shocks and future time perspective, this study regarded internal social capital as a tool of resource retention which shifts attention to negative career shocks’ positive effects. We test a moderated mediation model which illustrates the effect of negative career shocks on focus on opportunities—positive dimension of occupational future time perspective. Results revealed that internal social capital acts as the mediator between negative career shocks and focus on opportunities, and organizational embeddedness moderats the mediation effect. The relationship is stronger when individuals are highly embedded in organizations."
A multilevel and dynamic model of intragroup conflict and decision making: application of agent-based modeling,"Although intragroup conflict has both multilevel and dynamic natures, less attention has been paid to establishing a holistic model of intragroup conflict that emerges across levels and unfolds over time. To address this research gap, we extend the multilevel view of intragroup conflict (Korsgaard et al. 2008) to develop a multilevel and dynamic model of intragroup conflict that explicitly includes (1) the role of time and (2) the feedback loop to encompass the dynamic aspect of intragroup conflict. We further instantiate the extended model in the context of team decision-making. To achieve this and systematically examine the complex relationships, we use agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS). We directly investigate how two types of intragroup conflict—task and relationship conflict—interplay with cross-level antecedences, interrelate and develop over time, and affect team outcomes. This study adds to the intragroup conflict research by extending the field with multilevel and dynamic views."
Multivariate Gaussian and Student-t process regression for multi-output prediction,"Gaussian process model for vector-valued function has been shown to be useful for multi-output prediction. The existing method for this model is to reformulate the matrix-variate Gaussian distribution as a multivariate normal distribution. Although it is effective in many cases, reformulation is not always workable and is difficult to apply to other distributions because not all matrix-variate distributions can be transformed to respective multivariate distributions, such as the case for matrix-variate Student-t distribution. In this paper, we propose a unified framework which is used not only to introduce a novel multivariate Student-t process regression model (MV-TPR) for multi-output prediction, but also to reformulate the multivariate Gaussian process regression (MV-GPR) that overcomes some limitations of the existing methods. Both MV-GPR and MV-TPR have closed-form expressions for the marginal likelihoods and predictive distributions under this unified framework and thus can adopt the same optimization approaches as used in the conventional GPR. The usefulness of the proposed methods is illustrated through several simulated and real-data examples. In particular, we verify empirically that MV-TPR has superiority for the datasets considered, including air quality prediction and bike rent prediction. At last, the proposed methods are shown to produce profitable investment strategies in the stock markets."
"Associations between Adolescents’ Interpersonal Relationships, School Well-being, and Academic Achievement during Educational Transitions","A youth’s ability to adapt during educational transitions has long-term, positive impacts on their academic achievement and mental health. Although supportive relationships with parents, peers, and teachers are protective factors associated with successful educational transitions, little is known about the reciprocal link between the quality of these interpersonal relationships and school well-being, with even less known about how these two constructs affect academic achievement. This longitudinal study examined how the quality of interpersonal relationships and school well-being worked together to affect academic achievement during the transition from primary school to lower secondary school. Data were collected from 848 Finnish adolescents (54% girls, mean age at the outset 12.3 years) over the course of sixth and seventh grade. The results support a transactional model illustrating the reciprocal associations between the quality of interpersonal relationships and school well-being during the transition to lower secondary school. As such, the presence of high quality interpersonal relationships promoted higher academic achievement through increased school well-being, whereas high school well-being promoted higher subsequent academic achievement through increased quality of interpersonal relationships. Overall, the results suggest that promoting learning outcomes and helping adolescents with challenges during educational transitions is a critical part of supporting school well-being and the formation of high-quality interpersonal relationships."
Cross-spectral palmprint recognition with low-rank canonical correlation analysis,"As an important biometric trait, palmprint has been widely studied in individual identification. With the popularity of palmprint recognition, many palmprint acquisition devices with different spectra have been designed and applied into practical application, so it is difficult to ensure that the spectra of collectors are consistent during training and testing, which leads to the challenge of cross-spectral palmprint images classification. To address this problem, this paper presents a domain adaptive method based on subspace learning, i.e., low-rank canonical correlation analysis (LRCCA). The proposed method seeks to find the common subspace of cross-spectral palmprint images and capture the low-rank structural relationships in data simultaneously. We perform the experiment on the multi-spectral palmprint dataset with 12 cross-spectral palmprint recognition tasks. The experimental results show that our method achieves the promising results in both identification and verification and outperforms the classical transfer learning methods and deep canonical component analysis (DCCA)."
Viscoelastic analysis of the creep characteristics of interlayered rock specimens under uniaxial compression,"Creep properties of interlayered rock mass often encountered in rock engineering, significantly affect the safety and long-term stability of practical engineering. In this study, the theoretical equations of creep strain for interlayered rock specimens when the uniaxial compression loading was applied perpendicular to or parallel with bedding plane were derived. The laws of viscoelastic deformation for soft-hard interlayered rock specimens, soft-soft interlayered rock specimens and hard-hard interlayered rock specimens were also discussed, respectively. The creep deformation characteristics obtained from the numerical simulation and the theoretical analyses were consistent, confirming the correctness of the calculation method proposed in this paper. The results showed that the viscoelastic deformation of interlayered rock specimens was not only related to the volume ratio of rock layers, but it also was affected by the spatial position of the layered structure. In addition, creep properties of hard and soft rock layers were characterized by stable creep model and unstable creep model, respectively. The influences of volume content, number of strips, buried depth, spacing and angle of soft rock interlayer on the creep properties of soft-hard interlayered rock specimens were also analyzed."
Electrostatic Tuning of Anion Attraction from the Cytoplasm to the Pore of the CFTR Chloride Channel,"Anions enter from the cytoplasm into the channel pore of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channel not via a central pathway but via a single lateral portal or fenestration. High Cl− conductance is dependent on electrostatic attraction of cytoplasmic Cl− ions by four positively charged amino acid side-chains located within this portal. Here we use a mutagenic approach to investigate the functional effects of transplanting or supplementing these positive charges at nearby portal-lining sites. Using patch clamp recording, we find that the functionally important positive charges at K190 and R303 can be transplanted to four nearby sites (N186, L197, W356, and A367) with little loss of Cl− conductance. Introduction of additional positive charge at these sites had almost no effect on Cl− conductance, but did increase the sensitivity to channel block by intracellular suramin and Pt(NO2)42− anions. We suggest that it is the number of positive charges within the portal, rather than their exact location, that is the most important factor influencing Cl− conductance. The portal appears well optimized in terms of charge distribution to maximize Cl− conductance."
“Spotting the signs” of trafficking recruitment online: exploring the characteristics of advertisements targeted at migrant job-seekers,"Despite considerable concern about how human trafficking offenders may use the Internet to recruit their victims, arrange logistics or advertise services, the Internet-trafficking nexus remains unclear. This study explored the prevalence and correlates of a set of commonly-used indicators of labour trafficking in online job advertisements. Taking a case study approach, we focused on a major Lithuanian website aimed at people seeking work abroad. We examined a snapshot of job advertisements (n = 430), assessing both their general characteristics (e.g. industry, destination country) and the presence of trafficking indicators. The vast majority (98.4%) contained at least one indicator, suggesting certain ""indicators"" may in fact be commonplace characteristics of this labour market. Inferential statistical tests revealed significant but weak relationships between the advertisements’ characteristics and the number and nature of indicators present. While there may be value in screening job advertisements to identify potential labour trafficking and exploitation, additional information is needed to ascertain actual labour trafficking. We conclude with an outlook on automated approaches to identifying cases of possible trafficking and a discussion of the benefits and ethical concerns of a data science-driven approach."
How much does the rainfall temporal resolution affect rainfall thresholds for landslide triggering?,"In many areas of the world, the prediction of rainfall-induced landslides is usually carried out by means of empirical rainfall thresholds. Their definition is complicated by several issues, among which are the evaluation and quantification of diverse uncertainties resulting from data and methods. Threshold effectiveness and reliability strongly depend on the quality and quantity of rainfall measurements and landslide information used as input. In this work, the influence of the temporal resolution of rainfall measurements on the calculation of landslide-triggering rainfall thresholds is evaluated and discussed. For the purpose, hourly rainfall measurements collected by 172 rain gauges and geographical and temporal information on the occurrence of 561 rainfall-induced landslides in Liguria region (northern Italy) in the period 2004–2014 are used. To assess the impact of different temporal resolutions on the thresholds, rainfall measurements are clustered in increasing bins of 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h. A comprehensive tool is applied to each dataset to automatically reconstruct the rainfall conditions responsible for the failures and to calculate frequentist cumulated event rainfall–rainfall duration (ED) thresholds. Then, using a quantitative procedure, the calculated ED thresholds are validated. The main finding of the work is that the use of rainfall measurements with different temporal resolutions results in considerable variations of the shape and the validity range of the thresholds. Decreasing the rainfall temporal resolution, thresholds with smaller intercepts, higher slopes, shorter ranges of validity and higher uncertainties are obtained. On the other hand, it seems that the rainfall temporal resolution does not influence the validation procedure and the threshold performance indicators. Overall, the use of rainfall data with coarse temporal resolution causes a systematic underestimation of thresholds at short durations, resulting in relevant drawbacks (e.g. false alarms) if the thresholds are implemented in operational systems for landslide prediction."
Symbiosis extended: exchange of photosynthetic O2 and fungal-respired CO2 mutually power metabolism of lichen symbionts,"Lichens are a symbiosis between a fungus and one or more photosynthetic microorganisms that enables the symbionts to thrive in places and conditions they could not compete independently. Exchanges of water and sugars between the symbionts are the established mechanisms that support lichen symbiosis. Herein, we present a new linkage between algal photosynthesis and fungal respiration in lichen Flavoparmelia caperata that extends the physiological nature of symbiotic co-dependent metabolisms, mutually boosting energy conversion rates in both symbionts. Measurements of electron transport by oximetry show that photosynthetic O2 is consumed internally by fungal respiration. At low light intensity, very low levels of O2 are released, while photosynthetic electron transport from water oxidation is normal as shown by intrinsic chlorophyll variable fluorescence yield (period-4 oscillations in flash-induced Fv/Fm). The rate of algal O2 production increases following consecutive series of illumination periods, at low and with limited saturation at high light intensities, in contrast to light saturation in free-living algae. We attribute this effect to arise from the availability of more CO2 produced by fungal respiration of photosynthetically generated sugars. We conclude that the lichen symbionts are metabolically coupled by energy conversion through exchange of terminal electron donors and acceptors used in both photosynthesis and fungal respiration. Algal sugars and O2 are consumed by the fungal symbiont, while fungal delivered CO2 is consumed by the alga."
From civilian service to military service: what led policy-makers to remove nursing care from field units of the Israeli defense force (IDF) and return it later?,"From the very onset, Israeli military nurses served in supporting positions on the front lines, shoulder to shoulder with men. When the IDF was established in 1948, nurses were sent to serve near areas of conflict and were not included in compulsory military service in field units. Once the military hospitals were closed in 1949, nursing in the Medical Corps lost a clear military purpose, and its main contribution was in the civilian arena. From 1949 until 2000, most recruited military nurses operated their mandatory service mainly in a civilian framework according to the integration agreement between the ministry of defense to the ministry of health. Between 2000 to 2018, military nurses served at home front military clinics and in headquarters jobs at the Medicine Corps. In2018, the Medical Corps decided to integrate military nurses into the Israeli military service in order to cope with the shortage of military physicians, among other things, and ensure appropriate availability of medical and health services for military units.. This study examines, for the first time, the considerations that led to the closure of military hospitals and the transfer of the military service of nurses in the IDF to the Ministry of Health in 1949 and the decision in 2018 to return the military nurses to the field’s military battalions."
Optimization and scale-up production of Zika virus ΔNS1 in Escherichia coli: application of Response Surface Methodology,"Diagnosing Zika virus (ZIKV) infections has been challenging due to the cross-reactivity of induced antibodies with other flavivirus. The concomitant occurrence of ZIKV and Dengue virus (DENV) in endemic regions requires diagnostic tools with the ability to distinguish these two viral infections. Recent studies demonstrated that immunoassays using the C-terminal fragment of ZIKV NS1 antigen (ΔNS1) can be used to discriminate ZIKV from DENV infections. In order to be used in serological tests, the expression/solubility of ΔNS1 and growth of recombinant E. coli strain were optimized by Response Surface Methodology. Temperature, time and IPTG concentration were evaluated. According to the model, the best condition determined in small scale cultures was 21 °C for 20 h with 0.7 mM of IPTG, which predicted 7.5 g/L of biomass and 962 mg/L of ΔNS1. These conditions were validated and used in a 6-L batch in the bioreactor, which produced 6.4 g/L of biomass and 500 mg/L of ΔNS1 in 12 h of induction. The serological ELISA test performed with purified ΔNS1 showed low cross-reactivity with antibodies from DENV-infected human subjects. Denaturation of ΔNS1 decreased the detection of anti-ZIKV antibodies, thus indicating the contribution of conformational epitopes and confirming the importance of properly folded ΔNS1 for the specificity of the serological analyses. Obtaining high yields of soluble ΔNS1 supports the viability of an effective serologic diagnostic test capable of differentiating ZIKV from other flavivirus infections."
Drive for muscularity behaviors in male bodybuilders: a trans-contextual model of motivation,"The drive for muscularity behaviors are very common in male athletes, especially in male bodybuilders.

The work of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung (KAS) in Northeast Asia,"Northeast Asia contains several geopolitical hot spots, which alone or in combination, have a high risk potential for regional and global security. The rising assertiveness of the PR China, shifting economic weights, the need for a comprehensive economic transformation in an age of digitalisation and demographic shifts - these challenges shape the future of all Northeast Asian nations."
Entrepreneurs’ imprint: survival and sustainable development of private aesthetic plastic surgery hospitals in China,"Recently, the private aesthetic plastic surgery industry in China is developing rapidly and has become the fourth largest service industry of the country which contributes to 1.2% portion of the national GDP and helps to improve employment. Thus, the sustainable development of the industry plays an important role in the sustainability of the Chinese economy which is a problem that cannot be ignored. From the perspective of organizational imprinting, this paper selects seven newly established private aesthetic plastic surgery hospitals in central China as research samples and applies semi-structured interview and content analysis to investigate the relationship between personal characteristics of entrepreneurs and survival trajectories of these hospitals. Results show that entrepreneurs’ imprint takes effect in the course of establishing a new hospital through entrepreneurial motivation and initial strategy. Specifically, entrepreneurs’ age, educational background, geographical identity and industry experience all contribute to the entrepreneurial success. In addition, entrepreneurs’ imprint may be effective in the initial and early stage and then fades away with environmental changes. Corporate strategy is a useful complement to entrepreneurs’ imprint afterwards."
Platelet/lymphocyte ratio and mean platelet volume in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis,"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a granulomatous necrotizing vasculitis with high morbidity and mortality. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody is a valuable diagnostic marker, however its titer lacks predictive value for the severity of organ involvement. Platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and mean platelet volume (MPV) has been regarded as a potential marker in assessing systemic inflammation. We aimed to explore the value of PLR and MPV in the assessment of disease activity and manifestations of disease in GPA."
"Role of lunar laser ranging in realization of terrestrial, lunar, and ephemeris reference frames","Three possible applications of lunar laser ranging to space geodesy are studied. First, the determination of daily Earth orientation parameters (UT0 and variation of latitude) is rarely used nowadays in the presence of all-year VLBI, SLR, and GNSS data. The second application is the determination of two (out of three) lunar orientation parameters, i.e., daily corrections to the rotational ephemeris of the Moon. It may be of importance for future lunar satellite-based navigational systems. The third application is the tie of the ephemeris frame to the ICRF. It has been studied before, though in this work it is extensively compared to another realization of the same tie, obtained by spacecraft VLBI observations; also, two different EOP series and two different models of tidal variations in geopotential are applied, with different outcomes on the tie. The EPM lunar–planetary ephemeris, along with its underlying dynamical model and software, was used to obtain the presented results. All available observations were processed, since the earliest made at the end of 1969 at the McDonald observatory till the end of July 2019 (Matera, Grasse and also Wettzell observatory which began to provide data in 2018). The results and some open questions are discussed."
ZDOG: zooming in on dominating genes with mutations in cancer pathways,Inference of cancer-causing genes and their biological functions are crucial but challenging due to the heterogeneity of somatic mutations. The heterogeneity of somatic mutations reveals that only a handful of oncogenes mutate frequently and a number of cancer-causing genes mutate rarely.
Alignment-free genomic sequence comparison using FCGR and signal processing,"Alignment-free methods of genomic comparison offer the possibility of scaling to large data sets of nucleotide sequences comprised of several thousand or more base pairs. Such methods can be used for purposes of deducing “nearby” species in a reference data set, or for constructing phylogenetic trees."
An efficient gene selection method for microarray data based on LASSO and BPSO,"The main goal of successful gene selection for microarray data is to find compact and predictive gene subsets which could improve the accuracy. Though a large pool of available methods exists, selecting the optimal gene subset for accurate classification is still very challenging for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer."
Protein sequence information extraction and subcellular localization prediction with gapped k-Mer method,"Subcellular localization prediction of protein is an important component of bioinformatics, which has great importance for drug design and other applications. A multitude of computational tools for proteins subcellular location have been developed in the recent decades, however, existing methods differ in the protein sequence representation techniques and classification algorithms adopted."
A novel method detecting the key clinic factors of portal vein system thrombosis of splenectomy & cardia devascularization patients for cirrhosis & portal hypertension,"Portal vein system thrombosis (PVST) is potentially fatal for patients if the diagnosis is not timely or the treatment is not proper. There hasn’t been any available technique to detect clinic risk factors to predict PVST after splenectomy in cirrhotic patients. The aim of this study is to detect the clinic risk factors of PVST for splenectomy and cardia devascularization patients for liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension, and build an efficient predictive model to PVST via the detected risk factors, by introducing the machine learning method. We collected 92 clinic indexes of splenectomy plus cardia devascularization patients for cirrhosis and portal hypertension, and proposed a novel algorithm named as RFA-PVST (Risk Factor Analysis for PVST) to detect clinic risk indexes of PVST, then built a SVM (support vector machine) predictive model via the detected risk factors. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-measure, FPR (false positive rate), FNR (false negative rate), FDR (false discovery rate), AUC (area under ROC curve) and MCC (Matthews correlation coefficient) were adopted to value the predictive power of the detected risk factors. The proposed RFA-PVST algorithm was compared to mRMR, SVM-RFE, Relief, S-weight and LLEScore. The statistic test was done to verify the significance of our RFA-PVST."
Modelling TERT regulation across 19 different cancer types based on the MIPRIP 2.0 gene regulatory network approach,"Reactivation of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene TERT is a central feature for unlimited proliferation of the majority of cancers. However, the underlying regulatory processes are only partly understood."
Expression analysis of Rab11 during zebrafish embryonic development,"Rab proteins are GTPases responsible for intracellular vesicular trafficking regulation. Rab11 proteins, members of the Rab GTPase family, are known to regulate vesicular recycling during embryonic development. In zebrafish, there are 3 rab11 paralogues, known as rab11a, rab11ba and rab11bb, sharing high identity with each other. However, the expression analysis of rab11 is so far lacking."
Detection and application of genome-wide variations in peach for association and genetic relationship analysis,"Peach (Prunus persica L.) is a diploid species and model plant of the Rosaceae family. In the past decade, significant progress has been made in peach genetic research via DNA markers, but the number of these markers remains limited."
Effects of cage and floor rearing system on the factors of antioxidant defense and inflammatory injury in laying ducks,"Cage-rearing in laying ducks, as a novel rearing system, not only fundamentally solves the pollution problem of the duck industry and improve bio-safety and product quality but also exhibits more benefits by implementing standardized production compared with the floor-rearing. Of course, this system also brings some welfare problems and stress injuries to layers due to lack of water environment and limited activities in the cages. However, the effects on the factors of antioxidant defense and inflammatory injury in the early cage stage are not well-understood."
Chicken adaptive response to low energy diet: main role of the hypothalamic lipid metabolism revealed by a phenotypic and multi-tissue transcriptomic approach,"Production conditions of layer chicken can vary in terms of temperature or diet energy content compared to the controlled environment where pure-bred selection is undertaken. The aim of this study was to better understand the long-term effects of a 15%-energy depleted diet on egg-production, energy homeostasis and metabolism via a multi-tissue transcriptomic analysis. Study was designed to compare effects of the nutritional intervention in two layer chicken lines divergently selected for residual feed intake."
Clonal reconstruction from time course genomic sequencing data,"Bacterial cells during many replication cycles accumulate spontaneous mutations, which result in the birth of novel clones. As a result of this clonal expansion, an evolving bacterial population has different clonal composition over time, as revealed in the long-term evolution experiments (LTEEs). Accurately inferring the haplotypes of novel clones as well as the clonal frequencies and the clonal evolutionary history in a bacterial population is useful for the characterization of the evolutionary pressure on multiple correlated mutations instead of that on individual mutations."
ManiNetCluster: a novel manifold learning approach to reveal the functional links between gene networks,"The coordination of genomic functions is a critical and complex process across biological systems such as phenotypes or states (e.g., time, disease, organism, environmental perturbation). Understanding how the complexity of genomic function relates to these states remains a challenge. To address this, we have developed a novel computational method, ManiNetCluster, which simultaneously aligns and clusters gene networks (e.g., co-expression) to systematically reveal the links of genomic function between different conditions. Specifically, ManiNetCluster employs manifold learning to uncover and match local and non-linear structures among networks, and identifies cross-network functional links."
Genome sequencing of Mycobacterium pinnipedii strains: genetic characterization and evidence of superinfection in a South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens),"Mycobacterium pinnipedii, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTBC), is capable of infecting several host species, including humans. Recently, ancient DNA from this organism was recovered from pre-Columbian mummies of Peru, sparking debate over the origin and frequency of tuberculosis in the Americas prior to European colonization."
The transcriptomic signature of low aggression in honey bees resembles a response to infection,"Behavior reflects an organism’s health status. Many organisms display a generalized suite of behaviors that indicate infection or predict infection susceptibility. We apply this concept to honey bee aggression, a behavior that has been associated with positive health outcomes in previous studies. We sequenced the transcriptomes of the brain, fat body, and midgut of adult sibling worker bees who developed as pre-adults in relatively high versus low aggression colonies. Previous studies showed that this pre-adult experience impacts both aggressive behavior and resilience to pesticides. We performed enrichment analyses on differentially expressed genes to determine whether variation in aggression resembles the molecular response to infection. We further assessed whether the transcriptomic signature of aggression in the brain is similar to the neuromolecular response to acute predator threat, exposure to a high-aggression environment as an adult, or adult behavioral maturation."
De novo sequencing of the transcriptome reveals regulators of the floral transition in Fargesia macclureana (Poaceae),"Fargesia macclureana (Poaceae) is a woody bamboo species found on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) approximately 2000 ~ 3800 m above sea level. It rarely blossoms in the QTP, but it flowered 20 days after growing in our lab, which is in a low-altitude area outside the QTP. To date, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism of bamboo flowering, and no studies of flowering have been conducted on wild bamboo plants growing in extreme environments. Here, we report the first de novo transcriptome sequence for F. macclureana to investigate the putative mechanisms underlying the flowering time control used by F. macclureana to adapt to its environment."
Sketch distance-based clustering of chromosomes for large genome database compression,"The rapid development of Next-Generation Sequencing technologies enables sequencing genomes with low cost. The dramatically increasing amount of sequencing data raised crucial needs for efficient compression algorithms. Reference-based compression algorithms have exhibited outstanding performance on compressing single genomes. However, for the more challenging and more useful problem of compressing a large collection of n genomes, straightforward application of these reference-based algorithms suffers a series of issues such as difficult reference selection and remarkable performance variation."
An ancestry informative marker panel design for individual ancestry estimation of Hispanic population using whole exome sequencing data,"Europeans and American Indians were major genetic ancestry of Hispanics in the U.S. These ancestral groups have markedly different incidence rates and outcomes in many types of cancers. Therefore, the genetic admixture may cause biased genetic association study with cancer susceptibility variants specifically in Hispanics. For example, the incidence rate of liver cancer has been shown with substantial disparity between Hispanic, Asian and non-Hispanic white populations. Currently, ancestry informative marker (AIM) panels have been widely utilized with up to a few hundred ancestry-informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to infer ancestry admixture. Notably, current available AIMs are predominantly located in intron and intergenic regions, while the whole exome sequencing (WES) protocols commonly used in translational research and clinical practice do not cover these markers. Thus, it remains challenging to accurately determine a patient’s admixture proportion without additional DNA testing."
Diphenylalanine Peptide Nanowires as a Substrate for Neural Cultures,"Primary brain cells cultured on flat surfaces, i.e., in a two-dimensional fashion, have a long history of use as an experimental model system in neuroscience research. However, it is questionable to which extent these cultured brain cells resemble their in vivo counterparts. Mainly, it has been claimed that the non-oxidative glucose metabolism reflected by lactate production is unphysiologically high. Furthermore, it is known that culturing in 2D alters the phenotype of cells. Here we present diphenylalanine peptide nanowires (PNWs) as a culturing substrate for primary neocortical neurons from mice. The topology of the PNWs leads to neuronal cultures developing in 2.5D environment and hence improved culturing conditions. We investigate the effect of different concentrations of PNWs and different cell densities of neurons on the culturing conditions. The neocortical neurons were examined through scanning electron microscopy in order to study the effect of PNW concentrations and neuron densities on the structural appearance of the cells. Then employing the optimal combination of neuron density and PNW concentration, the neurons were evaluated functionally and metabolically by comparison with neocortical neurons standard culturing methods in 2D. Specifically, we tested neuronal viability, capacity for vesicular release of neurotransmitter GABA, as well as oxidative and non-oxidative glucose metabolism. It was evident that neurons cultured on PNWs exhibited increased viability combined with an increased capacity for neurotransmitter release and a lower fraction of non-oxidative metabolism than neurons cultured in 2D. Hence, neocortical neurons cultured in 2.5D on PNWs appear to be healthier and less glycolytic than neurons cultured in 2D."
Quantitative evaluation for moisture content of cellulose insulation material in paper/oil system based on frequency dielectric modulus technique,"The moisture evaluation of cellulose insulation material in paper/oil system based on the frequency dielectric spectroscopy (FDS) technique has been of great interest to researchers. However, the electrode polarization effect and conductance effect can “obscure” the relaxation information in the course of the traditional FDS test, which often leads to an unreliable result. The existing researches indicated that the frequency dielectric modulus-M*(ω) could effectively enable the investigation of the relaxation behavior, which might be used to realize the condition evaluation of cellulose insulation materials in paper/oil system. Unfortunately, the M*(ω) has been rarely exploited to evaluate the moisture content (mc%) of cellulose insulation material, and the study on approach for extracting characteristic parameters based on the M*(ω) is also rare. In view of this issue, the present contribution attempt to report an available approach for extracting the characteristic parameters based on the M*(ω), and further investigate the variation laws of mc% versus the above parameters. The findings reveal that the quantitative relationship between mc% and the above parameters can be established by fitting analysis. The feasibility of the proposed parameters for moisture evaluation of cellulose insulation material is demonstrated by the newly prepared cellulose insulation samples. It is interesting to note that the average percentage errors of evaluation results corresponding to the relaxation time constant (τM) and integral value (IV) of the real part of M*(ω) are less than 8%. In that respect, the novelty of this work is that the τM and IV might be used as a potential tool for quantitative evaluation of mc% of cellulose insulation in paper/oil systems."
"More humility, less counterproductive work behaviors? The role of interpersonal justice and trust","Leader humility has emerged as an important topic in understanding the role of leadership in organizations in recent years. Though it was found to enhance subordinates’ work performance and positive work behaviors, we are unaware of the psychological mechanism and boundary conditions underlying leader humility and employees’ negative behaviors toward leaders. Drawing on social exchange theory and using a multistage sample including 273 employees and 55 supervisors in China, we demonstrated a negative indirect effect between leader humility and subordinates’ counterproductive work behaviors toward supervisors (CWB-S) via interpersonal justice and trust in supervisor. Furthermore, we find that leader political skill moderates the effect of leader humility on interpersonal justice and trust in supervisor. The indirect effect of leader humility on subordinates’ CWB-S through interpersonal justice is stronger when leader political skill is high, suggesting a moderated mediation model. Finally, we discuss the theoretical contributions and practical implications of this study, and highlight future directions for research on leader humility."

Study protocol: The Dutch 20|30 Postmeningitis study: a cross-sectional follow-up of two historical childhood bacterial meningitis cohorts on long-term outcomes,"Bacterial meningitis (BM) is a serious, life-threatening infectious disease of the central nervous system that often occurs in young children. The most common severe to moderate sequelae following BM are sensorineural hearing loss, neuromotor disabilities and mental retardation, while subtle sequelae include academic and behavioral disabilities. It is largely unknown whether these more subtle sequelae persist into adolescence and adulthood. Therefore, this study will investigate the very long-term effects of childhood BM in later life. Better understanding of long-term effects and early identification of adverse outcomes after BM are essential for more timely interventions. Additionally, certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with disease severity and might predict adverse sequelae. These include SNPs in genes encoding for pathogen recognition and immune response upon infection. Accordingly, a secondary objective of this study is to investigate the role of genetic variation in BM and use any insights to predict short- and long-term outcomes."

We investigated the association between glucose metabolism and differentiation in advanced thyroid cancer as well as papillary thyroid cancer (PTC)."
"Androgen receptor and FOXA1 coexpression define a “luminal-AR” subtype of feline mammary carcinomas, spontaneous models of breast cancer","Invasive mammary carcinomas that spontaneously develop in female cats are associated with high mortality, and resemble the most aggressive human breast cancers, especially triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Transcriptome studies showed that TNBCs are a heterogeneous group that includes a potentially hormone-dependent subtype named luminal-AR. Some authors proposed an immunohistochemical definition of the luminal-AR subtype, which is not only positive for Androgen Receptor (AR), but also either positive for the transcription factor Forkhead box A1 (FOXA1), or negative for basal markers. The objectives of this study were to describe AR and FOXA1 expressions in feline mammary carcinomas (FMCs), their prognostic value, and if their coexpression could define a “luminal-AR” subtype of triple-negative mammary carcinomas in cats."

Reliable cell and tissue morphology-based diagnosis of endemic Burkitt lymphoma in resource-constrained settings in Ghana,"Endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma, which is a common childhood cancer in areas with intense transmission of Plasmodium falciparum parasites. Early and accurate diagnosis is a prerequisite for successful therapy, but it optimally involves advanced laboratory investigations. These are technologically demanding, expensive, and often difficult to implement in settings where eBL is prevalent. Diagnosis is thus generally based on clinical assessment and morphological examination of tumour biopsies or fine-needle aspirates (FNAs)."

"Stochastic flow models with delays, blocking and applications to multi-intersection traffic light control","We extend Stochastic Flow Models (SFMs), used for a large class of discrete event and hybrid systems, by including the delays which typically arise in flow movements, as well as blocking effects due to space constraints. We apply this framework to the multi-intersection traffic light control problem by including transit delays for vehicles moving from one intersection to the next and possible blocking between two intersections. Using Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) for this SFM with delays and possible blocking, we derive new on-line gradient estimates of several congestion cost metrics with respect to the controllable green and red cycle lengths. The IPA estimators are used to iteratively adjust light cycle lengths to improve performance and, in conjunction with a standard gradient-based algorithm, to obtain optimal values which adapt to changing traffic conditions. We introduce two new cost metrics to better capture congestions and show that the inclusion of delays and possible blocking in our analysis lead to improved performance relative to models that ignore delays and/or blocking effects."
What Should Society Maximise Under Uncertainty?,This paper overviews the research on social decision criteria under uncertainty and attempts to provide insights for future directions.
The role of place in city centre retailing,"City centre offerings, including shopping, restaurants and cafés, and a lively atmosphere are vital place attributes, which together with several other elements create an attractive place. However, city centre retailing is facing serious competition from e-commerce and external shopping malls, and dying city centres appear to have become a worldwide epidemic in the last decade. To retain visitors in the city centre is a prioritized issue and a current topic, for both retail and place branding research. In the present study the role of different elements of city centre retailing in the promotion of a city as a retail destination is explored by analysing photos published on Instagram by a Town Centre Management initiative. The following research question is answered: What role can the place play in city centre retailing? The study is inter-disciplinary, showing how retail attributes and place elements can reinforce each other and together offer opportunities for unique customer experience in a city centre, for the benefit of both retailing and the city brand. Three dominant visual themes of the place’s role in the marketing of a city centre are identified: the place as a frame, the place as a living room, and the place as a stage."
The Evolution of Positive and Negative Affect in a Longitudinal Sample of Children and Adolescents,"This article explores the evolution of Positive and Negative Affect (PA and NA) and their relationship with a single-item measure of overall life satisfaction (OLS) through a five-year longitudinal study on 1696 ten to eighteen-year-olds in Catalonia (Spain). The results, which were obtained through structural equation modelling with a cross-lagged panel, show that mean scores for both PA and the OLS scale decrease with age, while an asymmetrical increasing-with-age trend occurs for NA. These results challenge one aspect of the homeostatic model of well-being, according to which subjective well-being (SWB) remains on a stable baseline. Mean scores for PA and NA tend to moderately predict next year’s scores, prediction capacity being weaker the more years of difference – although it appears to be much weaker for the OLS than for PA and NA. Relationships between affect and the OLS vary only slightly over a 5-year period. The results obtained here shed new light on the role that PA and NA play in children and adolescents’ SWB from a developmental perspective, not only contributing to scientific knowledge in the field but also opening the door to designing interventions that promote their SWB considering how affects evolve during this period of the life cycle."
Managing large distributed dynamic graphs for smart city network applications,"Smart cities and traffic applications can be modelled by dynamic graphs for which vertices or edges can be added, removed or change their properties. In the smart city or traffic monitoring problem, we wish to detect if a city dynamic graph maintains a certain local or global property. Monitoring city large dynamic graphs, is even more complicated. To treat the monitoring problem efficiently we divide a large city graph into sub-graphs. In the distributed monitoring problem we would like to define some local conditions for which the global city graph G maintains a certain property. Furthermore, we would like to detect if a local city change in a sub-graph affect a global graph property. Here we show that turning the graph into a non-trivial one by handling directed graphs, weighted graphs, graphs with nodes that contain different attributes or combinations of these aspects, can be integrated in known urban environment applications. These implementations are demonstrated here in two types of network applications: traffic network application and on-line social network smart city applications. We exemplify these two problems, show their experimental results and characterize efficient monitoring algorithms that can handle them."
Learning versus optimal intervention in random Boolean networks,"Random Boolean Networks (RBNs) are an arguably simple model which can be used to express rather complex behaviour, and have been applied in various domains. RBNs may be controlled using rule-based machine learning, specifically through the use of a learning classifier system (LCS) – an eXtended Classifier System (XCS) can evolve a set of condition-action rules that direct an RBN from any state to a target state (attractor). However, the rules evolved by XCS may not be optimal, in terms of minimising the total cost along the paths used to direct the network from any state to a specified attractor. In this paper, we present an algorithm for uncovering the optimal set of control rules for controlling random Boolean networks. We assign relative costs for interventions and ‘natural’ steps. We then compare the performance of this optimal rule calculator algorithm (ORC) and the XCS variant of learning classifier systems. We find that the rules evolved by XCS are not optimal in terms of total cost. The results provide a benchmark for future improvement."
Comparative photon and proton dosimetry for patients with mediastinal lymphoma in the era of Monte Carlo treatment planning and variable relative biological effectiveness,"Existing pencil beam analytical (PBA) algorithms for proton therapy treatment planning are not ideal for sites with heterogeneous tissue density and do not account for the spatial variations in proton relative biological effectiveness (vRBE). Using a commercially available Monte Carlo (MC) treatment planning system, we compared various dosimetric endpoints between proton PBA, proton MC, and photon treatment plans among patients with mediastinal lymphoma."
Efficacy of Bimin decoction for patients with perennial allergic rhinitis: an open-label non-inferiority randomized controlled trial,"Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common allergic disease. It affects people worldwide and traditional Chinese medicine is becoming popular among AR patients because it has a definite clinical effect and there are few adverse reactions. Lung qi deficiency and cold syndrome (LQDCS) is a frequent type of AR, and the Chinese herbal medicine bimin decoction (BMD) is prescribed for it. This study compared the clinical efficacy of BMD for AR patients with LQDCS to the conventional medicine loratadine and fluticasone nasal spray."
"Transcranial direct current stimulation in management of pain, mood, functionality, and quality of life in patients undergoing hemodialysis: a study protocol for a double-blind controlled randomized trial","Persistent pain can lead to incapacitation requiring long-term pharmacological treatment. Up to 82% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) have chronic pain and most do not respond to usual medication. Advances in non-pharmacological treatments are necessary to promote pain relief without side effects and to restore functionality. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) promises to be a novel, cost-efficient, non-pharmacological treatment for CKD patients with chronic pain. In this study, we hypothesize that tDCS could improve pain, depression, functionality, and quality of life in patients with CKD undergoing HD."

"Can selenium deficiency in Malawi be alleviated through consumption of agro-biofortified maize flour? Study protocol for a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial","Micronutrient deficiencies including selenium (Se) are widespread in Malawi and potentially underlie a substantial disease burden, particularly among poorer and marginalised populations. Concentrations of Se in staple cereal crops can be increased through application of Se fertilisers – a process known as agronomic biofortification (agro-biofortification) – and this may contribute to alleviating deficiencies. The Addressing Hidden Hunger with Agronomy (AHHA) trial aims to establish the efficacy of this approach for improving Se status in rural Malawi."
Effects of perioperative transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation on monocytic HLA-DR expression in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass: study protocol for a double-blind randomized controlled trial,"Cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is known to be associated with a transient postoperative immunosuppression. When severe and persistent, this immune dysfunction predisposes patients to infectious complications, which contributes to a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), and even mortality. Effective prevention and treatment methods are still lacking. Recent studies revealed that acupuncture-related techniques, such as electroacupuncture and transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS), are able to produce effective cardioprotection and immunomodulation in adult and pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, which leads to enhanced recovery. However, whether perioperative application of TEAS, a non-invasive technique, is able to improve immunosuppression of the patients with post-cardiosurgical conditions is unknown. Thus, as a preliminary study, the main objective is to evaluate the effects of TEAS on the postoperative expression of monocytic human leukocyte antigen (-D related) (mHLA-DR), a standardized “global” biomarker of injury or sepsis-associated immunosuppression, in patients receiving on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)."
Genome analysis and knowledge-driven variant interpretation with TGex,"The clinical genetics revolution ushers in great opportunities, accompanied by significant challenges.

Greenhouse gas emissions from synthetic nitrogen manufacture and fertilization for main upland crops in China,"A significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions comes from the manufacture of synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers consumed in crop production processes. And the application of synthetic N fertilizers is recognized as the most important factor contributing to direct N2O emissions from agricultural soils. Based on statistical data and relevant literature, the GHG emissions associated with synthetic N manufacture and fertilization for wheat and maize in different provinces and agricultural regions of China were quantitatively evaluated in the present study."
Prediction of time to prosthesis implantation as a function of joint anatomy in patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip,"Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) can lead to pain and premature secondary osteoarthritis at an early stage. Joint-preserving osteotomy is an established solution to this problem. In contrast, a conservative approach would result in pain persistence, ultimately raising the patients question for a possible date of expected prosthesis implantation."
The impact of data quality and source data verification on epidemiologic inference: a practical application using HIV observational data,"Data audits are often evaluated soon after completion, even though the identification of systematic issues may lead to additional data quality improvements in the future.

The role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the differentiation of benign and malignant adnexal masses,"Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer diagnosis among women worldwide (Prat J, Int J Gynaecol Obstet 124:1–5, 2014) .Although magnetic resonance imaging has been proved to be accurate in characterizing adnexal masses (Pretorius E, et al. Top Magn Reson Imaging 12:131–46, 2001), it is still not conclusive in a considerable number of cases (Fujii S, et al. J Magn Reson Imaging 28:1149–1156, 2008, Thomassin-Naggara I, et al. Eur Radiol 19:1544–1552, 2009) .The aim of this study is to differentiate between benign and malignant adnexal tumors by MR spectroscopy."
Determination of Nitrogen Dioxide by Thin-Film Chemical Sensors Based on CdxPb1 –xS,"The results of a study of sensors based on thin semiconductor films of CdxPb1 – xS solid solutions intended for the determination of nitrogen dioxide in air are described. For a comparative assessment of the composition, morphology, and functional properties of the films, they were synthesized from reaction mixtures containing various cadmium salts. It was found that the maximum response is provided by layers obtained using cadmium acetate, in which the composition of the solid solution differs in the maximum supersaturation level in CdS. The films were formed of crystallites with average sizes of ~200 nm. When the concentration of nitrogen dioxide in air was 0.05‒200 mg/m3, the relative change in the ohmic resistance of sensors ranged from 8 to 80%. It was shown that the threshold concentration of NO2 in air was about 0.02 mg/m3. The reversible nature of the gas adsorption process opens a possibility for the creation of reusable chemical sensors based on CdxPb1 – xS films, differing in a relatively low threshold concentration of NO2 detection and selective response in the presence of significantly higher concentrations of O2, CO2, and H2."
Application of TiO2 Nanoparticles Modified Carbon Paste Electrode for the Determination of Vitamin B2,"In the present work, a modified carbon paste electrode was fabricated by grinding the mixture of graphite powder and paraffin oil (as a binder) with a sufficient amount of TiO2 nanoparticles. The electrochemical behavior of vitamin B2 (riboflavin) was investigated on the surface of the electrode using cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The results showed that the electrochemical response of riboflavin was improved considerably at the modified electrode comparing to the unmodified electrode. Effects of TiO2 percentage, pH value, pulse time, and pulse amplitude were optimized using DPV technique. Under the optimized conditions, a linear dynamic range of 2.4 × 10–6 to 2.4 × 10–4 M with the detection limit of 1.6 × 10–6 M for vitamin B2 was obtained. The effects of some common interferences were examined, and the method was successfully employed to the detection of riboflavin in pharmaceutical formulations."
Studying of Handwritten Strokes Aging Kinetics by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry,"One of central problems of the technical and forensic examination of documents is the determination of the time and sequence of ink depositions by such conventional writing instruments as ballpoint pens. To solve it, it is necessary to obtain information on the composition of the ballpoint pen ink used for recordings, on what qualitative and quantitative changes the ink components underwent in the time after application and under the action of environmental or external sources, such as photo, thermal, UV, IR, or microwave exposure. The purpose of this work was to develop an approach that enables the identification of changes in the composition of inks that occur in the strokes over time and to determine the time dependences ensuring the evaluation of the time of application. The possibilities of liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry in revealing changes in the composition of inks of BIC Original, Corvina 51, and Pilot ballpoint pens were estimated. The dye degradation processes under the effect of UV radiation on strokes was simulated, and the kinetic parameters describing the degree of dye conversion were determined."
Determination of a New Antiulcer Drug in Rat Blood Plasma by Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry,"Synthesis of an innovative drug 9-(2,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-2,3,7,8-tetrahydro-1H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4(6H)-dione (PPI) for the treatment of peptic ulcer with a new mechanism of action has necessitated the pharmacokinetics study of the substance in the blood plasma and investigation of its absorption and elimination processes. This paper describes the development and validation of a technique for the quantitative determination of new compound PPI in rat blood plasma by HPLC/MS. The method of solid-phase extraction is applied to extract PPI from blood plasma in the process of biological sample preparation. The lower limit of quantification is 0.1 ng/mL with a linearity range from 0.1 to 1000 ng/mL. By the developed technique, the sample analysis of rat blood plasma was carried out after the introduction of PPI pharmaceutical substance in a dose of 20 mg/kg, a pharmacokinetic profile of the substance was established, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated in order to judge the degrees and rates of absorption and excretion of the new antiulcer drug in the blood of laboratory rats."
Controlling the Resolution of Static Mass Spectrometers Using Intermediate Slit Diaphragms,"The paper shows how to increase effectively the resolving power and transmission of a static mass spectrometer (i.e., to get an optimal compromise between these two parameters) using the properly positioned intermediate slit diaphragms in order to ensure a minimum loss of sensitivity of the device."
Features of Tryptic Peptides Providing Their Detection and Identification by MALDI Mass Spectrometry,"Characteristics of tryptic peptides that provide the detection and identification of these compounds and corresponding proteins by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix are determined and discussed. Twenty-five proteins are identified; the features of reliably identified peptides are compared to those of the compounds that might be produced by trypsinolysis but were not detected. Two key factors enhancing a possibility of the detection of tryptic peptides are determined. One refers to the basicity of peptides in the gas phase, which is the highest for peptides with the C-terminal arginine residue; this reason for the emergence of significant analytical signals is well known. Another factor contributing to the ionization of peptides in study under MALDI conditions is their hydrophilicity. This result did not correlate with the most conclusions of earlier relevant studies discussed in the article."
"Gas-Chromatographic Retention Indices in GC/MS Identification of Alkyl Dichlorophosphates, Dialkyl Chlorophosphates, and Their Thio Analogues","The determination of a series of analytical parameters for the gas-chromatographic/mass-spectrometric identification of reactive intermediate products of phosphoryl chloride (POCl3) and thiophosphoryl chrolide (PSCl3) interaction with aliphatic alcohols, O-alkyl dichlorophosphates (I), O,O-dialkyl chlorophosphates (II), O-alkyl dichlorothiophosphates (III), and O,O-dialkyl chlorothiophosphates (IV) is considered. The members of these series are not sufficiently presented in contemporary databases; an exception is provided by series (I) and (II), which are characterized with EI mass spectra (NIST MS Database, 2017) for 8 and 19 homologues, respectively. The data set includes EI mass spectra and gas-chromatographic retention indices (RI) on standard nonpolar polydimethylsiloxane stationary phases. Strong differences in the mass spectra of homologues of series (I) depending on the conditions of their registration are revealed. A comparison of RI values for alkyl chlorophosphates and thiophosphates allows the evaluation of increments for the hypothetic substitution of the oxygen atom in the P=O fragment with the sulfur atom (P=S), namely 59 ± 4 and 30 ± 4 for O-alkyl dichloro- and O,O-dialkyl chloroderivatives. The statistical processing of the so-called homologous increments of retention indices leads to average values attributed to a homologous series rather than to individual homologues. Using these values permitted us to evaluate the molecular weights of homologues for which no reliably detected signals of molecular ions are present in EI mass spectra."
Determination of Mercury in Sediments by Slurry Sampling Electrothermal Atomic Absorption Spectrometry,"The concentration of mercury in suspensions of sediments is determined by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ET-AAS) using a novel chemical modifier (ChM) based on activated carbon treated by iron(II) formate. The efficiency of chemical modifiers based on activated carbon, also modified by Ag(I), Au(III), Pd(II), Co(II), and Ni(II) compounds is studied. The optimum conditions are found for the temperature and time program of the atomizer; they prevent mercury losses at the stage of drying sample suspensions and also exclude spectral interferences at the stage of atomization and measurement of the analytical signals. The minimum characteristic mass of mercury (52 pg) is reached using an iron-containing chemical modifier based on activated carbon. The conditions of ET-AAS analysis using this ChM are tested on certified reference materials of sediments and a sample selected near the sea port of Temryuk (Sea of Azov). The limit of detection found by the 3s-test was 0.05 mg/kg and the relative standard deviation was 5% at the concentration of mercury in the sample 149 mg/kg."
Application of Ultrasound-assisted Cloud-point Extraction and Spectrophotometry for Preconcentration and Determination of Trace Amounts of Copper(II) in Beverages,"A new method for preconcentration of trace Cu(II) in beverages before determination by spectrophotometry is presented. The method is based on the ternary complex formation of Cu(II) with Safranin T in presence of pyrogallol at pH 5.5 followed by its extraction into the micellar phase of Triton X-114. The ternary complex was monitored by spectrophotometry at 532 nm. Variables affecting extraction efficiency were evaluated and optimized. Under the optimal conditions, the detection limit was 0.6 µg/L in the range of 2–300 µg/L with sensitivity enhancement of 55 after preconcentration from 15 mL of the sample, and precision was in the range of 2.5–3.9%. The accuracy was verified by the analysis of two certified samples and recovery studies of the spiked samples. The intra- and inter-day precision varied in the ranges of 3.7–4.6 and 3.9–5.2%, respectively. The method was successfully applied to determination of trace Cu(II) in beverages."
On the Correct Averaging of the Equations of Ion Motion in High-Frequency Electric Fields,"The pseudopotential approach is a useful tool for the qualitative description of ion motion in inhomogeneous high-frequency electric fields, often used in mass spectrometric devices. However, in the theoretical study of the motion of ions in high-frequency electric fields with close frequencies, mathematical ambiguity arises, caused by the nonequivalence of different mathematical approaches. The paper considers and compares the time-dependent pseudopotential model and the model of solenoidal (vortex) pseudoforces, that is, vortex drift. The vortex drift model in high-frequency electric fields with close frequencies can be replaced by the model of ion motion in a pseudopotential varying in time. The theory of almost periodic time signals with two characteristic time scales, fast and slow, eliminates the ambiguity in selecting the correct mathematical method for describing ion motion in high-frequency electric fields."
viQC: Visual and Intuitive Quality Control for Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteome Analysis,"Mass spectrometry-based bottom-up proteomics becomes a method of choice in a broad range of biomedical studies. However, because of the growing complexity of the mass spectrometers employed in these studies, there is an increasing need in robust and rapid quality control over the instrument performance. A variety of quality control tools targeting all aspects of LC–MS instrument operation have been developed recently. These tools are typically loaded heavily with a large number of metrics. Many of these metrics are difficult for interpretation for regular users without extensive instrumentation and/or data processing experience. In this work, we introduced a set of simple and intuitively understandable metrics for assessing the quality of proteomic analysis, including the total experimental time and the number of spectral scans, ion accumulation time and intensity in both MS and MS/MS spectra, charge state distribution for precursor peptide ions, and the number of sequential MS/MS scans, etc. These metrics are implemented as an open-source utility, viQC, freely available at hg.theorchromo.ru/viQC. The developed tool has been tested experimentally using data from three different Orbitrap instruments and demonstrated its capability for assessing the possible flaws in the instrument’s operation and subsequent improving the efficiency of proteomic analysis."
"The H3O+(H2O)n Reagent Ion: Calculations of the Structure, Thermodynamic Parameters of Hydration, Equilibrium Composition, and Mobility","The H3O+(H2O)n reagent ion is widely used in ion mobility spectrometry and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry. In this work, calculated data on the structure and properties of the H3O+(H2O)n (n = 0–4) reagent ion are obtained. They are of interest for the study of the regularities of chemical ionization and the prediction and interpretation of ion mobility spectra and mass spectra. Using quantum chemical methods, we calculated the structures and refined the isomeric composition of the H3O+(H2O)n ions. It was found that ions with n = 2, 3, and 4 have 2, 5, and 15 isomers, respectively. The most stable isomers, which possess branched non-cyclic structures with the H3O+ core, were determined. The thermodynamic parameters of hydration reactions of the most stable isomers of H3O+(H2O)n (n = 0–3) ions and the equilibrium composition of the reagent ion in a wide range of temperatures and concentrations of water vapor are computed. The obtained results agree with the available experimental and calculated data. Using the computed structural data and data on the composition of the reagent ion, its mobility was calculated by the trajectory method. The error of calculations is close to the experimental one."
Permanent-Charge Generation Derivatization for the Analysis of Thiols by “Soft” Ionization Mass Spectrometry Methods,"A new method is proposed for the permanent-charge generation derivatization of thiols of different structures by a reaction with haloalkanes and dibromides. It was shown that 1,4-dibromobutane and 1,2-xylylene dibromide are the most effective alkylating agents, providing the formation of a stable five-membered ring with a positively charged sulfur atom. Such cations are readily detected by electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Sulfonium cations were further studied by tandem mass spectrometry using collision-induced dissociation (CID). Typical and specific CID directions for cyclic cations formed from thiols of different structures are revealed. They can be used to identify and quantify thiol analytes by the selected reaction monitoring method."
The higher education space: connecting degree programs from individuals’ choices,"Data on the applicants’ revealed preferences when entering higher education is used as a proxy to build the Higher Education Space (HES) of Portugal (2008–2015) and Chile (2006–2017). The HES is a network that connects pairs of degree programs according to their co-occurrence in the applicants’ preferences. We show that both HES network structures reveal the existence of positive assortment in features such as gender balance, application scores, unemployment levels, academic demand/supply ratio, geographical mobility, and first-year drop-out rates. For instance, if a degree program exhibits a high prevalence of female candidates, its nearest degree programs in the HES will also tend to exhibit a higher prevalence when compared to the prevalence in the entire system. These patterns extend up to two or three links of separation, vanishing, or inverting for increasing distances. Moreover, we show that for demand/supply ratio and application scores a similar pattern occurs for time variations. Finally, we provide evidence that information embedded in the HES is not accessible by merely considering the features of degree programs independently. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the higher education systems at revealing and leveraging its non-trivial underlying organizing principles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first network science approach for improving decision-making and governance in higher education systems."
Open-boundary conditions in the deconfined phase,"In this work, we consider open-boundary conditions at high temperatures, as they can potentially be of help to measure the topological susceptibility. In particular, we measure the extent of the boundary effects at \(T=1.5T_c\) and \(T=2.7T_c\). In the first case, it is larger than at \(T=0\) while we find it to be smaller in the second case. The length of this “boundary zone” is controlled by the screening masses. We use this fact to measure the scalar and pseudo-scalar screening masses at these two temperatures. We observe a mass gap at \(T=1.5T_c\) but not at \(T=2.7T_c\). Finally, we use our pseudo-scalar channel analysis to estimate the topological susceptibility. The results at \(T=1.5T_c\) are in good agreement with the literature. At \(T=2.7T_c\), they appear to suffer from topological freezing, which prevents us from providing a precise determination of the topological susceptibility."
Constraining chameleon field driven warm inflation with Planck 2018 data,"We investigate warm inflationary scenario in which the accelerated expansion of the early Universe is driven by chameleon-like scalar fields. Due to the non-minimal coupling between the scalar field and the matter sector, the energy-momentum tensor of each fluid component is not conserved anymore, and the generalized balance equation is obtained. The new source term in the energy equation can be used to model warm inflation. On the other hand, if the coupling function varies slowly, the model reduces to the standard model used for the description of cold inflation. To test the validity of the warm chameleon inflation model, the results for warm inflationary scenarios are compared with the observational Planck2018 Cosmic Microwave Background data. In this regard, the perturbation parameters such as the amplitude of scalar perturbations, the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio are derived at the horizon crossing in two approximations, corresponding to the weak and strong dissipative regimes. As a general result it turns out that the theoretical predictions of the chameleon warm inflationary scenario are consistent with the Planck 2018 observations."
ZDOG: zooming in on dominating genes with mutations in cancer pathways,Inference of cancer-causing genes and their biological functions are crucial but challenging due to the heterogeneity of somatic mutations.

An efficient gene selection method for microarray data based on LASSO and BPSO,"The main goal of successful gene selection for microarray data is to find compact and predictive gene subsets which could improve the accuracy. Though a large pool of available methods exists, selecting the optimal gene subset for accurate classification is still very challenging for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer."
Protein sequence information extraction and subcellular localization prediction with gapped k-Mer method,"Subcellular localization prediction of protein is an important component of bioinformatics, which has great importance for drug design and other applications. A multitude of computational tools for proteins subcellular location have been developed in the recent decades, however, existing methods differ in the protein sequence representation techniques and classification algorithms adopted."
A novel method detecting the key clinic factors of portal vein system thrombosis of splenectomy & cardia devascularization patients for cirrhosis & portal hypertension,"Portal vein system thrombosis (PVST) is potentially fatal for patients if the diagnosis is not timely or the treatment is not proper. There hasn’t been any available technique to detect clinic risk factors to predict PVST after splenectomy in cirrhotic patients. The aim of this study is to detect the clinic risk factors of PVST for splenectomy and cardia devascularization patients for liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension, and build an efficient predictive model to PVST via the detected risk factors, by introducing the machine learning method. We collected 92 clinic indexes of splenectomy plus cardia devascularization patients for cirrhosis and portal hypertension, and proposed a novel algorithm named as RFA-PVST (Risk Factor Analysis for PVST) to detect clinic risk indexes of PVST, then built a SVM (support vector machine) predictive model via the detected risk factors. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-measure, FPR (false positive rate), FNR (false negative rate), FDR (false discovery rate), AUC (area under ROC curve) and MCC (Matthews correlation coefficient) were adopted to value the predictive power of the detected risk factors. The proposed RFA-PVST algorithm was compared to mRMR, SVM-RFE, Relief, S-weight and LLEScore. The statistic test was done to verify the significance of our RFA-PVST."
Altered functional connectivity of the nucleus accumbens subdivisions in amphetamine-type stimulant abusers: a resting-state fMRI study,The growing abuse of amphetamine-type stimulants leads to new challenges to human health. A possible addiction mechanism has been proposed by altered functional architecture of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) during resting state. NAc contains different subdivisions and they may play different roles in addiction. The aim of the present study was to examine whether there are common or distinct patterns of functional connectivity of the NAc subdivisions in amphetamine-type stimulant abusers (ATSAs).
Metabolite profiling during graft union formation reveals the reprogramming of primary metabolism and the induction of stilbene synthesis at the graft interface in grapevine,"Grafting with rootstocks is essential for the culture of many perennial fruit crops and is increasing being used in the production of annual fruits and vegetables. Our previous work based on microarrays showed that transcripts encoding enzymes of both primary and secondary metabolism were differentially expressed during graft union formation in both homo-grafts (a genotype grafted with itself) and hetero-grafts (two different genotypes grafted together). The aim of this study was to profile primary and secondary metabolites, and quantify the activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and neutral invertase (NI) in the scion and rootstock tissues and the graft interface of homo and hetero-grafts of grapevine 1 month after grafting. Table-top grafting was done on over-wintering stems (canes) of grapevine and the graft interface tissues (containing some woody stem tissues and callus) were compared to the surrounding rootstock and scion tissues. The objective was to identify compounds involved in graft union formation and hetero-grafting responses."
"Colonisation of Oncidium orchid roots by the endophyte Piriformospora indica restricts Erwinia chrysanthemi infection, stimulates accumulation of NBS-LRR resistance gene transcripts and represses their targeting micro-RNAs in leaves","Erwinia chrysanthemi (Ec) is a destructive pathogen which causes soft-rot diseases in diverse plant species including orchids. We investigated whether colonization of Oncidium roots by the endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica (Pi) restricts Ec-induced disease development in leaves, and whether this might be related to the regulation of nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) Resistance (R) genes."
Genome-wide identification and characterization of the ALOG gene family in Petunia,"The ALOG (Arabidopsis LSH1 and Oryza G1) family of proteins, namely DUF640 (domain of unknown function 640) domain proteins, were found in land plants. Functional characterization of a few ALOG members in model plants such as Arabidopsis and rice suggested they play important regulatory roles in plant development. The information about its evolution, however, is largely limited, and there was no any report on the ALOG genes in Petunia, an important ornamental species."
"Pollen-mediated gene flow ensures connectivity among spatially discrete sub-populations of Phalaenopsis pulcherrima, a tropical food-deceptive orchid","Gene flow in plants via pollen and seeds is asymmetrical at different geographic scales. Orchid seeds are adapted to long-distance wind dispersal but pollinium transfer is often influenced by pollinator behavior. We combined field studies with an analysis of genetic diversity among 155 physically mapped adults and 1105 F1 seedlings to evaluate the relative contribution of pollen and seed dispersal to overall gene flow among three sub-populations of the food-deceptive orchid Phalaenopsis pulcherrima on Hainan Island, China."
Genome sequencing of Mycobacterium pinnipedii strains: genetic characterization and evidence of superinfection in a South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens),"Mycobacterium pinnipedii, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTBC), is capable of infecting several host species, including humans. Recently, ancient DNA from this organism was recovered from pre-Columbian mummies of Peru, sparking debate over the origin and frequency of tuberculosis in the Americas prior to European colonization."
The transcriptomic signature of low aggression in honey bees resembles a response to infection,"Behavior reflects an organism’s health status. Many organisms display a generalized suite of behaviors that indicate infection or predict infection susceptibility. We apply this concept to honey bee aggression, a behavior that has been associated with positive health outcomes in previous studies. We sequenced the transcriptomes of the brain, fat body, and midgut of adult sibling worker bees who developed as pre-adults in relatively high versus low aggression colonies. Previous studies showed that this pre-adult experience impacts both aggressive behavior and resilience to pesticides. We performed enrichment analyses on differentially expressed genes to determine whether variation in aggression resembles the molecular response to infection. We further assessed whether the transcriptomic signature of aggression in the brain is similar to the neuromolecular response to acute predator threat, exposure to a high-aggression environment as an adult, or adult behavioral maturation."
Sketch distance-based clustering of chromosomes for large genome database compression,"The rapid development of Next-Generation Sequencing technologies enables sequencing genomes with low cost. The dramatically increasing amount of sequencing data raised crucial needs for efficient compression algorithms. Reference-based compression algorithms have exhibited outstanding performance on compressing single genomes. However, for the more challenging and more useful problem of compressing a large collection of n genomes, straightforward application of these reference-based algorithms suffers a series of issues such as difficult reference selection and remarkable performance variation."
Chicken adaptive response to low energy diet: main role of the hypothalamic lipid metabolism revealed by a phenotypic and multi-tissue transcriptomic approach,"Production conditions of layer chicken can vary in terms of temperature or diet energy content compared to the controlled environment where pure-bred selection is undertaken. The aim of this study was to better understand the long-term effects of a 15%-energy depleted diet on egg-production, energy homeostasis and metabolism via a multi-tissue transcriptomic analysis. Study was designed to compare effects of the nutritional intervention in two layer chicken lines divergently selected for residual feed intake."
Clonal reconstruction from time course genomic sequencing data,"Bacterial cells during many replication cycles accumulate spontaneous mutations, which result in the birth of novel clones. As a result of this clonal expansion, an evolving bacterial population has different clonal composition over time, as revealed in the long-term evolution experiments (LTEEs). Accurately inferring the haplotypes of novel clones as well as the clonal frequencies and the clonal evolutionary history in a bacterial population is useful for the characterization of the evolutionary pressure on multiple correlated mutations instead of that on individual mutations."
ManiNetCluster: a novel manifold learning approach to reveal the functional links between gene networks,"The coordination of genomic functions is a critical and complex process across biological systems such as phenotypes or states (e.g., time, disease, organism, environmental perturbation). Understanding how the complexity of genomic function relates to these states remains a challenge. To address this, we have developed a novel computational method, ManiNetCluster, which simultaneously aligns and clusters gene networks (e.g., co-expression) to systematically reveal the links of genomic function between different conditions. Specifically, ManiNetCluster employs manifold learning to uncover and match local and non-linear structures among networks, and identifies cross-network functional links."
An ancestry informative marker panel design for individual ancestry estimation of Hispanic population using whole exome sequencing data,"Europeans and American Indians were major genetic ancestry of Hispanics in the U.S. These ancestral groups have markedly different incidence rates and outcomes in many types of cancers. Therefore, the genetic admixture may cause biased genetic association study with cancer susceptibility variants specifically in Hispanics. For example, the incidence rate of liver cancer has been shown with substantial disparity between Hispanic, Asian and non-Hispanic white populations. Currently, ancestry informative marker (AIM) panels have been widely utilized with up to a few hundred ancestry-informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to infer ancestry admixture. Notably, current available AIMs are predominantly located in intron and intergenic regions, while the whole exome sequencing (WES) protocols commonly used in translational research and clinical practice do not cover these markers. Thus, it remains challenging to accurately determine a patient’s admixture proportion without additional DNA testing."
De novo sequencing of the transcriptome reveals regulators of the floral transition in Fargesia macclureana (Poaceae),"Fargesia macclureana (Poaceae) is a woody bamboo species found on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) approximately 2000 ~ 3800 m above sea level. It rarely blossoms in the QTP, but it flowered 20 days after growing in our lab, which is in a low-altitude area outside the QTP. To date, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism of bamboo flowering, and no studies of flowering have been conducted on wild bamboo plants growing in extreme environments. Here, we report the first de novo transcriptome sequence for F. macclureana to investigate the putative mechanisms underlying the flowering time control used by F. macclureana to adapt to its environment."
Detection and application of genome-wide variations in peach for association and genetic relationship analysis,"Peach (Prunus persica L.) is a diploid species and model plant of the Rosaceae family.

Effects of cage and floor rearing system on the factors of antioxidant defense and inflammatory injury in laying ducks,"Cage-rearing in laying ducks, as a novel rearing system, not only fundamentally solves the pollution problem of the duck industry and improve bio-safety and product quality but also exhibits more benefits by implementing standardized production compared with the floor-rearing. Of course, this system also brings some welfare problems and stress injuries to layers due to lack of water environment and limited activities in the cages. However, the effects on the factors of antioxidant defense and inflammatory injury in the early cage stage are not well-understood."
Repurposing FPGAs for Tester Design to Enhance Field-Testing in a 3D Stack,"We propose an architecture for a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based tester for a 3D stacked integrated circuit (IC). Due to the very short distances between dies in a stack that can make SerDes connections very efficient and the high density of through silicon vias (TSVs) that may be available, it is possible to connect the FPGA to the die under test through a very high bandwidth connection that can feed multiple short scan chains. We propose and evaluate two designs that exploit the underlying structure of the FPGA, allowing it to be used to efficiently store and apply predefined test patterns, reducing the FPGA resources required and the switching activity in the circuit under test when compared to a more traditional on-chip decompressor implemented to feed short scan chains. For the largest circuit we studied, the switching activity was reduced about 80% and the test time by 90%."
Long-term impact of fecal transplantation in healthy volunteers,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been recently approved by FDA for the treatment of refractory recurrent clostridial colitis (rCDI). Success of FTM in treatment of rCDI led to a number of studies investigating the effectiveness of its application in the other gastrointestinal diseases. However, in the majority of studies the effects of FMT were evaluated on the patients with initially altered microbiota. The aim of our study was to estimate effects of FMT on the gut microbiota composition in healthy volunteers and to monitor its long-term outcomes."
Amentoflavone ameliorates cold stress-induced inflammation in lung by suppression of C3/BCR/NF-κB pathways,"Cold stress, which may lead to local and systemic injury, is reported to be related to the immune system, especially the complement system. At present, the lack of effective treatment is a critical issue. Amentoflavone (AF), which can inhibit cold stress-induced inflammation in lung by multiple mechanisms, is the main therapeutic ingredient in plants of the genus Selaginella."
Expression analysis of Rab11 during zebrafish embryonic development,"Rab proteins are GTPases responsible for intracellular vesicular trafficking regulation. Rab11 proteins, members of the Rab GTPase family, are known to regulate vesicular recycling during embryonic development. In zebrafish, there are 3 rab11 paralogues, known as rab11a, rab11ba and rab11bb, sharing high identity with each other. However, the expression analysis of rab11 is so far lacking."
A monograph of Caprifoliaceae: Linnaeeae,"Tribe Linnaeeae is a diverse group disjunctly distributed in the northern hemisphere between China and Japan and Mexico. The tribe consists of shrubs with showy flowers that are important in the horticultural industry. We present a detailed monograph of tribe Linnaeeae that includes descriptions, identification keys, botanical plates with line drawings and photographs, distribution maps, morphometric analysis of key characters, and discussion on evolution, cultivation and conservation. Twenty species, as well as five new varieties and four new forms, are recognised in six genera. Forty heterotypic names (not including the 218 names for Linnaea borealis) are listed as synonyms. 1,973 specimens were studied and databased from 13 herbaria (A, BM, CAS, E, GZAC, IBSC, KUN, KYO, MAK, PE, TNS, TOFO and TI). The Kolkwitzia–Dipelta–Diabelia clade radiated from the Qinling Mountain Range of China and is disjunctly distributed in Japan. The Linnaea–Vesalea clade may have migrated through the Bering Land Bridge and radiated along the Sierra Madre Oriental in Mexico. Abelia, which is most diverse in China, evolved in relation to the formation of the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau."
An a priori DNS analysis of scale similarity based combustion models for LES of non-premixed jet flames,"In this work, recently developed finite-rate dynamic scale similarity (SS) sub-grid scale (SGS) combustion models have been a priori assessed and compared with the Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) and “no model” approaches based on a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) database of a temporally evolving non-premixed jet flame. Two different filter widths, one placed in the inertial range and the other in the near dissipation range, have been used. The analyses were carried out in two time instants corresponding to instants of maximum local extinction and re-ignition. Conditional averaged filtered chemical source terms, conditioned on different parameters in the composition space, have been presented. Improvements are observed using the dynamic SS models compared to the two other approaches in the prediction of filtered chemical source terms of individual species while using larger filter widths. However, discrepancies still exists using the dynamic SS model on the turbulent/non-turbulent interfaces of the jet, mainly in the prediction of the oxidizer consumption rate."
Diphenylalanine Peptide Nanowires as a Substrate for Neural Cultures,"Primary brain cells cultured on flat surfaces, i.e., in a two-dimensional fashion, have a long history of use as an experimental model system in neuroscience research. However, it is questionable to which extent these cultured brain cells resemble their in vivo counterparts. Mainly, it has been claimed that the non-oxidative glucose metabolism reflected by lactate production is unphysiologically high. Furthermore, it is known that culturing in 2D alters the phenotype of cells. Here we present diphenylalanine peptide nanowires (PNWs) as a culturing substrate for primary neocortical neurons from mice. The topology of the PNWs leads to neuronal cultures developing in 2.5D environment and hence improved culturing conditions. We investigate the effect of different concentrations of PNWs and different cell densities of neurons on the culturing conditions. The neocortical neurons were examined through scanning electron microscopy in order to study the effect of PNW concentrations and neuron densities on the structural appearance of the cells. Then employing the optimal combination of neuron density and PNW concentration, the neurons were evaluated functionally and metabolically by comparison with neocortical neurons standard culturing methods in 2D. Specifically, we tested neuronal viability, capacity for vesicular release of neurotransmitter GABA, as well as oxidative and non-oxidative glucose metabolism. It was evident that neurons cultured on PNWs exhibited increased viability combined with an increased capacity for neurotransmitter release and a lower fraction of non-oxidative metabolism than neurons cultured in 2D. Hence, neocortical neurons cultured in 2.5D on PNWs appear to be healthier and less glycolytic than neurons cultured in 2D."
Quantitative evaluation for moisture content of cellulose insulation material in paper/oil system based on frequency dielectric modulus technique,"The moisture evaluation of cellulose insulation material in paper/oil system based on the frequency dielectric spectroscopy (FDS) technique has been of great interest to researchers. However, the electrode polarization effect and conductance effect can “obscure” the relaxation information in the course of the traditional FDS test, which often leads to an unreliable result. The existing researches indicated that the frequency dielectric modulus-M*(ω) could effectively enable the investigation of the relaxation behavior, which might be used to realize the condition evaluation of cellulose insulation materials in paper/oil system. Unfortunately, the M*(ω) has been rarely exploited to evaluate the moisture content (mc%) of cellulose insulation material, and the study on approach for extracting characteristic parameters based on the M*(ω) is also rare. In view of this issue, the present contribution attempt to report an available approach for extracting the characteristic parameters based on the M*(ω), and further investigate the variation laws of mc% versus the above parameters. The findings reveal that the quantitative relationship between mc% and the above parameters can be established by fitting analysis. The feasibility of the proposed parameters for moisture evaluation of cellulose insulation material is demonstrated by the newly prepared cellulose insulation samples. It is interesting to note that the average percentage errors of evaluation results corresponding to the relaxation time constant (τM) and integral value (IV) of the real part of M*(ω) are less than 8%. In that respect, the novelty of this work is that the τM and IV might be used as a potential tool for quantitative evaluation of mc% of cellulose insulation in paper/oil systems."
"Influence of green waste compost on Pb-polluted soil remediation, soil quality improvement, and uptake by Pakchoi cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp)","Green waste compost (GWC) has been widely used as organic mulches, growing media, soil organic fertilizer, and amendment in Beijing, China. The aim of this study is to determine the remediation efficiency of GWC on the Pb concentration in soil and uptake by pakchoi cabbage and to assess the activities of dehydrogenase, urease, and catalase after applying GWC. Original soil samples were spiked with Pb (NO3)2 of 500 mg/kg, and greenhouse pot experiment was carried out. Three seedlings of pakchoi cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp) were planted in plastic pots with mixture of soil amended with three levels of GWC (2%, 5%, and 10%, w/w). Soil and plant samples were collected over 45-day growth, after which Pb concentration and enzyme activities were assessed by laboratory analysis. The available Pb in soil and total Pb in roots and leaves of pakchoi cabbage greatly decreased after adding GWC, associated with significant increases in organic matter, water soluble organic carbon, total nitrogen, and available K and P, whereas pH was not a main factor controlling Pb speciation in this study. Activities of dehydrogenase, urease, and catalase were promoted with addition of GWC because physical properties, high organic matter, and organic carbon content rose by 9-fold, 40%, and 37% at 10% application rate, respectively. In conclusion, GWC could be an alternative option for the remediation of Pb-contaminated soil because of soil quality improvement and Pb reduction in soils and plants, without introducing extra heavy metals compared with other organic amendments."
Cadmium immobilization in aqueous solution by Aspergillus niger and geological fluorapatite,"This study investigated the application of fungus Aspergillus niger and geological fluorapatite (FAp) to cadmium (Cd) immobilization in aqueous solution. The initial Cd concentrations were set at 100, 50, 25, and 10 mg L−1. The mineralogy of the products was investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and attenuated total reflection–infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR). In both A. niger + FAp + Cd and A. niger + Cd treatments, A. niger secreted abundant oxalic acid, then dissolved the FAp, and reacted with Cd2+ cations to produce relatively insoluble Cd oxalate. Meanwhile, FAp can provide P source to improve microbial growth. The fungal tolerance to Cd2+ was identified at around 100 mg L−1. The final Cd concentrations of 13.7, 3.2, and 0.2 mg L−1 were recorded for A. niger + FAp + Cd treatments with initial Cd concentrations of 50, 25, and 10 mg L−1 respectively. Meanwhile, it was observed that the Cd concentration at 25 mg L−1 stimulated higher bioactivities of A. niger, which further enhanced Cd bioremediation. The immobilization efficiency (%) of the treatments at low to medium Cd concentrations was in the order: Asp + FAp > Asp > FAp, while FAp alone was most efficient at the high Cd concentration of 100 mg L−1. This research provides insights into the mechanisms of combining fungus and FAp as a composite to Cd contamination at various Cd levels."
Knowledge and attitudes regarding exposure to brominated flame retardants: a survey of Croatian health care providers,"The exposure of pregnant and lactating women and their children to environmental contaminants such as brominated flame retardants (BFRs) is a subject of international concern, but the perception of these contaminants by health providers has not been extensively investigated. The aim of this study was to assess Croatian health care providers’ knowledge of exposure to BFRs and their attitudes towards the responsibility to inform the public about the possible negative effects on human health. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from December 2017 to November 2018 with a sample of 400 health care providers. The instrument was a questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic questions, a BFR knowledge test and a BFR attitude assessment. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed with the STATISTICA 13 software. The results of our study indicate that health providers’ knowledge of BFR exposure is lacking, as evidenced by the high frequency of incorrect responses, irrespective of the field of medicine or profession. Neither age nor interest in the topic was significantly correlated with the correctness of answers. Participants expressed a moderate interest in the topic, regardless of the profession or field of medicine. Therefore, we suggest including additional information for health providers about the health effects of BFRs in continuing education programmes organized by Croatian medical associations, nurse associations and other professional bodies as well as in existing high school and university education programmes for health professionals."

Metabolite profiling during graft union formation reveals the reprogramming of primary metabolism and the induction of stilbene synthesis at the graft interface in grapevine,"Grafting with rootstocks is essential for the culture of many perennial fruit crops and is increasing being used in the production of annual fruits and vegetables. Our previous work based on microarrays showed that transcripts encoding enzymes of both primary and secondary metabolism were differentially expressed during graft union formation in both homo-grafts (a genotype grafted with itself) and hetero-grafts (two different genotypes grafted together). The aim of this study was to profile primary and secondary metabolites, and quantify the activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and neutral invertase (NI) in the scion and rootstock tissues and the graft interface of homo and hetero-grafts of grapevine 1 month after grafting. Table-top grafting was done on over-wintering stems (canes) of grapevine and the graft interface tissues (containing some woody stem tissues and callus) were compared to the surrounding rootstock and scion tissues. The objective was to identify compounds involved in graft union formation and hetero-grafting responses."

Transcultural adaption and preliminary evaluation of “understanding low back pain” patient education booklet,"Low back pain (LBP) is the number one cause of disability globally. LBP is a symptom associated with biological, psychological and social factors, and serious causes for pain are very rare. Unhelpful beliefs about LBP and inappropriate imaging are common. Practitioners report pressure from patients to provide inappropriate imaging. A recently developed patient education and management booklet, ‘Understanding low back pain’, was designed to target previously identified barriers for reducing inappropriate imaging. The booklet includes evidence-based information on LBP and supports communication between patients and practitioners. Our aim was to 1) describe the translation process into Finnish and 2) study patients’ and practitioners’ attitudes to the booklet and to evaluate if it improved patients’ understanding of LBP and practitioners’ ability to follow imaging guidelines."

Prediction of comorbid diseases using weighted geometric embedding of human interactome,"Comorbidity is the phenomenon of two or more diseases occurring simultaneously not by random chance and presents great challenges to accurate diagnosis and treatment. As an effort toward better understanding the genetic causes of comorbidity, in this work, we have developed a computational method to predict comorbid diseases. Two diseases sharing common genes tend to increase their comorbidity. Previous work shows that after mapping the associated genes onto the human interactome the distance between the two disease modules (subgraphs) is correlated with comorbidity."

Dying too soon or living too long? Withdrawing treatment from patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness after Re Y,"In the ruling in Y [2018], the UK Supreme Court has confirmed that there is no general requirement for the courts in England and Wales to authorise the withdrawal of clinically assisted nutrition and hydration from patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness. The perceived requirement, which originated in a court ruling in 1993, encompassed those in the vegetative state and those in the minimally conscious state. The ruling in Y confirms that the court may still be approached to decide difficult or contested cases, but there is otherwise no routine requirement that the judges be approached."
Multi-level models for heart failure patients’ 30-day mortality and readmission rates: the relation between patient and hospital factors in administrative data,"This study aims at gathering evidence about the relation between 30-day mortality and 30-day unplanned readmission and patient and hospital factors.

Unitarization from geometry,"We study the perturbative unitarity of scattering amplitudes in general dimensional reductions of Yang-Mills theories and general relativity on closed internal manifolds. For the tree amplitudes of the dimensionally reduced theory to have the expected high-energy behavior of the higher-dimensional theory, the masses and cubic couplings of the Kaluza-Klein states must satisfy certain sum rules that ensure there are nontrivial cancellations between Feynman diagrams. These sum rules give constraints on the spectra and triple overlap integrals of eigenfunctions of Laplacian operators on the internal manifold and can be proven directly using Hodge and eigenfunction decompositions. One consequence of these constraints is that there is an upper bound on the ratio of consecutive eigenvalues of the scalar Laplacian on closed Ricci-flat manifolds with special holonomy. This gives a sharp bound on the allowed gaps between Kaluza-Klein excitations of the graviton that also applies to Calabi-Yau compactifications of string theory."
Reflected entropy and entanglement wedge cross section with the first order correction,"We study the holographic duality between the reflected entropy and the entanglement wedge cross section with the first order correction. In the field theory side, we consider the reflected entropy for \( {\rho}_{AB}^m \), where ρAB is the reduced density matrix for two intervals in the ground state. The reflected entropy in the 2d holographic conformal field theories is computed perturbatively up to the first order in m − 1 by using the semiclassical conformal block. In the gravity side, we compute the entanglement wedge cross section in the backreacted geometry by cosmic branes with tension Tm which are anchored at the AdS boundary. Comparing both results we find a perfect agreement, showing the duality works with the first order correction in m − 1."
On the simple calculation of walking efficiency without kinematic information for its convenient use,"Since walking is a daily activity not to require the maximal effort in healthy populations, a very few universal bio-parameters and/or methods have been defined to evaluate individual walking characteristics in those populations. A concept of “economy” is a potential candidate; however, walking economy highly depends on speed, so direct comparisons of economy values are difficult between studies. We investigated whether the vertical component of net walking “efficiency” (Effvert; %) is constant across speed. In that case, direct comparisons of Effvert will be possible between studies or individuals at any voluntary speed."
Kimura’s disease affecting multiple body parts in a 57-year-old female patient: a case report,Kimura’s disease (KD) is a rare chronic inflammatory disease with unknown etiology.

Land subsidence monitoring based on InSAR and inversion of aquifer parameters,"In order to accurately separate the elastic and inelastic deformation information caused by aquifer compression in the land subsidence signal, and to invert the hydrogeological parameters of high spatial and temporal resolution to better apply the groundwater-ground subsidence model, a CWT (Continuous Wavelet Transform) separation method for aquifer elastic and inelastic deformation signals based on CWT is adopted, and the deformation signal is extracted by InSAR technology. The large-scale synthetic aperture radar dataset obtained by Envisat satellite from 2007 to 2009 is collected to obtain the surface deformation characteristic of the area by SBAS-InSAR technology, and then the independence provided by the observation well is used. Using the independent water level data provided by the observation wells, combined with the vertical InSAR deformation component and the head data, the CWT method is used to separate the periodic deformation signal components and long-term trends. Finally, the isolated signal component is used to invert the elastic and inelastic storage coefficient based on the ground subsidence model. The settlement signal separation method used in this paper makes up for the shortcomings of the two kinds of information in the previous settlement signal that are difficult to separate, which allows for more accurate inversion of aquifer parameters and helps to understand the aquifer parameters and continuously manage groundwater resources."
Experimental analysis and evaluation of wide residual networks based agricultural disease identification in smart agriculture system,"Specialised pest and disease control in the agricultural crops industry have been a high-priority issue. Due to great cost-effectiveness and efficient automation, computer vision (CV)–based automatic pest or disease identification techniques are widely utilised in the smart agricultural systems. As rapid development of artificial intelligence, in the field of computer vision–based agricultural pest identification, an increasing number of scholars have begun to move their attentions from traditional machine learning models to deep learning techniques. However, so far, deep learning techniques still have been suffering from many problems such as limited data samples, cost-effectiveness of network structure, and high image quality requirements. These issues greatly limit the potential utilisation of deep-learning techniques into smart agricultural systems. This paper aims at investigating utilization of one new deep-learning model WRN (wide residual networks) into CV-based automatic disease identification problem. We first built up a large-scale agricultural disease images dataset containing over 36,000 pieces of diseases, which includes typical types of disease in tomato, potato, grape, corn and apple. Then, we analysed and evaluated wide residual networks algorithm using the Tesla K80 graphics processor (GPU) in the TensorFlow deep-learning framework. A set of comprehensive experimental protocols have been designed in comparing with GoogLeNet Inception V4 regarding several benchmarks. The experimental results indicate that (1) under WRN architecture, Softmax loss function gives a faster convergence and improved accuracy than GoogLeNet inception V4 network. (2) While WRN shows a good effect for identification of agricultural diseases, its effectiveness has a strong need on the number of training samples of dataset like at least 36 k images in our experiment. (3) The overall performance is better than 800 sheets. The disease identification results show that the WRN model can be applied to the identification of agricultural diseases."
"Ingredients to enhance the performance of two-stage TCAM-based packet classifiers in internet of things: greedy layering, bit auctioning and range encoding","Using packet classification algorithms in network equipment increases packet processing speed in Internet of Things (IoT). In the hardware implementation of these algorithms, ternary content-addressable memories (TCAMs) are often preferred to other implementations. As a common approach, TCAMs are used for the parallel search to match packet header information with the rules of the classifier. In two-stage architectures of hardware-based packet classifiers, first the decision tree is created, and then the rules are distributed among its leaves. In the second step, depending on the corresponding leaves, the second part of the rules, which includes the range of source and destination ports is stored in different blocks of TCAM. Due to inappropriate storage of port range fields, the existing architectures face the problem of wasting memory and growing power consumption. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm to encode the port range. This algorithm consists of three general steps including layering, bit allocation, and encoding. A greedy algorithm in the first step places the ranges with higher weights in higher layers. Next, an auction-based algorithm allocates several bits to each layer depending on the number of the ranges in that layer. Finally, in each layer, depending on the weight order of the ranges, the bits are given values for the intended range. The evaluation results show that unlike previous methods of storing range fields, the proposed method not only increases the speed of the classification but also uses the capacity of TCAM in the second stage more efficiently."
Silencing or inhibition of H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L induces cell cycle arrest by epigenetically modulating c-Myc expression in colorectal cancer,"Epigenetic regulations play pivotal roles in tumorigenesis and cancer development. Disruptor of telomeric silencing-1-like (DOT1L), also known as KMT4, is the only identified histone methyltransferase that catalyzes the mono-, di-, and tri-methylation of lysine 79 histone 3 (H3K79). However, little is known about the effect of H3K79 methylation on the modulation of colorectal cancer (CRC) development."
Scenarios in the strategy process: a framework of affordances and constraints,"This paper challenges the solely rational view of the scenario technique as a strategy and foresight tool designed to cope with uncertainty by considering multiple possible future states. The paper employs an affordance-based view that allows for the identification and structuring of hidden, emergent attributes of the scenario technique beyond the intended ones. The suggested framework distinguishes between affordances (1) that are intended by the organization and relate to its goals, (2) that emergently generate organizational benefits, and (3) that do not relate to organizational but individual interests. Also, constraints in the use of scenarios are discussed. Affordance theory’s specific lens shows that the emergence of such attributes depends on the users’ specific intentions."
Examining seasonal variation in epistaxis in a maritime climate,"Epistaxis is a common reason patients present to the emergency department. There is significant variation in climate across Canada. Our study aimed to determine if epistaxis is related to season, temperature and humidity in a Maritime climate."
Endocrine-responsive lobular carcinoma of the breast: features associated with risk of late distant recurrence,Invasive lobular carcinomas (ILCs) account for 10–15% of all breast cancers. They are characterized by an elevated endocrine responsiveness and by a long lasting risk of relapse over time. Here we report for the first time an analysis of clinical and pathological features associated with the risk of late distant recurrence in ILCs.
Prophylactic use of levosimendan in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a prospective randomized controlled trial,"The administration of levosimendan prophylactically to patients undergoing cardiac surgery remains a controversial practice, and few studies have specifically assessed the value of this approach in pediatric patients. This study therefore sought to explore the safety and efficacy of prophylactic levosimendan administration to pediatric patients as a means of preventing low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) based upon hemodynamic, biomarker, and pharmacokinetic readouts."
Defining benefit threshold for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in children with sepsis—a binational multicenter cohort study,The surviving sepsis campaign recommends consideration for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in refractory septic shock. We aimed to define the benefit threshold of ECMO in pediatric septic shock.
Time and energy costs of different foraging choices in an avian generalist species,"Animals can obtain a higher foraging yield by optimizing energy expenditure or minimizing time costs. In this study, we assessed how individual variation in the relative use of marine and terrestrial foraging habitats relates to differences in the energy and time investments of an avian generalistic feeder (the Lesser Black-backed Gull, Larus fuscus), and how this changes during the course of the chick-rearing period."

Selective cytotoxic effect of Plantago lanceolata L. against breast cancer cells,"Plantago lanceolata L. is used in Iraqi folklore medicine to treat injuries, and its extract is prescribed by some herbalists for cancer patients. This research aimed to evaluate the effect of P. lanceolata leaf extract on breast cancer cell lines in vitro and to identify its active compounds. Crystal violet viability assay was used to determine the cytotoxicity of methanolic P. lanceolata leaf extract against various breast cancer cell lines. MCF7, AMJ13, MDAMB, and CAL51 human breast cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of the extract for 72 h. The morphology of the treated cells was examined under a phase-contrast inverted microscope. The clonogenic ability was assessed through a clonogenic assay. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed to measure the concentrations of phenols and flavonoids in the extract."
Primary versus staged repair of Fallot with borderline pulmonary artery anatomy,"Surgical management of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) can be either with a total primary repair or staged repair. The superiority of one technique over the other is still debatable, especially in developing countries with late presentation and limited resources. The objective of this study was to compare the outcome of patients with tetralogy of Fallot and borderline pulmonary anatomy defined as McGoon ratio between 1.2 and 1.6 who underwent primary versus staged repair."
Role of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of the anterior knee pain,"To review the most common causes of Anterior knee pain (AKP), with an emphasis on their MRI findings; 70 patients were included (24 males and 46 females). Their age range is 10–53 years with a mean ± SD of 28.8 ± 9.06 years. All patients performed MRI of the affected knee."
Diagnostic accuracy of double inversion recovery in delineation of multiple sclerosis lesions and its clinical correlation with expanded disability scoring system,"The aim of our work was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a double inversion recovery (DIR) sequence in the detection of brain and spinal cord MS lesions. In addition, we aimed to evaluate the reliability of the correlation between GM affection and high Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) to enhance the role of DIR as a practical test for clinical disability. Ninety MS patients were prospectively included in this study. Imaging was performed using Philips Intera 1.5 Tesla device. T2W-TSE, FLAIR, and DIR sequences were performed and compared to each other. Each patient was clinically assessed at the time of the MRI examination with EDSS."
The role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the differentiation of benign and malignant adnexal masses,"Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer diagnosis among women worldwide (Prat J, Int J Gynaecol Obstet 124:1–5, 2014) .Although magnetic resonance imaging has been proved to be accurate in characterizing adnexal masses (Pretorius E, et al. Top Magn Reson Imaging 12:131–46, 2001), it is still not conclusive in a considerable number of cases (Fujii S, et al. J Magn Reson Imaging 28:1149–1156, 2008, Thomassin-Naggara I, et al. Eur Radiol 19:1544–1552, 2009) .The aim of this study is to differentiate between benign and malignant adnexal tumors by MR spectroscopy."
An a priori DNS analysis of scale similarity based combustion models for LES of non-premixed jet flames,"In this work, recently developed finite-rate dynamic scale similarity (SS) sub-grid scale (SGS) combustion models have been a priori assessed and compared with the Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) and “no model” approaches based on a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) database of a temporally evolving non-premixed jet flame. Two different filter widths, one placed in the inertial range and the other in the near dissipation range, have been used. The analyses were carried out in two time instants corresponding to instants of maximum local extinction and re-ignition. Conditional averaged filtered chemical source terms, conditioned on different parameters in the composition space, have been presented. Improvements are observed using the dynamic SS models compared to the two other approaches in the prediction of filtered chemical source terms of individual species while using larger filter widths. However, discrepancies still exists using the dynamic SS model on the turbulent/non-turbulent interfaces of the jet, mainly in the prediction of the oxidizer consumption rate."
Is financial development good for the environment? An asymmetric analysis with CO2 emissions in China,"This paper examines the asymmetric effect of financial development on CO2 emissions in China by controlling for the effects of economic growth and energy consumption. So far, no consensus has been found as regards the nature and the intensity of the relationship between CO2 emissions and financial development in China. While most previous studies found a positive effect of financial development on the environment, there have been also studies showing that financial development increases CO2 emissions in China or has no effect on it. Moreover, these studies have not accounted for a possible asymmetric impact that financial development can have on CO2 emissions in China. The empirical study in this paper is carried out with the unit root test with structural breaks and the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model. The obtained results show that an asymmetric effect exists. An increase in financial development helps decreasing CO2 emission. These results show the importance to support financial development in China to decrease CO2 emissions while sustaining economic growth."
Knowledge and attitudes regarding exposure to brominated flame retardants: a survey of Croatian health care providers,"The exposure of pregnant and lactating women and their children to environmental contaminants such as brominated flame retardants (BFRs) is a subject of international concern, but the perception of these contaminants by health providers has not been extensively investigated. The aim of this study was to assess Croatian health care providers’ knowledge of exposure to BFRs and their attitudes towards the responsibility to inform the public about the possible negative effects on human health. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from December 2017 to November 2018 with a sample of 400 health care providers. The instrument was a questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic questions, a BFR knowledge test and a BFR attitude assessment. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed with the STATISTICA 13 software. The results of our study indicate that health providers’ knowledge of BFR exposure is lacking, as evidenced by the high frequency of incorrect responses, irrespective of the field of medicine or profession. Neither age nor interest in the topic was significantly correlated with the correctness of answers. Participants expressed a moderate interest in the topic, regardless of the profession or field of medicine. Therefore, we suggest including additional information for health providers about the health effects of BFRs in continuing education programmes organized by Croatian medical associations, nurse associations and other professional bodies as well as in existing high school and university education programmes for health professionals."
Cadmium immobilization in aqueous solution by Aspergillus niger and geological fluorapatite,"This study investigated the application of fungus Aspergillus niger and geological fluorapatite (FAp) to cadmium (Cd) immobilization in aqueous solution. The initial Cd concentrations were set at 100, 50, 25, and 10 mg L−1. The mineralogy of the products was investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and attenuated total reflection–infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR). In both A. niger + FAp + Cd and A. niger + Cd treatments, A. niger secreted abundant oxalic acid, then dissolved the FAp, and reacted with Cd2+ cations to produce relatively insoluble Cd oxalate. Meanwhile, FAp can provide P source to improve microbial growth. The fungal tolerance to Cd2+ was identified at around 100 mg L−1. The final Cd concentrations of 13.7, 3.2, and 0.2 mg L−1 were recorded for A. niger + FAp + Cd treatments with initial Cd concentrations of 50, 25, and 10 mg L−1 respectively. Meanwhile, it was observed that the Cd concentration at 25 mg L−1 stimulated higher bioactivities of A. niger, which further enhanced Cd bioremediation. The immobilization efficiency (%) of the treatments at low to medium Cd concentrations was in the order: Asp + FAp > Asp > FAp, while FAp alone was most efficient at the high Cd concentration of 100 mg L−1. This research provides insights into the mechanisms of combining fungus and FAp as a composite to Cd contamination at various Cd levels."
"Influence of green waste compost on Pb-polluted soil remediation, soil quality improvement, and uptake by Pakchoi cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp)","Green waste compost (GWC) has been widely used as organic mulches, growing media, soil organic fertilizer, and amendment in Beijing, China. The aim of this study is to determine the remediation efficiency of GWC on the Pb concentration in soil and uptake by pakchoi cabbage and to assess the activities of dehydrogenase, urease, and catalase after applying GWC. Original soil samples were spiked with Pb (NO3)2 of 500 mg/kg, and greenhouse pot experiment was carried out. Three seedlings of pakchoi cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp) were planted in plastic pots with mixture of soil amended with three levels of GWC (2%, 5%, and 10%, w/w). Soil and plant samples were collected over 45-day growth, after which Pb concentration and enzyme activities were assessed by laboratory analysis. The available Pb in soil and total Pb in roots and leaves of pakchoi cabbage greatly decreased after adding GWC, associated with significant increases in organic matter, water soluble organic carbon, total nitrogen, and available K and P, whereas pH was not a main factor controlling Pb speciation in this study. Activities of dehydrogenase, urease, and catalase were promoted with addition of GWC because physical properties, high organic matter, and organic carbon content rose by 9-fold, 40%, and 37% at 10% application rate, respectively. In conclusion, GWC could be an alternative option for the remediation of Pb-contaminated soil because of soil quality improvement and Pb reduction in soils and plants, without introducing extra heavy metals compared with other organic amendments."
Klinische Wertigkeit der Bestimmung von DFS70-Antikörpern für den Ausschluss von Kollagenosen,"Antinukleäre Antikörper (ANA) sind häufig bei Kollagenosen, können aber auch in der Normalbevölkerung vorkommen, daher kommt es bei ANA+-Patienten mit muskuloskeletalen Symptomen gehäuft zu differenzialdiagnostischen Problemen. Die relativ neuen Anti-dense fine speckled-Antikörper (DFS70-AK) werden bei Kollagenosen möglicherweise nur selten nachgewiesen."
"Evaluation of growth, stemness, and angiogenic properties of dental pulp stem cells cultured in cGMP xeno-/serum-free medium","This study was aimed to investigate the effects of cGMP xeno-/serum-free medium (XSF, Irvine Scientific) on the properties of human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). DPSCs, from passage 2, were cultured in XSF or fetal bovine serum (FBS)-supplemented medium, and sub-cultured up to passage 8. Cumulative population doublings (PDs) and the number of colony-forming-units (CFUs) were determined. qRT-PCR, ELISA, and in vitro assays were used to assess angiogenic capacity. Flow cytometry was used to measure CD73, CD90, and CD105 expression. Differentiation into osteo-, adipo-, and chondrogenic cell lineages was performed. DPSCs showed more elongated morphology, a reduced rate of proliferation at later passages, and lower CFU counts in XSF compared with FBS. Expression of angiogenic factors at the gene and protein levels varied in the two media and with passage number, but cells grown in XSF had more in vitro angiogenic activity. The majority of early and late passage DPSCs cultured in XSF expressed CD73 and CD90. In contrast, the percentage of CD105 positive DPSCs in XSF medium was significantly lower with increased passage whereas the majority of cells cultured in FBS were CD105 positive. Switching XSF-cultured DPSCs to medium supplemented with human serum restored the expression of CD105. The tri-lineage differentiation of DPSCs cultured under XSF and FBS conditions was similar. We showed that despite reduced CD105 expression levels, DPSCs expanded in XSF medium maintained a functional MSC phenotype. Furthermore, restoration of CD105 expression is likely to occur upon in vivo transplantation, when cells are exposed to human serum."
The doubled geometry of nilmanifold reductions,"A class of special holonomy spaces arise as nilmanifolds fibred over a line interval and are dual to intersecting brane solutions of string theory. Further dualities relate these to T-folds, exotic branes, essentially doubled spaces and spaces with R-flux. We develop the doubled geometry of these spaces, with the various duals arising as different slices of the doubled space."
Strong supercooling as a consequence of renormalization group consistency,"Classically scale-invariant models are attractive not only because they may offer a solution to the long-standing gauge hierarchy problem, but also due to their role in facilitating strongly supercooled cosmic phase transitions. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between these two aspects. We do so in the context of the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) in the minimal scale-invariant theory. We find that the amount of supercooling generally decreases for increasing scalar couplings. However, the stabilization of the electroweak scale against the Planck scale requires the absence of Landau poles in the respective energy range. Scalar couplings at the TeV scale can therefore not become larger than 𝒪(10−1). As a consequence, all fully consistent parameter points predict the EWPT not to complete before the QCD transition, which then eventually triggers the generation of the electroweak scale. We also discuss the potential of the model to give rise to an observable gravitational wave signature, as well as the possibility to accommodate a dark matter candidate."
Axion-like-particle decay in strong electromagnetic backgrounds,"The decay of a massive pseudoscalar, scalar and U(1) boson into an electron-positron pair in the presence of strong electromagnetic backgrounds is calculated. Of particular interest is the constant-crossed-field limit, relevant for experiments that aim to measure high-energy axion-like-particle conversion into electron-positron pairs in a magnetic field. The total probability depends on the quantum nonlinearity parameter — a product of field and lightfront momentum invariants. Depending on the seed particle mass, different decay regimes are identified. In the below-threshold case, we find the probability depends on a non-perturbative tunneling exponent depending on the quantum parameter and the particle mass. In the above-threshold case, we find that when the quantum parameter is varied linearly, the probability oscillates nonlinearly around the spontaneous decay probability. A strong-field limit is identified in which the threshold is found to disappear. In modelling the fall-off of a quasi-constant-crossed magnetic field, we calculate probabilities beyond the constant limit and investigate when the decay probability can be regarded as locally constant."
First validation of a novel assessgame quantifying selective voluntary motor control in children with upper motor neuron lesions,"The question whether novel rehabilitation interventions can exploit restorative rather than compensatory mechanisms has gained momentum in recent years. Assessments measuring selective voluntary motor control could answer this question. However, while current clinical assessments are ordinal-scaled, which could affect their sensitivity, lab-based assessments are costly and time-consuming. We propose a novel, interval-scaled, computer-based assessment game using low-cost accelerometers to evaluate selective voluntary motor control. Participants steer an avatar owl on a star-studded path by moving the targeted joint of the upper or lower extremities. We calculate a target joint accuracy metric, and an outcome score for the frequency and amplitude of involuntary movements of adjacent and contralateral joints as well as the trunk. We detail the methods and, as a first proof of concept, relate the results of select children with upper motor neuron lesions (n = 48) to reference groups of neurologically intact children (n = 62) and adults (n = 64). Linear mixed models indicated that the cumulative therapist score, rating the degree of selectivity, was a good predictor of the involuntary movements outcome score. This highlights the validity of this assessgame approach to quantify selective voluntary motor control and warrants a more thorough exploration to quantify changes induced by restorative interventions."
Short-term effects of air pollution on blood pressure,"Elevated blood pressure (BP) has been proposed as a possible pathophysiological mechanism linking exposure to ambient air pollution and the increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. In this study, we investigated the hourly relationship between ambient air pollutants and BP. BP measurements were extracted from the electronic health record database of the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital from February 2015 to June 2017. A total of 98,577 individual BP measurements were matched to the hourly levels of air pollutants. A generalized additive model was constructed for hour lags of 0–8 of air pollutants adjusting for age, sex, meteorological variables, and time trend. Systolic BP was shown to be significantly lower at 2–4 hours and 3–5 hours after increased levels of SO2 and CO, respectively (0.24 mmHg and 0.26 mmHg for an interquartile range, respectively). In contrast, O3 and NO2 were associated with significantly increased systolic BP at 3–5 lag hours and at 0–2 lag hours, respectively. BP elevation in association with O3 and NO2 was shown to be significantly greater in hypertensive patients than normotensive subjects. Our findings suggest that short-term exposure to air pollution may be associated with elevated BP."
RORγt+ Treg to Th17 ratios correlate with susceptibility to Giardia infection,"Infections with Giardia are among the most common causes of food and water-borne diarrheal disease worldwide. Here, we investigated Th17, Treg and IgA responses, and alterations in gut microbiota in two mouse lines with varying susceptibility to Giardia muris infection. Infected BALB/c mice shed significantly more cysts compared with C57BL/6 mice. Impaired control of infection in BALB/c mice was associated with lower Th17 activity and lower IgA levels compared with C57BL/6 mice. The limited metabolic activity, proliferation and cytokine production of Th17 cells in BALB/c mice was associated with higher proportions of intestinal Foxp3+RORγt+ regulatory T cells and BALB/c mice developed increased RORγt+ Treg:Th17 ratios in response to G. muris infection. Furthermore, G. muris colonization led to a significantly reduced evenness in the gut microbial communities of BALB/c mice. Our data indicate that differential susceptibility to Giardia infections may be related to RORγt+ Treg controlling Th17 activity and that changes in the microbiota composition upon Giardia infection partially depend on the host background."
"A theoretical, dynamical evaluation method of the steric hindrance in nitroxide radicals using transition states of model reactions","Steric hindrance is known to affect the stability, reactivity, and radical trapping ability of stable nitroxide radicals. Therefore, a quantitative evaluation and prediction model of steric hindrance is needed to select and design the optimum nitroxide radicals for specific applications. In this study, a dynamic parameter of steric hindrance (DPSH) is proposed and its characteristics are investigated. Unlike using only the equilibrium structure to evaluate the steric hindrance, DPSH is a dynamic value calculated from the theoretical activation enthalpies for two model reactions of radical addition to olefins. Using DPSH, the steric hindrance was evaluated for a total of 43 alkyl radicals, nitroxide radicals, and radicals derived from phenols, and the results were compared with those of other methods. The DPSH values for radicals can vary when the energy barrier for structural change varies, even if the equilibrium structures of the radicals have the same steric shielding. Finally, for radicals other than nitroxide radicals, the DPSH values were consistent with the predictions from their structures, which suggests that the DPSH has a wide range of applications. We expect DPSH to be used and developed in the analysis of steric factors in various reactions."
Synthesis and Evaluation of Anisomelic acid-like Compounds for the Treatment of HPV-Mediated Carcinomas,"The vast majority of cervical and 75% of oropharyngeal carcinomas are triggered by infection with a type of high-risk oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV). It is well-known that E6 and E7 oncoproteins are critical for viral-induced cancer, and hence, they represent valuable targets for therapeutic intervention in HPV-mediated cancers. Our earlier research on the cembranoid, anisomelic acid (AA) showed that, AA has the potential to induce apoptosis in HPV cells by the depletion of E6 and E7 oncoproteins. The present study describes the structure-activity relationship and the evaluation of synthetic AA like compounds, i.e simplified cembranoid-like structures, as HPV inhibitors against some papilloma cell lines. Both from experimental and computational results, we observed that these compounds induced apoptosis by the same E6/E7-based mechanism as AA, but at earlier time points, thus being far more effective than AA. Further, the data indicated that only part of the structure of AA is required for the molecular action. Based on these results, we identified some novel and potential compounds for specific treatment of HPV-associated carcinomas."
Bevacizumab improves survival in metastatic colorectal cancer patients with primary tumor resection: A meta-analysis,"It is not well determined whether primary tumor resection is associated with better outcomes in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients treated with bevacizumab. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to assess the prognostic role of primary tumor resection in mCRC treated with bevacizumab. Electronic databases including the Cochrane library, Embase, and Pubmed were searched until April 2018. Clinical studies assessing the influence of primary tumor resection on the efficacy of bevacizumab in patients with mCRC were identified. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Seven studies including 2760 mCRC patients were finally included. The results of the meta-analysis were in favor of bevacizumab to patients with resected primary tumor in terms of OS (HR = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.39–0.64; p < 0.01), and PFS (HR = 0.65, 95%CI: 0.51–0.81; p < 0.01). Administration of bevacizumab in mCRC patients with resected primary tumor had a better OS (HR = 0.65, 95%CI: 0.56–0.74; p < 0.01), when compared to chemotherapy(CT). Adding bevacizumab to mCRC patients without resection of primary tumor also had a better OS (HR = 0.78, 95%CI: 0.65–0.94; p < 0.01) and PFS (HR = 0.71, 95%CI: 0.57–0.88; p < 0.01) compared to chemotherapy alone. In conclusion, mCRC patients with resected primary tumor have better survival than those without surgery of primary tumor when treated with bevacizumab. Primary tumor resection status should be taken into consideration when using bevacizumab in mCRC."
Nanometrology: Absolute Seebeck coefficient of individual silver nanowires,"Thermoelectric phenomena can be strongly modified in nanomaterials. The determination of the absolute Seebeck coefficient is a major challenge for metrology with respect to micro- and nanostructures due to the fact that the transport properties of the bulk material are no more valid. Here, we demonstrate a method to determine the absolute Seebeck coefficient S of individual metallic nanowires. For highly pure and single crystalline silver nanowires, we show the influence of nanopatterning on S in the temperature range between 16 K and 300 K. At room temperature, a nanowire diameter below 200 nm suppresses S by 50% compared to the bulk material to less than S = 1 μVK−1, which is attributed to the reduced electron mean free path. The temperature dependence of the absolute Seebeck coefficient depends on size effects. Thermodiffusion and phonon drag are reduced with respect to the bulk material and the ratio of electron-phonon to phonon-phonon interaction is significantly increased."
Genome mining and characterisation of a novel transaminase with remote stereoselectivity,"Microbial enzymes from pristine niches can potentially deliver disruptive opportunities in synthetic routes to Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients and intermediates in the Pharmaceutical Industry. Advances in green chemistry technologies and the importance of stereochemical control, further underscores the application of enzyme-based solutions in chemical synthesis. The rich tapestry of microbial diversity in the oceanic ecosystem encodes a capacity for novel biotransformations arising from the chemical complexity of this largely unexplored bioactive reservoir. Here we report a novel ω-transaminase discovered in a marine sponge Pseudovibrio sp. isolate. Remote stereoselection using a transaminase has been demonstrated for the first time using this novel protein. Application to the resolution of an intermediate in the synthesis of sertraline highlights the synthetic potential of this novel biocatalyst discovered through genomic mining. Integrated chemico-genomics revealed a unique substrate profile, while molecular modelling provided structural insights into this ‘first in class’ selectivity at a remote chiral centre."
CIBER-CLAP (CIBERCV Cardioprotection Large Animal Platform): A multicenter preclinical network for testing reproducibility in cardiovascular interventions,"Despite many cardioprotective interventions have shown to protect the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury in the experimental setting, only few of them have succeeded in translating their findings into positive proof-of-concept clinical trials. Controversial and inconsistent experimental and clinical evidence supports the urgency of a disruptive paradigm shift for testing cardioprotective therapies. There is a need to evaluate experimental reproducibility before stepping into the clinical arena. The CIBERCV (acronym for Spanish network-center for cardiovascular biomedical research) has set up the “Cardioprotection Large Animal Platform” (CIBER-CLAP) to perform experimental studies testing the efficacy and reproducibility of promising cardioprotective interventions based on a pre-specified design and protocols, randomization, blinding assessment and other robust methodological features. Our first randomized, control-group, open-label blinded endpoint experimental trial assessing local ischemic preconditioning (IPC) in a pig model of acute myocardial infarction (n = 87) will be carried out in three separate sets of experiments performed in parallel by three laboratories. Each set aims to assess: (A) CMR-based outcomes; (B) histopathological-based outcomes; and (C) protein-based outcomes. Three core labs will assess outcomes in a blinded fashion (CMR imaging, histopathology and proteomics) and 2 methodological core labs will conduct the randomization and statistical analysis."
Localized spatial distributions of disease phases yield long-term persistence of infection,"We explore the emergence of persistent infection in two patches where the phases of disease progression of the individuals is given by the well known SIRS cycle modelling non-fatal communicable diseases. We find that a population structured into two patches with significantly different initial states, yields persistent infection, though interestingly, the infection does not persist in a homogeneous population having the same average initial composition as the average of the initial states of the two patches. This holds true for inter-patch links ranging from a single connection to connections across the entire inter-patch boundary. So a population with spatially uniform distribution of disease phases leads to disease extinction, while a population spatially separated into distinct patches aids the long-term persistence of disease. After transience, even very dissimilar patches settle down to the same average infected sub-population size. However the patterns of disease spreading in the patches remain discernibly dissimilar, with the evolution of the total number of infecteds in the two patches displaying distinct periodic wave forms, having markedly different amplitudes, though identical frequencies. We quantify the persistent infection through the size of the asymptotic infected set. We find that the number of inter-patch links does not affect the persistence in any significant manner. The most important feature determining persistence of infection is the disparity in the initial states of the patches, and it is clearly evident that persistence increases with increasing difference in the constitution of the patches. So we conclude that populations with very non-uniform distributions, where the individuals in different phases of disease are strongly compartmentalized spatially, lead to sustained persistence of disease in the entire population."
Butyrate attenuated fat gain through gut microbiota modulation in db/db mice following dapagliflozin treatment,"We investigated the effect of a combination treatment with dapagliflozin (Dapa), a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor and butyrate on weight change in db/db mice. Six-week-old male db/db mice were assigned to four groups: vehicle with normal chow diet (NCD), Dapa with NCD, vehicle with 5% sodium butyrate-supplemented NCD (NaB), or Dapa with 5% NaB. After six weeks of treatment, faecal microbiota composition was analysed by sequencing 16S ribosomal RNA genes. In the vehicle with NaB and Dapa + NaB groups, body weight increase was attenuated, and amount of food intake decreased compared with the vehicle with the NCD group. The Dapa + NaB group gained the least total and abdominal fat from baseline. Intestinal microbiota of this group was characterized by a decrease of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, a decrease of Adlercreutzia and Alistipes, as well as an increase of Streptococcus. In addition, the proportion of Adlercreutzia and Alistipes showed a positive correlation with total fat gain, whereas Streptococcus showed a negative correlation. Inferred metagenome function revealed that tryptophan metabolism was upregulated by NaB treatment. We demonstrated a synergistic effect of Dapa and NaB treatment on adiposity reduction, and this phenomenon might be related to intestinal microbiota alteration."
Ecological and economic benefits of planting winter rapeseed (Brassica rapa L.) in the wind erosion area of northern China,"Winter and early spring wind soil erosion have considerable impacts on ecosystems, human well-being and agricultural production in the low precipitation zones of northern China. Little is known about the impact of growing winter rapeseed on ecological cropping systems and the associated economic benefits in the wind erosion area. To explore the winter rapeseed cover effect, we conducted a field experiment in which we covered the soil with winter rapeseed, winter wheat and wheat stubble at different plant density levels and used the spring bare ground as the control (CK). The effects of wind erosion, the “winter rapeseed + ” multiple cropping system, and the economic benefits were compared. There was a large difference in the dry matter, the maximum water absorption, the maximum water storage, the soil evaporation and total wind erosion, the amount of sediment transported in the stratum and the wind erosion modulus. Among them, the mean wind erosion modulus of spring sowing bare land was as high as 490.9 kg·hm−2·h−1, which was 7 and 13 times that of winter wheat and winter rapeseed, respectively. As the wind speed increased from 14 to 22 m·s−1, from a small density to a large density, the mean wind erosion modulus decreased from 68 to 17 kg·hm−2·h−1 for winter rapeseed, and 150 to 31 kg·hm−2·h−1 for winter wheat. Total wind-erosion of sediment transport of CK was 18.6 g·m−2 min−1, which was 16 and 31 times the mean value of winter wheat and winter rapeseed, respectively. “Winter rapeseed + ” replanting peanuts, potatoes, rice, seed melons and other crops generally increased the production value by 5–74% compared with wheat and corn intercropping, which was 98–255% higher than the traditional wheat single crop. Our results suggested that the suitable area for planting winter rapeseed in northern China was approximately 3.3 × 106 hm2, and in terms of the best economic and ecological effects, the appropriate density was 5 × 105 plants·hm−2 in northern China. Our results indicated that Chinese winter rapeseed was the best choice for preventing wind erosion and improving ecological and economic benefits in winter and spring in northern China; additionally, winter rapeseed has important impacts on agricultural sustainability in semi-arid and arid climates."
Enhancement of immune response against Bordetella spp. by disrupting immunomodulation,"Well-adapted pathogens must evade clearance by the host immune system and the study of how they do this has revealed myriad complex strategies and mechanisms. Classical bordetellae are very closely related subspecies that are known to modulate adaptive immunity in a variety of ways, permitting them to either persist for life or repeatedly infect the same host. Exploring the hypothesis that exposure to immune cells would cause bordetellae to induce expression of important immunomodulatory mechanisms, we identified a putative regulator of an immunomodulatory pathway. The deletion of btrS in B. bronchiseptica did not affect colonization or initial growth in the respiratory tract of mice, its natural host, but did increase activation of the inflammasome pathway, and recruitment of inflammatory cells. The mutant lacking btrS recruited many more B and T cells into the lungs, where they rapidly formed highly organized and distinctive Bronchial Associated Lymphoid Tissue (BALT) not induced by any wild type Bordetella species, and a much more rapid and strong antibody response than observed with any of these species. Immunity induced by the mutant was measurably more robust in all respiratory organs, providing completely sterilizing immunity that protected against challenge infections for many months. Moreover, the mutant induced sterilizing immunity against infection with other classical bordetellae, including B. pertussis and B. parapertussis, something the current vaccines do not provide. These findings reveal profound immunomodulation by bordetellae and demonstrate that by disrupting it much more robust protective immunity can be generated, providing a pathway to greatly improve vaccines and preventive treatments against these important pathogens."
Predicting how color and shape combine in the human visual system to direct attention,"Objects in a scene can be distinct from one another along a multitude of visual attributes, such as color and shape, and the more distinct an object is from its surroundings, the easier it is to find it. However, exactly how this distinctiveness advantage arises in vision is not well understood. Here we studied whether and how visual distinctiveness along different visual attributes (color and shape, assessed in four experiments) combine to determine an object’s overall distinctiveness in a scene. Unidimensional distinctiveness scores were used to predict performance in six separate experiments where a target object differed from distractor objects along both color and shape. Results showed that there is mathematical law determining overall distinctiveness as the simple sum of the distinctiveness scores along each visual attribute. Thus, the brain must compute distinctiveness scores independently for each visual attribute before summing them into the overall score that directs human attention."
The Levantine jellyfish Rhopilema nomadica and Rhizostoma pulmo swim faster against the flow than with the flow,"Jellyfish locomotion and orientation have been studied in the past both in the laboratory, testing mostly small jellyfish, and in the field, where it was impossible to control the seawater currents. Utilizing an outdoor water flume, we tested the locomotion of jellyfish when swimming against and with currents of up to 4.5 cm s−1. We used adult jellyfish from two of the most abundant species in the eastern Mediterranean, Rhopilema nomadica and Rhizostoma pulmo, and measured their pulsation frequency and swimming speed relative to the water. While pulsation frequency was not affected by the water velocity, jellyfish swam faster against the current than with it. This finding suggests that jellyfish possess a sensory ability, whose mechanism is currently unknown, enabling them to gauge the flow and react to it, possibly in order to reduce the risk of stranding."
Graphene plasmonically induced analogue of tunable electromagnetically induced transparency without structurally or spatially asymmetry,"Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) arises from the coherent coupling and interference between a superradiant (bright) mode in one resonator and a subradiant (dark) mode in an adjacent resonator. Generally, the two adjacent resonators are structurally or spatially asymmetric. Here, by numerical simulation, we demonstrate that tunable EIT can be induced by graphene ribbon pairs without structurally or spatially asymmetry. The mechanism originates from the fact that the resonate frequencies of the bright mode and the dark mode supported by the symmetrical graphene ribbon pairs can be respectively tuned by electrical doping levels, and when they are tuned to be equal the graphene plasmon coupling and interference occurs. The EIT in symmetrical nanostructure which avoids deliberately breaking the element symmetry in shape as well as in size facilitates the design and fabrication of the structure. In addition, the work regarding to EIT in the structurally symmetric could provide a fresh contribution to a more comprehensive physical understanding of Fano resonance."
Bivariate analysis of barley scald resistance with relative maturity reveals a new major QTL on chromosome 3H,"The disease scald of barley is caused by the pathogen Rhynchosporium commune and can cause up to 30–40% yield loss in susceptible cultivars. In this study, the Australian barley cultivar ‘Yerong’ was demonstrated to have resistance that differed from Turk (Rrs1 (Rh3 type)) based on seedling tests with 11 R. commune isolates. A doubled haploid population with 177 lines derived from a cross between ‘Yerong’ and the susceptible Australian cultivar ‘Franklin’ was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for scald resistance. A QTL on chromosome 3H was identified with large effect, consistent with a major gene conferring scald resistance at the seedling stage. Under field conditions, a bivariate analysis was used to model scald percentage of infected leaf area and relative maturity, the residuals from the regression were used as our phenotype for QTL analysis. This analysis identified one major QTL on chromosome 3H, which mapped to the same position as the QTL at seedling stage. The identified QTL on 3H is proposed to be different from the Rrs1 on the basis of seedling resistance against different R. commune isolates and physical map position. This study increases the current understanding of scald resistance and identifies genetic material possessing QTLs useful for the marker-assisted selection of scald resistance in barley breeding programs."
Electrokinetics in Micro-channeled Cantilevers: Extending the Toolbox for Reversible Colloidal Probes and AFM-Based Nanofluidics,"The combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with nanofluidics, also referred to as FluidFM, has facilitated new applications in scanning ion conductance microscopy, direct force measurements, lithography, or controlled nanoparticle deposition. An essential element of this new type of AFMs is its cantilever, which bears an internal micro-channel with a defined aperture at the end. Here, we present a new approach for in-situ characterization of the internal micro-channels, which is non-destructive and based on electrochemical methods. It allows for probing the internal environment of a micro-channeled cantilever and the corresponding aperture, respectively. Acquiring the streaming current in the micro-channel allows to determine not only the state of the aperture over a wide range of ionic strengths but also the surface chemistry of the cantilever’s internal channel. The high practical applicability of this method is demonstrated by detecting the aspiration of polymeric, inorganic and hydrogel particles with diameters ranging from several µm down to 300 nm. By verifying in-situ the state of the aperture, i.e. open versus closed, electrophysiological or nano-deposition experiments will be significantly facilitated. Moreover, our approach is of high significance for direct force measurements by the FluidFM-technique and sub-micron colloidal probes."
Structural analysis of mycobacterial homoserine transacetylases central to methionine biosynthesis reveals druggable active site,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the cause of the world’s most deadly infectious disease. Efforts are underway to target the methionine biosynthesis pathway, as it is not part of the host metabolism. The homoserine transacetylase MetX converts l-homoserine to O-acetyl-l-homoserine at the committed step of this pathway. In order to facilitate structure-based drug design, we determined the high-resolution crystal structures of three MetX proteins, including M. tuberculosis (MtMetX), Mycolicibacterium abscessus (MaMetX), and Mycolicibacterium hassiacum (MhMetX). A comparison of homoserine transacetylases from other bacterial and fungal species reveals a high degree of structural conservation amongst the enzymes. Utilizing homologous structures with bound cofactors, we analyzed the potential ligandability of MetX. The deep active-site tunnel surrounding the catalytic serine yielded many consensus clusters during mapping, suggesting that MtMetX is highly druggable."
Medieval Climate Variability in the eastern Amazon-Cerrado regions and its archeological implications,"The South American Monsoon System is responsible for the majority of precipitation in the continent, especially over the Amazon and the tropical savannah, known as ‘Cerrado’. Compared to the extensively studied subtropical and temperate regions the effect of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) on the precipitation over the tropics is still poorly understood. Here, we present a multiproxy paleoprecipitation reconstruction showing a consistent change in the hydrologic regime during the MCA in the eastern Amazon and ‘Cerrado’, characterized by a substantial transition from humid to drier conditions during the Early (925-1150 C.E.) to Late-MCA (1150-1350 C.E.). We compare the timing of major changes in the monsoon precipitation with the expansion and abandonment of settlements reported in the archeological record. Our results show that important cultural successions in the pre-Columbian Central Amazon, the transition from Paredão to Guarita phase, are in agreement with major changes in the hydrologic regime. Phases of expansion and, subsequent abandonment, of large settlements from Paredão during the Early to Late-MCA are coherent with a reduction in water supply. In this context we argue that the sustained drier conditions during the latter period may have triggered territorial disputes with Guarita leading to the Paredão demise."
Analysis of HDL-microRNA panel in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia subjects with LDL receptor null or defective mutation,"In the last years increasing attention has been given to the connection between genotype/phenotype and cardiovascular events in subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). MicroRNAs (miRs) bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) may contribute to better discriminate the cardiovascular risk of FH subjects. Our aim was to evaluate the HDL-miR panel in heterozygous FH (HeFH) patients with an LDLR null or defective mutation and its association with pulse wave velocity (PWV). We evaluated lipid panel, HDL-miR panel and PWV in 32 LDLR null mutation (LDLR-null group) and 35 LDLR defective variant (LDLR-defective group) HeFH patients. HDL-miR-486 and HDL-miR-92a levels were more expressed in the LDLR-null group than the LDLR-defective group. When we further stratified the study population into three groups according to both the LDLR genotype and history of ASCVD (LDLR-null/not-ASCVD, LDLR-defective/not-ASCVD and LDLR/ASCVD groups), both the LDLR/ASCVD and the LDLR-null/not-ASCVD groups had a higher expression of HDL-miR-486 and HDL-miR-92a than the LDLR-defective/not-ASCVD group. Finally, HDL-miR-486 and HDL-miR-92a were independently associated with PWV. In conclusion, the LDLR-null group exhibited HDL-miR-486 and HDL-miR-92a levels more expressed than the LDLR-defective group. Further studies are needed to evaluate these HDL-miRs as predictive biomarkers of cardiovascular events in FH."
Oral administration of EP4-selective agonist KAG-308 suppresses mouse knee osteoarthritis development through reduction of chondrocyte hypertrophy and TNF secretion,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the world’s most common degenerative diseases, but there is no disease-modifying treatment available. Previous studies have shown that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and PGE2 receptor 4 (EP4) are involved in OA pathogenesis; however, their roles are not fully understood. Here, we examined the efficacy of oral administration of KAG-308, an EP4-selective agonist, in surgically induced mouse knee OA. Cartilage degeneration and synovitis were significantly inhibited by the KAG-308 treatment. Chondrocyte hypertrophy and expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Mmp13) in the synovium were suppressed in the KAG-308-treated mice. In cultured chondrocytes, hypertrophic differentiation was inhibited by KAG-308 and intranuclear translocation of histone deacetylase 4 (Hdac4) was enhanced. In cultured synoviocytes, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of TNF and Mmp13 was also suppressed by KAG-308. KAG-308 was detected in the synovium and cartilage of orally treated mice. TNF secretion from the synovia of KAG-308-treated mice was significantly lower than control mice. Thus, we conclude that oral administration of KAG-308 suppresses OA development through suppression of chondrocyte hypertrophy and synovitis. KAG-308 may be a potent candidate for OA drug development."
Water channel pore size determines exclusion properties but not solute selectivity,"Aquaporins (AQPs) are a ubiquitous family of transmembrane water channel proteins. A subgroup of AQP water channels also facilitates transmembrane diffusion of small, polar solutes. A constriction within the pore, the aromatic/arginine (ar/R) selectivity filter, is thought to control solute permeability: previous studies on single representative water channel proteins suggest narrow channels conduct water, whilst wider channels permit passage of solutes. To assess this model of selectivity, we used mutagenesis, permeability measurements and in silico comparisons of water-specific as well as glycerol-permeable human AQPs. Our studies show that single amino acid substitutions in the selectivity filters of AQP1, AQP4 and AQP3 differentially affect glycerol and urea permeability in an AQP-specific manner. Comparison between in silico-calculated channel cross-sectional areas and in vitro permeability measurements suggests that selectivity filter cross-sectional area predicts urea but not glycerol permeability. Our data show that substrate discrimination in water channels depends on a complex interplay between the solute, pore size, and polarity, and that using single water channel proteins as representative models has led to an underestimation of this complexity."
Chaos theory discloses triggers and drivers of plankton dynamics in stable environment,"Despite the enticing discoveries of chaos in nature, triggers and drivers of this phenomenon remain a classical enigma which needs irrefutable empirical evidence. Here we analyze results of the yearlong replicated mesocosm experiment with multi-species plankton community that allowed revealing signs of chaos at different trophic levels in strictly controlled abiotic environment. In mesocosms without external stressors, we observed the “paradox of chaos” when biotic interactions (internal drivers) were acting as generators of internal abiotic triggers of complex plankton dynamics. Chaos was registered as episodes that vanished unpredictably or were substituted by complex behaviour of other candidates when longer time series were considered. Remarkably, episodes of chaos were detected even in the most abiotically stable conditions. We developed the Integral Chaos Indicator to validate the results of the Lyapunov exponent analysis. These findings are essential for modelling and forecasting behaviour of a variety of natural and other global systems."
Ceftriaxone modulates the acute corticosterone effects in local field potentials in the primary somatosensory cortex of anesthetized mice,"Stress responses are associated with elevations in corticosterone levels and, as a consequence, increases in glutamate in the central nervous system which can lead to neurological impairment. Ceftriaxone promotes glutamate transport and has been used to reduce glutamate toxicity, but so far it is not known whether ceftriaxone is able to reverse the effects of corticosterone administration. Here we describe the separate and combined effects of acute ceftriaxone and acute corticosterone administration in local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the somatosensory cortex (S1) of anesthetized mice. For this, LFPs were recorded from groups of anesthetized mice injected with saline, corticosterone, ceftriaxone, or both. Comparison of global state maps, and their displacements, as measured by ratios of different frequency bands (Ratio 1: 0.5–20 Hz/0.5–45 Hz; and Ratio 2: 0.5–4.5 Hz/0.5–9 Hz) revealed distinct and opposite effects for corticosterone and for ceftriaxone. Corticosterone specifically increased the displacement in Ratio 2, while ceftriaxone decreased it; in addition, when both corticosterone and ceftriaxone were injected, Ratio 2 displacement values were again similar to those of the control group. The present results suggest that ceftriaxone and corticosterone modulate specific frequency bands in opposite directions and reveal a potential role for ceftriaxone in counteracting the effects of corticosterone."
Effect of long anther dehiscence on seed set at high temperatures during flowering in rice (Oryza sativa L.),"Countermeasures that can mitigate the global warming impact on rice production are needed. The large dehiscence of anther for pollen dispersal is one trait that shows tolerance of seed set to high temperatures under the global warming. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of long anther dehiscence on high temperature tolerance. Seven chromosome segment substitution lines and the seed parent with the different dehiscence lengths were subjected to high daytime temperatures. Elongation of dehiscence formed at the base of anther (BDL) by 100 µm mitigated the occurrence of high temperature induced sterility by 20% and improved tolerance to the high temperature by 0.66 °C. Relationship between the seed set and BDL was well explained by pollination, showing that quantitative information provided in the present experiment is reliable. The information is expected to be used in estimation of global warming impact and making countermeasures for it."
Amyloidophilic Molecule Interactions on the Surface of Insulin Fibrils: Cooperative Binding and Fluorescence Quenching,"Protein aggregation into insoluble fibrillar aggregates is linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease. Commonly used methods to study aggregation inhibition or fibril destabilization by potential drugs include spectroscopic measurements of amyloidophilic dye molecule fluorescence or absorbance changes. In this work we show the cross-interactions of five different dye molecules on the surface of insulin amyloid fibrils, resulting in cooperative binding and fluorescence quenching."
Characterization and engineering of broadly reactive monoclonal antibody against hepatitis B virus X protein that blocks its interaction with DDB1,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) plays diverse roles in both viral life cycle and HBV-related carcinogenesis. Its interaction with DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1) was shown to be essential for engendering cellular conditions favorable for optimal viral transcription and replication. Previously, we described a mouse monoclonal antibody against HBx (anti-HBx 2A7) recognizing HBx encoded by representative strains from 7 of 8 known HBV genotypes. In this work, we further characterized 2A7 in order to explore its potential usefulness in HBx-targeting applications. We demonstrated that 2A7 recognizes a linear epitope mapped to L89PKVLHKR96 on HBx, a segment that is highly conserved across genotypes and coincidentally overlaps with the DDB1-interacting segment. HBx-DDB1 binding could be inhibited by 2A7 in vitro, suggesting therapeutic potential. Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of 2A7 were then obtained, which allowed construction of recombinant antibody and single chain variable fragments (scFv). 2A7-derived recombinant antibody and scFv recapitulate 2A7’s HBx-binding capacity and epitope specificity. We also reported preliminary results using cell-penetrating peptide for delivering 2A7 antibody across cell membrane to target intracellular HBx. Anti-HBx 2A7 and 2A7-derived scFv characterized here may give rise to novel HBx-targeting diagnostics and therapeutics for HBV- and HBx-related pathologies."
Characterization of IL-10-producing neutrophils in cattle infected with Ostertagia ostertagi,"IL-10 is a master regulator of immune responses, but its cellular source and function in cattle during the initial phase of immune priming have not been well established. Despite a massive B cell response in the abomasal draining lymph nodes in Ostertagia ostertagi (OO)-infected cattle, protective immunity is slow to develop, and partial protection requires years of repeated exposure. In addressing this problem, our initial hypothesis was that B cells produce IL-10 that downregulates the host protective immune response. However, our results showed that neutrophils made up the majority of IL-10-producing cells in circulation and in secondary lymphoid tissues, particularly the spleen (80%). Conversely, IL-10-producing B cells were rare. In addition, approximately 10% to 20% of the neutrophils in the blood and spleen expressed MHC II and were IL-10 negative, suggesting that neutrophils could also participate in antigen presentation. In vitro investigation of bovine neutrophils revealed that exposure thereof to OO extract increased IL-10 and MHC II expression in these cells in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with IL-10+/MHC II+ neutrophils detected in cattle shortly after experimental OO infection. Co-culture of untreated neutrophils with anti-CD3 antibody (Ab)-stimulated CD4+ T cells led to enhanced T cell activation; also, IL-10 depletion with neutralizing Ab enhanced the stimulatory function of neutrophils. OO extract depressed neutrophil stimulation of CD4+ T cells in the presence of IL-10-neutralizing Ab, suggesting that OO utilizes both IL-10-dependent and independent mechanisms to manipulate the bovine immune response. Finally, contact and viability were required for T cell-stimulatory neutrophil function. This report, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate that neutrophil-derived IL-10 is directly involved in T cell regulation in cattle. Our data suggest that neutrophils and neutrophil-derived IL-10 are co-opted by nematode parasites and other pathogens to attenuate host immune responses and facilitate pathogen survival."
"Vitamin D Deficiency and Associated Risk Factors in Women from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Vitamin D deficiency is an epidemic public health problem worldwide. It is common in the Middle East and is more severe in women. This cross-sectional study was conducted to assess vitamin D deficiency and associated risk factors in women living in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) was measured in 166 women aged 30–65 years. Socio-demographic, lifestyle and health status characteristics, as well as intake of selected dietary supplements, were collected. Weight and height were measured. Vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL) was reported in 60.2% of participants. Mean of serum 25(OH)D was 20.7 ng/mL. Older age and taking the supplements of vitamin D, multi-vitamins or calcium were identified as factors that associated with a lower risk of hypovitaminosis D. A national strategy is needed to control a hypovitaminosis D crisis in Saudi Arabia. This could be accomplished by raising public awareness regarding vitamin D, regulating and enhancing vitamin D fortification and supplementation and screening vitamin D status among women at high risk."
Properties of orb weaving spider glycoprotein glue change during Argiope trifasciata web construction,"An orb web’s prey capture thread relies on its glue droplets to retain insects until a spider can subdue them. Each droplet’s viscoelastic glycoprotein adhesive core extends to dissipate the forces of prey struggle as it transfers force to stiffer, support line flagelliform fibers. In large orb webs, switchback capture thread turns are placed at the bottom of the web before a continuous capture spiral progresses from the web’s periphery to its interior. To determine if the properties of capture thread droplets change during web spinning, we characterized droplet and glycoprotein volumes and material properties from the bottom, top, middle, and inner regions of webs. Both droplet and glycoprotein volume decreased during web construction, but there was a progressive increase in the glycoprotein’s Young’s modulus and toughness. Increases in the percentage of droplet aqueous material indicated that these increases in material properties are not due to reduced glycoprotein viscosity resulting from lower droplet hygroscopicity. Instead, they may result from changes in aqueous layer compounds that condition the glycoprotein. A 6-fold difference in glycoprotein toughness and a 70-fold difference in Young’s modulus across a web documents the phenotypic plasticity of this natural adhesive and its potential to inspire new materials."
Effects of miR-98 in intrauterine extracellular vesicles on maternal immune regulation during the peri-implantation period in cattle,"Evidence accumulated suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs) present in uterine lumen play a role in conceptus-endometrial cell interactions during peri-implantation periods. However, how intrauterine EVs function on endometrium have not been well characterized. To study how intrauterine EVs affect endometrial milieu in cattle, bovine endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) were treated with EVs isolated from uterine flushing fluids (UFs) on day 17 or 20 pregnancy (P17, P20, respectively; conceptus implantation to endometrium begins on days 19–19.5). RNA extracted from EECs were then subjected to RNA sequence analysis. The analysis revealed that transcripts related to immune system were down-regulated in EECs treated with EVs on P20 compared with those on P17. To investigate whether microRNAs (miRNAs) in EVs regulate maternal immune system in the endometrium during the peri-implantation, microRNA sequence and in silico analyses were performed, identifying bta-miR-98 in EVs as a potential miRNA to regulate maternal immune system. Furthermore, the treatment of EECs with bta-miR-98 negatively regulated several immune system-related genes, CTSC, IL6, CASP4 and IKBKE, in EECs. These results suggest that EVs containing bta-miR-98 is a regulator of maternal immune system, possibly allowing the conceptus attachment to the endometrial epithelium during the peri-implantation period."
Nervous system-wide profiling of presynaptic mRNAs reveals regulators of associative memory,"Presynaptic protein synthesis is important in the adult central nervous system; however, the nervous system-wide set of mRNAs localized to presynaptic areas has yet to be identified in any organism. Here we differentially labeled somatic and synaptic compartments in adult C. elegans with fluorescent proteins, and isolated synaptic and somatic regions from the same population of animals. We used this technique to determine the nervous system-wide presynaptic transcriptome by deep sequencing. Analysis of the synaptic transcriptome reveals that synaptic transcripts are predicted to have specialized functions in neurons. Differential expression analysis identified 542 genes enriched in synaptic regions relative to somatic regions, with synaptic functions conserved in higher organisms. We find that mRNAs for pumilio RNA-binding proteins are abundant in synaptic regions, which we confirmed through high-sensitivity in situ hybridization. Presynaptic PUMILIOs regulate associative memory. Our approach enables the identification of new mechanisms that regulate synaptic function and behavior."
Characterization of potential biomarkers of reactogenicity of licensed antiviral vaccines: randomized controlled clinical trials conducted by the BIOVACSAFE consortium,"Biomarkers predictive of inflammatory events post-vaccination could accelerate vaccine development. Within the BIOVACSAFE framework, we conducted three identically designed, placebo-controlled inpatient/outpatient clinical studies (NCT01765413/NCT01771354/NCT01771367). Six antiviral vaccination strategies were evaluated to generate training data-sets of pre-/post-vaccination vital signs, blood changes and whole-blood gene transcripts, and to identify putative biomarkers of early inflammation/reactogenicity that could guide the design of subsequent focused confirmatory studies. Healthy adults (N = 123; 20–21/group) received one immunization at Day (D)0. Alum-adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccine elicited vital signs and inflammatory (CRP/innate cells) responses that were similar between primed/naive vaccinees, and low-level gene responses. MF59-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (ATIV) induced distinct physiological (temperature/heart rate/reactogenicity) response-patterns not seen with non-adjuvanted TIV or with the other vaccines. ATIV also elicited robust early (D1) activation of IFN-related genes (associated with serum IP-10 levels) and innate-cell-related genes, and changes in monocyte/neutrophil/lymphocyte counts, while TIV elicited similar but lower responses. Due to viral replication kinetics, innate gene activation by live yellow-fever or varicella-zoster virus (YFV/VZV) vaccines was more suspended, with early IFN-associated responses in naïve YFV-vaccine recipients but not in primed VZV-vaccine recipients. Inflammatory responses (physiological/serum markers, innate-signaling transcripts) are therefore a function of the vaccine type/composition and presence/absence of immune memory. The data reported here have guided the design of confirmatory Phase IV trials using ATIV to provide tools to identify inflammatory or reactogenicity biomarkers."
Enhanced oligomerization of full-length RAGE by synergy of the interaction of its domains,"The pattern recognition receptor RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end-products) transmits proinflammatory signals in several inflammation-related pathological states, including vascular diseases, cancer, neurodegeneration and diabetes. Its oligomerization is believed to be important in signal transduction, but RAGE oligomeric structures and stoichiometries remain unclear. Different oligomerization modes have been proposed in studies involving different truncated versions of the extracellular parts of RAGE. Here, we provide basic characterization of the oligomerization patterns of full-length RAGE (including the transmembrane (TM) and cytosolic regions) and compare the results with oligomerization modes of its four truncated fragments. For this purpose, we used native mass spectrometry, analytical ultracentrifugation, and size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering. Our results confirm known oligomerization tendencies of separate domains and highlight the enhanced oligomerization properties of full-length RAGE. Mutational analyses within the GxxxG motif of the TM region show sensitivity of oligomeric distributions to the TM sequence. Using hydrogen–deuterium exchange, we mapped regions involved in TM-dependent RAGE oligomerization. Our data provide experimental evidence for the major role of the C2 and TM domains in oligomerization, underscoring synergy among different oligomerization contact regions along the RAGE sequence. These results also explain the variability of obtained oligomerization modes in RAGE fragments."
Age-related changes of individual macular retinal layers among Asians,"We characterized the age-related changes of the intra-retinal layers measured with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT; Cirrus high-definition OCT [Carl Zeiss Meditec]. The Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases is a population-based, cross-sectional study of Chinese, Malays and Indians living in Singapore. Iowa Reference Algorithms (Iowa Institute for Biomedical Imaging) were used for intra-retinal layer segmentation and mean thickness of 10 intra-retinal layers rescaled with magnification correction using axial length value. Linear regression models were performed to investigate the association of retinal layers with risk factors. After excluding participants with history of diabetes or ocular diseases, high-quality macular SD-OCT images were available for 2,047 participants (44–89 years old). Most of the retinal layers decreased with age except for foveal retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and the inner/outer segments of photoreceptors where they increased with age. Men generally had thicker retinal layers than women. Chinese have the thickest RNFL and retinal pigment epithelium amongst the ethnic groups. Axial length and refractive error remained correlated with retinal layers in spite of magnification correction. Our data show pronounced age-related changes in retinal morphology. Age, gender, ethnicity and axial length need be considered when establishing OCT imaging biomarkers for ocular or systemic disease."
Transcriptomic changes during TGF-β-mediated differentiation of airway fibroblasts to myofibroblasts,"Asthma is the most common chronic lung disease in children and young adults worldwide. Airway remodelling (including increased fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in airway walls due to chronic inflammation) differentiates asthmatic from non-asthmatic airways. The increase in airway fibroblasts and myofibroblasts occurs via epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) where epithelial cells lose their tight junctions and are transdifferentiated to mesenchymal cells, with further increases in myofibroblasts occurring via fibroblast-myofibroblast transition (FMT). Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is the central EMT- and FMT-inducing cytokine. In this study, we have used next generation sequencing to delineate the changes in the transcriptome induced by TGF-β treatment of WI-38 airway fibroblasts in both the short term and after differentiation into myofibroblasts, to gain an understanding of the contribution of TGF-β induced transdifferentiation to the asthmatic phenotype. The data obtained from RNAseq analysis was confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and protein expression investigated by western blotting. As expected, we found that genes coding for intermediates in the TGF-β signalling pathways (SMADs) were differentially expressed after TGF-β treatment, SMAD2 being upregulated and SMAD3 being downregulated as expected. Further, genes involved in cytoskeletal pathways (FN1, LAMA, ITGB1) were upregulated in myofibroblasts compared to fibroblasts. Importantly, genes that were previously shown to be changed in asthmatic lungs (ADAMTS1, DSP, TIMPs, MMPs) were similarly differentially expressed in myofibroblasts, strongly suggesting that TGF-β mediated differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts may underlie important changes in the asthmatic airway. We also identified new intermediates of signalling pathways (PKB, PTEN) that are changed in myofibroblasts compared to fibroblasts. We have found a significant number of genes that are altered after TGF-β induced transdifferentiation of WI-38 fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, many of which were expected or predicted. We also identified novel genes and pathways that were affected after TGF-β treatment, suggesting additional pathways are activated during the transition between fibroblasts and myofibroblasts and may contribute to the asthma phenotype."
A sulfur-containing volatile emitted by potato-associated bacteria confers protection against late blight through direct anti-oomycete activity,"Plant diseases are a major cause for yield losses and new strategies to control them without harming the environment are urgently needed. Plant-associated bacteria contribute to their host’s health in diverse ways, among which the emission of disease-inhibiting volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We have previously reported that VOCs emitted by potato-associated bacteria caused strong in vitro growth inhibition of the late blight causing agent Phytophthora infestans. This work focuses on sulfur-containing VOCs (sVOCs) and demonstrates the high in planta protective potential of S-methyl methane thiosulfonate (MMTS), which fully prevented late blight disease in potato leaves and plantlets without phytotoxic effects, in contrast to other sVOCs. Short exposure times were sufficient to protect plants against infection. We further showed that MMTS’s protective activity was not mediated by the plant immune system but lied in its anti-oomycete activity. Using quantitative proteomics, we determined that different sVOCs caused specific proteome changes in P. infestans, indicating perturbations in sulfur metabolism, protein translation and redox balance. This work brings new perspectives for plant protection against the devastating Irish Famine pathogen, while opening new research avenues on the role of sVOCs in the interaction between plants and their microbiome."
An Efficient Intestinal Organoid System of Direct Sorting to Evaluate Stem Cell Competition in Vitro,"Stem cell competition could shed light on the tissue-based quality control mechanism that prevents carcinogenesis. To quantitatively evaluate stem cell competition in vitro, we developed a two-color intestinal organoid forming system. First, we improved a protocol of culturing organoids from intestinal leucine-rich-repeat containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5)- enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)high stem cells directly sorted on Matrigel without embedding. The organoid-forming potential (OFP) was 25% of Lgr5-EGFPhigh cells sorted at one cell per well. Using this culture protocol with lineage tracing, we established a two-color organoid culture system by mixing stem cells expressing different fluorescent colors. To analyze stem cell competition, two-color organoids were formed by mixing X-ray-irradiated and non-irradiated intestinal stem cells. In the two-color organoids, irradiated stem cells exhibited a growth disadvantage, although the OFP of irradiated cells alone did not decrease significantly from that of non-irradiated cells. These results suggest that stem cell competition can be evaluated quantitively in vitro using our new system."
Regional-scale modelling and predictive uncertainty analysis of cumulative groundwater impacts from coal seam gas and coal mining developments,"The geological basins in Australia across which the hydrogeological Great Artesian Basin (GAB) exists, hold significant coal and coal seam gas (CSG) resources. Resource development from deep sedimentary basins often involves the risk of impacting groundwater resources. Predictive analysis of potential impacts on water resources are important for the risk analysis of resource development projects. A regional-scale numerical groundwater model was developed to probabilistically assess potential groundwater impacts due to additional coal resource development from a deep sedimentary basin underlying the GAB. The probabilistic simulation considered the plausible variability of the model parameters and accounted for uncertainties. Predictive uncertainty analysis was undertaken using a rejection sampling method after screening the model runs using predefined objective functions to evaluate the performance of the model runs with respect to historical observations. The predictive simulations were undertaken using 2,618 model runs to obtain maximum head drawdown caused by CSG and coal mining developments. The results showed that the water-table drawdown from an individual coal mining development becomes insignificant (maximum difference in drawdown <0.2 m) beyond 5 km. In general, less water-table drawdown was produced near the CSG development site but small amounts of drawdown spread further from it. Separation of surficial aquifers from deeper coal formations, as generally found in the GAB, limits the propagation of CSG-induced drawdown into the aquifers closer to the surface. While this study was specifically done for the Namoi region, similar outcomes could be expected in the broader GAB and other basins where equivalent hydrogeological conditions exist."
Clinical pharmacological study of dotinurad administered to male and female elderly or young subjects,"Dotinurad is a novel selective urate reabsorption inhibitor (SURI) that selectively inhibits the reabsorption of uric acid in renal tubules and promotes the excretion of uric acid into urine.

A novel microscale selective laser sintering (μ-SLS) process for the fabrication of microelectronic parts,"One of the biggest challenges in microscale additive manufacturing is the production of three-dimensional, microscale metal parts with a high enough throughput to be relevant for commercial applications. This paper presents a new microscale additive manufacturing process called microscale selective laser sintering (μ-SLS) that can produce true 3D metal parts with sub-5 μm resolution and a throughput of greater than 60 mm3/hour. In μ-SLS, a layer of metal nanoparticle ink is first coated onto a substrate using a slot die coating system. The ink is then dried to produce a uniform nanoparticle layer. Next, the substrate is precisely positioned under an optical subsystem using a set of coarse and fine nanopositioning stages. In the optical subsystem, laser light that has been patterned using a digital micromirror array is used to heat and sinter the nanoparticles into the desired patterns. This set of steps is then repeated to build up each layer of the 3D part in the μ-SLS system. Overall, this new technology offers the potential to overcome many of the current limitations in microscale additive manufacturing of metals and become an important process in microelectronics packaging applications."

Feasibility evaluation of micro-optical coherence tomography (μOCT) for rapid brain tumor type and grade discriminations: μOCT images versus pathology,"Precise identification, discrimination and assessment of central nervous system (CNS) tumors is of critical importance to brain neoplasm treatment. Due to the complexity and limited resolutions of the existing diagnostic tools, however, it is difficult to identify the tumors and their boundaries precisely in clinical practice, and thus, the conventional way of brain neoplasm treatment relies mainly on the experiences of neurosurgeons to make resection decisions in the surgery process. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential of Micro-optical coherence tomography (μOCT) as an intraoperative diagnostic imaging tool for identifying and discriminating glioma and meningioma with their microstructure imaging ex vivo, which thus may help neurosurgeons to perform precise surgery with low costs and reduced burdens."

Woven-like change following intracoronary thrombosis recanalization: a case report,"A woven coronary artery is a rare congenital coronary anomaly and incidentally found in coronary angiogram. Coronary angiography is the major diagnostic modality, which shows the main trunk of coronary divides into several channels which later reconnect with normal blood flow (J Int Cardiol 113:121-123 2006). However, some cases and reviews inferred that this characteristic might be mimicked by recanalized coronary thrombus, which occurs following thrombotic occlusion. In some case, the multiple intraluminal channels have a ‘Swiss cheese’, a ‘Spider web-like’, a ‘Honeycomb’ or a ‘Lotus root’ appearance and most of them appear in local segment (Int J Cardiol 186: 239–240, 2015). As these images are nonspecific findings, there is no angiographic uniform definition of intracoronary thrombus. More information about the characteristics and the development of this woven-like structure is needed."
Bisoprolol transdermal patch for perioperative care of non-cardiac surgery in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy,"Non-cardiac surgery for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is considered to require meticulous perioperative care. β-blockers are considered the first-line drugs for patients with HOCM, and they play a key role in preventing cardiovascular complications in perioperative care. The bisoprolol transdermal patch has recently become available in Japan, and it is useful for patients who are unable to take oral medication during perioperative care.

Longitudinal associations between perceptions of the neighbourhood environment and physical activity in adolescents: evidence from the Olympic Regeneration in East London (ORiEL) study,"Most UK adolescents do not achieve recommended levels of physical activity. Previous studies suggested that perceptions of the neighbourhood environment could contribute to explain differences in physical activity behaviours. We aimed to examine whether five measures of perceptions – perceived bus stop proximity, traffic safety, street connectivity, enjoyment of the neighbourhood for walking/cycling, and personal safety – were longitudinally associated with common forms of physical activity, namely walking to school, walking for leisure, and a composite measure of outdoor physical activity. We further aimed to investigate the moderating role of gender."
"Association between ESR1, ESR2, HER2, UGT1A4, and UGT2B7 polymorphisms and breast Cancer in Jordan: a case-control study","Breast cancer risk, development, and treatment are influenced by genetic variation in certain genes, namely those involved in cell proliferation, tumor suppression, and drug metabolism. In turn, the relevance of the aforementioned genetic variation to cancer depends on the ethnic group in question, highlighting the need for population-specific association studies. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the association between certain ESR1, ESR2, HER2, UGT1A4, and UGT2B7 single nucleotide polymorphisms and breast cancer."
TOPK promotes metastasis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by activating the Src/GSK3β/STAT3 signaling pathway via γ-catenin,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a fatal disease with poor prognosis. The predominant reason for ESCC-related death is distal metastasis. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying metastasis is needed for improving patient prognosis. T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) is a MAPKK-like kinase, which plays a vital role in various physiological and pathophysiological processes. However, the role of TOPK in ESCC metastasis is unclear."
Impact of dexamethasone-sparing regimens on delayed nausea caused by moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy: a meta-analysis of randomised evidence,"Nausea can be particularly prominent during the delayed period.

Improvements to the Water Quality of the Acidic Berkeley Pit Lake due to Copper Recovery and Sludge Disposal,"The chemistry and limnology of the Berkeley Pit lake, located in Butte, Montana, have substantially changed during the past 15 years. These changes are due to: (1) a large-scale Cu recovery project in which deep water was pumped to a Cu precipitation plant and returned to the surface of the lake; and (2) in-pit disposal of lime-treatment sludge. As a consequence, the lake has shifted from a meromictic to a holomictic state, over 99% of the dissolved Fe has precipitated as schwertmannite and other ferric solids, the total acidity of the water column has dropped by roughly 35%, and the pH has risen from about 2.5 to near 4.1. Whereas most of the lake was anoxic prior to 2013, the water column now contains > 6 mg/L dissolved oxygen from the lake surface to the deepest levels sampled (> 150 m). Concentrations of several other solutes, including As, P, Cr, and V, have fallen sharply due to adsorption or co-precipitation with Fe, while other species, such as Al, Mg, and Mn, have increased due to dissolution of solids in the sludge. Although the Cu recovery circuit was discontinued in 2013, in-pit disposal of sludge is expected to continue. The pit water is now close to saturation with basaluminite, and the pH should remain poised in the range of 4.1–4.5 for many years as Al precipitates out of the water column. Pumping and treating of pit water is set to commence in 2019, and will continue for the foreseeable future. Continued in-pit disposal of sludge should translate into long term water-quality improvement and a decrease in annual lime-consumption costs. Although the Berkeley Pit still has a long ways to go before it will meet water quality standards, it is heartening to mine-water specialists that the pit lake may not be a problem that is “too big to fix”."
Impact of inter-fuel substitution on energy intensity in Ghana,"Energy intensity and elasticity, together with inter-fuel substitution are key issues in the current development stage of Ghana. Translog production and ridge regression are applied for studying these issues with a data range of 2000–2015. The current energy dynamics reveal the expected inverse relationship: higher energy intensity and lower elasticity with economic growth. There are evidences of energy-economic challenges: high energy cost, inefficiency and backfire rebound effect. The implications are higher energy losses in the system, more consumption of lower-quality energy together with low energy technology innovation. Energy is wasted and directly not productive with economic activities. It is observed further that the higher energy intensity invariably increases CO2 emission because approximately 95% of total energy is derived from hydrocarbons and biomass. An inter-fuel substitution future scenario design was further conducted and the results were positive with growth, lower energy intensity, and improved energy efficiency. Therefore, government and energy policymakers should improve energy efficiency, cost, and productiveness. That is, they should change energy compositions and augment energy technology innovation, thus, increasing renewable share to 15% by 2026, reducing wood and charcoal by about 69%, and increasing natural gas to about 776%. Energy policymakers should enhance the installation of smart energy, cloud energy solution, tokenization of energy system and storage."
Cost of chronic and episodic migraine patients in continuous treatment for two years in a tertiary level headache Centre,"Migraine is one of the most common neurological diseases and an estimated 1.04 billion people worldwide have been diagnosed with migraine. Available data suggest that migraine is world widely associated with a high economic burden, but there is great variability in estimated costs that depends on the geographical, methodological and temporal differences between the studies. The purpose of this study was to quantify the annual direct cost of episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM), both for the patient and for the National Health System (NHS), using data from subjects who attended an Italian tertiary headache centre. Furthermore, we evaluated comparatively the impact of gender and age on the economic burden of migraine."
DynaVenn: web-based computation of the most significant overlap between ordered sets,"In many research disciplines, ordered lists are compared. One example is to compare a subset of all significant genes or proteins in a primary study to those in a replication study. Often, the top of the lists are compared using Venn diagrams, ore more precisely Euler diagrams (set diagrams showing logical relations between a finite collection of different sets). If different cohort sizes, different techniques or algorithms for evaluation were applied, a direct comparison of significant genes with a fixed threshold can however be misleading and approaches comparing lists would be more appropriate."
Benchmarking the PEPOP methods for mimicking discontinuous epitopes,"Computational methods provide approaches to identify epitopes in protein Ags to help characterizing potential biomarkers identified by high-throughput genomic or proteomic experiments. PEPOP version 1.0 was developed as an antigenic or immunogenic peptide prediction tool. We have now improved this tool by implementing 32 new methods (PEPOP version 2.0) to guide the choice of peptides that mimic discontinuous epitopes and thus potentially able to replace the cognate protein Ag in its interaction with an Ab. In the present work, we describe these new methods and the benchmarking of their performances."
LMAP_S: Lightweight Multigene Alignment and Phylogeny eStimation,"Recent advances in genome sequencing technologies and the cost drop in high-throughput sequencing continue to give rise to a deluge of data available for downstream analyses. Among others, evolutionary biologists often make use of genomic data to uncover phenotypic diversity and adaptive evolution in protein-coding genes. Therefore, multiple sequence alignments (MSA) and phylogenetic trees (PT) need to be estimated with optimal results. However, the preparation of an initial dataset of multiple sequence file(s) (MSF) and the steps involved can be challenging when considering extensive amount of data. Thus, it becomes necessary the development of a tool that removes the potential source of error and automates the time-consuming steps of a typical workflow with high-throughput and optimal MSA and PT estimations."
PEIS: a novel approach of tumor purity estimation by identifying information sites through integrating signal based on DNA methylation data,"Tumor purity plays an important role in understanding the pathogenic mechanism of tumors. The purity of tumor samples is highly sensitive to tumor heterogeneity. Due to Intratumoral heterogeneity of genetic and epigenetic data, it is suitable to study the purity of tumors. Among them, there are many purity estimation methods based on copy number variation, gene expression and other data, while few use DNA methylation data and often based on selected information sites. Consequently, how to choose methylation sites as information sites has an important influence on the purity estimation results. At present, the selection of information sites was often based on the differentially methylated sites that only consider the mean signal, without considering other possible signals and the strong correlation among adjacent sites."
The exploration of disease-specific gene regulatory networks in esophageal carcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma,"Feed-forward loops (FFLs), consisting of miRNAs, transcription factors (TFs) and their common target genes, have been validated to be important for the initialization and development of complex diseases, including cancer. Esophageal Carcinoma (ESCA) and Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD) are two types of malignant tumors in the digestive tract. Understanding common and distinct molecular mechanisms of ESCA and STAD is extremely crucial."
PCA via joint graph Laplacian and sparse constraint: Identification of differentially expressed genes and sample clustering on gene expression data,"In recent years, identification of differentially expressed genes and sample clustering have become hot topics in bioinformatics. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used method in gene expression data. However, it has two limitations: first, the geometric structure hidden in data, e.g., pair-wise distance between data points, have not been explored. This information can facilitate sample clustering; second, the Principal Components (PCs) determined by PCA are dense, leading to hard interpretation. However, only a few of genes are related to the cancer. It is of great significance for the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer to identify a handful of the differentially expressed genes and find new cancer biomarkers."

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies also confirmed the formation of title compounds. These compounds were evaluated in vitro for their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. The results demonstrated that most of the tested compounds showed potent antifungal activity. Interestingly, these compounds also exhibited good anti-inflammatory and moderate antibacterial activity towards sensitive as well as resistant bacterial strains. In silico studies depicted their good binding affinity profile against S. aureus (PDB ID: 1AD4) and C. albicans (PDB ID: 1AI9)."
"The geography of evolutionary divergence in the highly endemic avifauna from the Sierra Madre del Sur, Mexico","Mesoamerica is a remarkable region with a high geological and ecological complexity. Within northern Mesoamerica, the biotic province of the Sierra Madre del Sur (SMS) in southwestern Mexico harbors exceptionally high avian endemism and diversity. Herein, we searched for spatially and temporally concordant phylogeographic patterns, in four bird genera from three distinct avian orders co-distributed across Mesoamerica and investigated their causes through hypothesis testing regarding historical processes. Selected species include endemic and differentiated populations across the montane forests of Mesoamerica, and particularly within the SMS."
"Quantitative relationship between plume emission and multiple deflations after the 2014 phreatic eruption at Ontake volcano, Japan","The phreatic eruption of Mount Ontake in 2014 caused local-scale subsidence and a mass discharge of water–vapor plumes from vents. A previous study of InSAR data analysis modeled the local subsidence as a deflation of a shallow hydrothermal reservoir (~ 500 m beneath the vents), and speculated that it was associated with plume emission continuing just after the eruption. In addition, combination of the InSAR and GNSS data implies that another, deeper deflation source (~ 3–6 km beneath the vents) contributes to the baseline contraction of the GNSS data. In this study, we estimated daily mass flux of the emitting plumes using photographed images, and compared the temporal behavior of the discharged mass with that of deflation of the two sources in order to clarify their association. The temporal profiles of the shallow deflation volume and the discharge mass both show evidence of decay, but with different characteristics; the deflation volume progress was approximated by a single exponential decay with a long relaxation time (379–641 days), whereas the discharge mass displayed a sum of a linear trend and an exponential decay with shorter relaxation time (47 days). This discrepancy, along with GNSS data, suggests the contribution of a deep deflation source with a short relaxation time (20–40 days). Estimation of mass balance between the emitting plume and fluids discharged from both shallow and deep sources revealed that more than 70% of the discharged mass came from the deep source. Based on the estimated mass balance, phase state of the shallow reservoir was estimated as a single-phase, liquid-rich reservoir. The fast decay of the deep deflation may reflect rapid depressurization due to violent fluid discharge at the onset of the eruption. In contrast, the slow decay of the shallow deflation suggests that it had a minor role in the eruption. However, such a wet reservoir has the potential to induce volcanic hazard such as snow-melting lahar for future eruptions, requiring monitoring the volcano, which will probably shift to pre-eruptive re-pressurized phase, until the future eruption."
Development of a framework with tools to support the selection and implementation of patient-reported outcome measures,"Patient reported outcomes (PROs) provide information on a patient’s health status coming directly from the patient. Measuring PROs with patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) has gained wide interest in clinical practice for individual patient care, as well as in quality improvement, and for providing transparency of outcomes to stakeholders through public reporting. However, current knowledge of selecting and implementing PROMs for these purposes is scattered, and not readily available for clinicians and quality managers in healthcare organizations. The objective of this study is to develop a framework with tools to support the systematic selection, implementation and evaluation of PROs and PROMs in individual patient care, for quality improvement and public reporting."
Neoantigen-specific immunity in low mutation burden colorectal cancers of the consensus molecular subtype 4,"The efficacy of checkpoint blockade immunotherapies in colorectal cancer is currently restricted to a minority of patients diagnosed with mismatch repair-deficient tumors having high mutation burden. However, this observation does not exclude the existence of neoantigen-specific T cells in colorectal cancers with low mutation burden and the exploitation of their anti-cancer potential for immunotherapy. Therefore, we investigated whether autologous neoantigen-specific T cell responses could also be observed in patients diagnosed with mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers."
Teacher Anxiety Program for Elementary Students (TAPES): intervention development and proposed randomized controlled trial,"Excessive student anxiety is a common problem that severely impairs short- and long-term academic functioning and increases teacher burden. Reducing student anxiety has been associated with improvement in educational functioning. Because anxiety manifests daily in the classroom, teachers are in an ideal position to identify and help students manage their anxiety. Unfortunately, teachers lack the knowledge and skills to support the learning of students with excessive anxiety. The Teacher Anxiety Program for Elementary Students (TAPES), a novel teacher-administered school-home collaborative intervention, was designed to address this gap."
"INtervention for Cognitive Reserve Enhancement in delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s Symptomatic Expression (INCREASE), a randomized controlled trial: rationale, study design, and protocol","The course of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) includes a 10–20-year preclinical period with progressive accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the absence of symptomatic cognitive or functional decline. The duration of this preclinical stage in part depends on the rate of pathologic progression, which is offset by compensatory mechanisms, referred to as cognitive reserve (CR). Comorbid medical conditions, psychosocial stressors, and inappropriate medication use may lower CR, hastening the onset of symptomatic AD. Here, we describe a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to test the efficacy of a medication therapy management (MTM) intervention to reduce inappropriate medication use, bolster cognitive reserve, and ultimately delay symptomatic AD."
"Home parenteral nutrition with an omega-3-fatty-acid-enriched MCT/LCT lipid emulsion in patients with chronic intestinal failure (the HOME study): study protocol for a randomized, controlled, multicenter, international clinical trial","Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is a life-preserving therapy for patients with chronic intestinal failure (CIF) indicated for patients who cannot achieve their nutritional requirements by enteral intake. Intravenously administered lipid emulsions (ILEs) are an essential component of HPN, providing energy and essential fatty acids, but can become a risk factor for intestinal-failure-associated liver disease (IFALD). In HPN patients, major effort is taken in the prevention of IFALD. Novel ILEs containing a proportion of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) could be of benefit, but the data on the use of n-3 PUFA in HPN patients are still limited."
"A randomised controlled trial of an exercise intervention promoting activity, independence and stability in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and early dementia (PrAISED) - A Protocol",People with dementia progressively lose cognitive and functional abilities. Interventions promoting exercise and activity may slow decline. We developed a novel intervention to promote activity and independence and prevent falls in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early dementia. We successfully undertook a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) to refine the intervention and research delivery. We are now delivering a multi-centred RCT to evaluate its clinical and cost-effectiveness.
Results and lessons learnt from a randomized controlled trial: prophylactic treatment of vestibular migraine with metoprolol (PROVEMIG),Vestibular migraine (VM) is the most frequent cause of recurrent spontaneous attacks of vertigo causally related to migraine.

Treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia with multi-drug resistant organism by Buzhong Yiqi decoction based on Fuzheng Quxie classical prescription: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Drug resistance in China is becoming a more and more serious issue. Infection by drug-resistant bacteria has become a major disease that seriously threatens the health of Chinese people and affects national medical finance. Therefore, it is of great scientific and clinical significance to actively carry out research on the prevention and treatment of infections by multi-drug resistant organisms (MDRO). Previous studies by the authors suggested that patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by MDRO mostly showed the pathological state of “insufficient healthy Qi and internal accumulation of pathogenic Qi” and “acute deficiency syndrome” mainly characterized by Qi deficiency. Buzhong Yiqi decoction is a famous classic prescription in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for treating internal damage fever. This study intends to provide an evidence-based rationale for Buzhong Yiqi decoction in treating MDRO hospital-acquired pneumonia by conducting a multi-center randomized controlled clinical study."

Effects of acupuncture on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in chronic insomnia patients: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Acupuncture, as an important component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been widely applied in the treatment of chronic insomnia in China, while there is no clinical study related to its therapeutic mechanism."
Salivary gland proteome analysis of developing adult female Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks: molecular motor and TCA cycle-related proteins play an important role throughout development,"Ticks are notorious blood-feeding arthropods that can spread a variety of deadly diseases. The salivary gland is an important organ for ticks to feed on blood, and this organ begins to develop rapidly when ixodid ticks suck blood. When these ticks reach a critical weight, the salivary glands stop developing and begin to degenerate. The expression levels of a large number of proteins during the development and degeneration of salivary glands change, which regulate the biological functions of the salivary glands. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there are only a few reports on the role of molecular motor and TCA cycle-related proteins in the salivary glands of ticks."
Evaluation of a Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction algorithm for low-count clinical 18F-FDG PET/CT,"Recently, a Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) reconstruction algorithm was introduced for a commercial PET/CT with the potential to improve image quality. We compared the performance of this BPL algorithm with conventional reconstruction algorithms under realistic clinical conditions such as daily practiced at many European sites, i.e. low 18F-FDG dose and short acquisition times."
IDC theory: creation and the creation loop,"The interest-driven creator (IDC) theory is being developed as a group endeavor by Asian researchers to articulate a holistic learning design theory for future education in Asia. The theory hypothesizes that students, driven by interest, can be engaged in the creation of knowledge (generating ideas and artifacts). By repeating this creation process in their daily learning routines, they will excel in learning performance, develop twenty-first-century competencies, and form creation habits. We hope that with such practices in education, our future generations will ultimately become lifelong interest-driven creators. In IDC Theory, there are three anchored concepts, namely, interest, creation, and habit. Each anchored concept comprises three component concepts which form a concept loop. For example, the creation loop consists of three component concepts—imitating, combining, and staging. Imitating is concerned with taking in (or inputting) an abundant amount of existing knowledge from the outside world to form one’s background knowledge. Combining refers to delivering (or outputting) new ideas or artifacts prolifically by synthesizing existing information encountered in the world and thoughts arising from the students’ background knowledge. Staging relates to frequently demonstrating the generated ideas or artifacts to the relevant communities and receiving feedback from these communities to improve the novelty and value of the demonstrated outcomes while gaining social recognition and nurturing positive social emotions. This paper focuses on describing the three components of the creation loop. We provide three case studies to illustrate the creation loop at work, as well as how it intertwines with both the interest and habit loops in supporting students to develop their creation capabilities. In presenting this iteration of the creation concept, an anchored concept in IDC theory, we acknowledge the roles played of imitation, combination, and staging in different learning and education contexts—indeed, there are multiple theories that inform and intersect with it."
Economic evaluation of alternative technologies to mitigate Sulphur emissions in maritime container transport from both the vessel owner and shipper perspective,"International maritime shipping is confronted from 2006 onwards with regulation until 2030 by different policy actors (i.e. International Maritime Organization, hereafter IMO), the EU) in order to improve the ecological performance of maritime shipping, and will face more so in the future. Many of these regulations concern the reduction of air pollution of vessels both globally and in particular in so-called Emission Control Areas (ECA’s)."

An efficient steganographic technique for hiding data,"Steganography is the technique for hiding data and aims to hide data in such a way that any eavesdropper cannot observe any changes in the original media. The least significant bit (LSB) is one of the most public techniques in steganography. The classical technique is LSB substitution. The main idea of this technique is to directly alter some LSB of the cover image with the secret data. The essential drawback of the available LSB techniques is that increasing the capacity of the stego image leads to decreasing its quality. Therefore, the goal of the proposed method is to enhance the capacity taking high visual quality into consideration. To achieve this goal, some LSB of the cover image are inverted depending on the secret data for embedding instead of replacing LSB with the secret data. First, the maximum and minimum values in the secret data are determined then subtract all values of the secret data from this maximum value. Finally, make a division for the results and embed the new results into the cover image to obtain the stego image. The results show that the proposed method gives high capacity and good imperceptibility in comparison with the previous methods."
Effect of internal heat generation on free convective power-law variable temperature past a vertical plate considering exponential variable viscosity and thermal conductivity,"The aim of this paper is to study the free convection boundary-layer flow with heat generation and variable fluid properties past a vertical plate. We incorporated the heat generation and variable viscosity are the exponential decay form and thermal conductivity is the linear form in the governing equation. Using similarity transformations, the governing coupled non-linear partial differential equations are transformed into a system of coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations and then solved using Maple symbolic software to execute the computations via dsolve. The effects of the temperature-dependent viscosity, the wall velocity power index, the thermal conductivity, the wall temperature parameter, and the Prandtl number on the flow and temperature fields are presented. The skin friction and the wall temperature gradient are also presented for different values of the physical parameters."

Instilling purpose and value in the implementation of digital badges in higher education,"This qualitative multi-case study examined digital badge programs being used at three higher education institutions, at the course level, the department level, and the university level. The study sought to explore the adoption of badges in higher education using Rogers’ (2003) innovation diffusion theory to identify factors associated with the adoption process in order to provide contextual insight into factors that impede and facilitate successful implementation of badge systems. Rogers established that there are five specific characteristics of innovations (relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability) which are attributed to varying rates of adoption (2003). The results of the current study also attributed factors related to complexity as barriers to successful adoption of badges in each of the three cases. Results found that usability issues, increased faculty workload, and a lack of understanding of the badges’ purpose and value were the main factors which negatively impacted badge adoption."

Exact distributions for stochastic models of gene expression with arbitrary regulation,"Stochasticity in gene expression can result in uctuations in gene product levels. Recent experiments indicated that feedback regulation plays an important role in controlling the noise in gene expression. A quantitative understanding of the feedback effect on gene expression requires analysis of the corresponding stochastic model. However, for stochastic models of gene expression with general regulation functions, exact analytical results for gene product distributions have not been given so far. Here, we propose a technique to solve a generalized ON-OFF model of stochastic gene expression with arbitrary (positive or negative, linear or nonlinear) feedbacks including posttranscriptional or posttranslational regulation. The obtained results, which generalize results obtained previously, provide new insights into the role of feedback in regulating gene expression. The proposed analytical framework can easily be extended to analysis of more complex models of stochastic gene expression."
Enhanced Crystallization Rate of Poly(L-lactide)/Hydroxyapatite-graft-poly(D-lactide) Composite with Different Processing Temperatures,"Hydroxyapatite-graft-poly(D-lactide) (HA-g-PDLA) was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization with HA as initiator and stannous octanoate (Sn(Oct)2) as catalyst. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results indicate that PDLA chains are successfully grafted onto HA particles by covalent bond. Under two different processing temperatures (190 and 230 °C), the effect of the grafted PDLA chains on the crystallization behavior of poly(L-lactide)/HA-g-PDLA (PLLA/HA-g-PDLA) composite was investigated in the current study, comparing to neat PLLA and its four composites (PLLA/HA, PLLA/HA-g-PLLA, PLLA/PDLA, and PLLA/HA/PDLA). The crystallization rate of PLLA/HA-g-PDLA composite is highly enhanced comparing to PLLA, PLLA/HA and PLLA/HA-g-PLLA composites in which there are no stereocomplex (SC) crystallites. In addition, when the processing temperature rises from 190 °C to 230 °C, the acceleration of PLLA crystallization in PLLA/HA-g-PDLA composite is not influenced so much as other composites containing SC crystallites, such as PLLA/HA/PDLA or PLLA/PDLA. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results demonstrate that even without SC crystallites, the crystallization of PLLA can still be accelerated a lot in this composite. This may be related to the interaction between the grafted PDLA chains and the amorphous PLLA chains in PLLA/HA-g-PDLA composite. The isothermal crystallization kinetics studies indicate that the nature of nucleation and crystal growth of PLLA/HA-g-PDLA composite are more likely 3D crystalline growth with heterogeneous nucleation mode, which are different from PLLA or other composites. This investigation could shed new light on the application of PLLA/HA composites."

Pralatrexate in patients with recurrent or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphomas: a multicenter retrospective analysis,"Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are a heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas with poor clinical outcomes. Pralatrexate showed efficacy and safety in recurrent or refractory PTCLs. The purpose or this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of pralatrexate in relapsed or refractory PTCLs in real-world practice. This was an observational, multicenter, retrospective analysis. Between December 2012 and December 2016, a total of 38 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCLs were treated with pralatrexate at 10 tertiary hospitals in Korea. Patients received an intravenous infusion of pralatrexate at a dose of 30 mg/m2/week for 6 weeks on a 7-week schedule. Modified dosing and/or scheduling was allowed according to institutional protocols. Median patient age was 58 years (range, 29–80 years) and the most common subtype was peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (n = 23, 60.5%). The median dosage of pralatrexate per administration was 25.6 mg/m2/wk (range, 15.0–33.0 mg/m2/wk). In intention-to-treat analysis, 3 patients (7.9%) showed a complete response and 5 patients (13.2%) showed a partial response, resulting in an overall response rate (ORR) of 21.1%. The median duration of response was 7.6 months (range, 1.6–24.3 months). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7–1.8 months) and the median overall survival was 7.7 months (95% CI, 4.4–9.0 months). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (n = 13, 34.2%), neutropenia (n = 7, 23.7%), and anemia (n = 7, 18.4%). Our study showed relatively lower ORR and shorter PFS in patients with recurrent or refractory PTCLs treated with pralatrexate in real-world practice. The toxicity profile was acceptable and manageable. We also observed significantly lower dose intensity of pralatrexate in real-world practice."
"Rivaroxaban after Thrombolysis in Acute Iliofemoral Venous Thrombosis: A Randomized, Open-labeled, Multicenter Trial","Recently non-Vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) is replacing warfarin for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, the role of NOAC after thrombolysis of acute iliofeomral DVT (IFDVT) is not yet defined. This randomized clinical trial aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban versus warfarin after catheter directed thrombolysis of an IFDVT. Patients with acute DVT of both the iliac and the femoral vein (n = 72) were recruited and randomized to either standard anticoagulation (enoxaparin and warfarin, n = 35) or rivaroxaban (n = 37) after successful thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy. Primary efficacy outcome was a recurrence of any venous thromboembolism (VTE) within 6 months. Secondary safety outcomes included major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB), other adverse event, and all-cause mortality. Rate of recurrent VTE were similar in both groups (11.4% versus 12.5%; p = 0.94). Major bleeding or CRNMB was less in rivaroxaban group without significance (2.9% versus 9.4%, HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.03–2.96; p = 0.31). Recurrence-free survival and major bleeding-free survival at 6 months were not different in both groups. After thrombolysis of acute IFDVT, rivaroxaban was as safe and effective as warfarin in preventing DVT recurrence."
Epigenetic reprogramming underlies efficacy of DNA demethylation therapy in osteosarcomas,"Osteosarcoma (OS) patients with metastasis or recurrent tumors still suffer from poor prognosis. Studies have indicated the efficacy of DNA demethylation therapy for OS, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Here, we aimed to clarify the mechanism of how epigenetic therapy has therapeutic efficacy in OS. Treatment of four OS cell lines with a DNA demethylating agent, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) treatment, markedly suppressed their growth, and in vivo efficacy was further confirmed using two OS xenografts. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis showed that 10 of 28 primary OS had large numbers of methylated CpG islands while the remaining 18 OS did not, clustering together with normal tissue samples and Ewing sarcoma samples. Among the genes aberrantly methylated in primary OS, genes involved in skeletal system morphogenesis were present. Searching for methylation-silenced genes by expression microarray screening of two OS cell lines after 5-aza-dC treatment revealed that multiple tumor-suppressor and osteo/chondrogenesis-related genes were re-activated by 5-aza-dC treatment of OS cells. Simultaneous activation of multiple genes related to osteogenesis and cell proliferation, namely epigenetic reprogramming, was considered to underlie the efficacy of DNA demethylation therapy in OS."
Phenylethylamides derived from bacterial secondary metabolites specifically inhibit an insect serotonin receptor,"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine: 5-HT) is a biogenic monoamine that mediates immune responses and modulates nerve signal in insects. Se-5HTR, a specific receptor of serotonin, has been identified in the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua. It is classified into subtype 7 among known 5HTRs. Se-5HTR was expressed in all developmental stages of S. exigua. It was expressed in all tested tissues of larval stage. Its expression was up-regulated in hemocytes and fat body in response to immune challenge. RNA interference (RNAi) of Se-5HTR exhibited significant immunosuppression by preventing cellular immune responses such as phagocytosis and nodulation. Treatment with an inhibitor (SB-269970) specific to 5HTR subtype 7 resulted in significant immunosuppression. Furthermore, knockout mutant of Se-5HTR by CRISPR-Cas9 led to significant reduction of phagocytotic activity of S. exigua hemocytes. Such immunosuppression was also induced by bacterial secondary metabolites derived from Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus. To determine specific bacterial metabolites inhibiting Se-5HTR, this study screened 37 bacterial secondary metabolites with respect to cellular immune responses associated with Se-5HTR and selected 10 potent inhibitors. These 10 selected compounds competitively inhibited cellular immune responses against 5-HT and shared phenylethylamide (PEA) chemical skeleton. Subsequently, 46 PEA derivatives were screened and resulting potent chemicals were used to design a compound to be highly inhibitory against Se-5HTR. The designed compound was chemically synthesized. It showed high immunosuppressive activities along with specific and competitive inhibition activity for Se-5HTR. This study reports the first 5HT receptor from S. exigua and provides its specific inhibitor designed from bacterial metabolites and their derivatives."
Antimicrobial Photoinactivation Using Visible Light Plus Water-Filtered Infrared-A (VIS + wIRA) and Hypericum Perforatum Modifies In Situ Oral Biofilms,"Due to increasing antibiotic resistance, the application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is gaining increasing popularity in dentistry. The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effects of aPDT using visible light (VIS) and water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA) in combination with a Hypericum perforatum extract on in situ oral biofilms. The chemical composition of H. perforatum extract was analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS). To obtain initial and mature oral biofilms in situ, intraoral devices with fixed bovine enamel slabs (BES) were carried by six healthy volunteers for two hours and three days, respectively. The ex situ exposure of biofilms to VIS + wIRA (200 mWcm−2) and H. perforatum (32 mg ml−1, non-rinsed or rinsed prior to aPDT after 2-min preincubation) lasted for five minutes. Biofilm treatment with 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution (CHX) served as a positive control, while untreated biofilms served as a negative control. The colony-forming units (CFU) of the aPDT-treated biofilms were quantified, and the surviving microorganisms were identified using MALDI-TOF biochemical tests as well as 16 S rDNA-sequencing. We could show that the H. perforatum extract had significant photoactivation potential at a concentration of 32 mg ml−1. When aPDT was carried out in the presence of H. perforatum, all biofilms (100%) were completely eradicated (p = 0.0001). When H. perforatum was rinsed off prior to aPDT, more than 92% of the initial viable bacterial count and 13% of the mature oral biofilm were killed. Overall, the microbial composition in initial and mature biofilms was substantially altered after aPDT, inducing a shift in the synthesis of the microbial community. In conclusion, H. perforatum-mediated aPDT using VIS + wIRA interferes with oral biofilms, resulting in their elimination or the substantial alteration of microbial diversity and richness. The present results support the evaluation of H. perforatum-mediated aPDT for the adjunctive treatment of biofilm-associated oral diseases."
Modeling Electrical Percolation to optimize the Electromechanical Properties of CNT/Polymer Composites in Highly Stretchable Fiber Strain Sensors,"A simulation model of electrical percolation through a three-dimensional network of curved CNTs is developed in order to analyze the electromechanical properties of a highly stretchable fiber strain sensor made of a CNT/polymer composite. Rigid-body movement of the curved CNTs within the polymer matrix is described analytically. Random arrangements of CNTs within the composite are generated by a Monte-Carlo simulation method and a union-find algorithm is utilized to investigate the network percolation. Consequently, the strain-induced resistance change curves are obtained in a wide strain range of the composite. In order to compare our model with experimental results, two CNT/polymer composite fibers were fabricated and tested as strain sensors. Their effective CNT volume fractions are estimated by comparing the experimental data with our simulation model. The results confirm that the proposed simulation model reproduces well the experimental data and is useful for predicting and optimizing the electromechanical characteristics of highly stretchable fiber strain sensors based on CNT/polymer composites."
The Relationship Between Evaluation Methods for Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy,"Numbness and pain are currently evaluated using subjective methods such as the visual analogue scale (VAS). PainVision (PV) is an analytical instrument that was designed to quantitatively assess sense perception and nociception in patients. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of the most important adverse events that renders prolonged chemotherapy difficult. To assess the features of CIPN, we aimed to compare PV methods with existing methods. A total of 73 patients received oxaliplatin for metastatic colorectal cancer. Registered patients included 37 men and 36 women in the range of 37 to 89 years (median 70). CIPN was evaluated a total of 483 times (median per patient six times). Our study examined the correlation between evaluation methods of CIPN using VAS and PV, respectively. The average VAS (hand), VAS (foot) and PV scores of CIPN were 18.4 (range: 0–100), 23.8 (range: 0–100), and 24.7 (range: 0–496), respectively. VAS (hand), VAS (foot), and FACT/GOG-NTX (NTX2, NTX4 and NTX8) were significantly correlated with PV. PV showed no correlation with a Disk-Criminator or the monofilament test used as a quantitative evaluation. The evaluation of CIPN is complex, and further improvement is required for evaluation with PV."
Deep placement of controlled-release urea effectively enhanced nitrogen use efficiency and fresh ear yield of sweet corn in fluvo-aquic soil,"Application of controlled-release urea (CRU) improves crop yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) compared with conventional urea. However, the effectiveness of CRU differs with fertilization placement. A two site-year field experiment was carried out in fluvo-aquic soil in central China to study the effects of two N sources (CRU and urea) and three fertilization placements (band application between two corn rows at 0, 5, and 15 cm soil depths) on fresh ear yield and NUE of sweet corn. The soil inorganic N (NO3−-N and NH4+-N) concentrations at the soil layers of 0–20 cm and 20–40 cm, root morphology characteristics and leaf physiological functions were also measured during the sweet corn growth period. Results showed that the deep placement of CRU at 15 cm soil depth significantly increased the sweet corn fresh ear yield, total N uptake, and NUE by 6.3%–13.4%, 27.9%–39.5%, and 82.9%–140.1%, respectively compared with CRU application at 0 cm depth. Deep placement of CRU at 15 cm also increased the root morphology traits, gas exchange attributes, and soil NO3−-N and NH4+-N concentrations in 0–20 cm and 20–40 cm layer, especially during later crop growth stages. However, the different N placements exerted non-significant effects on NUE and fresh ear yield when urea was applied as the N source. In crux, deep CRU placement instead of urea at 15 cm depth can effectively improve fresh ear yield and NUE of sweet corn in fluvo-aquic soil because of higher root growth, better leaf physiological functions and increased availability of soil NO3−-N and NH4+-N."
Oncotype DX Breast Cancer recurrence score resists inter-assay reproducibility with RT2-Profiler Multiplex RT-PCR,"The Oncotype Dx assay is frequently used to test if breast cancer patients can be spared from chemotherapy without negative effects for their future clinical course. However, due to conflicting data on the assay utility, in the recent past its reimbursement situation in Germany was revised; due to continued requests by clinicians for predictive values, our group decided to implement an Oncotype Dx like alternative assay with the objective of obtaining quality and cost optimization. Customized RT2-Profiler assays covering the 21 gene panel of the Oncotype Dx assay were applied to a pilot cohort of breast cancer patients with known Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score (RS). The Ct values obtained with RT2-Profiler-assays were used to calculate the unscaled Recurrence Score (RSu) values and the thereon based RS according to the Oncotype DX assay rules if available. Despite consistent assay performance it was impossible to establish correlations between RT2-Profiler recurrence scores with the respective Oncotype DX values not to mention exact matches. By following the Oncotype DX assay and its interpretation as close as possible we faced several obstructions such as lack of information on RNA amount used, missing units in the single gene expression report, missing references cited in the original study that should explain the determination of the recurrence score formula, and vague information on the normalization of the gene expression impeding the reproduction of Oncotype Dx results in other laboratories. Unfortunately, the Oncotype Dx assay cannot be confirmed by the customized RT2-profiler assay, not least because of the fact that the individual gene measurements are not provided in the medical report, although these are mandatory for the RS calculation. In fact, the “single gene report” only contains unscaled scores of the ER, PR, and Her2 genes without any internationally accepted unit used to describe a transcript quantity. Therefore a direct comparison with the in-house measurement to evaluate its performance is impossible. With regard to our findings and the fact that the Oncotype RS represents a likelihood of the risk of relapse it thus remains impossible to assess the clinical necessity of this assay."
Ultrafast electrical switching of nanostructured metadevice with dual-frequency liquid crystal,"Shortening of switching times of various soft-matter-based tunable metamaterials is one of the key challenges to improve the functionality of modern active devices. Here we show an effective strategy in the evolution of soft-matter-based tunable metamaterials that makes possible acceleration of both on and off switching processes by using a dual-frequency liquid crystal mixture. The frequency-convertible dielectric anisotropy of the dual-frequency mixture enabled us to create a fast-response in-plane switching metasurface at the nanoscale, which could be tuned by an electrical signal with different frequencies. The results clearly show that the resonance of the metamaterial can be continuously and reversibly controlled within a wavelength range of 100 nm as the applied frequency is inverted between 1 kHz and 40 kHz, with a total response time (τ = τON + τOFF) of 1.89 ms. Furthermore, experimental characteristics of the hybrid metamaterial are in great agreement with numerical calculations, which allow us to anticipate active epsilon-near-zero behavior of the metadevice. This work indicates the future development direction of liquid-crystal-based active plasmonic systems."
Autonomous lab-on-a-chip generic architecture for disposables with integrated actuation,"The integration of actuators within disposable lab-on-a-chip devices is a demanding goal that requires reliable mechanisms, systematic fabrication procedures and marginal costs compatible with single-use devices. In this work an affordable 3D printed prototype that offers a compact and modular configuration to integrate actuation in autonomous lab-on-a-chip devices is demonstrated. The proposed concept can handle multiple step preparation protocols, such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) configuration, by integrating reagents, volume metering capabilities with performance comparable to pipettes (e.g. 2.68% error for 5 μL volume), arbitrary dilution ratio support, effective mixing and active control of the sample injection. The chosen architecture is a manifold served by multiple injectors ending in unidirectional valves, which exchange a null dead volume when idle, thus isolating reagents until they are used. Functionalization is modularly provided by a plug-in element, which together with the selection of reagents can easily repurpose the platform to diverse targets, and this work demonstrates the systematic fabrication of 6 injectors/device at a development cost of USD$ 0.55/device. The concept was tested with a commercial ELISA kit for tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a marker for infectious, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and its performance satisfactorily compared with the classical microplate implementation."
Structured Back Focal Plane Interferometry (SBFPI),"Back focal plane interferometry (BFPI) is one of the most straightforward and powerful methods for achieving sub-nanometer particle tracking precision at high speed (MHz). BFPI faces technical challenges that prohibit tunable expansion of linear detection range with minimal loss to sensitivity, while maintaining robustness against optical aberrations. In this paper, we devise a tunable BFPI combining a structured beam (conical wavefront) and structured detection (annular quadrant photodiode). This technique, which we termed Structured Back Focal Plane Interferometry (SBFPI), possesses three key novelties namely: extended tracking range, low loss in sensitivity, and resilience to spatial aberrations. Most importantly, the conical wavefront beam preserves the axial Gouy phase shift and lateral beam waist that can then be harnessed in a conventional BFPI system. Through a series of experimental results, we were able to tune detection sensitivity and detection range over the SBFPI parameter space. We also identified a figure of merit based on the experimental optimum that allows us to identify optimal SBPFI configurations that balance both range and sensitivity. In addition, we also studied the resilience of SBFPI against asymmetric spatial aberrations (astigmatism of up to 0.8 λ) along the lateral directions. The simplicity and elegance of SBFPI will accelerate its dissemination to many associated fields in optical detection, interferometry and force spectroscopy."
High beta rhythm amplitude in olfactory learning signs a well-consolidated and non-flexible behavioral state,"Beta rhythm (15–30 Hz) is a major candidate underlying long-range communication in the brain. In olfactory tasks, beta activity is strongly modulated by learning but its condition of expression and the network(s) responsible for its generation are unclear. Here we analyzed the emergence of beta activity in local field potentials recorded from olfactory, sensorimotor and limbic structures of rats performing an olfactory task. Rats performed successively simple discrimination, rule transfer, memory recall tests and contingency reversal. Beta rhythm amplitude progressively increased over learning in most recorded areas. Beta amplitude reduced to baseline when new odors were introduced, but remained high during memory recall. Intra-session analysis showed that even expert rats required several trials to reach a good performance level, with beta rhythm amplitude increasing in parallel. Notably, at the beginning of the reversal task, beta amplitude remained high while performance was low and, in all tested animals, beta amplitude decreased before rats were able to learn the new contingencies. Connectivity analysis showed that beta activity was highly coherent between all structures where it was expressed. Overall, our results suggest that beta rhythm is expressed in a highly coherent network when context learning - including both odors and reward - is consolidated and signals behavioral inflexibility."
Immunotherapy using anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 in Leishmania amazonensis-infected BALB/c mice reduce parasite load,"Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease, for which current treatment presents numerous issues. Leishmania amazonensis is the etiological agent of cutaneous and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis. The roles of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor on lymphocytes and its ligand (PD-L1) on antigen-presenting cells have been well studied in tumor and other infection models; but little is known about their roles in non-healing cutaneous leishmaniasis. In this study, we observed that L. amazonensis induced PD-1 expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and PD-L1 on dendritic cells on BALB/c mice. We tested the therapeutic potential of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against a non-healing L. amazonensis infection in BALB/c mice, and that anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 treatment significantly increased IFN-γ-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively. Compared with infection controls, mice treated with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1, but not anti-PD-L2, displayed bigger lesions with significantly lower parasite loads. Treatment did not affect anti-Leishmania antibody (IgM, IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a) or IL-10 production, but anti-PD-1 treatment reduced both IL-4 and TGF-β production. Together, our results highlight the therapeutic potential of an anti-PD-1-based treatment in promoting the reinvigoration of T cells for the control of parasite burden."
A Novel Method for Calculation of Molecular Energies and Charge Distributions by Thermodynamic Formalization,"The paper describes a new approach to the thermodynamic formalization for calculation of molecular energy and charge distribution in ground state by means of the variational equation of DFT. In order to thermodynamically formalize the molecular calculation, the pseudo chemical potential (PCP) is conceptualized, where a molecule is broken into multi-phase(atom) one-component(electron) systems and the energy of system is represented as PCP. Calculation of the molecular energy and atomic charge by PCP is put forward, thereafter the approach is proved to be valid and its efficiency (accuracy and calculation speed) is verified."
Precursory worldwide signatures of earthquake occurrences on Swarm satellite data,"The study of the preparation phase of large earthquakes is essential to understand the physical processes involved, and potentially useful also to develop a future reliable short-term warning system. Here we analyse electron density and magnetic field data measured by Swarm three-satellite constellation for 4.7 years, to look for possible in-situ ionospheric precursors of large earthquakes to study the interactions between the lithosphere and the above atmosphere and ionosphere, in what is called the Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere Coupling (LAIC). We define these anomalies statistically in the whole space-time interval of interest and use a Worldwide Statistical Correlation (WSC) analysis through a superposed epoch approach to study the possible relation with the earthquakes. We find some clear concentrations of electron density and magnetic anomalies from more than two months to some days before the earthquake occurrences. Such anomaly clustering is, in general, statistically significant with respect to homogeneous random simulations, supporting a LAIC during the preparation phase of earthquakes. By investigating different earthquake magnitude ranges, not only do we confirm the well-known Rikitake empirical law between ionospheric anomaly precursor time and earthquake magnitude, but we also give more reliability to the seismic source origin for many of the identified anomalies."
"Optimized nitrogen management enhances lodging resistance of rice and its morpho-anatomical, mechanical, and molecular mechanisms","Increasing evidence shows that improved nitrogen management can enhance lodging resistance and lower internodes play a key role in the lodging resistance of rice. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the enhanced lodging resistance under improved nitrogen management. In the present study, two rice varieties, with contrasting lodging resistance, were grown under optimized N management (OPT) and farmers’ fertilizer practices. Under OPT, the lower internodes of both cultivars were shorter but the upper internodes were longer, while both culm diameter and wall thickness of lower internodes were dramatically increased. Microscopic examination showed that the culm wall of lower internodes under OPT contained more sclerenchyma cells beneath epidermis and vascular bundle sheath. The genome-wide gene expression profiling revealed that transcription of genes encoding cell wall loosening factors was down-regulated while transcription of genes participating in lignin and starch synthesis was up-regulated under OPT, resulting in inhibition of longitudinal growth, promotion in transverse growth of lower internodes and enhancement of lodging resistance. This is the first comprehensive report on the morpho-anatomical, mechanical, and molecular mechanisms of lodging resistance of rice under optimized N management."
Coconut shell derived biochar to enhance water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica Forsk) growth and decrease nitrogen loss under tropical conditions,"Farms usually apply excessive nitrogen (N) fertilizers, especially in a vegetable production system, resulting in severe N leaching loss. Although there have been some reports on the impact of biochar on the N leaching in farmlands, most of them focused on field crops in temperate or subtropical religions. Limited information about N leaching in the tropical vegetable system is available regarding the quantitative data and effective countermeasures. A field experiment was conducted to quantify N leaching in a tropical leafy production system (Ipomoea aquatica Forsk) and to evaluate the effects of coconut shell biochar on N loss and crop growth. The results showed that compared to conventional fertilization with the 240 kg N ha−1 application rate (NPK), biomass yield of water spinach increased by 40.1% under the high biochar application rate of 48 t ha−1 (HBC), which was significantly higher than that of NPK treatment. Moreover, The HBC treatment decreased N leaching by 34.0%, which can be attributed to enhanced crop uptake which increased by 40.3% as compared to NPK treatment. The NH4+/NO3− ratio in leachates was between 0.01 and 0.05. It was concluded that coconut shell derived biochar improved the biomass yields of water spinach and reduced the leaching N loss, which provides a promising amendment in tropical regions."
A Prospective Study of Service Use in the Year After Birth by Women at High Risk for Antenatal Substance Use and Mental Health Disorders,"Maternal substance use (SUD) and mental health disorders commonly co-occur and require complex treatment. Information on women’s use of appropriate services in the perinatal period is limited. Data from the New Zealand Infant Development, Environment and Lifestyle Study were used to examine the characteristics of women with high probability of substance use and/or psychiatric disorder and rates of service use at 1 and 12 months following birth (n = 221). The Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory-3 and the Brief Symptom Inventory were used to identify risk of disorder. Despite a high proportion of mothers with disorder risk, rates of specialist treatment remained low across SUD and psychiatric groups at 1 (27–39%) and 12 months postnatal (25–42%). Very low rates of women with comorbid disorder received both mental health and substance use treatments (1 month, 4.5%; 12 months, 7.3%). There was no association between service use and risk for psychiatric disorder at 12 months after birth. The findings suggest that even when services are publicly funded, they may be under-utilised or under-resourced to provide effective treatment, despite the high and complex needs of this population."
Generic parameters of first-order kinetics accurately describe soil organic matter decay in bare fallow soils over a wide edaphic and climatic range,"The conventional soil organic matter (SOM) decay paradigm considers the intrinsic quality of SOM as the dominant decay limitation with the result that it is modelled using simple first-order decay kinetics. This view and modelling approach is often criticized for being too simplistic and unreliable for predictive purposes. It is still under debate if first-order models can correctly capture the variability in temporal SOM decay observed between different agroecosystems and climates. To address this question, we calibrated a first-order model (Q) on six long-term bare fallow field experiments across Europe. Following conventional SOM decay theory, we assumed that parameters directly describing SOC decay (rate of SOM quality change and decomposer metabolism) are thermodynamically constrained and therefore valid for all sites. Initial litter input quality and edaphic interactions (both local by definition) and microbial efficiency (possibly affected by nutrient stoichiometry) were instead considered site-specific. Initial litter input quality explained most observed kinetics variability, and the model predicted a convergence toward a common kinetics over time. Site-specific variables played no detectable role. The decay of decades-old SOM seemed mostly influenced by OM chemistry and was well described by first order kinetics and a single set of general kinetics parameters."
The transport of liquids in softwood: timber as a model porous medium,"Timber is the only widely used construction material we can grow. The wood from which it comes has evolved to provide structural support for the tree and to act as a conduit for fluid flow. These flow paths are crucial for engineers to exploit the full potential of timber, by allowing impregnation with liquids that modify the properties or resilience of this natural material. Accurately predicting the transport of these liquids enables more efficient industrial timber treatment processes to be developed, thereby extending the scope to use this sustainable construction material; moreover, it is of fundamental scientific value — as a fluid flow within a natural porous medium. Both structural and transport properties of wood depend on its micro-structure but, while a substantial body of research relates the structural performance of wood to its detailed architecture, no such knowledge exists for the transport properties. We present a model, based on increasingly refined geometric parameters, that accurately predicts the time-dependent ingress of liquids within softwood timber, thereby addressing this long-standing scientific challenge. Moreover, we show that for the minimalistic parameterisation the model predicts ingress with a square-root-of-time behaviour. However, experimental data show a potentially significant departure from this \(\sqrt{{\boldsymbol{t}}}\) behaviour — a departure which is successfully predicted by our more advanced parametrisation. Our parameterisation of the timber microstructure was informed by computed tomographic measurements; model predictions were validated by comparison with experimental data. We show that accurate predictions require statistical representation of the variability in the timber pore space. The collapse of our dimensionless experimental data demonstrates clear potential for our results to be up-scaled to industrial treatment processes."
Layered material platform for surface plasmon resonance biosensing,"Plasmonic biosensing has emerged as the most sensitive label-free technique to detect various molecular species in solutions and has already proved crucial in drug discovery, food safety and studies of bio-reactions. This technique relies on surface plasmon resonances in ~50 nm metallic films and the possibility to functionalize the surface of the metal in order to achieve selectivity. At the same time, most metals corrode in bio-solutions, which reduces the quality factor and darkness of plasmonic resonances and thus the sensitivity. Furthermore, functionalization itself might have a detrimental effect on the quality of the surface, also reducing sensitivity. Here we demonstrate that the use of graphene and other layered materials for passivation and functionalization broadens the range of metals which can be used for plasmonic biosensing and increases the sensitivity by 3-4 orders of magnitude, as it guarantees stability of a metal in liquid and preserves the plasmonic resonances under biofunctionalization. We use this approach to detect low molecular weight HT-2 toxins (crucial for food safety), achieving phase sensitivity~0.5 fg/mL, three orders of magnitude higher than previously reported. This proves that layered materials provide a new platform for surface plasmon resonance biosensing, paving the way for compact biosensors for point of care testing."
A coupled forage-grazer model predicts viability of livestock production and wildlife habitat at the regional scale,"Informed management of livestock on rangelands underpins both the livelihoods of communities that depend on livestock for sustenance, and the conservation of wildlife that often depend on livestock-dominated landscapes for habitat. Understanding spatial patterns of rangeland productivity is therefore crucial to designing global development strategies that balance social and environmental benefits. Here we introduce a new rangeland production model that dynamically links the Century ecosystem model with a basic ruminant diet selection and physiology model. With lightweight input data requirements that can be met with global sources, the model estimates the viability of broad livestock management decisions, and suggests possible implications of these management decisions for grazing wildlife. Using minimal field data, the new rangeland production model enables the reliable estimation of cattle stocking density; this is an important predictor of the viability of livestock production and forage available for grazing wildlife."
Sensitive detection of EBV microRNAs across cancer spectrum reveals association with decreased survival in adult acute myelocytic leukemia,"Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is the etiologic agent involved in numerous human cancers. After infecting the host, EBV establishes a latent infection, with low levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression, evolved to evade immune recognition. Conversely, EBV microRNAs (miRNA) are expressed ubiquitously and abundantly within infected cells. Their role in tumor biology and clinical outcomes across the spectrum of cancer is not fully explained. Here, we applied our bioinformatics pipeline for quantitative EBV miRNA detection to examine sequencing data of 8,955 individual tumor samples across 27 tumor types representing the breadth of cancer. We uncover an association of intermediate levels of viral miRNA with decreased survival in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (P = 0.00013). Prognostic modeling of this association suggests that increased EBV miRNA levels represent an independent risk factor for poor patient outcomes. Furthermore, we explore differences in expression between elevated and absent viral miRNA loads in adult AML tumors finding that EBV positivity was associated with proinflammatory signals. Together, given no associations were found for pediatric AML, our analyses suggests EBV positivity has the potential for being a prognostic biomarker and might represent a surrogate measure related to immune impairment in adult patients."
Inflammatory bowel disease-associated ubiquitin ligase RNF183 promotes lysosomal degradation of DR5 and TRAIL-induced caspase activation,"RNF183 is a ubiquitin ligase containing RING-finger and transmembrane domains, and its expression levels are increased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, and in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis mice. Here, we further demonstrate that RNF183 was induced to a greater degree in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated IBD model at a very early stage than were inflammatory cytokines. In addition, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that RNF183 was specifically expressed in epithelial cells of DSS-treated mice, which suggested that increased levels of RNF183 do not result from the accumulation of immune cells. Furthermore, we identified death receptor 5 (DR5), a member of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor superfamily, as a substrate of RNF183. RNF183 mediated K63-linked ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of DR5. DR5 promotes TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis signal through interaction with caspase-8. Inhibition of RNF183 expression was found to suppress TRAIL-induced activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. Thus, RNF183 promoted not only DR5 transport to lysosomes but also TRAIL-induced caspase activation and apoptosis. Together, our results provide new insights into potential roles of RNF183 in DR5-mediated caspase activation in IBD pathogenesis."
"Molecular mechanisms underlying nuchal hump formation in dolphin cichlid, Cyrtocara moorii","East African cichlid fishes represent a model to tackle adaptive changes and their connection to rapid speciation and ecological distinction. In comparison to bony craniofacial tissues, adaptive morphogenesis of soft tissues has been rarely addressed, particularly at the molecular level. The nuchal hump in cichlids fishes is one such soft-tissue and exaggerated trait that is hypothesized to play an innovative role in the adaptive radiation of cichlids fishes. It has also evolved in parallel across lakes in East Africa and Central America. Using gene expression profiling, we identified and validated a set of genes involved in nuchal hump formation in the Lake Malawi dolphin cichlid, Cyrtocara moorii. In particular, we found genes differentially expressed in the nuchal hump, which are involved in controlling cell proliferation (btg3, fosl1a and pdgfrb), cell growth (dlk1), craniofacial morphogenesis (dlx5a, mycn and tcf12), as well as regulators of growth-related signals (dpt, pappa and socs2). This is the first study to identify the set of genes associated with nuchal hump formation in cichlids. Given that the hump is a trait that evolved repeatedly in several African and American cichlid lineages, it would be interesting to see if the molecular pathways and genes triggering hump formation follow a common genetic track or if the trait evolved in parallel, with distinct mechanisms, in other cichlid adaptive radiations and even in other teleost fishes."
A novel phytocannabinoid isolated from Cannabis sativa L. with an in vivo cannabimimetic activity higher than Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol: Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabiphorol,"(-)-Trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) is the main compound responsible for the intoxicant activity of Cannabis sativa L. The length of the side alkyl chain influences the biological activity of this cannabinoid. In particular, synthetic analogues of Δ9-THC with a longer side chain have shown cannabimimetic properties far higher than Δ9-THC itself. In the attempt to define the phytocannabinoids profile that characterizes a medicinal cannabis variety, a new phytocannabinoid with the same structure of Δ9-THC but with a seven-term alkyl side chain was identified. The natural compound was isolated and fully characterized and its stereochemical configuration was assigned by match with the same compound obtained by a stereoselective synthesis. This new phytocannabinoid has been called (-)-trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabiphorol (Δ9-THCP). Along with Δ9-THCP, the corresponding cannabidiol (CBD) homolog with seven-term side alkyl chain (CBDP) was also isolated and unambiguously identified by match with its synthetic counterpart. The binding activity of Δ9-THCP against human CB1 receptor in vitro (Ki = 1.2 nM) resulted similar to that of CP55940 (Ki = 0.9 nM), a potent full CB1 agonist. In the cannabinoid tetrad pharmacological test, Δ9-THCP induced hypomotility, analgesia, catalepsy and decreased rectal temperature indicating a THC-like cannabimimetic activity. The presence of this new phytocannabinoid could account for the pharmacological properties of some cannabis varieties difficult to explain by the presence of the sole Δ9-THC."
Prediction of IDH and TERT promoter mutations in low-grade glioma from magnetic resonance images using a convolutional neural network,"Identification of genotypes is crucial for treatment of glioma. Here, we developed a method to predict tumor genotypes using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) from magnetic resonance (MR) images and compared the accuracy to that of a diagnosis based on conventional radiomic features and patient age. Multisite preoperative MR images of 164 patients with grade II/III glioma were grouped by IDH and TERT promoter (pTERT) mutations as follows: (1) IDH wild type, (2) IDH and pTERT co-mutations, (3) IDH mutant and pTERT wild type. We applied a CNN (AlexNet) to four types of MR sequence and obtained the CNN texture features to classify the groups with a linear support vector machine. The classification was also performed using conventional radiomic features and/or patient age. Using all features, we succeeded in classifying patients with an accuracy of 63.1%, which was significantly higher than the accuracy obtained from using either the radiomic features or patient age alone. In particular, prediction of the pTERT mutation was significantly improved by the CNN texture features. In conclusion, the pretrained CNN texture features capture the information of IDH and TERT genotypes in grade II/III gliomas better than the conventional radiomic features."
In silico definition of new ligninolytic peroxidase sub-classes in fungi and putative relation to fungal life style,"Ligninolytic peroxidases are microbial enzymes involved in depolymerisation of lignin, a plant cell wall polymer found in land plants. Among fungi, only Dikarya were found to degrade lignin. The increase of available fungal genomes allows performing an expert annotation of lignin-degrading peroxidase encoding sequences with a particular focus on Class II peroxidases (CII Prx). In addition to the previously described LiP, MnP and VP classes, based on sequence similarity, six new sub-classes have been defined: three found in plant pathogen ascomycetes and three in basidiomycetes. The presence of CII Prxs could be related to fungal life style. Typically, necrotrophic or hemibiotrophic fungi, either ascomycetes or basidiomycetes, possess CII Prxs while symbiotic, endophytic or biotrophic fungi do not. CII Prxs from ascomycetes are rarely subjected to duplications unlike those from basidiomycetes, which can form large recent duplicated families. Even if these CII Prxs classes form two well distinct clusters with divergent gene structures (intron numbers and positions), they share the same key catalytic residues suggesting that they evolved independently from similar ancestral sequences with few or no introns. The lack of CII Prxs encoding sequences in early diverging fungi, together with the absence of duplicated class I peroxidase (CcP) in fungi containing CII Prxs, suggests the potential emergence of an ancestral CII Prx sequence from the duplicated CcP after the separation between ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. As some ascomycetes and basidiomycetes did not possess CII Prx, late gene loss could have occurred."
Effective reinforcements for thermoplastics based on carbon nanotubes of oil fly ash,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are widely investigated for preparing polymer nanocomposites, owing to their unique mechanical properties. However, dispersing CNTs uniformly in a polymer matrix and controlling their entanglement/agglomeration are still big technical challenges to be overcome. The costs of their raw materials and production are also still high. In this work, we propose the use of CNTs grown on oil fly ash to solve these issues. The CNTs of oil fly ash were evaluated as reinforcing materials for some common thermoplastics. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) was mainly reinforced with various weight fractions of CNTs. Xylene was used as a solvent to dissolve HDPE and to uniformly disperse the CNTs. Significantly enhanced mechanical properties of HDPE reinforced at a low weight fraction of these CNTs (1–2 wt.%), mainly the tensile strength, Young’s modulus, stiffness, and hardness, were observed. The tensile strength and Young’s modulus were enhanced by ~20 and 38%, respectively. Moreover, the nanoindentation results were found to be in support to these findings. Polycarbonate, polypropylene, and polystyrene were also preliminarily evaluated after reinforcement with 1 wt.% CNTs. The tensile strength and Young’s Modulus were increased after reinforcement with CNTs. These results demonstrate that the CNTs of the solid waste, oil fly ash, might serve as an appropriate reinforcing material for different thermoplastics polymers."
High order Fano resonances and giant magnetic fields in dielectric microspheres,"We show that weakly dissipating dielectric spheres made of materials such as glass, quartz, etc. can support high order Fano resonances associated with internal Mie modes. These resonances, happening for specific values of the size parameter, yield field-intensity enhancement factors on the order of 104–107, which can be directly obtained from analytical calculations. Associated to these “super-resonances”, we analyze the emergence of magnetic nanojets with giant magnetic fields, which might be attractive for many photonic applications."
Modification of asphalt mixtures for cold regions using microencapsulated phase change materials,"Phase change materials (PCMs) may be used to regulate the temperature of road surfaces to avoid low-temperature damages when asphalt materials become brittle and prone to cracking. With this in mind, different asphalt mixtures were modified with microencapsulated phase change materials (i.e. tetradecane) to assess their thermal benefits during the phase change process. Likewise, the effect on the mechanical performance of PCMs as a replacement of mineral filler was assessed. Special attention was paid to dry and wet modification processes for incorporating the PCMs into the mixtures. The results showed that PCM modifications are indeed able to slow down cooling and affect temperatures below zero. Approximately, a maximum of 2.5 °C offset was achieved under the tested cooling conditions compared to the unmodified reference specimens. Regarding the mechanical response at 0 °C and 10 °C, the results indicated that the PCM modification significantly reduces the stiffness of the material in comparison with the values obtained for the reference mixture."
Reversal of increased mammary tumorigenesis by valproic acid and hydralazine in offspring of dams fed high fat diet during pregnancy,"Maternal or paternal high fat (HF) diet can modify the epigenome in germ cells and fetal somatic cells leading to an increased susceptibility among female offspring of multiple generations to develop breast cancer. We determined if combined treatment with broad spectrum DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor hydralazine and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) will reverse this increased risk. C57BL/6 mouse dams were fed either a corn oil-based HF or control diet during pregnancy. Starting at age 7 weeks, female offspring were administered 3 doses of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) to initiate mammary cancer. After last dose, offspring started receiving VPA/hydralazine administered via drinking water: no adverse health effects were detected. VPA/hydralazine reduced mammary tumor multiplicity and lengthened tumor latency in HF offspring when compared with non-treated HF offspring. The drug combination inhibited DNMT3a protein levels and increased expression of the tumor suppressor gene Cdkn2a/p16 in mammary tumors of HF offspring. In control mice not exposed to HF diet in utero, VPA/hydralazine increased mammary tumor incidence and burden, and elevated expression of the unfolded protein response and autophagy genes, including HIF-1α, NFkB, PERK, and SQSTM1/p62. Expression of these genes was already upregulated in HF offspring prior to VPA/hydralazine treatment. These findings suggest that breast cancer prevention strategies with HDAC/DNMT inhibitors need to be individually tailored."
Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Modulate Lipid Metabolism and Lipid Droplet Biogenesis via AKT/mTOR –PPARγ Signalling in Macrophages,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a potential therapy for many chronic inflammatory diseases due to their regenerative, immunologic and anti-inflammatory properties. The two-way dialogue between MSCs and macrophages is crucial to tissue regeneration and repair. Previous research demonstrated that murine adipose-derived MSC conditioned medium (ASCcm) reprograms macrophages to an M2-like phenotype which protects from experimental colitis and sepsis. Here, our focus was to determine the molecular mechanism of lipid droplet biogenesis in macrophages re-educated using ASCcm. Adipose-derived MSC conditioned medium promotes phosphorylation of AKT/mTOR pathway proteins in macrophages. Furthermore, increased expression of PPARγ, lipid droplet biogenesis and PGE2 synthesis were observed in M2-like phenotype macrophages (high expression of arginase 1 and elevated IL-10). Treatment with mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 suppressed lipid droplets and PGE2 secretion. However, these inhibitors had no effect on arginase-1 expression. Rapamycin, but not GW9662, inhibit IL-10 secretion. In conclusion, we demonstrate major effects of ASCcm to reprogram macrophage immunometabolism through mTOR and PPARγ dependent and independent pathways."
Hyperuniform disordered waveguides and devices for near infrared silicon photonics,"We introduce a hyperuniform-disordered platform for the realization of near-infrared photonic devices on a silicon-on-insulator platform, demonstrating the functionality of these structures in a flexible silicon photonics integrated circuit platform unconstrained by crystalline symmetries. The designs proposed advantageously leverage the large, complete, and isotropic photonic band gaps provided by hyperuniform disordered structures. An integrated design for a compact, sub-volt, sub-fJ/bit, hyperuniform-clad, electrically controlled resonant optical modulator suitable for fabrication in the silicon photonics ecosystem is presented along with simulation results. We also report results for passive device elements, including waveguides and resonators, which are seamlessly integrated with conventional silicon-on-insulator strip waveguides and vertical couplers. We show that the hyperuniform-disordered platform enables improved compactness, enhanced energy efficiency, and better temperature stability compared to the silicon photonics devices based on rib and strip waveguides."
The C-terminal region affects the activity of photoactivated adenylyl cyclase from Oscillatoria acuminata,"Photoactivated adenylyl cyclase (PAC) is a unique protein that, upon blue light exposure, catalyzes cAMP production. The crystal structures of two PACs, from Oscillatoria acuminata (OaPAC) and Beggiatoa sp. (bPAC), have been solved, and they show a high degree of similarity. However, the photoactivity of OaPAC is much lower than that of bPAC, and the regulatory mechanism of PAC photoactivity, which induces the difference in activity between OaPAC and bPAC, has not yet been clarified. Here, we investigated the role of the C-terminal region in OaPAC, the length of which is the only notable difference from bPAC. We found that the photoactivity of OaPAC was inversely proportional to the C-terminal length. However, the deletion of more than nine amino acids did not further increase the activity, indicating that the nine amino acids at the C-terminal critically affect the photoactivity. Besides, absorption spectral features of light-sensing domains (BLUF domains) of the C-terminal deletion mutants showed similar light-dependent spectral shifts as in WT, indicating that the C-terminal region influences the activity without interacting with the BLUF domain. The study characterizes new PAC mutants with modified photoactivities, which could be useful as optogenetics tools."
Time-Resolved Measurements of Turbulent Mixing in Shock-Driven Variable-Density Flows,"Recent developments of burst-mode lasers and imaging systems have opened new realms of simultaneous diagnostics for velocity and density fields at a rate of 1 kHz–1 MHz. These enable the exploration of previously unimaginable shock-driven turbulent flow fields that are of significant importance to problems in high-energy density physics. The current work presents novel measurements using simultaneous measurements of velocity and scalar fields at 60 kHz to investigate Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) in a spatio-temporal approach. The evolution of scalar fields and the vorticity dynamics responsible for the same are shown, including the interaction of shock with the interface. This temporal information is used to validate two vorticity-deposition models commonly used for initiation of large scale simulations, and have been previously validated only via simulations or integral measures of circulation. Additionally, these measurements also enable tracking the evolution and mode merging of individual flow structures that were previously not possible owing to inherently random variations in the interface at the smallest scales. A temporal evolution of symmetric vortex merging and the induced mixing prevalent in these problems is presented, with implications for the vortex paradigms in accelerated inhomogenous flows."
IL-33/ST2 axis promotes glioblastoma cell invasion by accumulating tenascin-C,"Tenascin-C (TNC), a very large multimeric glycoprotein, is overexpressed in human glioblastomas, leading to a highly motile and invasive phenotype of glioma cells. However, the regulation of TNC expression in glioma has remained unclear until now. Our data suggest that interleukin-33 (IL-33) may promote the accumulation of TNC protein by autocrine or paracrine modes of action in glioma. In the present study, the expression levels of TNC, IL-33, and ST2 were measured in glioma tissue specimens, and the impact of altered IL-33 expression on TNC was investigated in vitro and in vivo. In contrast with control treatment, IL-33 treatment increased TNC expression, and knockdown of IL-33 attenuated TNC expression in glioma cells. Furthermore, IL-33 induced the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and increased the expression of TNC in U251 cells. In addition, blockage of the IL-33-ST2-NFκB pathway resulted in downregulation of TNC production. IL-33 promoted glioma cell invasion by stimulating the secretion of TNC. Similarly, knockdown of TNC inhibited the invasiveness of glioma cells. These findings provide a novel perspective on the role of the IL-33/NF-κB/TNC signalling pathway in supporting cancer progression. Thus, targeting the IL-33/NF-κB/TNC signalling pathway may be a useful therapeutic approach in glioma."
Levosimendan and systemic vascular resistance in cardiac surgery patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Levosimendan is a potent non-adrenergic inodilator agent. The net effect of hemodynamic changes may result in a hyperdynamic state with low systemic vascular resistance. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing hemodynamics in cardiac surgery patients treated with levosimendan. English-language literature was searched systematically from 2006 until October 2018, including randomized controlled trials and case-matched or retrospective studies providing at least two sequentially measured hemodynamic variables in adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and were treated with levosimendan in comparison to alternative drugs or devices. Cardiac index significantly increased in the levosimendan group by 0.74 (0.24 to 1.23) [standardized mean difference (95% CI); p = 0.003] from baseline to postoperative day (POD) 1, and by 0.75 (0.25 to 1.25; p = 0.003) from baseline to POD 7, when corrected for the standardized mean difference at baseline by a multivariate mixed effects meta-analysis model. With this correction for baseline differences, other hemodynamic variables including systemic vascular resistance did not significantly differ until POD 1 [−0.17 (−0.64 to 0.30), p = 0.48] and POD 7 [−0.13 (−0.61 to 0.34), p = 0.58] between the levosimendan and the comparator group. Levosimendan increases cardiac index in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Although levosimendan has inodilator properties, this meta-analysis finds no clinical evidence that levosimendan produces vasopressor-resistant vasoplegic syndrome."
Dominant Role of the Gut Microbiota in Chemotherapy Induced Neuropathic Pain,"Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), a toxic side effect of some cancer treatments, negatively impacts patient outcomes and drastically reduces survivor’s quality of life (QOL). Uncovering the mechanisms driving chemotherapy-induced CIPN is urgently needed to facilitate the development of effective treatments, as currently there are none. Observing that C57BL/6 (B6) and 129SvEv (129) mice are respectively sensitive and resistant to Paclitaxel-induced pain, we investigated the involvement of the gut microbiota in this extreme phenotypic response. Reciprocal gut microbiota transfers between B6 and 129 mice as well as antibiotic depletion causally linked gut microbes to Paclitaxel-induced pain sensitivity and resistance. Microglia proliferated in the spinal cords of Paclitaxel treated mice harboring the pain-sensitive B6 microbiota but not the pain-resistant 129 microbiota, which exhibited a notable absence of infiltrating immune cells. Paclitaxel decreased the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, which could compromise barrier integrity resulting in systemic exposure to bacterial metabolites and products – that acting via the gut-immune-brain axis – could result in altered brain function. Other bacterial taxa that consistently associated with both bacteria and pain as well as microglia and pain were identified, lending support to our hypothesis that microglia are causally involved in CIPN, and that gut bacteria are drivers of this phenotype."
Design and Development of Lubricating Material Database and Research on Performance Prediction Method of Machine Learning,"Long developing period and cumbersome evaluation for the lubricating materials performance seriously jeopardize the successful development and application of any database system in tribological field. Such major setback can be solved effectively by implementing approaches with high throughput calculation. However, it often involves with vast number of output files, which are computed on the basis of first principle computation, having different data format from that of their experimental counterparts. Commonly, the input, storage and management of first principle calculation files and their individually test counterparts, implementing fast query and display in the database, adding to the use of physical parameters, as predicted with the performance estimated by first principle approach, may solve such setbacks. Investigation is thus performed for establishing database website specifically for lubricating materials, which satisfies both data: (i) as calculated on the basis of first principles and (ii) as obtained by practical experiment. It further explores preliminarily the likely relationship between calculated physical parameters of lubricating oil and its respectively tribological and anti-oxidative performance as predicted by lubricant machine learning model. Success of the method facilitates in instructing the obtainment of optimal design, preparation and application for any new lubricating material so that accomplishment of high performance is possible."
Review of defects in lattice structures manufactured by powder bed fusion,"Additively manufactured lattice structures are popular due to their desirable properties, such as high specific stiffness and high surface area, and are being explored for several applications including aerospace components, heat exchangers and biomedical implants. The complexity of lattices challenges the fabrication limits of additive manufacturing processes and thus, lattices are particularly prone to manufacturing defects. This paper presents a review of defects in lattice structures produced by powder bed fusion processes. The review focuses on the effects of lattice design on dimensional inaccuracies, surface texture and porosity. The design constraints on lattice structures are also reviewed, as these can help to discourage defect formation. Appropriate process parameters, post-processing techniques and measurement methods are also discussed. The information presented in this paper contributes towards a deeper understanding of defects in lattice structures, aiming to improve the quality and performance of future designs."
String corrections to AdS amplitudes and the double-trace spectrum of \( \mathcal{N} \) = 4 SYM,"We consider α′ corrections to four-point correlators of half-BPS operators in \( \mathcal{N} \) = 4 super Yang-Mills theory in the supergravity limit. By demanding the correct behaviour in the flat space limit, we find that the leading (α′)3 correction to the Mellin amplitude is fixed for arbitrary charges of the external operators. By considering the mixing of double-trace operators we can find the (α′)3 corrections to the double-trace spectrum which we give explicitly for su (4)-singlet operators. We observe striking patterns in the corrections to the spectra which hint at their common ten-dimensional origin. By extending the observed patterns and imposing them at order (α′)5 we are able to reproduce the recently found result for the correction to the Mellin amplitude for \( \left\langle {\mathcal{O}}_2{\mathcal{O}}_2{\mathcal{O}}_p{\mathcal{O}}_p\right\rangle \) correlators. By applying a similar logic to the [0, 1, 0] channel of su(4) we are able to deduce new results for the correlators of the form \( \left\langle {\mathcal{O}}_2{\mathcal{O}}_3{\mathcal{O}}_p-1{\mathcal{O}}_p\right\rangle \)."
Physics potential of ESSνSB in the presence of a light sterile neutrino,"ESSνSB is a proposed neutrino super-beam project at the ESS facility. We study the performance of this setup in the presence of a light eV-scale sterile neutrino, considering 540 km baseline with 2 years (8 years) of ν (\( \overline{\nu} \)) run-plan. This baseline offers the possibility to work around the second oscillation maximum, providing high sensitivity towards CP-violation (CPV). We explore in detail its capability in resolving CPV generated by the standard CP phase δ13, the new CP phase δ14, and the octant of θ23. We find that the sensitivity to CPV induced by δ13 deteriorates noticeably when going from 3ν to 4ν case. The two phases δ13 and δ14 can be reconstructed with a 1σ uncertainty of ∼ 150 and ∼ 350 respectively. Concerning the octant of θ23, we find poor sensitivity in both 3ν and 4ν schemes. Our results show that a setup like ESSνSB working around the second oscillation maximum with a baseline of 540 km, performs quite well to explore CPV in 3ν scheme, but it is not optimal for studying CP properties in 3+1 scheme."
Four-particle scattering amplitudes in QCD at NNLO to higher orders in the dimensional regulator,"We compute all helicity amplitudes for four particle scattering in massless QCD with nf fermion flavours to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbation theory. In particular, we consider all possible configurations of external quarks and gluons. We evaluate the amplitudes in terms of a Laurent series in the dimensional regulator to the order required for future next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) calculations. The coefficients of the Laurent series are given in terms of harmonic polylogarithms that can readily be evaluated numerically. We present our findings in the conventional dimensional regularisation and in the t’Hooft-Veltman schemes."
Reflection groups and 3d \( \mathcal{N} \)> 6 SCFTs,"We point out that the moduli spaces of all known 3d \( \mathcal{N} \) = 8 and \( \mathcal{N} \) = 6 SCFTs, after suitable gaugings of finite symmetry groups, have the form ℂ4r/Γ where Γ is a real or complex reflection group depending on whether the theory is \( \mathcal{N} \) = 8 or \( \mathcal{N} \) = 6, respectively. Real reflection groups are either dihedral groups, Weyl groups, or two sporadic cases H3,4 Since the BLG theories and the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories correspond to dihedral and Weyl groups, it is strongly suggested that there are two yet-to­"
Dynamical axion misalignment with small instantons,"We present a new mechanism to relax the initial misalignment angle of the QCD axion and raise the cosmological bound on the axion decay constant. The QCD axion receives a contribution from small UV instantons during inflation, which raises its mass to the inflationary Hubble scale. This makes the axion start rolling down its potential early on. In the scenario, the standard model Yukawa couplings of quarks are dynamical, being of order one during the inflationary era and reducing to their standard model values once it ends. This means that after inflation the contribution of the small instantons is suppressed, and the axion potential reduces to the standard one from the usual IR instantons. As a result, when the axion starts to oscillate again after inflation, the initial misalignment angle is suppressed due to the dynamics during inflation. While the general idea of dynamical axion misalignment has been discussed in the literature before, we present in detail the major bottleneck on the mismatching between the minima of the axion potentials during and after inflation, and how it is circumvented in our scenario via the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism. Taking into account of all the constraints, we find that the axion decay constant could be raised to the GUT scale, 1015 GeV, in our scenario."
Anatomy of deconfinement,"In the weak coupling limit of SUN Yang-Mills theory and the O(N) vector model, explicit state counting allows us to demonstrate the existence of a partially deconfined phase: M of N colors deconfine, and \( \frac{M}{N} \) gradually grows from zero (confinement) to one (complete deconfinement). We point out that the mechanism admits a simple interpretation in the form of spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry. In terms of the dual gravity theory, such breaking occurs during the formation of a black hole. We speculate whether the breaking and restoration of gauge symmetry can serve as an alternative definition of the deconfinement transition in theories without center symmetry, such as QCD. We also discuss the role of the color degrees of freedom in the emergence of the bulk geometry in holographic duality."
Bino-wino coannihilation as a prediction in the E7 unification of families,"We study the phenomenological consequences of the supersymmetric (SUSY) E7/SU(5) × U(1)3 non-linear sigma model coupled to supergravity, where the three gen- erations of quark and lepton chiral multiplets appear as (pseudo) Nambu Goldstone (NG) multiplets, that is, the origin of the three families is explained. To break SUSY, we intro- duce a SUSY breaking field charged under some symmetry avoiding the Polonyi problem. The gaugino mass spectrum is almost uniquely determined when one requires the electroweak vacuum to be (meta)stable: it would be a miracle that the mass difference between the bino and wino turns out to be within \( \mathcal{O} \)(1)% at the low energy. Thus, a bino-wino coannihilation is naturally predicted, which can explain the correct relic abundance of dark matter. Moreover, we find that the bottom-tau Yukawa couplings and the gauge couplings are unified up to \( \mathcal{O} \)(1)% in most of the viable region. This scenario can be fully tested at the LHC and future collider experiments since the gauginos and some of the pseudo-NG bosons are light. An axion-like multiplet, which can be identified with the QCD axion, is also predicted."
On stringy de Sitter spacetimes,"We reexamine a family of models with a 3+1-dimensional de Sitter spacetime obtained in the standard tree-level low-energy limit of string theory with a non-trivial anisotropic axion-dilaton background. While such limiting approximations are encouraging but incomplete, our analysis reveals a host of novel features, and shows these models to relate standard and well understood supersymmetric string theory solutions. Finally, we conjecture that this de Sitter spacetime naturally arises by including more of the stringy degrees of freedom, such as a recently advanced variant of the non-commutative phase-space formalism, as well as the analytic continuation of a complex two-dimensional Fano variety arising as a small resolution in a Calabi-Yau 5-fold."

Is there a correlation between inflammatory markers and coagulation parameters in women with advanced ovarian endometriosis?,Endometriosis is defined as a chronic inflammatory disease. Recent studies have shown that increased coagulation parameters including fibrinogen and platelets are associated with endometriosis. The objective of this study was to determine the levels of inflammatory markers and coagulation parameters and their correlations in women with endometriomas compared to those with benign ovarian cysts or normal pelvic anatomy.
Directional association test reveals high-quality putative cancer driver biomarkers including noncoding RNAs,"Most statistical methods used to identify cancer driver genes are either biased due to choice of assumed parametric models or insensitive to directional relationships important for causal inference. To overcome modeling biases and directional insensitivity, a recent statistical functional chi-squared test (FunChisq) detects directional association via model-free functional dependency. FunChisq examines patterns pointing from independent to dependent variables arising from linear, non-linear, or many-to-one functional relationships. Meanwhile, the Functional Annotation of Mammalian Genome 5 (FANTOM5) project surveyed gene expression at over 200,000 transcription start sites (TSSs) in nearly all human tissue types, primary cell types, and cancer cell lines. The data cover TSSs originated from both coding and noncoding genes. For the vast uncharacterized human TSSs that may exhibit complex patterns in cancer versus normal tissues, the model-free property of FunChisq provides us an unprecedented opportunity to assess the evidence for a gene’s directional effect on human cancer."

The implementation of natural language processing to extract index lesions from breast magnetic resonance imaging reports,"There are often multiple lesions in breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports and radiologists usually focus on describing the index lesion that is most crucial to clinicians in determining the management and prognosis of patients. Natural language processing (NLP) has been used for information extraction from mammography reports. However, few studies have investigated NLP in breast MRI data based on free-form text. The objective of the current study was to assess the validity of our NLP program to accurately extract index lesions and their corresponding imaging features from free-form text of breast MRI reports."
Evaluation of the Korean version of the self-assessment of nursing informatics competencies scale,"In order to assess nursing students’ informatics competency, we need a comprehensive Korean version scale that reflects the important advances in nursing informatics and can make up for the lack of an existing measure.

"Reasons for late presentation for antenatal care, healthcare providers’ perspective","Antenatal care (ANC) provides healthcare services to pregnant women in an attempt to ensure, the best possible pregnancy outcome for women and their babies. Healthcare providers’ understanding of their patient’s behaviour and reasons for engagement in care and their response to this insight can influence patient-provider interactions and patient demand for ANC early in pregnancy. We examined the insight of healthcare providers into women’s reasons for starting ANC later than the South African National Department of Health’s recommended 20 weeks gestation. We also looked at the impact of late ANC presentation on overall healthcare providers’ work experiences and their response in their interactions with patients."
‘A lifebuoy’ and ‘a waste of time’: patients’ varying experiences of multidisciplinary pain centre treatment- a qualitative study,"The recognition of chronic pain as a biopsychosocial phenomenon has led to the establishment of multidisciplinary pain treatment facilities, such as pain centres.

The aim of this clinical study was to confirm the ability of this measurement system and to determine the clinical impact of management of air leak."
The posterior-anterior-flexed view is essential for the evaluation of valgus osteoarthritis. A prospective study on 134 valgus knees,Radiographic imaging is an important tool to assess osteoarthritis (OA). Lateral compartment osteoarthritis (valgus OA) usually starts with cartilage degeneration along the posterior aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. There is evidence that the posterior-anterior (PA)-flexed view is more sensitive when diagnosing early stages of valgus OA compared to the anterior-posterior (AP) view. The current paper analyzes the value of the PA-flexed view for patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Characterization of phenolic compounds in two novel lines of Pisum sativum L. along with their in vitro antioxidant potential,"Like other vegetables, Pisum sativum L. also faces storage and degradation problems. To enhance their resistance and make them enable to cope with the deterioration problems during storage, the current study was designed to develop two resistant lines of P. sativum in terms of phenolic contents and genotypes. The phenolic compounds generally have antioxidant properties and deterioration during storage which are usually due to oxidation caused by free radicals. Thus, if a variety has high phenolic contents these problems will be coped in a better way. The genotype of a plant is also important in this regard, and the best adopted species would survive in unfavorable conditions. First, the phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined in the crude extract using the Folin–Ciocalteu method. Then, the identification and quantification of phenolic compounds were carried out in the developed lines of selected plants PL-04 and PL-05, as well as in the parental varieties [Climax (female) and Falan (male)] via HPLC. DPPH assay was used to determine the free radical scavenging capabilities of the extracts of the developed verities. The genotypic differences were confirmed by DNA fingerprinting using advanced simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The HPLC analysis of PL-04 confirmed the presence of three phenolic compounds in an appreciable amount which exhibited a higher antioxidant activity against DPPH radicals, while in the parental varieties, two phenolic compounds were identified and exhibited lower antioxidant activities. PL-04 was found rich in phenolic compounds and affectively scavenge-free radicals which would therefore be resistant to oxidation and degradation caused by free radicals. Comparing the present findings with our previous one, P-04 was found to be resistant to powdery mildew; it was concluded that the most probable reason of the resistance was the high phenolic contents and thus long shelf life."
"The effects of pretreatment with lithium metaborate dihydrate on lipid peroxidation and Ca, Fe, Mg, and K levels in serum of Wistar albino male rats exposed to Cd","Boron and boron compounds have beneficial biological effects. Lithium metaborate dihydrate (LMBDH) is used in many branches of industry. Despite its wide industrial use, there is limited information about its biological effects on antioxidant defense system and trace element homeostasis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo protective effects of LMBDH against CdCl2-induced oxidative stress and imbalance of some bioelements for the first time. In the study, totally 20 Wistar albino male rats were used. The rats were fed with pellet food and water ad libitum and divided into four groups including five rats in each. Group I was control group (standard pellet food + water + normal saline), Group II was CdCl2 (4.58 mg/kg/body weight/intraperitoneally/single dose), Group III was LMBDH (15 mg/kg/body weight/day orally, for 5 days), Group IV was CdCl2 (4.58 mg/kg/body weight/intraperitoneally/single dose in fifth day), and LMBDH (15 mg/kg/body weight/day orally for 5 days). The results showed that CdCl2 treatment increased blood MDA level and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities and the level of blood GSH compared to control group. Pretreatment with LMBDH significantly decreased MDA levels and increased SOD activity (p < 0.05). In addition, Ca, Fe, and K levels decreased in LMBDH pretreatment group in different statistically levels. However, Mg levels showed an increase in LMBDH pretreatment group. As a result, LMBDH pretreatment decreased MDA status and supported antioxidant system by increasing SOD activity. In addition, it did not exhibit an ameliorative effect on measured bioelement homeostasis."
Ecotoxicological risk evaluation and regulatory compliance of endocrine disruptor phthalates in a sustainable wastewater treatment scheme,"Due to their pervasive applications, phthalic acid esters or phthalates have ample presence in all environmental compartments. A principal source of their existence in freshwater is phthalate-laden wastewater treatment plant effluents. For its sustainable operation and biogas production, wastewater treatment scheme of up flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and polishing pond is more prevalent in developing countries. This yearlong study focused on evaluating the occurrence, fate and risk of four priority phthalates, diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), benzylbutyl phthalate (BBP), and diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) in a UASB+ polishing pond-based wastewater treatment plant. Concentration of the phthalates in raw wastewater ranged from nd to 17.36 μg/L (DEP), 0.92 to 18.26 μg/L (DBP), nd to 6.54 μg/L (BBP), and nd to 53.21 μg/L (DEHP). DEHP concentrations in UASB sludge were below 100 mg/kg, the recommended limit by the European Union for safe disposal of dewatered sludge. All four compounds were removed approximately 80% in the wastewater treatment plant, with larger removal in polishing pond than UASB. Sorption contributes a significant portion of BBP and DEHP removal (15–24%) in UASB than DEP and DBP (0–3%). Seasonally, larger removals of phthalates were observed during the summer season. Risk assessment showed that the treated effluents had low risk of DEP, DBP, and BBP. However, the hazard quotient (HQ) of DEHP was greater than 1. To comply with regulations, dilution requirement of effluents was investigated which showed that a dilution factor of 4.4 in summer and 2.1 in winter is required for effluents of UASB + Pond-based treatment plant."
"Oxidative stress, hematological and biochemical alterations induced by sub-acute exposure to fipronil (COACH®) in albino mice and ameliorative effect of selenium plus vitamin E","Fipronil (FIP) is a highly effective, broad-use insecticide that belongs to the phenylpyrazole chemical group. It is extensively used in the agriculture and veterinary medicine for controlling a wide variety of pests. Though FIP showed lower toxicity in vertebrates than in insects, it was recognized to have a variety of toxic effects in mammals. The present study was undertaken to evaluate FIP-induced alterations in the blood biochemical markers and oxidative stress parameters in male albino mice via oral sub-acute toxicity exposure. The possible ameliorative effect of the pretreatment with selenium plus α-tocopherol (vitamin E) against the harmful effects of FIP was also investigated. Mice in FIP-test groups were exposed to different sublethal doses, i.e., 1.43, 2.87, and 4.78 mg active ingredient (AI)/kg body weight (b.w.), equal to 1/100, 1/50, and 1/30 LD50 of FIP, respectively, for 28 days. Mice in the amelioration groups were orally administered with selenium + vitamin E (0.3 mg + 22.5 mg/kg b.w., respectively) 14 days prior to exposure to the higher dose (4.78 mg/kg) of FIP for another 14 days. Fipronil exposure at medium and high doses showed lowered values of red blood cell count (RBC), hematocrit (HCT), hemoglobin (HGB), white blood cell (WBC), and platelet (PLT) counts after 28-day exposure, compared to the control. All three doses caused significant increases in levels of liver-function biomarkers, i.e., aspartate amino transaminase (AST), alanine amino transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), cholesterol, and bilirubin levels compared to the control. Levels of biomarkers related to kidney functions, i.e., urea, uric acid, and creatinine, increased significantly than these of the control. Likewise, the oxidative stress indices, i.e., hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA), significantly increased at the higher and medium doses, while antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), decreased significantly. On the other hand, prior administration of selenium + vitamin E in the FIP-exposed mice led to restore values of most hematological parameters nearly to these of the control. Also, the levels of AST, total protein, and creatinine seemed to be restored to the control values. Interestingly, pretreatment with selenium + vitamin E restored the levels of antioxidant enzymes, CAT and SOD, to the control values, whereas, oxidative stress indices, H2O2 and MDA, remained significantly high. It is our thought that the sublethal dose less than 1.43 mg/kg b.w. of commercial formulation of FIP (COACH® 200 SC) could be considered as no-observed-adverse-effect-level(NOAEL) under our present experimental conditions at short-term toxicity study. On the other hand, the higher sublethal doses, 4.78 and 2.87 mg/kg b.w., induced significant adverse effects in biomarkers and may be deleterious to human health following long-term exposure."
Low-cost sugarcane bagasse and peanut shell magnetic-composites applied in the removal of carbofuran and iprodione pesticides,"In the present study, two agro-industrial wastes, sugarcane bagasse, and peanut shell were employed as support of magnetite nanoparticles for the synthesis of magnetic bio-composites: magnetic sugarcane bagasse (MBO) and magnetic peanut shell (MPSo). The presence of magnetite was verified by Raman spectroscopy. Magnetic nanoparticles shape and size distribution were studied by TEM, while composites morphologies were observed by SEM. Structural characteristics of the pesticides and their possible chemical adsorption on composites were analyzed by FTIR. The removal was carried out by a batch adsorption process, and UV-VIS technique was used for pesticide concentration estimation. Elovich model described better all systems pointing out to a chemical adsorption process occurring. Experimental data isotherms of carbofuran and iprodione can be best explained by more than one mathematical model, but Sip was the ordinary equation in all systems. Maximum adsorption capacities of 175 and 89.3 mg/g for carbofuran, and 119 and 2.76 mg/g for iprodione, were obtained for MBo and MPSo, respectively."
Stereoselective metabolism and potential adverse effects of chiral fungicide triadimenol on Eremias argus,"Reptiles are an important part of vertebrates and are the primitive terrestrial vertebrates. However, lots of reptile species are endangered or susceptible to extinction. It is no doubt that contaminants are one of the important reasons for the decline of the lizard population. In this study, the selective metabolism of triadimenol (TN) in the male Eremias argus lizards and the toxic effects of TN on lizards were studied. TN chiral isomers were separated and detected by HPLC-MS/MS system with Lux Cellulose-1 column. Tissue distribution experiments showed the existence of stereoselectivity biotransformation of TN enantiomers among organs in lizards, and RR-TN preferentially emerged over the other enantiomers. The antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GST) activities and MDA content assays demonstrated that TN induced oxidative stress in most organs, especially in the liver, and the histopathology analysis showed the severe liver and testis damage caused by 14-day continuous TN gavage. The reproductive effects of TN-induced reflected in the increased sex hormone testosterone. This research confirms that TN could induce hepatic and reproductive toxicity of E. argus lizard."
Antiviral effects of Brazilian green and red propolis extracts on Enterovirus surrogates,"Propolis is a natural product of bees with biological activities that are mainly associated with bee type and geographic origin. Propolis extract has been proposed with several applications in environmental health. The ethanol extracts have shown good antimicrobial activity. The association of this technique with ultrasound-assisted extraction has been studied to improve the characteristics of the obtained extracts. Thus, the objective of this work is to verify the antiviral action against two strains of bacteriophages of two extracts of Brazilian propolis (green and red) obtained by conventional extraction and ultrasonic extraction. The activities of the propolis red and green extracts were confirmed by the significant ~3 and ~4.5 Log 10 PFU/mL reduction in the concentrations of the MS2 and Av-08 bacteriophages, respectively. It was found that ultrasound-assisted extraction is comparable to the maceration process and demonstrated the best antiviral activities. Brazilian red propolis was more effective than green propolis in viral reduction in all treatments."
Spray dedusting scheme under hybrid ventilation at a fully mechanized excavation face,"In order to evaluate the dust suppression performance with a spraying system at the fully mechanized excavation face, an airflow–droplet–dust multiphase coupling model was established based on the Eulerian–Lagrangian method. Subsequently, the model’s accuracy was validated experimentally using a self-developed system for measuring dust suppression efficiency. For the pressure/exhaust hybrid ventilation condition, the following conclusions can be drawn: with an increase of airflow migration distance, the number of vortices gradually decreased, and dust-capturing probability caused by collision with wall decreased gradually along the axial direction of the roadway. Jointly driven by the rebounded airflow, the entrainment effect of high-velocity jets around the pressure inlet, and the transverse vortex field near the cutting face, three high-concentration dust particle clusters, denoted as particle flows I, II, and III, were formed, and the distribution patterns of dust particle clusters after the implementation of different spray schemes were determined. By analyzing the droplet field distribution surrounding the coal cutting head and comparing the dust suppression performance, the study proposed two optimal spray schemes: with gravity-driven supply of water, the spray scheme K2.0–4 MPa delivered optimum dust suppression performance, and the mean dust concentrations at specific fixed operating points dropped to 130 mg/m3; after utilizing a booster pump, the P2.0–8 MPa spray scheme delivered optimum dust suppression performance, with a mean dust concentration at fixed operating points dropping to 65 mg/m3. After applying the K2.0–4 MPa and P2.0–8 MPa schemes, the dust suppression performance was better for the dust with bigger size. The dust suppression efficiencies for the respirable dust were less than 60.7 and 72.5%, respectively. Other dust prevention measures should be taken to further reduce the dust hazard."
Surfactant-modified titania for cadmium removal and textile effluent treatment together being environmentally safe for seed germination and growth of Vigna radiata,"The present work describes synthesis, detailed characterization, and application of bare and surfactant-modified titania nanomaterials (NMs) for various wastewater treatment applications as individual cases like cadmium (Cd) removal, methylene blue (MB) dye degradation, and treatment of real textile and dyeing industry effluent. These NMs are used as adsorbents and photocatalysts in an indegenously developed end-to-end treatment process and a photocatalytic reactor for treatment of textile wastewater. The used NMs are suitably filtered and recovered for reuse; however, still this work focusses on the extent of potential risk and environmental safety of these engineered NMs towards seed germination and plant growth, in the event they escape wastewater treatment plants and reach out to natural water bodies and soil systems, accumulate over a period of time, and comes in contact with plant species. For synthesis, sol-gel method was utilized; cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were used as cationic and anionic surfactants, respectively, to act as particle growth templates and improve surface morphology. Detailed characterization involved XRD (X-ray diffraction), FTIR (Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy), SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy), EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis), and BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface area analysis. Improved morphology and surface properties, from irregular shape in Bare TiO2 to spherical shape in surfactant-modified titania, led to enhanced Cd removal and MB dye degradation efficiency. Bare TiO2 was used for complete treatment of textile wastewater, which took 5 h in achieving water quality, which is safe for discharge and reuse as per norms of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Govt. of India. Phytotoxicity studies of these NMs at a wide concentration range (0–1000 mg L-1) were undertaken towards Vigna radiata, and 500 mg L−1 concentration was found to be optimally safe for seed germination and plant growth."
Functional mutation allele mining of plant architecture and yield-related agronomic traits and characterization of their effects in wheat,"Wheat mutant resources with phenotypic variation have been developed in recent years. These mutants might carry favorable mutation alleles, which have the potential to be utilized in the breeding process. Plant architecture and yield-related features are important agronomic traits for wheat breeders and mining favorable alleles of these traits will improve wheat characteristics."
Vision-based vehicle detection and counting system using deep learning in highway scenes,"Intelligent vehicle detection and counting are becoming increasingly important in the field of highway management. However, due to the different sizes of vehicles, their detection remains a challenge that directly affects the accuracy of vehicle counts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a vision-based vehicle detection and counting system. A new high definition highway vehicle dataset with a total of 57,290 annotated instances in 11,129 images is published in this study. Compared with the existing public datasets, the proposed dataset contains annotated tiny objects in the image, which provides the complete data foundation for vehicle detection based on deep learning. In the proposed vehicle detection and counting system, the highway road surface in the image is first extracted and divided into a remote area and a proximal area by a newly proposed segmentation method; the method is crucial for improving vehicle detection. Then, the above two areas are placed into the YOLOv3 network to detect the type and location of the vehicle. Finally, the vehicle trajectories are obtained by the ORB algorithm, which can be used to judge the driving direction of the vehicle and obtain the number of different vehicles. Several highway surveillance videos based on different scenes are used to verify the proposed methods. The experimental results verify that using the proposed segmentation method can provide higher detection accuracy, especially for the detection of small vehicle objects. Moreover, the novel strategy described in this article performs notably well in judging driving direction and counting vehicles. This paper has general practical significance for the management and control of highway scenes."
High-level integration of murine intestinal transcriptomics data highlights the importance of the complement system in mucosal homeostasis,"The mammalian intestine is a complex biological system that exhibits functional plasticity in its response to diverse stimuli to maintain homeostasis. To improve our understanding of this plasticity, we performed a high-level data integration of 14 whole-genome transcriptomics datasets from samples of intestinal mouse mucosa. We used the tool Centrality based Pathway Analysis (CePa), along with information from the Reactome database."
Comparative genomics of Alternaria species provides insights into the pathogenic lifestyle of Alternaria brassicae – a pathogen of the Brassicaceae family,"Alternaria brassicae, a necrotrophic pathogen, causes Alternaria Leaf Spot, one of the economically important diseases of Brassica crops. Many other Alternaria spp. such as A. brassicicola and A. alternata are known to cause secondary infections in the A. brassicae-infected Brassicas. The genome architecture, pathogenicity factors, and determinants of host-specificity of A. brassicae are unknown. In this study, we annotated and characterised the recently announced genome assembly of A. brassicae and compared it with other Alternaria spp. to gain insights into its pathogenic lifestyle."
Genomic identification and characterization of MYC family genes in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.),"MYC transcriptional factors are members of the bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) superfamily, and play important roles in plant growth and development. Recent studies have revealed that some MYCs are involved in the crosstalk between Jasmonic acid regulatory pathway and light signaling in Arabidopsis, but such kinds of studies are rare in wheat, especially in photo-thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (PTGMS) wheat line."
normGAM: an R package to remove systematic biases in genome architecture mapping data,"The genome architecture mapping (GAM) technique can capture genome-wide chromatin interactions. However, besides the known systematic biases in the raw GAM data, we have found a new type of systematic bias. It is necessary to develop and evaluate effective normalization methods to remove all systematic biases in the raw GAM data."
iPseU-NCP: Identifying RNA pseudouridine sites using random forest and NCP-encoded features,"Pseudouridine modification is most commonly found among various kinds of RNA modification occurred in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This biochemical event has been proved to occur in multiple types of RNAs, including rRNA, mRNA, tRNA, and nuclear/nucleolar RNA. Hence, gaining a holistic understanding of pseudouridine modification can contribute to the development of drug discovery and gene therapies. Although some laboratory techniques have come up with moderately good outcomes in pseudouridine identification, they are costly and required skilled work experience. We propose iPseU-NCP – an efficient computational framework to predict pseudouridine sites using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm combined with nucleotide chemical properties (NCP) generated from RNA sequences. The benchmark dataset collected from Chen et al. (2016) was used to develop iPseU-NCP and fairly compare its performances with other methods."
Investigating the role of super-enhancer RNAs underlying embryonic stem cell differentiation,"Super-enhancer RNAs (seRNAs) are a kind of noncoding RNA transcribed from super-enhancer regions. The regulation mechanism and functional role of seRNAs are still unclear. Although super-enhancers play a critical role in the core transcriptional regulatory circuity of embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation, whether seRNAs have similar properties should be further investigated."
"Composite genome sequence of Bacillus clausii, a probiotic commercially available as Enterogermina®, and insights into its probiotic properties",Some of the spore-forming strains of Bacillus probiotics are marketed commercially as they survive harsh gastrointestinal conditions and bestow health benefits to the host.
Genome-Wide Association Analysis Dissects the Genetic Basis of the Grain Carbon and Nitrogen Contents in Milled Rice,"Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are two fundamental components of starch and protein, which are important determinants of grain yield and quality. The food preferences of consumers and the expected end-use of grains in different rice-growing regions require diverse varieties that differ in terms of the grain N content (GNC) and grain C content (GCC) of milled rice. Thus, it is important that quantitative trait loci (QTLs)/genes with large effects on the variation of GNC and GCC are identified in breeding programs."
Tuning Crystal Field Potential by Orbital Dilution in Strongly Correlated d4 Oxides,"We investigate the interplay between Coulomb-driven orbital order and octahedral distortions in strongly correlated Mott insulators due to orbital dilution, i.e., doping by metal ions without an orbital degree of freedom. In particular, we focus on layered transition metal oxides and study the effective spin–orbital exchange due to d3 substitution at d4 sites. The structure of the d3 − d4 spin–orbital coupling between the impurity and the host in the presence of octahedral rotations favors a distinct type of orbital polarization pointing towards the impurity and outside the impurity–host plane. This yields an effective lattice potential that generally competes with that associated with flat octahedra and, in turn, can drive an inversion of the crystal field interaction."
Study of solar cycle dependence of the quasi-two-day wave in the MLT from an extratropical station,"The relationship between the quasi-two-day wave (QTDW) and solar variability during summer in the MLT is studied using long-term meteor wind observations from an extratropical station, Cachoeira Paulista (22.7°S, 45°W) in the Southern hemisphere. Overall, the seasonal (summer) mean and monthly mean zonal amplitude of the QTDW show a negative correlation and the meridional amplitude exhibits a positive correlation with the solar F10.7 flux in the MLT. Although the seasonal mean (summer) wave period shows positive correlation with the solar cycle, both positive and negative correlations are found in the monthly mean period in certain summer months at the present location. Additionally, both amplitude and period of the QTDW show slightly higher values in solar minimum and lower values in solar maximum within the limit of standard deviation indicating a weak, but measurable response to the solar cycle. The features of the present study bearing similarity as well as disagreement with the findings of the past investigators are also discussed in the perspective of current understanding."
Waiting for the green light: tracing candidate selection by the French Green party in the 2014 European elections,"A widespread assumption is that national political parties use candidate selection for European elections to promote unexperienced politicians or to offer a luxury retirement home to senior national figureheads. Yet, if much criticism is addressed to the outcomes of the parties’ selection procedures, the actual processes that lead to such outcomes are under remarkably little scrutiny. This article traces the candidate recruitment process that took place in the French party Europe Ecology—The Greens ahead of the 2014 European elections. It investigates how the greens have juggled between their participatory ideals and short-term campaign imperatives. Results show that different combinations of logics have prevailed at different times in the process of nomination. Although the party elite carefully designed a process to maximise its goals, developments ultimately escaped its control."
Geography and Demography: New Economic Geography with Endogenous Fertility,"To explain the links between demographics and economic integration, we construct a new economic geography model with endogenous fertility. Labour mobility across regions results in more people flowing into highly populated regions, but lowers fertility rates there. Finally, regions are divided into one very large region with a higher real wage and another small region with a lower real wage, a higher fertility rate and a supply of workers to the large region. The population growth path resembles a logistic curve in the early phase, but population decreases in the last phase. Economic integration leads to population concentration and decreases population size."
Excess Burden of Taxation and Environmental Policy Mix with a Consumer-Friendly Firm,"This study examines the environmental policy mix of tradable emission permits and emission taxes in a duopoly model with a consumer-friendly firm. We analyse the interplay of the two policies and the welfare consequences in the presence of excess burden of taxation. We show that an emission tax can be redundant when both the excess burden of taxation and the degree of consumer friendliness are insignificant. However, when the excess burden of taxation is significant, tradable permits policy with tax treatment should be applied to enhance welfare in the presence of a consumer-friendly firm. Finally, under the tax revenue-neutral case where the excess burden of taxation does not matter, the environmental policy mix is also efficient if the degree of consumer friendliness is sufficiently high."
SEOM clinical guidelines in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (2019),"Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 high penetrance genes account for most hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, although other new high-moderate penetrance genes included in multigene panels have increased the genetic diagnosis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer families by 50%. Multigene cancer panels provide new challenges related to increased frequency of variants of uncertain significance, new gene-specific cancer risk assessments, and clinical recommendations for carriers of mutations of new genes. Although clinical criteria for genetic testing continue to be largely based on personal and family history with around a 10% detection rate, broader criteria are being applied with a lower threshold for detecting mutations when there are therapeutic implications for patients with breast or ovarian cancer. In this regard, new models of genetic counselling and testing are being implemented following the registration of PARP inhibitors for individuals who display BRCA mutations. Massive sequencing techniques in tumor tissue is also driving a paradigm shift in genetic testing and potential identification of germline mutations. In this paper, we review the current clinical criteria for genetic testing, as well as surveillance recommendations in healthy carriers, risk reduction surgical options, and new treatment strategies in breast cancer gene-mutated carriers."
An information-theoretic graph-based approach for feature selection,"Feature selection is a critical research problem in data science. The need for feature selection has become more critical with the advent of high-dimensional data sets especially related to text, image and micro-array data. In this paper, a graph-theoretic approach with step-by-step visualization is proposed in the context of supervised feature selection. Mutual information criterion is used to evaluate the relevance of the features with respect to the class. A graph-based representation of the input data set, named as feature information map (FIM) is created, highlighting the vertices representing the less informative features. Amongst the more informative features, the inter-feature similarity is measured to draw edges between features having high similarity. At the end, minimal vertex cover is applied on the connected vertices to identify a subset of features potentially having less similarity among each other. Results of the experiments conducted with standard data sets show that the proposed method gives better results than the competing algorithms for most of the data sets. The proposed algorithm also has a novel contribution of rendering a visualization of features in terms of relevance and redundancy."
Isotopic Analysis of Highly Enriched Crystalline 28Si and Initial 28SiF4 by High-Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry,"A procedure is described for determining the isotopic composition of highly enriched silicon as elementary 28Si and initial 28SiF4 by a single collector double focusing sector field ICP MS over a wide range of isotope concentrations (more than 6 orders of magnitude). To expand the range of measured isotopic concentrations, the signals of the main and “impurity” isotopes were recorded in solutions of different concentrations. The determination of the matrix effects and mass discrimination factors was carried out using the isotopic dilution method. This procedure allowed us to reach the uncertainty of measuring the concentration of the main isotope of ten thousandths of a percent in enriching >99.999% on a high-resolution single-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer."
Gold Nanoparticles–Fe3O4 Beads/multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes Modified Glassy Carbon Electrode as a Sensing Platform for the Electrocatalytic Determination of Loratadine in Biological Fluids,"The glassy carbon electrode was modified by gold nanoparticles (AuNps)–Fe3O4 beads/multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Surface morphology characterization of the bare and modified electrodes was characterized by scanning electron microscopy technique. This modified glassy carbon electrode was applied for electro-catalytic determination of loratadine. The modified electrode lowered the reduction overpotential of loratadine with the enhancement of its peak current; this behavior was attributed to the electro-catalytic activity of the modified electrode toward loratadine electro-reduction. Various parameters, such as pH of the working solution, amounts of MWCNTs, Fe3O4 beads and AuNps affecting the electrochemical performance of the modified electrode toward loratadine determination were optimized. The linear response of the modified electrode toward loratadine concentration using hydrodynamic amperometry method was between 0.05–5 μM with a detection limit of 0.04 μM (S/N = 3). The modified electrode figures of merit were high repeatability, reproducibility, long-term life time and low response time (<3 s). The practicability of this proposed method was examined by loratadine content quantification in commercial pharmaceutical samples, human blood serum and urine samples and satisfactory results were obtained."
Use of Chemometric Methods of Data Analysis for the Identification and Typification of Petroleum and Petroleum Products,"A method for identifying straits of rocket kerosene (RG-1 and T-1 brands) and various types of hydrocarbon fuels (aviation fuel TC-1 and diesel fuel) in soil has been developed. The proposed version of identification is based on the preliminary separation of the main components by gas chromatography and their mass spectrometric detection followed by the processing of the data obtained by chemometric methods of analysis (principal component analysis and projection on latent structures with discriminant analysis) using the “MZmineZ,” “iMet-Q,” and “MetaboAnalyst” software. A possibility of the application of the developed approach to the typification of saturated oil fractions of different origin is illustrated."
Study of the Aquatic Chlorination of UV Filter Avobenzone in the Presence of Inorganic Salts by Gas Chromatography–High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry,"Disinfection is an essential technological stage in water treatment. It is used not only for potable water but also for, e. g., swimming pool water. Water chlorination is the most common method for eliminating microorganisms today. However, active chlorine reacting with natural and anthropogenic compounds dissolved in water gives rise to the formation of numerous compounds that may be hazardous to human health. The assortment of anthropogenic contaminants grows every year; UV filters are well represented among them. Since recently, they are referred to as ecotoxicants, while their application to skin protection becomes more and more popular all over the world. Over 30 compounds, including numerous halogenated derivatives forming in the aquatic chlorination of a popular UV filter avobenzone in the presence of inorganic salts of iron and copper, as well as bromides and iodides, were identified by gas-chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry. The study demonstrated the notable variation of the qualitative and quantitative composition of the reaction products depending on the added salt. It is worth mentioning the formation of brominated and iodinated products."
Study of Nettle (Urtica dióica) Lignin by Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry,"Orbital ion trap high-resolution mass spectrometry with acetone doped atmospheric pressure photoionization is first used to characterize the structure of grass lignins using an example of nettle (Urtíca dióica) dioxane lignin. The obtained mass spectrum contains about 3,000 peaks of deprotonated molecules of lignin oligomers in the molecular mass range up to 1.6 kDa. The study of tandem mass spectra and of a composition of monomers formed in the collision-induced dissociation of lignin macromolecules showed the special role of p-hydroxycinnamic acids in the formation of nettle lignin. Based on the results of tandem mass spectrometry, possible structures of nettle lignin oligomers formed by the addition of guaiacyl- and syringylpropane units followed by etherification by p-coumaric, ferulic, and dihydroferulic acids are proposed."
"Dissociative Electron Attachment to 2,6- and 2,5-Dihydroxyacetophenone","Two model humic compounds, 2,6- and 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone, were investigated by negative ion mass spectrometry. Dissociative electron attachment cross-sections and negative ion autodetachment lifetimes were measured in the electron energy region 0–10 eV. Adiabatic electron affinities of the compounds under investigation were evaluated. The results obtained were rationalized using DFT B3LYP/6-31G+(d) quantum-chemical calculations."
Application of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography/High Resolution Mass Spectrometry to the Investigation of the Biodegradation and Transformation of Phenanthrene by a Plasmid Bearing Rhizosphere Bacteria Pseudomonas aureofaciens,"Mass spectrometry was applied to identify metabolites and estimate the efficiency of phenanthrene biodegradation and transformation by rhizosphere bacteria Pseudomonas aureofaciens BS1393. Strains P. aureofaciens BS1393(pOV17) and P. aureofaciens BS1393(NPL-41) bearing various naphthalene biodegradation plasmids were used in the work. The strain BS1393(pOV17) contains the pOV17 wild type naphthalene biodegradation plasmid that determines the oxidation of naphthalene to Krebs cycle metabolites. The strain BS1393(NPL-41) contains the mutant plasmid NPL-41 governing the initial stages of naphthalene oxidation into salicylic acid. The limiting stages of phenanthrene biodegradation in bacteria with various plasmids have been identified according to the accumulation of intermediates. When bacteria were grown on phenanthrene, the main metabolites were as follows: (a) 2-hydroxy-2H-benzo[h]chromene-2-carboxylic acid/trans-4-(1-hydroxynaph-2-yl)-2-oxobut-3-enoic acid, (b) 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, and (c) salicylic acid. In the strain BS1393(pOV17), metabolite (а) was observed during 1–14 days of cultivation. Unlike it, in the strain BS1393(NPL-41), an insignificant amount of this metabolite was found after only 14 days. The availability of metabolite (b) in the growth of both strains was an evidence of the limited rate of its further decarboxylation. Metabolite (c) as a final product was found in the growth of the strain BS1393(NPL-41). Contrastingly, in the strain BS1393(pOV17), this metabolite was not found, which indicates the complete oxidation of phenanthrene."
Quadrupole Ion Trap Time-of-Flight MALDI Mass Spectrometry: Hydration of Ions of Hydroxyl-Containing Compounds,"A possibility of artifact formation associated with ion hydration in quadrupole ion trap MALDI mass spectra is shown for the first time on an example of a number of natural hydroxyl-containing compounds from various classes. It was found that, in using tandem mass spectrometry, both precursor ions and product ions are involved in the formation of adducts with water. The main source of water for ion-molecular interactions in the ion trap is provided by buffer and collision gases. The role of metal cations in the formation of analyte adducts with water is noted. For the majority of the studied hydroxyl-containing compounds, hydration proceeds most actively in cationization with lithium ions, with the peak of the [M+H2O+Li]+ ion dominating in the mass spectra."
Characterization of the Structural Forms of Biomolecules Based on the Decomposition and Separation of the Charge-State Distributions of Their Ions,"The purpose of this work is the efficient reveal and analysis of hidden information in mass spectrometric data on the structural composition of the studied solutions of biomolecules in their electrospray ionization. This paper describes the algorithm of sequential splitting combined with the decomposition of the measured charge-state distributions of biomolecules while increasing the number of individual components corresponding to the independent presence of charge carriers with the found probabilities of retention for a given number of ionogenic groups of these biomolecules. The article discusses the results of calculations for the two-dimensional and one-dimensional decompositions of the charge distributions of cytochrome c with separation, presumably corresponding to different conformations of proteins. For the first time we developed a method and a software for searching individual components and their contributions to the mass spectra of multiply charged ions when the mass spectra of these components are not known in advance."
Framework for generalized polytropes with complexity factor,"A framework is developed for generalized polytropes with the help of complexity factor introduced by Herrera (Phy Rev D 97:044010, 2018), by using the spherical symmetry with anisotropic inner fluid distribution. For this purpose generalized polytropic equation of state will be used, having two cases (i) for mass density \((\mu _{o})\), (ii) for energy density \((\mu )\), each case leads to a system of differential equations. These systems of differential equations involve two equations with three unknowns and they will be made consistent by using the complexity factor. The analysis of the solutions of these systems will be carried out graphically by using different parametric values involved in the systems."
Violent conflict and breastfeeding: the case of Iraq,"This study explores the relationship between armed conflict and breastfeeding practices of Iraqi mothers. To date, the relationship between violent conflict and breastfeeding is surprisingly understudied. Especially in the Middle East, which is conflict-prone and has a young population, research on war and household behavior is critical for promoting recovery and sustainable development."
CircNFIX promotes progression of glioma through regulating miR-378e/RPN2 axis,"Circular RNA nuclear factor I X (circNFIX) has been reported to play an important role in glioma progression. However, the mechanism by which circNFIX participates in glioma progression remains poorly understood."
Proteomic profiling of the neurons in mice with depressive-like behavior induced by corticosterone and the regulation of berberine: pivotal sites of oxidative phosphorylation,"Chronic corticosterone (CORT) stress is an anxiety and depression inducing factor that involves the dysfunction of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neuronal plasticity. However, the regulation of proteomic profiles in neurons suffering CORT stress is remaining elusive. Thus, the proteomic profiles of mouse neuronal C17.2 stem cells were comprehensively investigated by TMT (tandem mass tag)-labeling quantitative proteomics. The quantitative proteomics conjugated gene ontology analysis revealed the inhibitory effect of CORT on the expression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation-related proteins, which can be antagonized by berberine (BBR) treatment. In addition, animal studies showed that changes in mitochondria by CORT can affect neuropsychiatric activities and disturb the physiological functions of neurons via disordering mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, the mitochondrial energy metabolism can be considered as one of the major mechanism underlying CORT-mediated depression. Since CORT is important for depression after traumatic stress disorder, our study will shed light on the prevention and treatment of depression as well as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."
TNF-α mediated upregulation of NaV1.7 currents in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons is independent of CRMP2 SUMOylation,"Clinical and preclinical studies have shown that patients with Diabetic Neuropathy Pain (DNP) present with increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) serum concentration, whereas studies with diabetic animals have shown that TNF-α induces an increase in NaV1.7 sodium channel expression. This is expected to result in sensitization of nociceptor neuron terminals, and therefore the development of DNP. For further study of this mechanism, dissociated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were exposed to TNF-α for 6 h, at a concentration equivalent to that measured in STZ-induced diabetic rats that developed hyperalgesia. Tetrodotoxin sensitive (TTXs), resistant (TTXr) and total sodium current was studied in these DRG neurons. Total sodium current was also studied in DRG neurons expressing the collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) SUMO-incompetent mutant protein (CRMP2-K374A), which causes a significant reduction in NaV1.7 membrane cell expression levels. Our results show that TNF-α exposure increased the density of the total, TTXs and TTXr sodium current in DRG neurons. Furthermore, TNF-α shifted the steady state activation and inactivation curves of the total and TTXs sodium current. DRG neurons expressing the CRMP2-K374A mutant also exhibited total sodium current increases after exposure to TNF-α, indicating that these effects were independent of SUMOylation of CRMP2. In conclusion, TNF-α sensitizes DRG neurons via augmentation of whole cell sodium current. This may underlie the pronociceptive effects of TNF-α and suggests a molecular mechanism responsible for pain hypersensitivity in diabetic neuropathy patients."

"Projected local rain events due to climate change and the impacts on waterborne diseases in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","Climate change is increasing the number and intensity of extreme weather events in many parts of the world. Precipitation extremes have been linked to both outbreaks and sporadic cases of waterborne illness. We have previously shown a link between heavy rain and turbidity to population-level risk of sporadic cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in a major Canadian urban population. The risk increased with 30 or more dry days in the 60 days preceding the week of extreme rain. The goal of this study was to investigate the change in cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis risk due to climate change, primarily change in extreme precipitation."
CoQ10 enhances PGC1α and increases expression of mitochondrial antioxidant proteins in chronically ischemic swine myocardium,"Expression of mitochondrial proteins is reduced within hibernating myocardium (HM). It is unclear whether dietary supplementation with CoQ10 can increase expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) and antioxidant proteins within this tissue. In a swine model of HM, we tested whether dietary administration of CoQ10 for four weeks enhances the expression of ETC and antioxidant proteins within the mitochondria via increased PGC1α signaling."
Development of 3D-printed myoelectric hand orthosis for patients with spinal cord injury,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe medical condition affecting the hand and locomotor function. New medical technologies, including various wearable devices, as well as rehabilitation treatments are being developed to enhance hand function in patients with SCI. As three-dimensional (3D) printing has the advantage of being able to produce low-cost personalized devices, there is a growing appeal to apply this technology to rehabilitation equipment in conjunction with scientific advances. In this study, we proposed a novel 3D-printed hand orthosis that is controlled by electromyography (EMG) signals. The orthosis was designed to aid the grasping function for patients with cervical SCI. We applied this hand exoskeleton system to individuals with tetraplegia due to SCI and validated its effectiveness."
Post-annealing tailored 3D cross-linked TiNb2O7 nanorod electrode: towards superior lithium storage for flexible lithium-ion capacitors,"TiNb2O7 anode materials (TNO) have unique potential for applications in Li-ion capacitors (LICs) due to their high specific capacity of ca. 280 mA h g−1 over a wide anodic Li-insertion potential window. However, their high-rate capability is limited by their poor electronic and ionic conductivity. In particular, studies on TNO for LICs are lacking and that for flexible LICs have not yet been reported. Herein, a unique TNO porous electrode with cross-linked nanorods tailored by post-annealing and its application in flexible LICs are reported. This binder-free TNO anode exhibits superior rate performance (~66.3% capacity retention as the rate increases from 1 to 40 C), which is ascribed to the greatly shortened ion-diffusion length in TNO nanorods, facile electrolyte penetration and fast electron transport along the continuous single-crystalline nanorod network. Furthermore, the TNO anode shows an excellent cycling stability up to 2000 cycles and good flexibility (no capacity loss after continuous bending for 500 times). Model flexible LIC assembled with the TNO anode and activated carbon cathode exhibits increased gravimetric and volumetric energy/power densities (~100.6 W h kg−1/4108.8 W kg−1; 10.7 mW h cm−3/ 419.3 mW cm−3), more superior to previously reported hybrid supercapacitors. The device also efficiently powers an LED light upon 180° bending."
Promoting the creation of R&D intentions in primary healthcare measured by a validated instrument,"Primary healthcare has a long and successful patient care history in Sweden. Nevertheless, a research-oriented attitude has been more or less absent in this context.

Proteomic profiling of the neurons in mice with depressive-like behavior induced by corticosterone and the regulation of berberine: pivotal sites of oxidative phosphorylation,"Chronic corticosterone (CORT) stress is an anxiety and depression inducing factor that involves the dysfunction of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neuronal plasticity. However, the regulation of proteomic profiles in neurons suffering CORT stress is remaining elusive. Thus, the proteomic profiles of mouse neuronal C17.2 stem cells were comprehensively investigated by TMT (tandem mass tag)-labeling quantitative proteomics.

Quantitative analysis of cryptocurrencies transaction graph,"Cryptocurrencies as a new way of transferring assets and securing financial transactions have gained popularity in recent years. Transactions in cryptocurrencies are publicly available, hence, statistical studies on different aspects of these currencies are possible. However, previous statistical analysis on cryptocurrencies transactions have been very limited and mostly devoted to Bitcoin, with no comprehensive comparison between these currencies. In this study, we intend to compare the transaction graph of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, and Z-Cash, with respect to the dynamics of their transaction graphs over time, and discuss their properties. In particular, we observed that the growth rate of the nodes and edges of the transaction graphs, and the density of these graphs, are closely related to the price of these currencies. We also found that the transaction graph of these currencies is non-assortative, i.e. addresses do not tend for transact with a particular type of addresses of higher or lower degree, and the degree sequence of their transaction graph follows the power law distribution."
Pharmacologic and surgical therapies for patients with Meniere’s disease: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Hearing loss is one of the leading causes of disability in Canada and worldwide, with more than one million Canadians enduring a hearing-related disability. Meniere’s disease (MD) is a chronic condition of the inner ear, manifesting as a triad of disabling symptoms, including attacks of vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), and tinnitus. Impacts on quality of life are severe, particularly with respect to restrictions in social participation and physical activity, fatigue, and reduced capacity to work. Anxiety and other psychological disorders may result from the restrictions imposed on life, the constant uncertainty of vertigo attacks, and fluctuating SNHL, with neuroses and depression affecting 40 to 60% of sufferers of intractable MD. There is a need to establish the benefits of previously studied interventions with greater certainty. The planned systematic review and meta-analyses/network meta-analyses (NMAs) will assess the relative effects of competing pharmacologic and surgical interventions for management of MD in adults."

Cellular and molecular characterization of multiplex autism in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with pronounced heritability in the general population. This is largely attributable to the effects of polygenic susceptibility, with inherited liability exhibiting distinct sex differences in phenotypic expression. Attempts to model ASD in human cellular systems have principally involved rare de novo mutations associated with ASD phenocopies. However, by definition, these models are not representative of polygenic liability, which accounts for the vast share of population-attributable risk."
"CyBy2: a strongly typed, purely functional framework for chemical data management","We present the development of CyBy2, a versatile framework for chemical data management written in purely functional style in Scala, a modern multi-paradigm programming language. Together with the core libraries we provide a fully functional example implementation of a HTTP server together with a single page web client with powerful querying and visualization capabilities, providing essential functionality for people working in the field of organic and medicinal chemistry. The main focus of CyBy2 are the diverse needs of different research groups in the field and therefore the flexibility required from the underlying data model. Techniques for writing type level specifications giving strong guarantees about the correctness of the implementation are described, together with the resulting gain in confidence during refactoring. Finally we talk about the advantages of using a single code base from which the server, the client and the software’s documentation pages are being generated. We conclude with a comparison with existing open source solutions. All code described in this article is published under version 3 of the GNU General Public License and available from GitHub including an example implementation of both backend and frontend together with documentation how to download and compile the software (available at https://github.com/stefan-hoeck/cyby2)."
Let’s play on Facebook: using sentiment analysis and social media metrics to measure the success of YouTube gamers’ post types,"This paper discusses the analysis results of successful self-marketing techniques on Facebook pages in the cases of three YouTube gamers: PewDiePie, Markiplier, and Kwebbelkop. The research focus was to identify significant differences in terms of the gamers’ user-generated Facebook metrics and commentary sentiments. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and k-nearest neighbor sentiment analysis were employed as core research methods. ANOVA of the classified post categories revealed that photos tended to show significantly more user-generated interactions than other post types, while, on the other hand, re-posted YouTube videos gained significantly fewer numbers in the retrieved metrics than other content types. K-nearest neighbor sentiment analysis pointed out underlying follower negativity in cases where user-generated activity was relatively low, thereby improving the understanding of the opinion of the masses previously hidden behind metrics such as the number of likes, comments, and shares. The paper at hand highlights the methodological design of the study as well as a detailed discussion of key findings and their implications, and future work. The results per se indicate the need to utilize natural language processing techniques to optimize brand communication on social media and highlight the importance of considering machine learning sentiment analysis techniques for a better understanding of consumer feedback."

We used multivariate analysis technique to know the correlations between the vegetation group types and the location environmental factors; we used the location environment factors such as altitudes above sea level, tidal winds (distance from the coast), annual average temperatures, and forest gaps to know the vegetation distribution patterns."
Population genetic structure based on mitochondrial DNA analysis of Ikonnikov’s whiskered bat (Myotis ikonnikovi—Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae) from Korea,"Ikonnikov’s whiskered bat (Myotis ikonnikovi) is found throughout the Korean Peninsula, as well as in Kazakhstan, Russia, Mongolia, China, and Japan. It is small-sized and primarily inhabits old-growth forests. The decrease and fragmentation of habitats due to increased human activity may influence the genetic structure of bat populations. This study was designed to elucidate the population genetic structure of M. ikonnikovi using mitochondrial genes (cytochrome oxidase I and cytochrome b)."
Modern Chinese nationalism and the awakening of self-consciousness of the Chinese Nation,"The concept of “Chinese nation” has a close relationship with the rise, development and upsurge of modern Chinese nationalism from its proposition to establishment, and to universal identification among people of all ethnic groups. The period of the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China was the formation stage of modern Chinese nationalism and also the stage of the proposition and initial usage of the concept of “Chinese nation”: Modern Chinese nationalism developed around the period of the May 4th Movement. Under the impetus of the establishment of national self-determination theory, especially the rise of a national self-determination movement, the concept of “Chinese nation” was accepted and adopted by more and more people and finally established and formed. After the September 18th Incident, especially after the North China Incident and the July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the worsening national crisis promoted the upsurge of modern Chinese nationalism, and this upsurge made the concept of “Chinese nation” more widely and deeply disseminated and accepted."
"Controlling the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) by releasing the predatory phytoseiid mites and pesticides on pepper in a greenhouse","Two programs for controlling the western flower thrips (WFT), Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), were evaluated. Greenhouse experiments were conducted for reducing F. occidentalis populations on pepper plants. The first program was by releasing four phytoseiid predacious mite species namely Neoseiulus arundonaxi (Metwally and Sanad), N. barkeri (Hughes), N. bicaudus (Wainstein), and Cydnoseius negevi (Swirski and Amitai) in the presence of blue sticky traps. The second one was by applying four sequential applications of different pesticides. Results showed that two releases of N. bicaudus, N. barkeri, and N. arundonaxi in the presence of the blue sticky traps reduced WFT population by 45 to 56%. The best control management of the WFT was by the following insecticides: chlorfenapyr, imidacloprid, azadirachtin, and agricultural potassium soap (third program)."
Description of Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Nematoda: Heterorhabditidae) isolated from hilly areas of Kashmir Valley,"Three strains of entomopathogenic nematodes, labelled P5, P6 and PH, were isolated during surveys of agricultural soils of Pir Panjal Range, using insect baiting technique. Morpho-taxometrical studies and molecular data confirmed that these isolates belong to Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, making this finding the first report of this species from Jammu and Kashmir, India. Their distribution using a meta-analysis of GenBank records was attempted to assess. The morphology, morphometric studies and molecular data were conspecific to original description with minor deviations. Data analysis of the distribution showed that H. bacteriophora was the most ubiquitous throughout the South Africa subcontinent, but it was rarely found in Indian subcontinent having been isolated from 3 states throughout the country. As these 3 strains of H. bacteriophora are native to the hilly region of Kashmir Valley, they can be exploited for the control of target crop insect pests of the region. However, further studies are required regarding their life cycle, host range, virulence potential and survival capacity under extreme environmental conditions."
"Efficiency of Bacillus thuringiensis strains and their Cry proteins against the Red Flour Beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst.) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae)","Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is one of the used bioagents in insect pest control. Its toxicity is largely due to the insecticide endotoxins (crystalline (Cry) proteins) that act selectively on insects and nematodes. The efficiency of 20 of the most common Coleopteran-specific Cry proteins of Bt strains was tested against third instar-larvae of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaeum (Herbst.) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). The primary screening results revealed that 11 Cry proteins (Cry8Ea, Cry8Fa, Cry1Ba, Cry8Ca, Cry1Fb, Cry1Ea, Cry1Ca, Cry55Aa, Cry9Da, Cry1Da, and Cry1Ia) were not toxic at all, 4 Cry proteins (Cry1Aa, Cry14Aa, Cry8Aa, and Cry7Ab) did not cause mortality but caused significant inhibition of growth, and 5 Cry proteins (Cry3Aa, Cry37Aa, Cry22Aa, Cry51Aa, and Cry3Ba) were toxic to T. castaneum larvae. The active 5 Cry proteins were used in the subsequent experiments. Five concentrations, being 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 g Cry protein/10 g diet were used against the third instar larvae, and their mortalities were estimated. The LC50 values of Cry3Aa, Cry37Aa, Cry22Aa, Cry51Aa, and Cry3Ba were 0.46, 0.77, 1.25, 1.45, and 1.60 g/10 g, respectively. While the LT50 values of the same Cry proteins (for the concentration 2 g/10 g diet) were 1.50, 1.93, 2.29, 2.23, and 4.22 days, respectively. The results indicated that Cry3Aa was the most active one against T. castaneum larvae. The results of the sublethal study showed that the application of LC30 value of the active 5 Cry proteins reduced total eggs laid daily per female within 2 weeks, where, the percent decrease in egg numbers were 50.55, 38.56, 31.31, 23.20, and, 18.10% for Cry3Aa, Cry37Aa, Cry22Aa, Cry51Aa, and Cry3Ba, respectively. In addition, the hatchability rate of eggs, the larval, and pupal durations of T. castaneum decreased, while the pre-ovipositional period was prolonged. Furthermore, the larvae fed on a diet containing LC30 concentrations of Cry protein showed lower glycogen and lipid rates and generally lower protein content than the control larvae. When T. castaneum larvae were treated by Cry proteins, the level of digestive enzymes found in the midgut was decreased. The present findings indicated that Bt strains/Cry proteins had significant potential for controlling T. castaneum"
"Evaluation of the biological activity of Moringa oleifera leaves extract after incorporating silver nanoparticles, in vitro study","Moringa oleifera is rich in various active phyto-constituents (tannins, sterols, terpenoids, flavonoids, saponins, anthraquinones, alkaloids, and vitamins) in addition to different minerals in its leaves and seeds. Presence of these constituents is responsible for the antioxidant activity and the ability to protect against oxidative damage. Based on measurements of the cytotoxic activities, M. oleifera leaves were found to be more effective than the plant seeds. Therefore, the plant leaves were selected for preparation of silver plant nano-extract during the present study."
"Chronic oral administration of Passiflora incarnata extract has no abnormal effects on metabolic and behavioral parameters in mice, except to induce sleep","Although the number of prescriptions and dependence on sleeping pills are increasing, the associations with unexpected abnormal behaviors and metabolic diseases caused by the overuse of sleeping pills are not well understood. In particular, such as abnormal eating-behavior and the occurrence of metabolic disorders caused by psychological unstable states are reported. For this reason, herbal medicine, which has not had such side effects in recent years, is attracting attention as an alternative medicine/food for sleeping inducer. We have used ethanol extracts from Passiflora incarnata (PI) to steadily obtain positive effects on sleep and brain microenvironment. However, as mentioned earlier, sleep-inducing efficacy can only be used safely if the behavioral and metabolic abnormalities do not appear."
A soft set theoretic approach to an AG-groupoid via ideal theory with applications,"In this paper, we study the structural properties of a non-associative algebraic structure called an AG-groupoid by using soft set theory. We characterize a right regular class of an AG-groupoid in terms of soft intersection ideals and provide counter examples to discuss the converse part of various problems. We also characterize a weakly regular class of an AG***-groupoid by using generated ideals and soft intersection ideals. We investigate the relationship between SI-left-ideal, SI-right-ideal, SI-two-sided-ideal, and SI-interior-ideal of an AG-groupoid over a universe set by providing some practical examples."
"Photocatalytic Degradation of Chlothianidin: Effect of Humic Acids, Nitrates, and Oxygen","The use of neonicotinoid insecticides has been constantly revised because of their impact on bees, causing their decrease and bee malady. Unfortunately, because of the worldwide differences in pesticide regulation, chlothianidin is still allowed in European Union for greenhouse use and worldwide in some cases without any restictions. Lately, it was detected on soil particles and in raw and drinking waters. The preparation of drinking waters implies different purification processes, including chlorination, ozonation, and UV irradiation and nowadays advanced oxidation processes, including TiO2. The TiO2 photocatalytic degradation of chlothianidin in the presence of oxygen, nitrate, and humic acids was followed by kinetic studies, whereas the photoproducts formed were identified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The efficiency of different set-ups of the photocatalytic degradation of chlothianidin was evaluated by the identification of photoproducts and bioluminescence inhibition of bacteria Vibrio fischeri. The results indicate that less harmful photoproducts are generated in the samples with added humic acids."
A revision of the African genus Mesanthemum (Eriocaulaceae),"Mesanthemum is a genus comprising 16 species in the family Eriocaulaceae and is native to Africa and Madagascar. Eriocaulaceae are characterised by a basal tuft or rosette of narrow leaves and small flowers in heads. Mesanthemum can be recognised by diplostemonous flowers and fused glandular pistillate petals. While most Mesanthemum species are large perennial herbs, two small ephemeral species from West Africa, M. albidum and M. auratum differ from the rest of the genus by their shorter life cycle, smaller size, simpler floral structures and different seed surface patterning. A molecular phylogenetic study, morphological comparisons and scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination of seed coat sculpture were carried out to determine whether they should be separated as a new genus. The molecular results indicate that the two ephemeral species are nested in the Mesanthemum clade. However, they are not closely related to each other. All species of Mesanthemum are here revised, including the description of a new species M. alenicola from Equatorial Guinea. An identification key is provided, together with taxonomic descriptions, synonymy and notes. Images of the seeds as seen under SEM are provided where available. Lectotypifications are provided for Mesanthemum albidum, M. bennae, M. pilosum, M. prescottianum, M. pubescens and M. variabile. A neotype is selected for M. rutenbergianum, which is synonymised with M. pubescens."

There have been no reports of ABS caused by PORD in Chinese children.
"Preoperative platelet count, preoperative hemoglobin concentration and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest duration are risk factors for acute kidney injury after pulmonary endarterectomy: a retrospective cohort study","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major postoperative morbidity of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and has a negative effect on prognosis. The kidney outcomes after pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) have not yet been reported; However, several perioperative characteristics of PEA may induce postoperative AKI. The objective of our study was to identify the incidence and risk factors for postoperative AKI and its association with short-term outcomes."
The short- to midterm effectiveness of stemless prostheses compared to stemmed prostheses for patients who underwent total shoulder arthroplasty: a meta-analysis,To systematically compare the short- to midterm effectiveness of stemless prostheses to that of stemmed prostheses for patients who underwent total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) and to provide a guideline for clinical decision-making.
Comparison of the operative time for open door laminoplasty using titanium plate spacers or hydroxyapatite block spacers: a retrospective study,"Titanium plate (TP) and hydroxyapatite (HA) spacers are widely used during open-door laminoplasty, performed with the patient in a prone position. Reducing operative time is an important consideration, particularly to reduce the risk of postoperative complications in older patients. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to compare the operative time for open-door laminoplasty using TP or HA spacers."
Utilizing network pharmacology to explore the underlying mechanism of Radix Salviae in diabetic retinopathy,"Radix Salviae (Dan-shen in pinyin), a classic Chinese herb, has been extensively used to treat diabetic retinopathy in clinical practice in China for many years. However, the pharmacological mechanisms of Radix Salviae remain vague. The aim of this study was to decrypt the underlying mechanisms of Radix Salviae in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy using a systems pharmacology approach."
Topping-off surgery vs posterior lumbar interbody fusion for degenerative lumbar disease: a finite element analysis,"Adjacent segment disease (ASD) is a common complication after posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF). Recently, a topping-off surgery (non-fusion with Coflex) has been developed to reduce the risk of ASD, yet whether and how the topping-off surgery can relieve ASD remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the biomechanical effect of PLIF and Coflex on the adjacent segments via finite element (FE) analysis and discuss the efficacy of Coflex in preventing ASD."
mRNA structural elements immediately upstream of the start codon dictate dependence upon eIF4A helicase activity,"The RNA helicase eIF4A1 is a key component of the translation initiation machinery and is required for the translation of many pro-oncogenic mRNAs. There is increasing interest in targeting eIF4A1 therapeutically in cancer, thus understanding how this protein leads to the selective re-programming of the translational landscape is critical. While it is known that eIF4A1-dependent mRNAs frequently have long GC-rich 5′UTRs, the details of how 5′UTR structure is resculptured by eIF4A1 to enhance the translation of specific mRNAs are unknown."
Molecular and physiological characterization of the chitin synthase B gene isolated from Culex pipiens pallens (Diptera: Culicidae),"The growth and development of insects is strictly dependent on the precise regulation of chitin synthase (CHS), which is absent in vertebrates and plants. Therefore, CHS represents an attractive target for insecticides. At present, the research on the CHS gene in mosquitoes, especially its biological functions, remains limited."
Increased Ca2+ signaling in NRXN1α+/− neurons derived from ASD induced pluripotent stem cells,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a high co-morbidity of epilepsy and associated with hundreds of rare risk factors. NRXN1 deletion is among the commonest rare genetic factors shared by ASD, schizophrenia, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and developmental delay. However, how NRXN1 deletions lead to different clinical symptoms is unknown. Patient-derived cells are essential to investigate the functional consequences of NRXN1 lesions to human neurons in different diseases."
APOE2 orchestrated differences in transcriptomic and lipidomic profiles of postmortem AD brain,"The application of advanced sequencing technologies and improved mass-spectrometry platforms revealed significant changes in gene expression and lipids in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain. The results so far have prompted further research using “multi-omics” approaches. These approaches become particularly relevant, considering the inheritance of APOEε4 allele as a major genetic risk factor of AD, disease protective effect of APOEε2 allele, and a major role of APOE in brain lipid metabolism."
Non-pulsatile blood flow is associated with enhanced cerebrovascular carbon dioxide reactivity and an attenuated relationship between cerebral blood flow and regional brain oxygenation,"Systemic blood flow in patients on extracorporeal assist devices is frequently not or only minimally pulsatile. Loss of pulsatile brain perfusion, however, has been implicated in neurological complications. Furthermore, the adverse effects of absent pulsatility on the cerebral microcirculation are modulated similarly as CO2 vasoreactivity in resistance vessels. During support with an extracorporeal assist device swings in arterial carbon dioxide partial pressures (PaCO2) that determine cerebral oxygen delivery are not uncommon—especially when CO2 is eliminated by the respirator as well as via the gas exchanger of an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine. We, therefore, investigated whether non-pulsatile flow affects cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity (CVR) and regional brain oxygenation (rSO2)."
Enhancer polymorphism rs10865710 associated with traumatic sepsis is a regulator of PPARG gene expression,Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a major regulator in sepsis. Our previous study identified the enhancer polymorphism rs10865710C/G to be associated with susceptibility to sepsis in trauma patients. We performed two-stage cohort studies integrating biological experiments of potential functional variants that modify susceptibility to traumatic sepsis.
Impact of a goal-directed factor-based coagulation management on thromboembolic events following major trauma,"A factor-based coagulation management following major trauma is recommended as standard of care by the European Trauma Treatment Guidelines. However, concerns about the thromboembolic risk of this approach are still prevalent. Our study therefore aims to assess if such a haemostatic management is associated with an increased risk for thromboembolic events."
Influence of marital status on overall survival in patients with ovarian serous carcinoma: finding from the surveillance epidemiology and end results (SEER) database,This study is to investigate the relationship between marital status and prognosis of patients with ovarian serous carcinoma.
A benchmark of transposon insertion detection tools using real data,"Transposable elements (TEs) are an important source of genomic variability in eukaryotic genomes. Their activity impacts genome architecture and gene expression and can lead to drastic phenotypic changes. Therefore, identifying TE polymorphisms is key to better understand the link between genotype and phenotype. However, most genotype-to-phenotype analyses have concentrated on single nucleotide polymorphisms as they are easier to reliable detect using short-read data. Many bioinformatic tools have been developed to identify transposon insertions from resequencing data using short reads. Nevertheless, the performance of most of these tools has been tested using simulated insertions, which do not accurately reproduce the complexity of natural insertions."
"The effect of home-based low-volume, high-intensity interval training on cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition and cardiometabolic health in women of normal body mass and those with overweight or obesity: protocol for a randomized controlled trial","There is a high prevalence of women in South Africa with overweight and obesity which is associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic disorders. Perceived barriers such as lack of time and motivation reduce engagement in beneficial activity behaviours for health. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a time-efficient and effective way to improve cardiometabolic risk profile regardless of a loss in body mass or change in body composition. This randomized controlled trial aims to determine the effects on cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition and cardiometabolic health and feasibility of a home-based 14-week HIIT program in women with overweight/obesity or normal body mass."
MMP-2 salivary activity in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and periodontitis are chronic inflammatory diseases with a bidirectional relationship. The uncontrolled levels of glucose in T2DM patients change the pathophysiology and balance of inflammatory mediators. Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is a zinc-dependent endopeptidase that is responsible for tissue remodeling and degradation of the extracellular matrix in periodontal tissue. Therefore, the uncontrolled levels of glucose in T2DM could lead to an imbalance in MMP-2 activity in saliva, favoring the development of periodontitis."
The effect of co supplementation of omega-3 and vitamin D on cardio metabolic risk factors and psychological distress in reproductive-aged women with prediabetes and hypovitaminosis D: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"A prediabetic state is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. There are no approved drugs to manage prediabetes. Among the supplements routinely used by individuals, vitamin D and omega-3 have been studied to reduce fasting blood sugar. However, their co-supplementation has not been studied in individuals with prediabetes. This randomized controlled trial is designed to determine the effects of these two supplements on fasting blood sugar, other cardio metabolic risk factors, and psychological distress in reproductive-aged women with prediabetes and hypovitaminosis D."
Multicenter study of plastic vs. self-expanding metal stents in endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage of walled-off pancreatic necrosis – PROMETHEUS: a randomized controlled trial protocol,"It seems that lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) are displacing plastic stents in the therapy of pancreatic-fluid collection in walled-off necrosis (WON). To date, there is no quality of evidence to recommend LAMS as the standard treatment in the management of WON. The theoretical benefit of LAMS over plastic stents needs to be proven."
"Evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of the Chinese herbal medicine Yishen Tongbi decoction in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis: protocol for a randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common chronic autoimmune disease that seriously affects the quality of life of patients because of damage to joints. Presently, RA is mainly treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or biological agents; however, they offer limited efficacy in some patients. Therefore, additional therapeutic strategies need to be developed. Yishen Tongbi decoction is a traditional Chinese medicine formulation widely used to treat RA in China. However, currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use for the treatment of RA. Therefore, we aim to verify the efficacy of Yishen Tongbi decoction to treat RA by a noninferiority trial, and to provide a basis for its use with a full-scale clinical trial."
A cognitive behavioral therapy intervention to reduce fear of hypoglycemia in young adults with type 1 diabetes (FREE): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"In persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D), hypoglycemia is the major limiting factor in achieving optimal glycemic control. All persons with T1D are at risk for hypoglycemia (blood glucose level < 70 mg/dl), which is life-threatening and accompanied by serious physical and psychological symptoms, resulting in profound fear of hypoglycemia (FOH) and reduced quality of life. Young adults with T1D are at risk for FOH and have worse glycemic control and self-management behavior than other age groups with T1D. FOH also results in increased glycemic variability (GV). A major gap exists in how to manage FOH. Our overall objective is to reduce FOH and improve diabetes self-management, glycemic control, and GV in young adults with T1D to reduce or delay diabetes complications and improve quality of life. We aim to (1) determine the feasibility and acceptability of an eight-week cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based Fear Reduction Efficacy Evaluation (FREE) intervention in young adults with T1D who experience FOH; and (2) determine the impact of the FREE intervention, compared to an attention control group, on the outcomes FOH, self-management, glycemic control (A1C), and glycemic variability (continuous glucose monitoring recordings)."
Testing effectiveness of the revised Cape Town modified early warning and SBAR systems: a pilot pragmatic parallel group randomised controlled trial,Nurses’ recognition of clinical deterioration is crucial for patient survival. Evidence for the effectiveness of modified early warning scores (MEWS) is derived from large observation studies in developed countries.
"Internet-based interpersonal psychotherapy for stress, anxiety, and depression in prenatal women: study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial","Psychological distress, defined as depression, anxiety and perceived stress, during pregnancy is common, with 15–25% of women experiencing clinically significant levels of such distress. Despite the far-reaching impact of prenatal psychological distress on mothers and their children, and that women are receptive to screening, few providers routinely screen for prenatal psychological distress and less than one in five women will receive the mental health care that they require. There is a lack of certainty regarding the most effective treatments for prenatal psychological distress. No online interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) trials have been conducted that focus on improving psychological distress in prenatal women. The purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the perspectives of pregnant women on the feasibility and acceptability of online IPT (e-IPT) delivered during pregnancy."
The efficacy of iCBT added to treatment as usual for alcohol-dependent patients in primary care: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Alcohol dependence is a common disorder with a continuum regarding severity. Most alcohol-dependent persons have a moderate level of dependence and live under socially orderly conditions. Treatment-seeking in this group is low, mainly due to stigma and because treatment options are seen as unappealing."
Comparison of 22G standard and Franseen needles in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration for diagnosing pancreatic mass lesions: Study protocol for a controlled trial,"Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) was developed with the aim of further improving the diagnostic performance of endoscopic ultrasound. Although novel puncture needles have been specifically designed for collecting sufficient tissue specimens, clinical studies have indicated no clear difference in diagnostic performance between these novel needles and conventional puncture needles. Recently, a needle with Franseen geometry was developed specifically for EUS-FNA biopsy. Due to the characteristic shape of its tip, the Franseen needle is expected to be effective for scraping tissues, thus potentially increasing the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA biopsy. We plan to carry out a prospective, multicenter, open-labeled, controlled trial to compare conventional and Franseen needles in terms of the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA for evaluating the malignancy of pancreatic mass lesions."
Circ_0001667 promotes breast cancer cell proliferation and survival via Hippo signal pathway by regulating TAZ,"Breast cancer is a most common type of cancer in women. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in cancer development and progression, but their roles and regulatory mechanisms are unclear in breast cancer. Our previous study indicated that has_circ_0001667 (circ_0001667) was up-regulated in breast cancer from the array and might play an oncogenic role, however, the roles of circ_0001667 were not known. This study was aimed to investigate the role and the underlying molecular mechanism of circ_0001667 in breast cancer."
Transcriptional activation of USP16 gene expression by NFκB signaling,"Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 16 (USP16) has been reported to contribute to somatic stem-cell defects in Down syndrome. However, how this gene being regulated is largely unknown. To study the mechanism underlying USP16 gene expression, USP16 gene promoter was cloned and analyzed by luciferase assay. We identified that the 5′ flanking region (− 1856 bp ~ + 468 bp) of the human USP16 gene contained the functional promotor to control its transcription. Three bona fide NFκB binding sites were found in USP16 promoter. We showed that p65 overexpression enhanced endogenous USP16 mRNA level. Furthermore, LPS and TNFα, strong activators of the NFκB pathway, upregulated the USP16 transcription. Our data demonstrate that USP16 gene expression is tightly regulated at transcription level. NFκB signaling regulates the human USP16 gene expression through three cis-acting elements. The results provide novel insights into a potential role of dysregulation of USP16 expression in Alzheimer’s dementia in Down Syndrome."
Musashi2 contributes to the maintenance of CD44v6+ liver cancer stem cells via notch1 signaling pathway,"Liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) contribute to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development, metastasis, and drug resistance. MSI2 and Notch1 signaling are involved in the maintenance of CSCs. However, it is unknown whether MSI2 and Notch1 are involved in the maintenance of CD44v6+ LCSCs. Therefore, we investigated the clinical significance and function of MSI2 and its relationship with Notch1 signaling in the maintenance of stemness properties in CD44v6+ LCSCs."
Plasma membrane localization of MLC1 regulates cellular morphology and motility,"Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is a rare form of infantile-onset leukodystrophy. The disorder is caused primarily by mutations of MLC1 that leads to a series of phenotypic outcomes including vacuolation of myelin and astrocytes, subcortical cysts, brain edema, and macrocephaly. Recent studies have indicated that functional interactions among MLC1, GlialCAM, and ClC-2 channels play key roles in the regulation of neuronal, glial and vascular homeostasis. However, the physiological role of MLC1 in cellular homeostatic communication remains poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the cellular function of MLC1 and its effects on cell–cell interactions."
"Microstructure, mechanical properties and magnetic properties of FeCoNiCuTiSix high-entropy alloys","The microstructure, mechanical properties and magnetic properties of FeCoNiCuTiSix (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.5) high-entropy alloys were studied in detail in the present paper. The crystal structure changes from FCC+Laves to FCC+BCC+Laves phases, as the Si content increases. Cu is more segregated with the increase in Si content, which can be explained from a thermodynamic point of view. The FeCoNiCuTi high-entropy alloy has good compression mechanical properties, and the fracture strength, fracture strain, and Vickers hardness are 1584.2 MPa, 3.3% and 483.2 HV, respectively. However, the plasticity of the alloy decreases slightly as the Si content increases. The highest fracture strength obtained in this study is 1841.7 MPa at x=0.1."
Analysis of node deployment in wireless sensor networks in warehouse environment monitoring systems,"This paper mainly studies the deployment of wireless sensor network nodes in the warehouse environment monitoring system, discusses the deployment algorithm of wireless sensor network nodes in the warehouse environment, and finds out the node deployment scheme with better network performance through comparison. Wireless sensor network node deployment is the basis of wireless sensor network application in storage environment monitoring system. It affects the performance of the whole network and is the primary problem to be solved in network application. This paper discusses the advantages of wireless sensor network in the monitoring of storage environment, especially the deployment and simulation analysis of sensor nodes in the warehouse environment. Aiming at the influence of sensor perception model on the effectiveness of the node deployment plan, this paper proposes a node deployment collaborative perception model based on 0-1 perception model and exponential model. The sensor node deployment problem is transformed into a three-dimensional node deployment problem. Finally, the algorithm is applied to tobacco storage environment. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the scheme obtained by the proposed algorithm is compared with that obtained by the corresponding deployment algorithm in this paper. The comparison results show that the overall performance of the algorithm is better than that of the usual scheme."
Joint measure matrix and channel estimation for millimeter-wave massive MIMO with hybrid precoding,"Millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with hybrid precoding is a promising technology for future 5G wireless communications. Channel estimation for the millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems with hybrid precoding can be performed by estimating the path directions of the channel and corresponding path gains. This paper considers joint measure matrix and channel estimation for a massive MIMO system. By exploiting the sparsity of a massive MIMO system, a channel estimation scheme based on a Toeplitz-structured measure matrix and complete complementary sequence (CC-S) is proposed. Moreover, analytic studies show that the measurement matrix based on CC-S yields either optimal performance or feasibility in practice than an independent identically distributed Gaussian matrix. The performance of the scheme is shown with numerical examples."
Uplifting anti-D6-brane,"A simple, KKLT-like construction of de Sitter vacua in type IIA string theory is presented in an STU model with guidance from string theory U-duality and with an up- lifting anti-D6-brane. In four dimensions the model is reduced to \( \mathcal{N} \) = 1 supergravity with three chiral multiplets, namely S, T and U , as well as one nilpotent multiplet representing the anti-D6-brane. We briefly discuss also a generalization with seven moduli."
FQHE and tt* geometry,"Cumrun Vafa [1] has proposed a microscopic description of the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE) in terms of a many-body Hamiltonian H invariant under four supersymmetries. The non-Abelian statistics of the defects (quasi-holes and quasi-particles) is then determined by the monodromy representation of the associated tt* geometry. In this paper we study the monodromy representation of the Vafa 4-susy model. Modulo some plausible assumption, we find that the monodromy representation factors through a Temperley-Lieb/Hecke algebra with q = ± exp (πi/ν) as predicted in [1]. The emerging picture agrees with the other predictions of [1] as well."
The matrix-extended \( {\mathcal{W}}_{1+\infty } \) algebra,"We construct a quadratic basis of generators of matrix-extended \( {\mathcal{W}}_{1+\infty } \) using a generalization of the Miura transformation. This makes it possible to conjecture a closed-form formula for the operator product expansions defining the algebra. We study truncations of the algebra. An explicit calculation at low levels shows that these are parametrized in a way consistent with the gluing description of the algebra. It is perhaps surprising that in spite of the fact that the algebras are rather complicated and non-linear, the structure of their truncations follows very simple gluing rules."
\( T\overline{T} \) deformation of correlation functions,"We study the evolution of correlation functions of local fields in a two-dimensional quantum field theory under the \( \lambda T\overline{T} \) deformation, suitably regularized. We show that this may be viewed in terms of the evolution of each field, with a Dirac-like string being attached at each infinitesimal step. The deformation then acts as a derivation on the whole operator algebra, satisfying the Leibniz rule. We derive an explicit equation which allows for the analysis of UV divergences, which may be absorbed into a non-local field renormalization to give correlation functions which are UV finite to all orders, satisfying a (deformed) operator product expansion and a Callan-Symanzik equation. We solve this in the case of a deformed CFT, showing that the Fourier-transformed renormalized two-point functions behave as k2∆+2λk2, where ∆ is their IR conformal dimension. We discuss in detail deformed Noether currents, including the energy-momentum tensor, and show that, although they also become non-local, when suitably improved they remain finite, conserved and satisfy the expected Ward identities. Finally, we discuss how the equivalence of the \( T\overline{T} \) deformation to a state-dependent coordinate transformation emerges in this picture."
Charge density response and fake plasmons in holographic models with strong translation symmetry breaking,"We study the charge density response in holographic models with explicit trans- lation symmetry breaking which is relevant in IR. In particular, we focus on Q-lattices and the Bianchy VII helix. We show that the hydrodynamic sound mode is removed from the spectrum due to the strong momentum relaxation and therefore, the usual treatment of the plasmon as Coulomb-dressed zero sound does not apply. Furthermore, the dominant coherent modes in the longitudinal channel, which control the neutral density-density correlator, are the diffusive modes. We show these modes are strongly suppressed when the boundary Coulomb interaction is turned on. This renders the low frequency charge density response spectrum completely incoherent and featureless."
"Causality, unitarity thresholds, anomalous thresholds and infrared singularities from the loop-tree duality at higher orders","We present the first comprehensive analysis of the unitarity thresholds and anomalous thresholds of scattering amplitudes at two loops and beyond based on the loop- tree duality, and show how non-causal unphysical thresholds are locally cancelled in an efficient way when the forest of all the dual on-shell cuts is considered as one. We also prove that soft and collinear singularities at two loops and beyond are restricted to a compact region of the loop three-momenta, which is a necessary condition for implementing a local cancellation of loop infrared singularities with the ones appearing in real emission; without relying on a subtraction formalism."
Gluing gravitational blocks for AdS black holes,"We provide a unifying entropy functional and an extremization principle for black holes and black strings in AdS4 × S7 and AdS5 × S5 with arbitrary rotation and generic electric and magnetic charges. This is done by gluing gravitational blocks, basic building blocks that are directly inspired by the holomorphic blocks appearing in the factorization of supersymmetric partition functions in three and four dimensions. We also provide an explicit realization of the attractor mechanism by identifying the values of the scalar fields at the horizon with the critical points of the entropy functional. We give examples based on dyonic rotating black holes with a twist in AdS4 × S7, rotating black strings in AdS5 × S5, dyonic Kerr-Newman black holes in AdS4 × S7 and Kerr-Newman black holes in AdS5 × S5. In particular, our entropy functional extends existing results by adding rotation to the twisted black holes in AdS4 and by adding flavor magnetic charges for the Kerr-Newman black holes in AdS4. We also discuss generalizations to higher-dimensional black objects."
Single Object Auctions with Externalities: A Tractable Model,"We consider the single object auction model with allocative externalities in a private valuation and quasi-linear setting. We model externalities by assuming that every agent has a private valuation (for the object) and a strict ranking of other agents. The utility for an agent when another agent receives the object is the product of his own valuation and a real number that depends on the rank of this agent in his ranking. When the only private information is the valuation of the agents, we characterise the implementable allocation rules and use these to derive the optimal auction. The optimal auction collects payments from agents who do not receive the object."
Free Trade Agreement with Endogenous Market Structure,"We examine the incentives of free trade agreement (FTA) formation between two countries under endogenous market structure with leaders and followers. We demonstrate that establishing a FTA is neither an equilibrium outcome nor socially optimal when consumer demand and fixed cost are intermediate, products are close substitutes and countries are asymmetrical. This is because the FTA induces exit of followers, which makes the market less competitive and shrinks the leader’s production both in the domestic and foreign markets. We also show that large developing countries are less likely to establish a FTA than small developed countries."
School Choice with General Constraints: A Market Design Approach for the Nursery School Waiting List Problem in Japan,"This study considers a school choice problem with general feasibility constraints. Each student belongs to a grade; and 2 students belonging to the same grade are symmetric, whereas those belonging to different grades can be asymmetric with respect to the feasibility constraint of a school. We introduce five requirements of a matching and a polynomial-time algorithm to derive a matching satisfying them. Because the algorithm is inspired by the nursery school system of Yokohama City, we introduce the system and compare it with the algorithm of this study."
Proximal femoral head transcriptome reveals novel candidate genes related to epiphysiolysis in broiler chickens,"The proximal femoral head separation (FHS) or epiphysiolysis is a prevalent disorder affecting the chicken femur epiphysis, being considered a risk factor to infection which can cause bacterial chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis in broilers. To identify the genetic mechanisms involved in epiphysiolysis, differentially expressed (DE) genes in the femur of normal and FHS-affected broilers were identified using RNA-Seq technology. Femoral growth plate (GP) samples from 35-day-old commercial male broilers were collected from 4 healthy and 4 FHS-affected broilers. Sequencing was performed using an Illumina paired-end protocol. Differentially expressed genes were obtained using the edgeR package based on the False Discovery Rate (FDR < 0.05)."
Hydrogen cyanamide induces grape bud endodormancy release through carbohydrate metabolism and plant hormone signaling,"Grape buds exhibit non-uniform, or delayed, break in early spring in subtropical regions because the accumulation of chilling is insufficient. Hydrogen cyanamide (H2CN2, HC) can partially replace chilling to effectively promote bud sprouting and is used widely in warm winter areas. However, the exact underlying mechanism of grape bud release from endodormancy induced by HC remains elusive."
Cloud accelerated alignment and assembly of full-length single-cell RNA-seq data using Falco,"Read alignment and transcript assembly are the core of RNA-seq analysis for transcript isoform discovery. Nonetheless, current tools are not designed to be scalable for analysis of full-length bulk or single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. The previous version of our cloud-based tool Falco only focuses on RNA-seq read counting, but does not allow for more flexible steps such as alignment and read assembly."
Deep analysis and optimization of CARD antibiotic resistance gene discovery models,"Identification of antibiotic resistance genes from environmental samples has been a critical sub-domain of gene discovery which is directly connected to human health. However, it is drawing extraordinary attention in recent years and regarded as a severe threat to human health by many institutions around the world. To satisfy the needs for efficient ARG discovery, a series of online antibiotic resistance gene databases have been published.

Human protein-RNA interaction network is highly stable across mammals,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are crucial in modulating RNA metabolism in eukaryotes thereby controlling an extensive network of RBP-RNA interactions. Although previous studies on the conservation of RBP targets have been carried out in lower eukaryotes such as yeast, relatively little is known about the extent of conservation of the binding sites of RBPs across mammalian species."
SMaSH: Sample matching using SNPs in humans,"Inadvertent sample swaps are a real threat to data quality in any medium to large scale omics studies. While matches between samples from the same individual can in principle be identified from a few well characterized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), omics data types often only provide low to moderate coverage, thus requiring integration of evidence from a large number of SNPs to determine if two samples derive from the same individual or not."
Capture of complete ciliate chromosomes in single sequencing reads reveals widespread chromosome isoforms,"Whole-genome shotgun sequencing, which stitches together millions of short sequencing reads into a single genome, ushered in the era of modern genomics and led to a rapid expansion of the number of genome sequences available. Nevertheless, assembly of short reads remains difficult, resulting in fragmented genome sequences. Ultimately, only a sequencing technology capable of capturing complete chromosomes in a single run could resolve all ambiguities. Even “third generation” sequencing technologies produce reads far shorter than most eukaryotic chromosomes. However, the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax has a somatic genome with thousands of chromosomes averaging only 3.2 kbp, making it an ideal candidate for exploring the benefits of sequencing whole chromosomes without assembly."
Application of LpxC enzyme inhibitor to inhibit some fast-growing bacteria in human gut bacterial culturomics,"Culturomics can ascertain traces of microorganisms to be cultivated using different strategies and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry or 16S rDNA sequencing. However, to cater to all requirements of microorganisms and isolate as many species as possible, multiple culture conditions must be used, imposing a heavy workload. In addition, the fast-growing bacteria (e.g., Escherichia) surpass the slow-growing bacteria in culture by occupying space and using up nutrients. Besides, some bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas) suppress others by secreting antibacterial metabolites, making it difficult to isolate bacteria with lower competence. Applying inhibitors to restrain fast-growing bacteria is one method to cultivate more bacterial species from human feces."
Primary progressive multiple sclerosis in a Russian cohort: relationship with gut bacterial diversity,"Gut microbiota has been increasingly acknowledged to shape significantly human health, contributing to various autoimmune diseases, both intestinal and non-intestinal, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Gut microbiota studies in patients with relapsing remitting MS strongly suggested its possible role in immunoregulation; however, the profile and potential of gut microbiota involvement in patients with primary progressive MS (PPMS) patients has received much less attention due to the rarity of this disease form. We compared the composition and structure of faecal bacterial assemblage using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of V3-V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA genes amplicons in patients with primary progressive MS and in the healthy controls."
An in vitro collagen perfusion wound biofilm model; with applications for antimicrobial studies and microbial metabolomics,"The majority of in vitro studies of medically relevant biofilms involve the development of biofilm on an inanimate solid surface. However, infection in vivo consists of biofilm growth on, or suspended within, the semi-solid matrix of the tissue, whereby current models do not effectively simulate the nature of the in vivo environment. This paper describes development of an in vitro method for culturing wound associated microorganisms in a system that combines a semi-solid collagen gel matrix with continuous flow of simulated wound fluid. This enables culture of wound associated reproducible steady state biofilms under conditions that more closely simulate the dynamic wound environment. To demonstrate the use of this model the antimicrobial kinetics of ceftazidime, against both mature and developing Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, was assessed. In addition, we have shown the potential application of this model system for investigating microbial metabolomics by employing selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) to monitor ammonia and hydrogen cyanide production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in real-time."
Gut bacteria of weevils developing on plant roots under extreme desert conditions,"Many phytophagous insects, whose diet is generally nitrogen-poor, rely on gut bacteria to compensate for nutritional deficits. Accordingly, we hypothesized that insects in desert environments may evolve associations with gut bacteria to adapt to the extremely low nutrient availability. For this, we conducted a systematic survey of bacterial communities in the guts of weevils developing inside mud chambers affixed to plant roots in the Negev Desert of Israel, based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing."

However, the severities of many SMA cases, especially the cases within a family, often failed to be explained by these modifiers. Therefore, other modifiers are still waiting to be explored."
"Frames, Erasures, and Signal Estimation with Stochastic Models","Frame properties and conditions are determined that would minimize the error in signal reconstruction or estimation in the presence of noise and erasures. The special focus here is on stochastic models. These include estimating a random signal with zero mean and a general covariance matrix, minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE) when the frame coefficients are erased according to some a priori probability distribution in the presence of random noise, and also studying the use of stochastic frames in estimating a random signal. In estimating a random signal from noisy coefficients, when a frame coefficient is lost or erased, it is established that the MSE is minimized under certain geometric relationships between the frame vectors and the signal. When the coefficients are erased according to some a priori distribution, conditions are found for the norms of the frame vectors in terms of the probability distribution of the erasure so that the MSE is minimized. Results obtained here also show how using stochastic frames can lead to more flexibility in design and greater control on the MSE."

Transcriptional activation of USP16 gene expression by NFκB signaling,"Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 16 (USP16) has been reported to contribute to somatic stem-cell defects in Down syndrome. However, how this gene being regulated is largely unknown. To study the mechanism underlying USP16 gene expression, USP16 gene promoter was cloned and analyzed by luciferase assay. We identified that the 5′ flanking region (− 1856 bp ~ + 468 bp) of the human USP16 gene contained the functional promotor to control its transcription. Three bona fide NFκB binding sites were found in USP16 promoter. We showed that p65 overexpression enhanced endogenous USP16 mRNA level. Furthermore, LPS and TNFα, strong activators of the NFκB pathway, upregulated the USP16 transcription. Our data demonstrate that USP16 gene expression is tightly regulated at transcription level. NFκB signaling regulates the human USP16 gene expression through three cis-acting elements. The results provide novel insights into a potential role of dysregulation of USP16 expression in Alzheimer’s dementia in Down Syndrome."
mRNA structural elements immediately upstream of the start codon dictate dependence upon eIF4A helicase activity,"The RNA helicase eIF4A1 is a key component of the translation initiation machinery and is required for the translation of many pro-oncogenic mRNAs. There is increasing interest in targeting eIF4A1 therapeutically in cancer, thus understanding how this protein leads to the selective re-programming of the translational landscape is critical.

MMP-2 salivary activity in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and periodontitis are chronic inflammatory diseases with a bidirectional relationship. The uncontrolled levels of glucose in T2DM patients change the pathophysiology and balance of inflammatory mediators. Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is a zinc-dependent endopeptidase that is responsible for tissue remodeling and degradation of the extracellular matrix in periodontal tissue. Therefore, the uncontrolled levels of glucose in T2DM could lead to an imbalance in MMP-2 activity in saliva, favoring the development of periodontitis."
A benchmark of transposon insertion detection tools using real data,"Transposable elements (TEs) are an important source of genomic variability in eukaryotic genomes. Their activity impacts genome architecture and gene expression and can lead to drastic phenotypic changes. Therefore, identifying TE polymorphisms is key to better understand the link between genotype and phenotype. However, most genotype-to-phenotype analyses have concentrated on single nucleotide polymorphisms as they are easier to reliable detect using short-read data. Many bioinformatic tools have been developed to identify transposon insertions from resequencing data using short reads. Nevertheless, the performance of most of these tools has been tested using simulated insertions, which do not accurately reproduce the complexity of natural insertions."

Antithrombotic drugs do not increase intraoperative blood loss in emergency gastrointestinal surgery: a single-institution propensity score analysis,"The use of antithrombotic drugs is increasing with the aging population. Prior to elective procedures, antithrombotic drugs are often discontinued. For emergency procedures in patients taking antithrombotic drugs, their effect cannot be attenuated which may lead to an increased risk of hemorrhagic events. However, there are few studies showing increased intraoperative blood loss in patients taking antithrombotic drugs who undergo emergency gastrointestinal surgery.

Dense quark–gluon plasma in strong magnetic fields,"A non-perturbative (np) method of Field correlators (FCM) was applied to study QCD at temperatures above the deconfinement transition (\(1<T/T_c<3,~T_c\sim 0.16~\mathrm{GeV}\)) and nonzero baryon densities (baryon chemical potential \(\mu _B<0.5~\mathrm{GeV}\)) in an external uniform magnetic field (\(eB<0.5~\mathrm{GeV}^2\)). Within FCM, the np high-temperature dynamics is embodied in the Polyakov loop and in the Debye mass due to the Color-Magnetic confinement. Analytic expressions for quark pressure and magnetic susceptibility were obtained. The expressions were represented as series and in integral form. Magnetic susceptibility was found to increase rapidly with temperature and slowly with density. The results at the zero density limit are in agreement with lattice data."

Nitric oxide- induced AtAO3 differentially regulates plant defense and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana,"Exposure of plants to different environmental insults instigates significant changes in the cellular redox tone driven in part by promoting the production of reactive nitrogen species. The key player, nitric oxide (NO) is a small gaseous diatomic molecule, well-known for its signaling role during stress.

However, the biological roles of the majority of the WRKY family members remains poorly understood in soybean relative to the research progress in model plants."
In-plane stress development in sol–gel-derived titania and silica thin films on Si(100) substrates,"In order to study (i) how the in-plane stress develops in alkoxide-derived oxide gel films on heating and (ii) how the residual stress changes with firing temperature, we prepared titania and silica gel films on Si(100) wafers from alkoxide solutions. The intrinsic stress was previously measured in situ during heating up to 500 °C for the gel films, where the stress was calculated from the radius of curvature of the substrate bending. Because the commercialized apparatus that measures the substrate bending has an upper limitation of temperature at 500 °C, we devised a method for estimating the intrinsic stress over 500 °C in the present work. The gel films were heated from 100 °C up to 900 or 1000 °C successively and cumulatively. Then we estimated the intrinsic stress over 500 °C by monitoring the changes in stress in situ during heating and cooling for the cumulatively fired films. Combining the estimated data over 500 °C with those measured below 500 °C, we found that the intrinsic stress increases and then decreases around to zero with temperature for both titania and silica gel films, which we recognized as a general trend in alkoxide-derived oxide thin films in conjunction with our previous work on yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) films. Regarding the residual stress, the titania and silica films exhibited different behaviors. The titania film showed an increase followed by a slight decrease, and finally a significant increase in residual tensile stress with increasing firing temperature. The silica films also exhibited an increase and a decrease in residual tensile stress with increasing firing temperature, but the stress continued to decrease and turned into compressive one at ca 800 °C. The last decrease in residual tensile stress that turned into compressive one resulted from the development of compressive thermal stress during cooling, which is due to the smaller thermal expansion coefficient of silica than silicon. It was thus clarified that the difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the film and the substrate becomes prominent in residual stress when the films are fired at high temperatures like 800 °C. Thus we could successfully obtain a general view on how the residual stress changes with firing temperature as well as on how the in-plane stress develops during heating thanks to the information on the stress development in the sol–gel-derived titania and silica films that was added to the information on the YSZ films."
Short-lived long noncoding RNAs as surrogate indicators for chemical stress in HepG2 cells and their degradation by nuclear RNases,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein-coding transcripts >200 nucleotides in length that have been shown to play important roles in various biological processes. The mechanisms underlying the induction of lncRNA expression by chemical exposure remain to be determined. We identified a novel class of short-lived lncRNAs with half-lives (t1/2) ≤4 hours in human HeLa Tet-off cells, which have been suggested to express many lncRNAs with regulatory functions. As they may affect various human biological processes, short-lived lncRNAs may be useful indicators of the degree of stress on chemical exposure. In the present study, we identified four short-lived lncRNAs, designated as OIP5-AS1, FLJ46906, LINC01137, and GABPB1-AS1, which showed significantly upregulated expression following exposure to hydrogen peroxide (oxidative stress), mercury II chloride (heavy metal stress), and etoposide (DNA damage stress) in human HepG2 cells. These lncRNAs may be useful indicators of chemical stress responses. The levels of these lncRNAs in the cells were increased because of chemical stress-induced prolongation of their decay. These lncRNAs were degraded by nuclear RNases, which are components of the exosome and XRN2, and chemical exposure inhibited the RNase activities within the cells."
Tuning PFKFB3 Bisphosphatase Activity Through Allosteric Interference,"The human inducible phospho-fructokinase bisphosphatase isoform 3, PFKFB3, is a crucial regulatory node in the cellular metabolism. The enzyme is an important modulator regulating the intracellular fructose-2,6-bisphosphate level. PFKFB3 is a bifunctional enzyme with an exceptionally high kinase to phosphatase ratio around 740:1. Its kinase activity can be directly inhibited by small molecules acting directly on the kinase active site. On the other hand, here we propose an innovative and indirect strategy for the modulation of PFKFB3 activity, achieved through allosteric bisphosphatase activation. A library of small peptides targeting an allosteric site was discovered and synthesized. The binding affinity was evaluated by microscale thermophoresis (MST). Furthermore, a LC-MS/MS analytical method for assessing the bisphosphatase activity of PFKFB3 was developed. The new method was applied for measuring the activation on bisphosphatase activity with the PFKFB3-binding peptides. The molecular mechanical connection between the newly discovered allosteric site to the bisphosphatase activity was also investigated using both experimental and computational methods."
Salt Mediated Self-Assembly of Poly(ethylene glycol)-Functionalized Gold Nanorods,"Although challenging, assembling and orienting non-spherical nanomaterials into two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) ordered arrays can facilitate versatile collective properties by virtue of their shape-dependent properties that cannot be realized with their spherical counterparts. Here, we report on the self-assembly of gold nanorods (AuNRs) into 2D films at the vapor/liquid interface facilitated by grafting them with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Using surface sensitive synchrotron grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) and specular X-ray reflectivity (XRR), we show that PEG-AuNRs in aqueous suspensions migrate to the vapor/liquid interface in the presence of salt, forming a uniform monolayer with planar-to-surface orientation. Furthermore, the 2D assembled PEG functionalized AuNRs exhibit short range order into rectangular symmetry with side-by-side and tail-to-tail nearest-neighbor packing. The effect of PEG chain length and salt concentration on the 2D assembly are also reported."
Switching of multi-state magnetic structures via domain wall propagation triggered by spin-orbit torques,"Spin-orbit torques emerge as a promising method for manipulating magnetic configurations of spintronic devices. Here, we show that these torques can induce a magnetization reversal via domain wall propagation which may open new ways in developing novel spintronic devices and in particular in realizing high-density multi-level magnetic memory. Our devices are bi-layer heterostructures of Ni0.8Fe0.2 on top of β-Ta patterned in the form of two or three crossing ellipses which exhibit in the crossing area shape-induced biaxial and triaxial magnetic anisotropy, respectively. We demonstrate field-free switching between discrete remanent magnetic states of the structures by spin-orbit torques induced by flowing electrical current through one of the ellipses. We note switchings induced by the coupling between the ellipses where current flowing in one ellipse triggers a reversal in a neighboring ellipse which propagates from the center outwards. Numerical tools successfully simulate the observed coupling-induced switching using experimentally extracted parameters."
Exogenous and endogenous microbiomes of wild-caught Phormia regina (Diptera: Calliphoridae) flies from a suburban farm by 16S rRNA gene sequencing,"The black blow fly, Phormia regina (Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) is one of the most abundant carrion flies in North America. Calliphorids are important in agriculture and animal production, veterinary sciences, forensics and medical entomology. While the role of flies in the epidemiology of human and animal diseases is an active area of research, little is known about the microorganisms associated with these insects. We examined the diversity of wild-caught black blow fly endogenous (internal body) and exogenous (external body) microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Overall, 27 phyla, 171 families and 533 genera were detected, and diversity was significantly higher (P < 0.05) on external body surfaces. At the genus level, Dysgonomonas, Ignatzschineria, Acinetobacter, Vagococcus, Myroides, and Wohlfahrtiimonas were predominant. Cloning and sequencing of nearly full-length fragments of the 16S rRNA gene showed that some of the species identified are known to be pathogenic to humans, animals, and plants. Myroides odoratimimus and Acinetobacter radioresistens are well-known, multi-drug resistant bacteria. These results provide a snapshot of the microbial communities harbored by adult black blow flies and call for more comprehensive studies to better characterize the role these flies may play in the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms."
Inflammation as a predictor of acute kidney injury and mediator of higher mortality after acute kidney injury in non-cardiac surgery,"This retrospective cohort study examined the roles of inflammation in acute kidney injury (AKI). Serum albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were used as markers of inflammation. Adults who underwent non–cardiac surgery from 2007 to 2011 were included. Exclusion criteria were urological surgery, obstetric surgery, missing data, and pre-operative dialysis. Subjects were followed until the end of 2015 or loss to follow-up. Associations between pre–operative albumin or CRP and post-operative AKI or association between AKI and mortality were examined by logistic or Cox regression, respectively. Mediation analyses were performed using albumin and CRP as mediators. Among 4,538 subjects, 272 developed AKI. Pre-operative albumin was independently associated with AKI (odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.63 [0.48–0.83]). During a median follow-up of 4.5 years, 649 died. AKI was significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI]: 1.58 [1.22–2.04]). Further adjustment for pre-operative albumin and CRP attenuated the association (HR [95% CI]: 1.28 [0.99–1.67]). The proportions explained by mediating effects of lnCRP and albumin were 29.3% and 39.2% and mediation effects were statistically significant. In conclusion, inflammation is a predictor of AKI and a mediator of mortality after AKI. Interventions targeting inflammation might improve outcomes of AKI."
Serum circular RNAs act as blood-based biomarkers for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most common hereditary heart diseases and is associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death. HCM is characterized by pronounced hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes, fiber disarray and development of fibrosis and can be divided into a non-obstructive (HNCM) and obstructive form (HOCM) therefore requiring personalized therapeutic therapies. In the present study, we investigated the expression patterns of several circulating circular RNAs (circRNAs) as potential biomarkers in patients with HCM. We included 64 patients with HCM and 53 healthy controls to the study and quantitatively measured the expression of a set of circRNAs already known to be associated with cardiac diseases (circDNAJC6) and/or being highly abundant in blood (circTMEM56 and circMBOAT2). Abundancy of circRNAs was then correlated to relevant clinical parameters. Serum expression levels of circRNAs DNAJC6, TMEM56 and MBOAT2 were downregulated in patients with HCM. The inverse association between circRNA levels and HCM remained unchanged even after adjusting for confounding factors. All circRNAs, evaluated separately or in combination, showed a robust discrimination capacity when comparing control subjects with HCM, HNCM or HOCM patients (AUC from 0.722 to 0.949). Two circRNAs, circTMEM56 and circDNAJC6, significantly negatively correlated with echocardiographic parameters for HOCM. Collectively, circulating circRNAs DNAJC6, TMEM56 and MBOAT2 can distinguish between healthy and HCM patients. In addition, circTMEM56 and circDNAJC6 could serve as indicators of disease severity in patients with HOCM. Thus, circRNAs emerge as novel biomarkers for HCM facilitating the clinical decision making in a personalized manner."
"Distinct climate influences on the risk of typhoid compared to invasive non-typhoid Salmonella disease in Blantyre, Malawi","Invasive Salmonella diseases, both typhoid and invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS), are seasonal bloodstream infections causing important morbidity and mortality globally in Africa. The reservoirs and transmission of both are not fully understood. We hypothesised that differences in the time-lagged relationships of rainfall or temperature with typhoid and iNTS incidence might infer differences in epidemiology. We assessed the dynamics of invasive Salmonella incidence over a 16-year period of surveillance, quantifying incidence peaks, seasonal variations, and nonlinear effects of rainfall and temperature exposures on the relative risks of typhoid and iNTS, using monthly lags. An increased relative risk of iNTS incidence was short-lasting but immediate after the onset of the rains, whereas that of typhoid was long-lasting but with a two months delayed start, implying a possible difference in transmission. The relative-risk function of temperature for typhoid was bimodal, with higher risk at both lower (with a 1 month lag) and higher (with a ≥4 months lag) temperatures, possibly reflecting the known patterns of short and long cycle typhoid transmission. In contrast, the relative-risk of iNTS was only increased at lower temperatures, suggesting distinct transmission mechanisms. Environmental and sanitation control strategies may be different for iNTS compared to typhoid disease."
Health-promoting phytochemicals and antioxidant capacity in different organs from six varieties of Chinese kale,"Chinese kale (Brassica oleracea var. alboglabra) has high nutritional value. This study investigated the contents of glucosinolates, antioxidants (chlorophylls, carotenoids, vitamin C, and total phenolics), and antioxidant capacity in five organs from six varieties of Chinese kale. The highest concentrations of individual and total glucosinolates were in the roots and inflorescences, respectively. The highest levels of antioxidants and antioxidant capacity were in inflorescences and leaves. Plant organs played a predominant role in glucosinolate and antioxidant accumulation. Glucoiberin, glucoraphanin, and glucobrassicin, the main anticarcinogenic glucosinolates, could be enhanced simultaneously because of their high positive correlations. The relationship between glucosinolates and antioxidant capacity indicated that glucobrassicin might contribute to the total antioxidant capacity. These results provide useful information related to consumption, breeding of functional varieties, and use of the non-edible organs of Chinese kale."
Incidence of invasive breast cancer in women treated with testosterone implants: a prospective 10-year cohort study,"Testosterone implants have been used for over eighty years to treat symptoms of hormone deficiency in pre and postmenopausal women.

SnSe2 nanocrystals coupled with hierarchical porous carbon microspheres for long-life sodium ion battery anode,"Tin selenides have been attracting great attention as anode materials for the state-of-the-art rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity and low cost. However, they deliver unsatisfactory performance in practice, owing to their intrinsically low conductivity, sluggish kinetics and volume expansion during the charge-discharge process. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of SnSe2 nanocrystals coupled with hierarchical porous carbon (SnSe2 NCs/C) microspheres for boosting SIBs in terms of capacity, rate ability and durability. The unique structure of SnSe2 NCs/C possesses several advantages, including inhibiting the agglomeration of SnSe2 nanoparticles, relieving the volume expansion, accelerating the diffusion kinetics of electrons/ions, enhancing the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte and improving the structural stability of the composite. As a result, the as-obtained SnSe2 NCs/C microspheres show a high reversible capacity (565 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1), excellent rate capability, and long cycling life stability (363 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles), which represent the best performances among the reported SIBs based on SnSe2-based anode materials."
Age-related changes of cholestanol and lathosterol plasma concentrations: an explorative study,"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) and Lathosterolosis represent two treatable inherited disorders of cholesterol metabolism that are characterized by the accumulation of cholestanol and lathosterol, respectively. The age of the patients suspected of having these disorders is highly variable due to the very different phenotypes. The early diagnosis of these disorders is important because specific therapeutic treatment could prevent the disease progression. The biochemical diagnosis of these defects is generally performed analyzing the sterol profile."
Association between egg consumption and elevated fasting glucose prevalence in relation to dietary patterns in selected group of Polish adults,"The safety of high egg intake in view of its impact on glucose metabolism remains inconclusive.

Time course of neuropathological events in hyperhomocysteinemic amyloid depositing mice reveals early neuroinflammatory changes that precede amyloid changes and cerebrovascular events,"Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are the second leading cause of dementia behind only Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, VCID is commonly found as a co-morbidity with sporadic AD. We have previously established a mouse model of VCID by inducing hyperhomocysteinemia in both wild-type and amyloid depositing mice. While we have shown the time course of neuropathological events in the wild-type mice with hyperhomocysteinemia, the effect of amyloid deposition on this time course remains unknown; therefore, in this study, we determined the time course of neuropathological changes in our mouse model of hyperhomocysteinemia-induced VCID in amyloid depositing mice."
How do FDI and technical innovation affect environmental quality? Evidence from China,"Foreign direct investment (FDI) is an important driving force for economic growth and technological innovation, but it also brings environmental pollution problems along with economic development. From the perspective of technological innovation, the impact of FDI on China’s environmental pollution deserves further study. With the spatial econometric tools employed to account for the potential spatial dependence of environmental pollution, this study uses the panel data of 30 province-level units in China from 1998 to 2016 to investigate the impact of FDI and technological innovation on environmental pollution. The results show that increased FDI can reduce environmental pollution, confirming the existence of the “pollution halo hypothesis”; technological innovation can reduce the emissions of sulfur dioxide and smoke dust but increase the chemical oxygen demand. Therefore, vigorous introduction of foreign capital is good for sustainable development for government, but it is also necessary to pay attention to screening and identifying environment-friendly enterprises with advanced production technology and management experience and to reject high-pollution and high-energy-consuming enterprises eliminated by developed countries."
"Multiple environmental factors analysis of flash flood risk in Upper Hanjiang River, southern China","Identifying the environmental factors and analyzing the causal mechanism of flash floods help to manage the risk. Maximum 24-h precipitation (MP), digital elevation (DE), slope degree (SD), soil type (ST), drainage density (DD), and vegetation cover (VC) are selected as the risk factors of flash floods in this study. Precipitation is the important meteorological components in flash floods; thus spatial characteristics of precipitation trend have been analyzed by using Mann-Kendall tests, and a positive trend of precipitation in Upper Hanjiang River is detected. Then, association rule mining approach is proposed to investigate the multiple environmental factors of flash floods, in which both single and multiple dimension data mining have been conducted by Apriori algorithm. Considering the high rate of 5-year return period floods in the flash flood inventory, further association rule mining after sampling has been conducted in order to deeply mine the causal patterns of flash floods in different risk magnitudes. Results show that soil type, slope degree, and digital elevation are the dominant environmental factors of flash floods in the study area, and precipitation is one of the important causal factors in severe flash flood hazards. It is also highlighted that flash floods might easily occur even with a slight rainfall present due to the instability of sand clay and saturated soil moisture. The proposed novel use of field data and data mining has the potential for providing procedures and solutions for an effective interpretation of flash flood mechanism. The results are expected to be applicable for decision-making and sustainable management in flooding risk."
Concomitant febuxostat enhances methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity by inhibiting breast cancer resistance protein,"Methotrexate (MTX) is an antifolate agent used for the treatment of various malignancies and is eliminated by breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Because febuxostat (FBX) is known to inhibit BCRP activity, FBX might exacerbate MTX-related adverse effects. In this study, we examined the drug-drug interaction between FBX and MTX in BCRP-expressing membrane vesicles. Moreover, we retrospectively investigated the impact of FBX on MTX-related adverse effects in 38 patients (144 cycles) receiving high-dose MTX therapy (HDMTX). The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database and human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 cells were used to evaluate the effects of FBX on MTX-induced hepatotoxicity. In the membrane vesicle study, FBX significantly inhibited BCRP-mediated transport of MTX. Concomitant FBX significantly increased the incidence of hepatotoxicity, but not of nephrotoxicity and hematological toxicity in patients receiving HDMTX. FAERS database analyses revealed that the reporting odds ratio of FBX for MTX-induced hepatotoxicity was 4.16 (95% CI: 2.89–5.98). Co-incubated FBX significantly decreased the cell viability and increased cytotoxicity in MTX-treated HepG2 cells. These findings suggest that concomitant FBX enhances MTX-induced hepatotoxicity by inhibiting hepatic BCRP. These findings provide important information for the safe management of HDMTX therapy in clinical settings."
A metrological approach to the analysis of choroidal thickness by optical coherence tomography 3D scans in myopia research,"In myopia research, changes of choroidal thickness in response to optically induced signals serve as predictor for changes in axial length that might be correlated with myopia progression. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides a tool for imaging the choroid, however, with certain difficulties because of a limited visibility of the scleral-choroidal interface. Considering the previously reported effect sizes of thickness change in human myopia research, this study investigated the repeatability of automated 3D choroidal segmentation across the macular area of 6 × 6 mm2. Fifteen subjects underwent nine volume scans in two OCT devices with analysis of the 95% interval of repeatability, intersubject and intrasubject variations, as well as interdevice agreement. Repeatability generally improved with increasing eccentricity from the fovea. The nasal perifoveal region exhibited the best repeatability with ±19 and ±21 μm in both OCT devices, whereas the subfovea showed a repeatability of ±57 and ±44 μm, respectively. High inter- and intrasubject variations were observed, together with a negative bias in the device agreement. Although there is still limited data on thickness changes of the nasal choroid, future studies could focus more on measuring the effect size in the nasal perifoveal area to account for metrological issues in choroidal segmentation."
Protease Responsive Essential Amino-Acid Based Nanocarriers for Near-Infrared Imaging,"Delivery of the theranostic agents with effective concentration to the desired sites inside the body is a major challenge in disease management. Nanotechnology has gained attention for the delivery of theranostic agents to the targeted location. The use of essential amino-acid based homopolymers for the synthesis of biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) could serve as a nanocarrier for delivery applications. In this study, poly-l-lysine (PLL) and salts were used to fabricate the NPs for the delivery of exogenous contrast agents. Here, indocyanine green (ICG) was encapsulated within these NPs, and a simple two-step green chemistry-based self-assembly process was used for the fabrication. The morphological and biochemical characterizations confirm the formation of ICG encapsulating spherical PLL NPs with an average diameter of ~225 nm. Further, a detailed study has been carried out to understand the role of constituents in the assembly mechanism of PLL NPs. Our results show a controlled release of the ICG from PLL NPs in the presence of the proteolytic enzyme. In-vitro cellular studies suggest that the PLL NPs were readily taken up by the cells showing their superior delivery efficiency of ICG in comparison to the free-form of the ICG."
Adaptation of muscle activation after patellar loading demonstrates neural control of joint variables,"We evaluated whether the central nervous system (CNS) chooses muscle activations not only to achieve behavioral goals but also to minimize stresses and strains within joints. We analyzed the coordination between quadriceps muscles during locomotion in rats before and after imposing a lateral force on the patella. Vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis (VM) in the rat produce identical knee torques but opposing mediolateral patellar forces. If the CNS regulates internal joint stresses, we predicted that after imposing a lateral patellar load by attaching a spring between the patella and lateral femur, the CNS would reduce the ratio between VL and VM activation to minimize net mediolateral patellar forces. Our results confirmed this prediction, showing that VL activation was reduced after attaching the spring whereas VM and rectus femoris (RF) activations were not significantly changed. This adaptation was reversed after the spring was detached. These changes were not observed immediately after attaching the spring but only developed after 3–5 days, suggesting that they reflected gradual processes rather than immediate compensatory reflexes. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that the CNS chooses muscle activations to regulate internal joint variables."
Using transfer learning from prior reference knowledge to improve the clustering of single-cell RNA-Seq data,"In many research areas scientists are interested in clustering objects within small datasets while making use of prior knowledge from large reference datasets. We propose a method to apply the machine learning concept of transfer learning to unsupervised clustering problems and show its effectiveness in the field of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). The goal of scRNA-Seq experiments is often the definition and cataloguing of cell types from the transcriptional output of individual cells. To improve the clustering of small disease- or tissue-specific datasets, for which the identification of rare cell types is often problematic, we propose a transfer learning method to utilize large and well-annotated reference datasets, such as those produced by the Human Cell Atlas. Our approach modifies the dataset of interest while incorporating key information from the larger reference dataset via Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). The modified dataset is subsequently provided to a clustering algorithm. We empirically evaluate the benefits of our approach on simulated scRNA-Seq data as well as on publicly available datasets. Finally, we present results for the analysis of a recently published small dataset and find improved clustering when transferring knowledge from a large reference dataset. Implementations of the method are available at https://github.com/nicococo/scRNA."
In Utero Exposure to Glucocorticoids and Pubertal Timing in Sons and Daughters,"Early pubertal timing has been associated with adult diseases, and identifying preventable causes is of importance. In utero exposure to exogenous glucocorticoids, has been associated with changes in the reproductive hormonal axes in the children, which may influence pubertal timing. Exogenous glucocorticoids can be indicated for diseases such as asthma, allergy, skin diseases, as well as muscle and joint diseases. The aim was to explore the association between in utero exposure to glucocorticoids and pubertal timing in the children. This population-based study was conducted in the Puberty Cohort including 15,819 children, which is a sub-cohort of the Danish National Birth Cohort. Information on maternal glucocorticoid treatment was collected through interviews during pregnancy. Information on pubertal timing was obtained by questionnaires every 6 months throughout puberty, including Tanner Stages, axillary hair, acne, voice break, first ejaculation and menarche. The potential impact of confounding by indication was explored by stratifying on indication and treatment status. Overall, 6.8% of the children were exposed to glucocorticoids in utero. Exposure to glucocorticoids in utero was not associated with earlier puberty for neither boys nor girls with combined estimates of 0.4 months (95% CI: –1.5; 2.2) and –0.7 months (95% CI: –2.5; 1.2)."
Characterization and functional roles of paternal RNAs in 2–4 cell bovine embryos,"Embryos utilize oocyte-donated RNAs until they become capable of producing RNAs through embryonic genome activation (EGA). The sperm’s influence over pre-EGA RNA content of embryos remains unknown. Recent studies have revealed that sperm donate non-genomic components upon fertilization. Thus, sperm may also contribute to RNA presence in pre-EGA embryos. The first objective of this study was to investigate whether male fertility status is associated with the RNAs present in the bovine embryo prior to EGA. A total of 65 RNAs were found to be differentially expressed between 2–4 cell bovine embryos derived from high and low fertility sires. Expression patterns were confirmed for protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 36 (PPP1R36) and ataxin 2 like (ATXN2L) in three new biological replicates. The knockdown of ATXN2L led to a 22.9% increase in blastocyst development. The second objective of this study was to characterize the parental origin of RNAs present in pre-EGA embryos. Results revealed 472 sperm-derived RNAs, 2575 oocyte-derived RNAs, 2675 RNAs derived from both sperm and oocytes, and 663 embryo-exclusive RNAs. This study uncovers an association of male fertility with developmentally impactful RNAs in 2–4 cell embryos. This study also provides an initial characterization of paternally-contributed RNAs to pre-EGA embryos. Furthermore, a subset of 2–4 cell embryo-specific RNAs was identified."
Cerebral Organoids Repair Ischemic Stroke Brain Injury,"Stroke is the second leading cause of death and main cause of disability worldwide, but with few effective therapies. Although stem cell-based therapy has been proposed as an exciting regenerative medicine strategy for brain injury, there are limitations. The developed cerebral organoids (COs) represent a promising transplantation source for stroke that remains to be answered. Here, we transplanted COs at 55 days and explored the feasibility in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke. COs transplantation at 6 h or even 24 h after MCAO significantly reduces brain infarct volume and improves neurological motor function. Transplanted COs show the potential of multilineage differentiation to mimic in vivo cortical development, support motor cortex region-specific reconstruction, form neurotransmitter-related neurons, and achieve synaptic connection with host brain via in situ differentiation and cell replacement in stroke. Cells from transplanted COs show extensive migration into different brain regions along corpus callosum. The mechanisms underlying COs transplantation therapy are also associated with enhanced neurogenesis, synaptic reconstruction, axonal regeneration and angiogenesis, and decreased neural apoptosis with more survival neurons after stroke. Moreover, COs transplantation promotes predominantly exogenous neurogenesis in the transplantation periphery of ipsilateral cortex and predominantly endogenous neurogenesis in the hippocampus and subventricular zone. Together, we demonstrate the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of COs transplantation in stroke. This preliminary but promising study provides first-hand preclinical evidence for COs transplantation as a potential and effective intervention for stroke treatment."

Herbal syrup from chicory and artichoke leaves ameliorate liver damage induced by deltamethrin in weanling male rats,"Pyrethroid insecticides are extensively used for control insects in both public health and agriculture sectors. Despite the important role of these insecticides, it caused adverse toxic effects on human, especially at the weanling stage. In this work, the antioxidant activity of chicory and artichoke leaves extracts, and phenolic flavonoid contents were studied. In addition, herbal syrup formulation and hepatoprotective effect against oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and liver damage induced by deltamethrin in weanling male rats were investigated. Both extracts have high phenolic, flavonoid contents, and antioxidant activity. Deltamethrin reduced body and liver weights of weanling rats. It induced oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and altered liver function enzymes. It caused a histopathological alteration in liver tissue. Supplementation of herbal syrup improved the above changes via increase body weights, antioxidant enzymes, and decrease lipid peroxidation, and enhanced histopathological profile. It can be concluded that herbal syrup of chicory and artichoke leaves extracts can ameliorate liver damage induced by deltamethrin. Herbal syrup from agriculture wastes of chicory and artichoke leaves is considered an easy, economical, and useful formulation for protecting agriculture workers against the adverse effects induced by pyrethroid insecticides especially in poor rural in developing countries where pyrethroid insecticides are applied for control vector-borne diseases and insects in agriculture."

"Beyond the flow rate: the importance of thermal range, flow intensity, and distribution for water-efficient showers","Studies show that user behaviours have not necessarily changed, despite the prevalence of water-efficient products in the market. One reason is because the technical emphasis for delivering the water use efficiency of products has focused on reducing the flow rate. Therefore, this study was undertaken to examine the physical parameters that define the technical efficiency of showerheads against the experiential performance (and therefore the satisfaction with the showerheads). These parameters were measured in a controlled laboratory environment and the findings were triangulated against user feedback from in-home trials. Synergies between the laboratory data and user feedback were found. Notably, it was found that water spray intensity, distribution, and temperature loss all impact the quality of showering experience. These factors also influence shower duration—and thus the volume of water used in the shower. Significantly, these technical metrics affected the overall experiential performance of such products from the users’ perspective. Therefore, the design of water-efficient showerheads, in addition to delivering water discharge savings, should avoid poor spray distribution, intensity, and heat retention. The implications of the findings are that water efficiency labelling and product standards should extend beyond the emphasis on limiting the flow rates—typically to 9 l per min for showerheads. This study shows good merit for including the spray intensity (pressure), distribution, and degree of heat loss, in addition to the discharge rate, as part of the performance and efficiency considerations of showerheads."
Analyse der Wirksamkeit des Harninkontinenzmanagements in einer geriatrischen Rehabilitationsklinik,"Harninkontinenz ist ein weitverbreitetes gesundheitsrelevantes Problem, welches insbesondere im Alter auftritt.

The Indispensability of Knowledge,Nuno Venturinha holds that the contextualist epistemology adumbrated in Wittgenstein’s On Certainty--the most powerful response to philosophical skepticism yet developed-- falls short of providing a complete answer to Cartesian radical skepticism about knowledge of the external world. I argue that Venturinha underestimates the range and complexity of Wittgenstein’s epistemological. He does so because he reads Wittgenstein along the lines of so-called ‘hinge epistemology’. Hinge epistemology indeed fails as a diagnosis of skepticism. But it also fails as a reading of Wittgenstein. A more adequate understanding of Wittgenstein suggests that Venturinha’s pessimistic conclusion can be avoided.
Venturinha and Epistemic Vertigo,"This paper critically explores Nuno Venturinha’s (2018) discussion of the Wittgensteinian notion of epistemic vertigo in the context of the radical sceptical problematic, at least as that notion has been recently articulated by Duncan Pritchard (e.g., 2016)."

VariFAST: a variant filter by automated scoring based on tagged-signatures,"Variant calling and refinement from whole genome/exome sequencing data is a fundamental task for genomics studies. Due to the limited accuracy of NGS sequencing and variant callers, IGV-based manual review is required for further false positive variant filtering, which costs massive labor and time, and results in high inter- and intra-lab variability."
Multi-cancer samples clustering via graph regularized low-rank representation method under sparse and symmetric constraints,"Identifying different types of cancer based on gene expression data has become hotspot in bioinformatics research. Clustering cancer gene expression data from multiple cancers to their own class is a significance solution. However, the characteristics of high-dimensional and small samples of gene expression data and the noise of the data make data mining and research difficult. Although there are many effective and feasible methods to deal with this problem, the possibility remains that these methods are flawed."
Curcumin analogs: synthesis and biological activities,"Curcumin has received great attention in the past three decades due to its versatile medicinal activities, which are attributed to the presence of certain functional groups in its structure. Despite this, the application of curcumin in therapy is limited by its poor aqueous solubility which results in low bioavailability, and also by its low chemical stability due to the keto-enol tautomerism. In this work, eight analogs of curcumin were synthesized starting from aminophenol to tackle these issues. Their chemical structures were characterized by detecting their IR, 1H-NMR, and 13C-NMR spectra. Biological studies were performed on the synthesized analogs using curcumin as a positive control. The tested activities included antioxidant capacity via DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity tests, preliminary antitumor activity by MTT test against MCF-7 and HeLa cancer cell lines, and antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumonia using disk diffusion technique. The results of antioxidant activity showed that the SC50 values of the synthesized analogs are closely related to the control, the same finding is reported in the preliminary antitumor activity. In the testing of antibacterial activity, the synthesized analogs displayed variable activities with a superior effect attributed to chloride-based analogs. In the course of performing these tests, it could be deduced that both stability and solubility of the analogs were improved in comparison with curcumin. It is proposed that such analogs with improved aqueous solubility may be useful guides to improve the therapeutic applications of curcumin."
Morphology and evolutionary significance of phosphatic otoliths within the inner ears of cartilaginous fishes (Chondrichthyes),"Chondrichthyans represent a monophyletic group of crown group gnathostomes and are central to our understanding of vertebrate evolution. Like all vertebrates, cartilaginous fishes evolved concretions of material within their inner ears to aid with equilibrium and balance detection. Up to now, these materials have been identified as calcium carbonate-bearing otoconia, which are small bio-crystals consisting of an inorganic mineral and a protein, or otoconial masses (aggregations of otoconia bound by an organic matrix), being significantly different in morphology compared to the singular, polycrystalline otolith structures of bony fishes, which are solidified bio-crystals forming stony masses. Reinvestigation of the morphological and chemical properties of these chondrichthyan otoconia revises our understanding of otolith composition and has implications on the evolution of these characters in both the gnathostome crown group, and cartilaginous fishes in particular."
Molecular differentiation of the Murraya paniculata Complex (Rutaceae: Aurantioideae: Aurantieae),Orange jasmine has a complex nomenclatural history and is now known as Murraya paniculata (L.) Jack. Our interest in this common ornamental stemmed from the need to resolve its identity and the identities of closely related taxa as hosts of the pathogen ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ and its vector Diaphorina citri. Understanding these microbe-vector-plant relationships has been hampered by taxonomic confusion surrounding Murraya at both the generic and specific levels.
Lose-of-Function of a Rice Nucleolus-Localized Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Is Responsible for the floury endosperm14 Mutant Phenotypes,"The endosperm of rice (Oryza sativa) has been usually used for the study of starch synthesis. Although several related factors have been revealed, other unknown members remain to be identified, given that starch synthesis is a complicated and sophisticated process."
Representations are adjoint to endomorphisms,"The functor that takes a ring to its category of modules has an adjoint if one remembers the forgetful functor to abelian groups: the endomorphism ring of linear natural transformations. This uses the self-enrichment of the category of abelian groups. If one considers enrichments into symmetric sequences or even bisymmetric sequences, one can produce an endomorphism operad or an endomorphism properad. In this note, we show that more generally, given a category  enriched in a monoidal category , the functor that associates to a monoid in  its category of representations in  is adjoint to the functor that computes the endomorphism monoid of any functor with domain . After describing the first results of the theory we give several examples of applications."
Age-related changes of cholestanol and lathosterol plasma concentrations: an explorative study,"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) and Lathosterolosis represent two treatable inherited disorders of cholesterol metabolism that are characterized by the accumulation of cholestanol and lathosterol, respectively. The age of the patients suspected of having these disorders is highly variable due to the very different phenotypes. The early diagnosis of these disorders is important because specific therapeutic treatment could prevent the disease progression. The biochemical diagnosis of these defects is generally performed analyzing the sterol profile."
SnSe2 nanocrystals coupled with hierarchical porous carbon microspheres for long-life sodium ion battery anode,"Tin selenides have been attracting great attention as anode materials for the state-of-the-art rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity and low cost. However, they deliver unsatisfactory performance in practice, owing to their intrinsically low conductivity, sluggish kinetics and volume expansion during the charge-discharge process. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of SnSe2 nanocrystals coupled with hierarchical porous carbon (SnSe2 NCs/C) microspheres for boosting SIBs in terms of capacity, rate ability and durability. The unique structure of SnSe2 NCs/C possesses several advantages, including inhibiting the agglomeration of SnSe2 nanoparticles, relieving the volume expansion, accelerating the diffusion kinetics of electrons/ions, enhancing the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte and improving the structural stability of the composite. As a result, the as-obtained SnSe2 NCs/C microspheres show a high reversible capacity (565 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1), excellent rate capability, and long cycling life stability (363 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles), which represent the best performances among the reported SIBs based on SnSe2-based anode materials."
Roles of transforming growth factor-β and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase isoforms in integrin β1-mediated bio-behaviors of mouse lung telocytes,"Telocytes (TCs) have the capacity of cell–cell communication with adjacent cells within the tissue, contributing to tissue repair and recovery from injury.

Upregulation of mitotic bookmarking factors during enhanced proliferation of human stromal cells in human platelet lysate,"Innovative human stromal cell therapeutics require xeno-free culture conditions. Various formulations of human platelet lysate (HPL) are efficient alternatives for fetal bovine serum (FBS). However, a consistent lack of standardized manufacturing protocols and quality criteria hampers comparability of HPL-products. Aim of this study was to compare the biochemical composition of three differential HPL-preparations with FBS and to investigate their impact on stromal cell biology."
Translational value of IDH1 and DNA methylation biomarkers in diagnosing lung cancers: a novel diagnostic panel of stage and histology-specificity,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and the timely and serial assessment of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in high-risk populations remains a challenge. Furthermore, testing a single biomarker for the diagnosis of lung cancers is of relatively low effectiveness. Thus, a stronger diagnostic combination of blood biomarkers is needed to improve the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)."

The purpose of this study was to perform a translation, cultural adaptation of the Polish version of the OSS and to evaluate its selected psychometric properties in patients after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair."
Travel time to health facilities in areas of outbreak potential: maps for guiding local preparedness and response,"Repeated outbreaks of emerging pathogens underscore the need for preparedness plans to prevent, detect, and respond. As countries develop and improve National Action Plans for Health Security, addressing subnational variation in preparedness is increasingly important. One facet of preparedness and mitigating disease transmission is health facility accessibility, linking infected persons with health systems and vice versa. Where potential patients can access care, local facilities must ensure they can appropriately diagnose, treat, and contain disease spread to prevent secondary transmission; where patients cannot readily access facilities, alternate plans must be developed. Here, we use travel time to link facilities and populations at risk of viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) and identify spatial variation in these respective preparedness demands."
The NASSS framework for ex post theorisation of technology-supported change in healthcare: worked example of the TORPEDO programme,"Evaluation of health technology programmes should be theoretically informed, interdisciplinary, and generate in-depth explanations. The NASSS (non-adoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, sustainability) framework was developed to study unfolding technology programmes in real time—and in particular to identify and manage their emergent uncertainties and interdependencies. In this paper, we offer a worked example of how NASSS can also inform ex post (i.e. retrospective) evaluation."
Patients’ perception of communication at the interface between primary and secondary care: a cross-sectional survey in 34 countries,"Poor communication between general practitioners (GPs) and medical specialists can lead to poorer quality, and continuity, of care. Our study aims to assess patients’ perceptions of communication at the interface between primary and secondary care in 34 countries. It will analyse, too, whether this communication is associated with the organisation of primary care within a country, and with the characteristics of GPs and their patients."
HiSSI: high-order SNP-SNP interactions detection based on efficient significant pattern and differential evolution,"Detecting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) interactions is an important and challenging task in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Various efforts have been devoted to detect SNP interactions. However, the large volume of SNP datasets results in such a big number of high-order SNP combinations that restrict the power of detecting interactions."
A network clustering based feature selection strategy for classifying autism spectrum disorder,"Advanced non-invasive neuroimaging techniques offer new approaches to study functions and structures of human brains. Whole-brain functional networks obtained from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging has been widely used to study brain diseases like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Auto-classification of ASD has become an important issue. Existing classification methods for ASD are based on features extracted from the whole-brain functional networks, which may be not discriminant enough for good performance."
Region-based interaction detection in genome-wide case-control studies,"In genome-wide association study (GWAS), conventional interaction detection methods such as BOOST are mostly based on SNP-SNP interactions. Although single nucleotides are the building blocks of human genome, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are not necessarily the smallest functional unit for complex phenotypes. Region-based strategies have been proved to be successful in studies aiming at marginal effects."
A network view of microRNA and gene interactions in different pathological stages of colon cancer,"Colon cancer is one of the common cancers in human.

Use of natural language processing to improve predictive models for imaging utilization in children presenting to the emergency department,"To examine the association between the medical imaging utilization and information related to patients’ socioeconomic, demographic and clinical factors during the patients’ ED visits; and to develop predictive models using these associated factors including natural language elements to predict the medical imaging utilization at pediatric ED."
DeepFHR: intelligent prediction of fetal Acidemia using fetal heart rate signals based on convolutional neural network,"Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is a screening tool used by obstetricians to evaluate the fetal state. Because of the complexity and non-linearity, a visual interpretation of FHR signals using common guidelines usually results in significant subjective inter-observer and intra-observer variability. Objective: Therefore, computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems based on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology have recently been developed to assist obstetricians in making objective medical decisions."
AliClu - Temporal sequence alignment for clustering longitudinal clinical data,"Patient stratification is a critical task in clinical decision making since it can allow physicians to choose treatments in a personalized way. Given the increasing availability of electronic medical records (EMRs) with longitudinal data, one crucial problem is how to efficiently cluster the patients based on the temporal information from medical appointments. In this work, we propose applying the Temporal Needleman-Wunsch (TNW) algorithm to align discrete sequences with the transition time information between symbols. These symbols may correspond to a patient’s current therapy, their overall health status, or any other discrete state. The transition time information represents the duration of each of those states. The obtained TNW pairwise scores are then used to perform hierarchical clustering. To find the best number of clusters and assess their stability, a resampling technique is applied."
Exploring patient experiences with and attitudes towards hypertension at a private hospital in Uganda: a qualitative study,"Hypertension is the leading risk factor for mortality worldwide and is more common in sub-Saharan Africa than any other region. Work to date confirms that a lack of human and material resources for healthcare access contributes to this gap. The ways in which patients’ knowledge and attitudes toward hypertension determine their engagement with and adherence to available care, however, remains unclear."
Association between egg consumption and elevated fasting glucose prevalence in relation to dietary patterns in selected group of Polish adults,"The safety of high egg intake in view of its impact on glucose metabolism remains inconclusive.

C1 inhibitor in canine intravascular hemolysis (C1INCH): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) is a common disease that affects all breeds of dogs and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Intravascular hemolysis of erythrocytes in IMHA is caused by complement activation and is often fatal. No current treatments target complement activation in canine IMHA. Human C1 esterase (C1-INH) reduces canine complement-mediated hemolysis in vitro, and a recent pharmacokinetic analysis of an FDA licensed formulation of C1-INH in dogs confirmed that a 50 IU/kg dose of C1-INH is safe to administer to dogs, and effectively inhibits canine complement mediated hemolysis ex-vivo. The C1INCH randomized controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy of this drug in dogs with intravascular hemolysis."
Time course of neuropathological events in hyperhomocysteinemic amyloid depositing mice reveals early neuroinflammatory changes that precede amyloid changes and cerebrovascular events,"Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are the second leading cause of dementia behind only Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, VCID is commonly found as a co-morbidity with sporadic AD. We have previously established a mouse model of VCID by inducing hyperhomocysteinemia in both wild-type and amyloid depositing mice. While we have shown the time course of neuropathological events in the wild-type mice with hyperhomocysteinemia, the effect of amyloid deposition on this time course remains unknown; therefore, in this study, we determined the time course of neuropathological changes in our mouse model of hyperhomocysteinemia-induced VCID in amyloid depositing mice."

Investigating Various Factors Affecting the Long-Term Compressive Strength of Heat-Cured Fly Ash Geopolymer Concrete and the Use of Orthogonal Experimental Design Method,"This work quantified the hierarchy of the influence of three common mixture design parameters on the compressive strength and the rate of strength increase over the long term of low-calcium fly ash geopolymer concrete (FAGC) through designing 16 mixtures by the orthogonal experimental design (OED) method. The parameters used in the study were liquid to fly ash (L/FA) ratio, sodium hydroxide concentration (SHC) and sodium silicate solution to sodium hydroxide solution (SS/SH) ratio. The L/FA ratio showed little effect on compressive strength when it was varied from 0.40 to 0.52. SHC showed the greatest influence on compressive strength with little impact on the rate of strength increase after the initial heat curing. Even though the SS/SH ratio showed a small effect on the initial compressive strength, it had a considerable influence on the rate of strength increase over the long term. It was found that the compressive strength at 480 days was positively related to the Na2O/SiO2 molar ratio when it was varied from 0.49 to 0.80 and the Si/Al molar ratio was increased up to 1.87. Analysis of the failure types of specimens demonstrated that compressive strength of FAGC was associated with the strength of the mortar–aggregate interface zone (MAIZ)."
Synapse alterations precede neuronal damage and storage pathology in a human cerebral organoid model of CLN3-juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis,"The juvenile form of neuronal ceroid Lipofuscinosis (JNCL) is the most common form within this group of rare lysosomal storage disorders, causing pediatric neurodegeneration. The genetic disorder, which is caused by recessive mutations affecting the CLN3 gene, features progressive vision loss, cognitive and motor decline and other psychiatric conditions, seizure episodes, leading to premature death. Animal models have traditionally aid the understanding of the disease mechanisms and pathology and are very relevant for biomarker research and therapeutic testing. Nevertheless, there is a need for establishing reliable and predictive human cellular models to study the disease. Since patient material, particularly from children, is scarce and difficult to obtain, we generated an engineered a CLN3-mutant isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) line carrying the c.1054C → T pathologic variant, using state of the art CRISPR/Cas9 technology. To prove the suitability of the isogenic pair to model JNCL, we screened for disease-specific phenotypes in non-neuronal two-dimensional cell culture models as well as in cerebral brain organoids. Our data demonstrates that the sole introduction of the pathogenic variant gives rise to classical hallmarks of JNCL in vitro. Additionally, we discovered an alteration of the splicing caused by this particular mutation. Next, we derived cerebral organoids and used them as a neurodevelopmental model to study the particular effects of the CLN3Q352X mutation during brain formation in the disease context. About half of the mutation -carrying cerebral organoids completely failed to develop normally. The other half, which escaped this severe defect were used for the analysis of more subtle alterations. In these escapers, whole-transcriptome analysis demonstrated early disease signatures, affecting pathways related to development, corticogenesis and synapses. Complementary metabolomics analysis confirmed decreased levels of cerebral tissue metabolites, some particularly relevant for synapse formation and neurotransmission, such as gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). Our data suggests that a mutation in CLN3 severely affects brain development. Furthermore, before disease onset, disease -associated neurodevelopmental changes, particular concerning synapse formation and function, occur."
"α-Synuclein conformational strains spread, seed and target neuronal cells differentially after injection into the olfactory bulb","Alpha-synuclein inclusions, the hallmarks of synucleinopathies, are suggested to spread along neuronal connections in a stereotypical pattern in the brains of patients. Ample evidence now supports that pathological forms of alpha-synuclein propagate in cell culture models and in vivo in a prion-like manner. However, it is still not known why the same pathological protein targets different cell populations, propagates with different kinetics and leads to a variety of diseases (synucleinopathies) with distinct clinical features. The aggregation of the protein alpha-synuclein yields different conformational polymorphs called strains. These strains exhibit distinct biochemical, physical and structural features they are able to imprint to newly recruited alpha-synuclein. This had led to the view that the clinical heterogeneity observed in synucleinopathies might be due to distinct pathological alpha-synuclein strains."
Writing scale effects on raters: an exploratory study,"In writing assessment, finding a valid, reliable, and efficient scale is critical. Appropriate scales, increase rater reliability, and can also save time and money. This exploratory study compared the effects of a binary scale and an analytic scale across teacher raters and expert raters. The purpose of the study is to find out how different scale types impact rating performance and scores. The raters in this study rated twenty short EFL essays using the two scales, completed a rater cognition questionnaire, and took part in an in-depth interview. The ratings were analyzed using a multi-faceted Rasch analysis to compare essay scores and rater statistics across scales and rater groups. The results indicated when using the binary scale, the raters spent less time and were less spread out and more consistent in their ratings. Three out of four raters replied that less mental effort was required when using the binary scale and felt more confident in their ratings. Across the two rater groups, there was a bigger shift in rating performance when using the binary scale for the teacher raters than the expert raters. This implies that scale design had a greater effect on teacher raters. The overall findings suggest that the binary scale maybe a better fit for large scale assessment with sufficient rater training."
Standardized proficiency tests in a campus-wide English curriculum: a washback study,"Washback refers to the influence of tests on learning and teaching. To date, a number of studies have revealed that tests affect teaching content, course design, and classroom practices. However, in Asian higher education contexts, little research has examined the washback of proficiency tests on English learning in comparison with the efforts on teaching. Thus, the current study bridged this research gap by exploring the washback effects of a proficiency test on student learning in a campus-wide English curriculum, uncovering relationships between washback and learner characteristics such as major, gender, and proficiency level. A total of 694 students from engineering-, business-, and foreign language-related disciplines at a national university in Taiwan were surveyed. The results revealed washback effects on such aspects as personal image, learning motivation, emotion, and future job opportunities were especially salient. In addition, the relationship between washback and proficiency level was found to be statistically significant. However, male and female students did not differ statistically in washback nor was there a statistically significant difference in washback among different majors. With detailed information and consideration of different aspects of washback, stakeholders, including instructors, school administrators, and language policymakers, can make informed decisions when formulating language-related policies."
Extra upper limb practice after stroke: a feasibility study,There is a need to provide a large amount of extra practice on top of usual rehabilitation to adults after stroke.

Accessory mitral valve tissue that caused a left ventricular outflow tract obstruction: a case report,Accessory mitral valve tissue (AMVT) is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly and is usually diagnosed in childhood. The diagnosis of AMVT in adulthood is extremely rare. We present a case report on an adult patient with AMVT that caused a left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction.
Modern Chinese nationalism and the awakening of self-consciousness of the Chinese Nation,"The concept of “Chinese nation” has a close relationship with the rise, development and upsurge of modern Chinese nationalism from its proposition to establishment, and to universal identification among people of all ethnic groups. The period of the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China was the formation stage of modern Chinese nationalism and also the stage of the proposition and initial usage of the concept of “Chinese nation”: Modern Chinese nationalism developed around the period of the May 4th Movement. Under the impetus of the establishment of national self-determination theory, especially the rise of a national self-determination movement, the concept of “Chinese nation” was accepted and adopted by more and more people and finally established and formed. After the September 18th Incident, especially after the North China Incident and the July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the worsening national crisis promoted the upsurge of modern Chinese nationalism, and this upsurge made the concept of “Chinese nation” more widely and deeply disseminated and accepted."
"Characteristics of vegetation succession on the Pinus thunbergii forests in warm temperate regions, Jeju Island, South Korea","To investigate the trends of succession occurring at the Pinus thunbergii forests on the lowlands of Jeju Island, we quantified the species compositions and the importance values by vegetation layers of Braun-Blanquet method on the Pinus thunbergii forests. We used multivariate analysis technique to know the correlations between the vegetation group types and the location environmental factors; we used the location environment factors such as altitudes above sea level, tidal winds (distance from the coast), annual average temperatures, and forest gaps to know the vegetation distribution patterns."
Population genetic structure based on mitochondrial DNA analysis of Ikonnikov’s whiskered bat (Myotis ikonnikovi—Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae) from Korea,"Ikonnikov’s whiskered bat (Myotis ikonnikovi) is found throughout the Korean Peninsula, as well as in Kazakhstan, Russia, Mongolia, China, and Japan. It is small-sized and primarily inhabits old-growth forests. The decrease and fragmentation of habitats due to increased human activity may influence the genetic structure of bat populations. This study was designed to elucidate the population genetic structure of M. ikonnikovi using mitochondrial genes (cytochrome oxidase I and cytochrome b)."
Assessing the endocrine disrupting potentials and genotoxicity in environmental samples from Taiwanese rivers,"Surface waters receive a variety of organic pollutants via wastewater discharge, and sediment represents a sink for hydrophobic contaminants. In this study, we used in vitro yeast-based reporter gene assays and a Bacillus subtilis Rec-assay to examine the occurrence of endocrine disrupting activities and genotoxic potentials in samples collected from three Taiwanese rivers. Levels of 51 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in muscles of fish captured from same rivers were also analyzed to assess in vivo pollution of PAHs."
"Controlling the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) by releasing the predatory phytoseiid mites and pesticides on pepper in a greenhouse","Two programs for controlling the western flower thrips (WFT), Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), were evaluated. Greenhouse experiments were conducted for reducing F. occidentalis populations on pepper plants. The first program was by releasing four phytoseiid predacious mite species namely Neoseiulus arundonaxi (Metwally and Sanad), N. barkeri (Hughes), N. bicaudus (Wainstein), and Cydnoseius negevi (Swirski and Amitai) in the presence of blue sticky traps. The second one was by applying four sequential applications of different pesticides. Results showed that two releases of N. bicaudus, N. barkeri, and N. arundonaxi in the presence of the blue sticky traps reduced WFT population by 45 to 56%. The best control management of the WFT was by the following insecticides: chlorfenapyr, imidacloprid, azadirachtin, and agricultural potassium soap (third program)."
Description of Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Nematoda: Heterorhabditidae) isolated from hilly areas of Kashmir Valley,"Three strains of entomopathogenic nematodes, labelled P5, P6 and PH, were isolated during surveys of agricultural soils of Pir Panjal Range, using insect baiting technique. Morpho-taxometrical studies and molecular data confirmed that these isolates belong to Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, making this finding the first report of this species from Jammu and Kashmir, India. Their distribution using a meta-analysis of GenBank records was attempted to assess. The morphology, morphometric studies and molecular data were conspecific to original description with minor deviations. Data analysis of the distribution showed that H. bacteriophora was the most ubiquitous throughout the South Africa subcontinent, but it was rarely found in Indian subcontinent having been isolated from 3 states throughout the country. As these 3 strains of H. bacteriophora are native to the hilly region of Kashmir Valley, they can be exploited for the control of target crop insect pests of the region. However, further studies are required regarding their life cycle, host range, virulence potential and survival capacity under extreme environmental conditions."
"Efficiency of Bacillus thuringiensis strains and their Cry proteins against the Red Flour Beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst.) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae)","Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is one of the used bioagents in insect pest control. Its toxicity is largely due to the insecticide endotoxins (crystalline (Cry) proteins) that act selectively on insects and nematodes. The efficiency of 20 of the most common Coleopteran-specific Cry proteins of Bt strains was tested against third instar-larvae of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaeum (Herbst.) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). The primary screening results revealed that 11 Cry proteins (Cry8Ea, Cry8Fa, Cry1Ba, Cry8Ca, Cry1Fb, Cry1Ea, Cry1Ca, Cry55Aa, Cry9Da, Cry1Da, and Cry1Ia) were not toxic at all, 4 Cry proteins (Cry1Aa, Cry14Aa, Cry8Aa, and Cry7Ab) did not cause mortality but caused significant inhibition of growth, and 5 Cry proteins (Cry3Aa, Cry37Aa, Cry22Aa, Cry51Aa, and Cry3Ba) were toxic to T. castaneum larvae. The active 5 Cry proteins were used in the subsequent experiments. Five concentrations, being 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 g Cry protein/10 g diet were used against the third instar larvae, and their mortalities were estimated. The LC50 values of Cry3Aa, Cry37Aa, Cry22Aa, Cry51Aa, and Cry3Ba were 0.46, 0.77, 1.25, 1.45, and 1.60 g/10 g, respectively. While the LT50 values of the same Cry proteins (for the concentration 2 g/10 g diet) were 1.50, 1.93, 2.29, 2.23, and 4.22 days, respectively. The results indicated that Cry3Aa was the most active one against T. castaneum larvae. The results of the sublethal study showed that the application of LC30 value of the active 5 Cry proteins reduced total eggs laid daily per female within 2 weeks, where, the percent decrease in egg numbers were 50.55, 38.56, 31.31, 23.20, and, 18.10% for Cry3Aa, Cry37Aa, Cry22Aa, Cry51Aa, and Cry3Ba, respectively. In addition, the hatchability rate of eggs, the larval, and pupal durations of T. castaneum decreased, while the pre-ovipositional period was prolonged. Furthermore, the larvae fed on a diet containing LC30 concentrations of Cry protein showed lower glycogen and lipid rates and generally lower protein content than the control larvae. When T. castaneum larvae were treated by Cry proteins, the level of digestive enzymes found in the midgut was decreased. The present findings indicated that Bt strains/Cry proteins had significant potential for controlling T. castaneum"
"National progress, sustainability and higher goals: the case of Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness","The context of this study is the predominant global paradigm for measuring national progress, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which has resulted in an over-emphasis on production and consumption that in turn, is exhausting the planet’s capacity to sustain life. This study examines the potential for a new paradigm of development that can propel human society in a more meaningful, sustainable direction."

Status constraint and lifestyle transition: a latent class analysis of health-related lifestyles among different social strata in China,"The present study uses data from the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) to develop a multidimensional measure for the healthiness of Chinese citizens’ lifestyles. A latent class analysis reveals variety in Chinese people’s lifestyles. Three categories are identified: the healthy, the mixed, and the risky. People with higher socio-economic status (SES) are polarized between the healthy and the risky lifestyles, while those with lower SES tend to have a more mixed lifestyle. Generally speaking, Chinese people’s lifestyles are in constant change. Located in an advantageous social-structural position, members of the upper strata manage to choose the lifestyle beneficial to their health. At the same time, however, they are influenced by western lifestyles. Members of the lower strata are more constrained by social-structural status."

"Evaluation of the biological activity of Moringa oleifera leaves extract after incorporating silver nanoparticles, in vitro study","Moringa oleifera is rich in various active phyto-constituents (tannins, sterols, terpenoids, flavonoids, saponins, anthraquinones, alkaloids, and vitamins) in addition to different minerals in its leaves and seeds. Presence of these constituents is responsible for the antioxidant activity and the ability to protect against oxidative damage. Based on measurements of the cytotoxic activities, M. oleifera leaves were found to be more effective than the plant seeds. Therefore, the plant leaves were selected for preparation of silver plant nano-extract during the present study."
Ultrasound angiology reference standards of fetal cerebroplacental flow in normal Egyptian gestation: statistical analysis of one thousand observations,"Doppler velocity assessment is the most frequently used method in clinical practice to identify fetal well-being, as it is considered as a non-invasive estimation of the fetus and feto-placental circulation. The aim of the current study is to establish longitudinal reference ranges for MCA and UA Doppler velocities, systolic-to-diastolic (S/D) ratio, resistive index (RI) and PI, and cerebroplacental ratio. The current study was a multicentric longitudinal study of 428 singleton pregnancies and 1284 observations.

Assessment of the follow-up interval changes of the less than 2 cm arterial phase enhancing hepatic nodules in correlation with Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) classification version 18 using contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the liver and the second leading cause of cancer death in the world. It is the only tumor that can be diagnosed by imaging only, without a need for histopathological confirmation. CT and MR are the imaging techniques that often allow making a definite diagnosis."
Delayed post-diuretic 18F-FDG PET/CT: can it help in determination of the best clinical decision for muscle invasive UB cancer patients?,"18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F FDG PET/CT) has been used previously in the staging of the bladder cancer patients. Its main role was to detect regional nodal metastatic spread as well as distant organ metastasis but it was limited in detection of the primary neoplasia and the local tumor recurrence in the urinary bladder due to the presence of excreted radiotracer in the urinary tract, masking the urinary bladder lesion and probably the adjacent small regional metastatic lymph nodes. The aim of this study was to highlight the efficacy of delayed post-diuretic 18F-FDG PET/CT in staging and restaging muscle invasive urinary bladder cancer (MIBC), allowing metabolic evaluation of the primary disease, in addition to detection of associated metastasis which in turn can help to determine the best clinical decision for patients. This prospective study included 35 patients with MIBC, divided into two main groups: group A (18 patients) coming for initial staging and group B (17 patients) coming for post-therapeutic assessment. All patients of both groups were analyzed by a multidisciplinary team and the clinical decisions before and after PET CT were analyzed."

Faucet aerators as a reservoir for Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii: a healthcare-associated infection outbreak in a neurosurgical intensive care unit,"On January 7, 2019, we observed an outbreak of healthcare-associated infection (HAI) caused by Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) in the neurosurgical intensive care unit (NSICU). A follow-up epidemiological investigation was conducted, and an emergency response was initiated. We aimed to study the clonal transmission of CRAB and its possible source."
"Distribution and morphology of the surface ruptures of the 2018 Donggala–Palu earthquake, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia","A large Mw 7.5 earthquake occurred at 18.03 on 28 September 2018 in the Donggala–Palu area of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, which triggered a tsunami, liquefaction, and landslides. A 160-km rupture zone was formed on the surface along the NS to NNW–SSE trending Palu–Koro fault (PKF) system through three regencies: Donggala, Palu, and Sigi. Obvious surface ruptures associated with the earthquake were not observed in the epicentral area. Surface ruptures with a small displacement of both sinistral and westerly downward slip components appear south of the epicentral area in the Donggala area. The event induced widespread subsidence of the Donggala coastal area on the west side of the rupture zone. Passing across the Palu bay, the rupture cuts through the urban area of Palu city and extends across alluvial fans along the western side of the Palu basin showing large displacements with a predominant sinistral slip up to 4.2 m and subordinate easterly downward slip components. Approximately 5 m of anomalously high vertical displacement with 3 m of horizontal displacement occurs in an extensional bend in the southern area of the Palu basin. In the Sigi valley, the rupture zone follows the previously known PKF trace showing predominant sinistral and subordinate easterly downward slip, of which displacement is 0.9 m sinistral and 0.5 m easterly downward at the site 60 km south of Palu city and gradually smaller toward the south. These distributions of rupture zones and displacements suggest that rupture of the 2018 earthquake unilaterally propagated southwards and resulted in the movement of the eastern side of the fault towards the NNW."
"Chronic oral administration of Passiflora incarnata extract has no abnormal effects on metabolic and behavioral parameters in mice, except to induce sleep","Although the number of prescriptions and dependence on sleeping pills are increasing, the associations with unexpected abnormal behaviors and metabolic diseases caused by the overuse of sleeping pills are not well understood. In particular, such as abnormal eating-behavior and the occurrence of metabolic disorders caused by psychological unstable states are reported. For this reason, herbal medicine, which has not had such side effects in recent years, is attracting attention as an alternative medicine/food for sleeping inducer. We have used ethanol extracts from Passiflora incarnata (PI) to steadily obtain positive effects on sleep and brain microenvironment. However, as mentioned earlier, sleep-inducing efficacy can only be used safely if the behavioral and metabolic abnormalities do not appear."

Despite endorsed attempts to identify the accelerating effects of different herpes viridea, such as HSV-1, HSV2, VZV and CMV on the deterioration of different kinds of malignancy, the relationship between these viruses and CRC have not successfully been understood. Taking advantages of these facts, we assessed the role of these viruses on CRC progression."
Study protocol of coaching end-of-life palliative care for advanced heart failure patients and their family caregivers in rural appalachia: a randomized controlled trial,"Heart failure (HF) afflicts 6.5 million Americans with devastating consequences to patients and their family caregivers. Families are rarely prepared for worsening HF and are not informed about end-of-life and palliative care (EOLPC) conservative comfort options especially during the end stage. West Virginia (WV) has the highest rate of HF deaths in the U.S. where 14% of the population over 65 years have HF. Thus, there is a need to investigate a new family EOLPC intervention (FamPALcare), where nurses coach family-managed advanced HF care at home."
The relationship between spinal pain and temporomandibular joint disorders in Korea: a nationwide propensity score-matched study,"Patients with temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD) often complain of pain in other areas.

Efficient production of α-acetolactate by whole cell catalytic transformation of fermentation-derived pyruvate,"Diacetyl provides the buttery aroma in products such as butter and margarine. It can be made via a harsh set of chemical reactions from sugarcane bagasse, however, in dairy products it is normally formed spontaneously from α-acetolactate, a compound generated by selected lactic acid bacteria in the starter culture used. Due to its bacteriostatic properties, it is difficult to achieve high levels of diacetyl by fermentation. Here we present a novel strategy for producing diacetyl based on whole-cell catalysis, which bypasses the toxic effects of diacetyl."

Remineralising agents are widely used to prevent WSLs formation and are the first-line treatment for existing WSLs. Previous systematic reviews have evaluated the effectiveness of remineralisation agents in the management of WSLs. However, their conclusions were contradictory. The objective of this study will be to compare the effectiveness and safety of current remineralising agents used in the management of WSLs in patients treated with fixed orthodontic appliances in any orthodontic setting."
Defining the function of SUMO system in pod development and abiotic stresses in Peanut,"Posttranslational modification of proteins by small ubiquitin like modifier (SUMO) proteins play an important role during the developmental process and in response to abiotic stresses in plants. However, little is known about SUMOylation in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), one of the world’s major food legume crops. In this study, we characterized the SUMOylation system from the diploid progenitor genomes of peanut, Arachis duranensis (AA) and Arachis ipaensis (BB)."
Long-Term Effects of Sheep Grazing in Various Densities on Marsh Properties and Vegetation Dynamics in Two Different Salt-Marsh Zones,"For conservation management of grassland ecosystems, an important question is under which conditions large grazers induce compositional and structural variation in plant communities, which is a prerequisite for high biodiversity. Here we used two long-term projects on the mainland salt marshes of the Wadden Sea to test the hypothesis that long-term grazing management with different stocking densities results in plant communities with distinctively different plant species composition and vegetation structure. The two projects took place on a low clayey and a high sandy salt marsh with different stocking densities of sheep: 0, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5 and the initially 10 sheep ha−1, where measurements were collected 11, 15, 19 and 23 years after the start of the project. Moreover, grazers affect abiotic conditions by reducing soil-redox potential and surface elevation, thereby driving composition and structure of salt-marsh vegetation. On the low salt marsh, a continued high stocking density (10 sheep ha−1) resulted in succession from the early-successional Puccinellia maritima community to the late-successional Atriplex portulacoides community. On the high salt marsh, the early-successional Festuca rubra community was maintained under all stocking densities. Cessation of grazing resulted in succession to the Elytrigia atherica community in both salt-marsh types. Intermediate stocking densities (1.5, 3 or 4.5 sheep ha−1) resulted in a mosaic of tall vegetation and patches of lawn, i.e. short-grazed vegetation, where Puccinellia maritima lawn occurred interspersed with patches of the Festuca rubra and tall Elytrigia atherica communities in both salt-marsh types. Effects of grazers were influenced by the presence of watering points near the sea wall. To conclude, our results show how joint interactions between grazers and abiotic conditions drive vegetation diversity and heterogeneity, with implications for ecosystem functions and services such as wildlife biodiversity and coastal protection."
The use of response surface methodology for improving fatty acid methyl ester profile of Scenedesmus vacuolatus,"The present study has been designed to optimise certain important process parameters for Scenedesmus vacuolatus to achieve efficient carbon dioxide extenuation as well as suitable fatty acid profile in context to improve biodiesel properties. The effect of varying sodium bicarbonate concentration was evaluated in single and multicomponent system such as nitrate, phosphate, inoculum size to observe interactive effects on algae biomass production, carbon dioxide (CO2) removal efficiency and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profile. Maximum biomass productivity of 117.0 ± 7.7 mg/L/day with 3 g/L of sodium bicarbonate was obtained i.e. approximately 2 folds higher than the control. Under multicomponent exposure, maximum biomass of 1701.5 ± 88.8 mg/L and maximum chlorophyll concentration of 15.3 ± 6.4 mg/L were achieved on 14th day at 3 g/L sodium nitrate, 0.1 g/L dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, 2 g/L of sodium bicarbonate and initial cell density of 0.3 (N3P0.1B2OD0.3). FAME content of 46.1 mg/g of biomass was obtained at this combination which is approximately 3 folds higher than the FAME content obtained under nitrogen and phosphate deprivation (16.6 mg/g at N0P0B2OD0.3). Confocal microscopy images confirmed the results with enhanced lipid droplet accumulation at high bicarbonate concentration as compared with the control. This interactive study concluded the variability in FAME profile along with the exposure to varying nutrient concentrations."
Research on the influence of land use change to habitat of cranes in Shengjin Lake wetland,"Shengjin Lake wetland reserve is an important habitat for the winter cranes of our country, and the change of land use structure in the area have had a vital influence on the winter cranes and their habitat. The TM remote sensing images of 1986–2015 years were selected in this paper, and the land use change model and gray relational analysis model were used to analyze the effect of land use degree on the habitat of the winter crane and correlation degree between cranes and land use of Shengjin lake wetland. The land use transformation method was employed to analyze the transfer of the habitat of cranes and the relationship between the size of the cranes habitat and the number of populations. The results showed that the degree of land use change fluctuated greatly in different periods, and comprehensive index of land use degree between 220 and 260, also the land use was based on woodland, grassland, and water and their effect on the habitat was limited; the marsh land had the highest retention rate among the cranes habitat being 34.44%. While the reed flat had the lowest rate, only 15.36%, and the reed breach land was mainly transferred to marsh and dry land, 23.22% and 18.16%, respectively. The mud was mainly transferred to water and farmland, respectively, for 31.79% and 27.75%; except the period from 2011 to 2015, the change of habitat area was basically consistent with the change of the number of cranes."

The cost-effectiveness of pegaspargase versus native asparaginase for first-line treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: a UK-based cost-utility analysis,"L-asparaginase is a key component of treatment for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in the UK. Commonly used forms of asparaginase are native E. coli-derived asparaginase (native asparaginase) and pegaspargase in first-line combination therapy, and native Erwinia chrysanthemi-derived asparaginase (Erwinia asparaginase) as second-line treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pegaspargase versus native asparaginase in first-line combination therapy for patients with newly diagnosed ALL. A combined decision tree and health-state transition Markov cost-effectiveness model was developed to assess the relative costs and health outcomes of pegaspargase versus native asparaginase in the UK setting."
A re-evaluation of LINE-1 ORF2 expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells,"We previously examined expression of Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1) in a variety of prostate cancer cells including hormone-dependent LNCaP cells.

Kallistatin inhibits tumour progression and platinum resistance in high-grade serous ovarian cancer,"Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecologic malignancy. Although there are various subtypes of ovarian cancer, high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) accounts for 70% of ovarian cancer deaths. Chemoresistance is the primary reason for the unfavourable prognosis of HGSOC. Kallistatin (KAL), also known as SERPINA4, is part of the serpin family. Kallistatin has been discovered to exert multiple effects on angiogenesis, inflammation and tumour progression. However, the roles and clinical significance of kallistatin in HGSOC remain unclear. Here, we showed that kallistatin was significantly downregulated in HGSOC compared to normal fallopian tube (FT) tissues. Low expression of kallistatin was associated with unfavourable prognosis and platinum resistance in HGSOC. Overexpression of kallistatin significantly inhibited proliferation and metastasis, and enhanced platinum sensitivity and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that kallistatin serves as a prognostic predictor and provide a potential therapeutic target for HGSOC."

Effects of industry structures on water quality in different urbanized regions using an improved entropy-weighted matter-elementmethodology,"Urbanization and industrialization significantly impact water quality, and detecting the specific factors which influence water quality change would greatly improve urban water environment management. In this study, an improved entropy-weighted matter-element method is used to assess the variations of water quality in two regions with different levels of urbanization in the Yangtze River Delta. Redundancy analysis was used to detect the effects of different industries on water quality. Results show that (1) an improved entropy weight-based matter-element method measures weights of pollutants and water quality levels more reliably and accurately; (2) the improvement rate of water quality in highly urbanized regions is 42.9% during 2005–2014 which is 17.2% higher than that in regions with low urbanization; (3) a decreasing concentration of total phosphorus is the main reason for changes of water quality in both regions, with decreasing concentrations of permanganate index and ammonium nitrogen having a strong influence on changes of water quality in the highly urbanized regions; (4) the decreasing proportion of fishery and heavy industries and the increasing proportion of the tertiary industries significantly influence water quality in highly urbanized regions while the decreasing proportion of animal husbandry is the most important factor influencing the changes of water quality in lowly urbanized regions."
Removal of organic micropollutants from biologically treated greywater using continuous-flow vacuum-UV/UVC photo-reactor,"Despite growing apprehension regarding the fate of organic micropollutants (MPs) of emerging concern, little attention has been paid to their presence in domestic greywater, where they mainly originate from personal care products. Many MPs are not fully removed in conventional greywater treatments and require additional treatment. Vacuum-UV radiation (VUV) can generate ·OH in situ, via water photolysis, initiating advanced oxidation process (AOP) without any chemical addition. Despite growing interest in VUV-based AOP, its performance in real-life grey- or wastewater matrices has hardly been investigated. The present study investigates the removal of triclosan (TCS) and oxybenzone (BP3), common antibacterial and UV-filter MPs, in deionized water (DIW) and in treated greywater (TGW) using combined UVC/VUV or UVC only radiation in a continuous-flow reactor. Degradation kinetics of these MPs and their transformation products (TPs) were addressed, as well as bacterial growth inhibition of the resulting reactor’s effluent. In DIW, MP degradation was much faster under the combined UVC/VUV irradiation. In TGW, the combined radiation successfully removed both MPs but at lower efficiency than in DIW, as particles and dissolved organic matter (DOM) acted as radical scavengers. Filtration and partial DOM removal prior to irradiation improved the process efficiency and reduced energy requirements under the combined radiation (from 1.6 and 167 to 1.1 and 6.0 kWh m−3·ּorder−1 for TCS and BP3, respectively). VUV radiation also reduced TP concentrations in the effluent. As a result, bacterial growth inhibition of triclosan solution irradiated by VUC/VUV was lower than that irradiated by UVC light alone, for UV dose > 120 mJ cm−2."
Rabbit VX2 lung tumor models can form early nodal metastases,"The rabbit squamous cell cancer line, VX2, has been used to generate various tumor models in rabbits. It is notable for its ability to generate nodal metastases. However, the timing and extent of nodal metastases vary by primary inoculation site and methodology. The development of metastases specifically in lung cancer models has not been well-described. We sought to characterize the generation of nodal metastases in rabbit transbronchial VX2 lung tumor models."
"Health insurance coverage, type of payment for health insurance, and reasons for not being insured under the National Health Insurance Scheme in Ghana","Ghana’s National Health Insurance Scheme has improved access to care, although equity and sustainability issues remain.

Tools and best practices for retrotransposon analysis using high-throughput sequencing data,"Sequencing technologies give access to a precise picture of the molecular mechanisms acting upon genome regulation. One of the biggest technical challenges with sequencing data is to map millions of reads to a reference genome. This problem is exacerbated when dealing with repetitive sequences such as transposable elements that occupy half of the mammalian genome mass. Sequenced reads coming from these regions introduce ambiguities in the mapping step. Therefore, applying dedicated parameters and algorithms has to be taken into consideration when transposable elements regulation is investigated with sequencing datasets."
Case report: a rapid review approach used by the UK National Screening Committee to inform recommendations on general population screening for vasa praevia,"The UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) reviews evidence about existing or potential population screening programmes using rapid review products called evidence summaries.

Palliative home parenteral nutrition in patients with ovarian cancer and malignant bowel obstruction: experiences of women and family caregivers,"Malnutrition is a problem in advanced cancer, particularly ovarian cancer where malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a frequent complication. Parenteral nutrition is the only way these patients can received adequate nutrition and is a principal indication for palliative home parenteral nutrition (HPN). Giving HPN is contentious as it may increase the burden on patients. This study investigates patients’ and family caregivers’ experiences of HPN, alongside nutritional status and survival in patients with ovarian cancer and MBO."
Navigation-assisted suture anchor insertion for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair,Suture anchor placement for subscapularis repair is challenging. Determining the exact location and optimum angle relative to the subscapularis tendon direction is difficult because of the mismatch between a distorted arthroscopic view and the actual anatomy of the footprint. This study aimed to compare the reliability and reproducibility of the navigation-assisted anchoring technique with conventional arthroscopic anchor fixation.

Effect of laser texturing on the performance of ultra-hard single-point cutting tools,"This paper investigates the cutting performance and anti-adhesive properties of textured single-point polycrystalline diamond (PCD) cutting tools in machining Aluminium 6082 alloys. The micro/nano textures were first milled using a fibre laser (1064-nm wavelength) at different power intensities, feed speeds and pulse durations, and finally characterised using scanning electron microscopy, white light interferometry and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The effect of different textures on the cutting performance was investigated in turning tests under dry cutting conditions. The test was stopped at regular lengths of cut to allow analysis of height of adhesion through 3D white light interferometry. The data processing of the cutting forces and the microscopical characterisation of the tested cutting tools enabled the evaluation of the effects of texture design, friction coefficient and adhesive properties. The results indicated that feed force in tools with grooves perpendicular to the chip flow direction (CFD) was more stable (20–40 N) than the benchmark (6–41 N). Similarly, the thrust force for tools with grooves parallel to CFD and grooves perpendicular to CFD showed a homogeneous trend fluctuating between 60 and 75 N as compared with the benchmark (ranging between 73 and 90 N). For texture depth in the order of 260 nm and post process roughness in the order of tens of nanometers, a reduction of average friction coefficient (0.28 ± 0.14) was reported when using lasered inserts with grooves parallel to the chip flow direction compared with the benchmark tools (0.34 ± 0.26) corroborated by reduced stiction of workpiece material on the rake face. In machining via textured tools with grooves perpendicular to CFD, the cutting forces were reduced by 23%, and the surface quality of the machined workpiece was improved by 11.8%, making this geometry the preferred choice for finishing applications. Using grooves parallel to CFD reduced the cutting forces by 11.76%, adhesion by 59.36% and friction coefficient by 14.28%; however, it increased the surface roughness of the machined workpiece, making this geometry suitable for roughing operations. For the first time, laser manufacturing is proposed as a flexible technique to functionalise the geometrical and wear properties of PCD cutting tools to the specific applications (i.e. roughing, finishing) as opposed to the standard industrial approach to use microstructurally different PCDs (i.e. grain size and binder %) based on the type of operation."
Satellite-Observed Chlorophyll-a Concentration Variability and Its Relation to Physical Environmental Changes in the East Sea (Japan Sea) from 2003 to 2015,"The spatio-temporal variability of the chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration in the East Sea (Japan Sea) (EJS) was investigated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data over 13 years from 2003 to 2015 to understand the impact of physical environmental changes on low-trophic level marine ecosystems. The chl-a images were composited to produce gridded monthly chl-a images using a weighted average method after applying a speckle removal algorithm to each path image. Missing pixels without any satellite observations because of cloud coverage were objectively filled using three-dimensional optimal interpolation. The first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) mode of the monthly chl-a images, accounting for 14% of the total variance, showed higher eigenvectors values in the eastern part of the EJS and distinct annual peaks each spring. The amplitudes of the first EOF mode, despite the dominant year-to-year variations in chl-a, tended to increase during spring over time. The recent 13-year trend of chl-a showed differences between the southwestern part and the northeastern part of the EJS, and this difference clearly appeared in the monthly trend maps for March and April. The eastern coast of Korea showed a highly positive trend during summer, particularly during August. The changes in chl-a over the decade were related to the physical environmental changes in sea surface wind, mixed layer depth, and stratification of upper sea water in the EJS."
Campylobacter in wintering great tits Parus major in Poland,"Domestic and wild mammals, domestic birds and particularly wild birds are considered to be reservoirs of many species of Enterobacteriaceae, and also important human enteric pathogens, e.g., the bacteria of the genus Campylobacter that occur in their digestive tracts. These species may be vectors of antimicrobial resistance dissemination in the environment, because they may have contact with an environment contaminated with antibiotics. Bird feeders have been suggested as potential dispersal centres between wild wintering birds whose feeding is supported by humans. Therefore, we checked for the presence of Campylobacter bacteria among great tits Parus major, the most common bird species on bird feeders in Poland. Samples (n = 787 cloacal swabs) were collected in urban and rural areas of Poland. Bacterial species were identified using multiplex PCR, and 23 (2.9%) positive tests for Campylobacter spp. were found; in ten samples, C. jejuni was detected. The odds ratio of Campylobacter infection in rural birds was over 2.5 times higher than urban birds. Ten samples with C. jejuni were tested for antibiotic resistance, and all were sensitive to azithromycin, erythromycin and gentamycin, while six isolates were resistant to tetracycline, and five were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Four Campylobacter isolates were resistant to both these antibiotics."
"Ellagic acid ameliorates lung damage in rats via modulating antioxidant activities, inhibitory effects on inflammatory mediators and apoptosis-inducing activities","Phytochemicals is considered one of the most effective and safe alternative therapy against oxidative linked lung diseases. Ellagic acid (EA), an important component of fruits, nuts, and vegetables, are partly responsible for their beneficial health effects against oxidation-related diseases. In the present study, we investigated the ameliorative effect of EA on lung damage induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in Wistar male albino rats. Thirty-six male rats (n = 36, 8-week old) were divided into 4 groups, each with 9 rats. The groups were: Control group: received standard diet; EA group: administered with EA (10 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal); CCl4 group: administered with CCl4 (1.5 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal); EA+CCl4 group: administered with EA and CCl4. . The rats were decapitated at the end of experimental period of 8 weeks and the lung tissues were examined. CCl4-induced rats showed elevation in the expressions of inflammatory proteins, nuclear factor kappa b (NF-κB), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α); and the indicator of lipid peroxidation, malondialdehyde (MDA). Intraperitoneal administration of EA significantly reduced the levels of these markers. EA administration increased the protein expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and enhanced the activity of glutathione (GSH) and catalase enzyme (CAT). In addition, EA administration increased the expression levels of the executioner protein of apoptosis, caspase-3, and decreasing pro-survival protein, B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2). In conclusion, these results establishes the protective role of EA in the treatment of lung damage and that in the future, this may have the potential to be used as a medication for the prevention or attenuation of lung diseases."
Mechanism of phosphorus mobility in sediments with larval (Propsilocerus akamusi) bioturbation,"The effects of chironomid larval (Propsilocerus akamusi) bioturbation on sediment phosphorus (P) mobility were studied over the course of 34 days using the indoor larval cultivation method on in situ sediment cores. High-resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper) and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) techniques were used to record fine-scale changes of soluble and DGT-labile P and iron (Fe) concentrations in the sediment. The larval-driven irrigation of the overlying water into their burrows significantly increased the oxygen penetration depth (OPD) and redox state (Eh) in sediments. In addition, the soluble and DGT-labile P and Fe decreased with the increase of OPD and Eh in larval-bioturbated sediments. The greatest decrease in the mean concentration of SRP, soluble Fe, and DGT-labile P in the Propsilocerus group was observed on Day 15 of the experiment, with a decrease by over half of the mean concentration of the control group. Furthermore, two-dimensional measurements of DGT-labile P concentration showed notable reductions of DGT-labile P around larval burrows. The DGT-induced fluxes in sediments (DIFS) model also exhibited a much longer response time (420 s) and a much higher rate of P adsorption (0.002 s−1) in the bioturbation sediments than those in the control sediments (116 s and 0.009 s−1, respectively). A significant correlation was shown for DGT-labile P and DGT-labile Fe. We conclude that Fe(II) oxidation and its enhanced adsorption were the major mechanisms responsible for the decrease of soluble and DGT-labile P in sediments."
Health risk assessment of heavy metals in cosmetic products sold in Iran: the Monte Carlo simulation,"Cosmetics can contain harmful compounds such as heavy metals. Several metals have a cumulative effect on the body, especially fatty tissues, and may have different health effects on the human body over the long term. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to assess the health risks of heavy metals in cosmetics in Iran. Also, in this study, Monte Carlo simulation was used to investigate uncertainties. In this study, heavy metals data of cosmetics were extracted from studies carried out at intervals 2010–2018. International and Iranian databases such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, Springer, Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, Irandoc, Magiran, Scientific Information Database (SID), and Information Institute for Scientific (ISC) were searched for this purpose. In this study, the index of the Margin of Safety was calculated to determine the risk of human contact with metallic impurities in cosmetic products used by humans. In the selected period, 11 studies were conducted on the measurement of heavy metals in cosmetics in Iran. In these studies, cosmetics such as eye shadow, eye pencil, powder, cream, and lipstick were studied. The Margin of Safety (MoS) values calculated for different metals were higher than the established safe standard by WHO. The highest and lowest amount of systemic exposure dosage in all types of cosmetic investigated (lipstick, cream, eye pencil, face powder, and eye shadow) was related to Fe and Hg. The mean hazardous quotient (HQ) for Cd, Cr, Ni, Cu, Mn, Zn, Pb, and Hg was 1.05E-03, 1.03E-01, 7.95E-03, 2.59E-03, 1.05E-03, 4.98E-03, 7.22E-04, 1.85E-01, and 1.35E-05, respectively. The highest HQ (6.10E-01) was found for Pb, which was observed in the cream."
Anthropogenic mercury contamination in sediments of Krka River estuary (Croatia),"Coastal and estuarine sediments play an important role in the biogeochemical cycle of mercury (Hg) in the aquatic environment. When contaminated, sediments can act as a potential source of Hg and may pose a long-term risk to aquatic biota. The aim of this research was to assess spatial and historical distribution of Hg in the sediments of the Krka River estuary, an environment that so far has been regarded as relatively unpolluted. To achieve this goal, 40 surface sediment samples and 7 sediment cores were collected along the entire estuary. Hg concentrations in the surface and deep sediments of the Krka River estuary were found in a broad range 0.042–57.8 mg kg−1, demonstrating significant spatial and temporal differences in Hg input to the estuarine sediments. Two distinct areas were distinguished; upper estuary where the Hg content was comparable to other unpolluted Adriatic sediments, and the lower estuary where sediment profiles reflected the history of anthropogenic Hg input associated with the city of Šibenik. The vertical Hg profile from the most affected area of the estuary, combined with 210Pb and 137Cs dating, demonstrated that a significant increase of Hg input started in late 1940s/early 1950s, mainly related to shipyard activities. This study provided more insight on the Hg concentration in the Krka River estuary, demonstrating that the high values obtained, although localized, were comparable to the ones found in some of the most contaminated sites in the Mediterranean."
Fluoride-induced rectal barrier damage and microflora disorder in mice,"Intestinal microflora plays a key role in maintaining the homeostasis between immune and host health. Here, we reported the fluoride-induced changes of rectal structure and microflora in mice. The morphology of rectal tissue was observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The rectal development parameters (the thickness of mucosa, intestinal gland and muscle layer) were evaluated. The proliferation of rectal epithelial cells was evaluated via BrdU labeling. The distribution of goblet, glycoprotein and mast cell were evaluated by specific staining. Rectal microflora was detected using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that the rectal structure was seriously damaged and the proliferation of rectal epithelial cells was significantly inhibited by fluoride. The distribution of goblet cells, glycoprotein and mast cells decreased significantly after fluoride exposure. The relative richness of microfloras was changed after fluoride treatment, such as increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes. In summary, this study indicated that excessive fluoride damages the intestinal structure, disturbs the intestinal micro-ecology and causes intestinal microflora disorder in mice. Findings mentioned in the present study enrich a new scope for elucidating fluoride toxicity from intestinal homeostasis."
Structured cobalt oxide catalysts for VOC abatement: the effect of preparation method,"Magnetron sputtering was employed for the deposition of cobalt oxide thin films on stainless steel meshes. Catalysts prepared by sputtering in inert and oxidation atmosphere were compared with those obtained by electrochemical deposition and hydrothermal synthesis. Systematic characterization using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, N2 physisorption, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen allowed detailed monitoring of their physicochemical properties. Ethanol gas-phase oxidation was employed as a model reaction to reveal the catalytic performance of the catalysts. It was shown that the catalyst prepared by magnetron sputtering in oxidation atmosphere exhibited the best mechanical stability among all studied catalysts. Moreover, its catalytic activity was 18 times higher than that of pelletized commercial cobalt oxide."
