Understanding Evaluations of Foreigners in Modern South Africa: The Relationship Between Subjective Wellbeing and Xenophobia,"Recent and recurrent violence against immigrants in South Africa highlight the prevalence of xenophobia in the country. Is there a relationship between attitudes towards immigrant sentiment and life satisfaction at the individual level in that nation? Life satisfaction could be a proxy for anxiety, social alienation or insecurity which may be driving xenophobic sentiment. Using data from the 2013 South African Social Attitudes Survey, this paper examines the relationship between attitudes towards immigrants and life satisfaction (measured using the Personal Wellbeing Index). The study focuses exclusively on the attitudes of the country’s Black African majority. Bivariate and multivariate analysis found that life satisfaction did not have a strong relationship with pro-immigrant sentiments. Objective measures of socio-economic status (such as educational attainment) did not have a significant relationship with attitudes towards immigrants. Although improving subjective wellbeing among Black Africans is a worthwhile policy goal in of itself, the findings of this study suggest that addressing xenophobia among this group will require focus on other areas. Intergroup contact, interracial attitudes and perceptions about the consequences of immigration were found to be stronger predictors of pro-immigrant sentiment than life satisfaction. There was some evidence of `outsider solidarity ‘in the study—isiTsonga speakers and members of the ethnolinguistic Black African minority were more pro-immigrant in sentiment than other groups. The implications of this finding on the study of pro-immigration attitudes are discussed in the conclusion."
Black Patients with Colorectal Cancer Have More Advanced Cancer Stage at Time of Diagnosis: A Community-Based Safety-Net Hospital Experience,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Disparities in access to care contribute to advanced CRC stage at diagnosis, and these disparities are most pronounced among underserved populations and ethnic minorities. We aim to evaluate race/ethnicity-specific disparities in CRC stage at diagnosis among an ethnically diverse, urban safety-net hospital. We retrospectively evaluated all adult CRC patients diagnosed from January 1, 2009 to October 1, 2015. CRC cases were confirmed by histopathology specimens from biopsies and/or surgical resection. CRC staging utilized American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging systems and were stratified by race/ethnicity. Multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to evaluate disparities in AJCC stage at presentation (stage 3–4 vs. stage 0–2). Among 311 patients with CRC [51.5% male, 25.3% black, 18.7% Hispanic, 32.0% Asian, and mean age at diagnosis 58.1 years (SD 10.3)] 61.4% had advanced ACC stage 3–4 CRC at diagnosis. Among black patients with CRC, 73.3% had AJCC stage 3–4 cancer at time of diagnosis. On multivariate regression, blacks were nearly four times more likely to have advanced AJCC stage 3–4 CRC at diagnosis compared to whites (OR 3.70; 95% CI 0.97–14.11; p = 0.055). Among a diverse underserved population, over 60% of CRC were AJCC stage 3–4 at diagnosis, and nearly 75% of blacks with CRC had AJCC stage 3–4 at diagnosis. Advanced stage CRC at diagnosis limits options for potentially curative therapies, and increases the risk for cancer recurrence and mortality."
Long-Time Simulations of Nonlinear Schrödinger-Type Equations using Step Size Exceeding Threshold of Numerical Instability,"We propose an exponential time-differencing method based on the leapfrog scheme for numerical integration of the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger-type equations. The key advantage of the proposed method over the widely used Fourier split-step method is that in the new method, numerical instability at high wavenumbers is strongly suppressed. This allows one to use time steps that considerably exceed the instability threshold, which leads to a proportional reduction of the computational time. Moreover, we introduce a technique that eliminates numerical instability at low-to-moderate wavenumbers that is common for methods based on the leapfrog scheme. We illustrate the performance of the proposed method with examples from two applications areas: deterministic wave turbulence and solitary waves."
Misbeliefs About Gambling in a Convenience Sample from the General Population,"We examined knowledge about the role of randomness in gambling and the principle of independence of events, in a community sample. We also investigated whether this knowledge varies according to gender and age. A convenience sample of 1257 residents in French-speaking Switzerland, aged 18–88 years (28.5% of women) completed a short online questionnaire. This assessed the perceived role of human skills in four different games as well as beliefs relating to the principle of independence of events. The results show that 19.5% of the respondents perceived Roulette as a game for which the outcome is determined by skill. They also showed that 15.1% of the respondents did not hold beliefs about the independence of events principle. Gender and age differences were also observed: Men were proportionally more likely to hold erroneous beliefs about gambling skills and the independence of events, compared to women. The 18–25 year-old age group attributed Roulette outcomes to the gambler’s skill more frequently than the older categories. The implications of these findings for prevention and social support are discussed."
Protic Ionic Liquid Assisted Synthesis and Characterization of Ferromagnetic Cobalt Oxide Nanocatalyst,"Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanocatalyst was synthesized by sol-gel method using the protic ionic liquid namely 1-butylimidazolium glycolate as solvent and stabilizer. The obtained Co3O4 nanocatalyst was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared, High resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), Selected area electron diffraction, UV–Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Photoluminescence spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area and Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Powder XRD results showed the well-crystalline cubic structure of synthesized Co3O4 with size of 19.29 nm. Also, the sphere-like morphology of Co3O4 nanocatalyst was confirmed by HR-SEM and HR-TEM images. Furthermore, the synthesized Co3O4 nanocatalyst possessed optical band gap values of 1.75 and 2.46 eV and hence acted as a semiconducting material. In addition, the presence of small hysteresis loop in Magnetic measurement (VSM) confirmed the ferromagnetic nature of Co3O4 nanoparticles. Moreover, the synthesized Co3O4 nanocatalyst found to be used in photo-catalytic degradation of methylene blue and exhibited 94.61% efficiency."

The truncation of a cage graph,"The modern nanotechnology applies various cage molecules having a polyhedral shape. Topologically, a polyhedron is represented by its map. Since such a map is a plane graph, one may apply various graph-theoretical methods also for studying polyhedra. Of similar use are molecular (multi)tori. The surface of a multitorus is locally plane and allows one to apply much the same mathematical methods. This text is an introduction into the spectral theory of truncated cage graphs and truncated multitori. It anticipates further extensions."
Effects of social media on consumers’ purchase decisions: evidence from Taobao,"Given the rapid growth of social media, it is important to understand the effects of social media on consumers’ purchase decisions in the e-commerce environment. However, although some e-commerce sites have started to link themselves to social media to enhance user interactions, previous studies of social media and service management have shed little light on the effects of social media on consumers’ purchase decisions. This study proposes a theoretical research model that includes social media factors, social impact transfer factors, and e-commerce outcome factors. We posit social interaction ties and social media commitment as key elements of social media. An online questionnaire was conducted to test the research model and hypotheses based on survey data collected from Taobao, the largest e-commerce site in China. The analysis results indicate that social interaction ties have significant positive effects on social impact transfer factors and trust in online vendor, whereas they do not directly influence visit intention. Social media commitment plays a crucial role in increasing social impact transfer factors and e-commerce outcomes. The findings reveal the different effects of normative and informational social influences on consumer purchase decisions. Further implications are discussed."
The ecology of diamond sourcing: from mined to synthetic gems as a sustainable transition,"Luxury goods such as gemstones constitute a challenge for moving towards a sustainable society. From a purely bio-economic perspective, such goods consume planetary resources to provide a human “want” rather than a “need”. However, their extraction or manufacturing also provides important livelihoods for communities along the supply chain and hence contribute towards development outcomes. Comparing mined versus synthetic gems can provide consumers with important benchmarks on choice. The energy usage and emissions in mined versus lab-created diamonds was evaluated, based on industrial data, since these two factors are often a general indicator of environmental impact that can be useful in product comparisons. Depending on the process and the location of the mine, the data can be highly divergent and cannot be used as a singular measure of environmental impact. There is a need to develop life cycle analysis techniques from industrial ecology to conduct a detailed comparison of synthetic versus mined stones. Informed consumers could help to transition this luxury good towards a mix of mined and synthetic gems that best meet ecological and social metrics of sustainability."
FPGA-realization of a self-tuning PID controller for X–Y table with RBF neural network identification,"Based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology, a realization of a servo/motion control system with the self-tuning PID controller for X–Y table is presented in this work. Firstly, to cope with the system and external load uncertainly, a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF NN) is applied to identify the dynamic model of the X-axis table and Y-axis table and to provide the information to adjust the PID controller gains. Then, the design of an FPGA-based motion control IC for X–Y table using the aforementioned controller is described. The motion controller IC includes two modules. The first module, which performs two PMSM’s position servo controllers for X–Y table, is implemented by hardware in FPGA. The position servo controller adopts self-tuning PID controller with RBF NN identification. The second module, which runs the motion trajectory planning for X–Y table, is implemented by software in Nios II processor. As the result, the hardware/software co-design technology can make the motion controller of X–Y table more compact, robust, flexible, and less cost."

This study assesses the benefits and effectiveness of utilizing Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS), a school based intervention, with Spanish speaking, Latino youth residing in New Orleans, Louisiana, in effort to address presenting symptoms of trauma and depression."
Impact of laser pulse duration on the reduction of intraocular pressure during selective laser trabeculoplasty,"To evaluate the efficacy of selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), normal tension glaucoma (NTG) or ocular hypertension (OHT), when performed with laser pulse duration of 1 ns compared with standard 3–5 ns."
Research on Google’s brand performance,"Google has developed an extremely high profitability during the past 5 years. The paper takes a research on how Google’s strategies and tactics incorporated consumer expectations, and aims at measuring and interpreting brand performance of Google. According to the research, Google remains the leading position in its core service-the search engine by using brand audit though faced with serious competition. The goal of the paper is to giving suggestions that Google need to continue its innovation in its website contribution and remain the high quality of searches to gain competitive power to attract advertisers. Considering to the failure in China and the drastic competition with Yahoo! in Japan, to sustain and reoccupy the search engine market, Google should keep strong relationship with the governments in its targeting markets, especially in Asia."
Managing QoS degradation of partner web services: A proactive and preventive approach,"In the service oriented paradigm, a software solution is a composition of individual web services. These web services, also called partner services, contribute not only to realize the functional capabilities of the software solution but also determine its Quality of Service (QoS). A partner web service operates in a dynamic environment, and hence is vulnerable to failures, or suffers from QoS degradation. The failure of a partner web service compromises QoS of service based solution. Therefore, a research challenge arises as to how to manage web services which suddenly disappear at the time of execution or stop performing as expected. Several solutions exist for run time monitoring of the partner web services so that when QoS values of some of them degrade, the software solution can be adapted and executed using alternative web services with better QoS. But these solutions are confined either to client side or to provider side. In this paper, we propose a solution which is distributed between the clients and the service providers. It is a software agent based framework that prevents invocation of partner web services with degraded QoS. The experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution in a dynamic runtime environment."

Some examples have been exhibited to substantiate our certain claims.
Incidence of bradycardia in pediatric patients receiving dexmedetomidine anesthesia: a meta-analysis,"Background Dexmedetomidine, an α2-receptor agonist, provides potent sedation, analgesia, and anxiolysis without respiratory depression and is used in a variety of surgical and procedural situations. Aim of the review The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of bradycardia in pediatric patients who received dexmedetomidine as a sole agent for any procedural, intensive care or surgical sedation. Method Literature was searched in electronic databases and studies were selected by following pre-determined eligibility criteria. Meta-analyses were carried out by pooling the percent incidence of bradycardia to attain a weighted overall effect size. Age-wise subgroup analyses and meta-regression analyses for the identification of factors affecting the incidence were also performed. Results Data of 2835 patients from 21 studies were included. The mean age was 62.21 ± 35.68 months. Initial, maintenance and total doses of dexmedetomidine (mean ± standard deviation) were 1.63 ± 0.33 μg/kg body weight, 0.86 ± 0.68 μg/kg/h, and 26.7 ± 20.8 μg/kg. The overall incidence of bradycardia (95% confidence interval) was 3.067 (2.863, 3.270)%; P < 0.0001. However, range was wider (0–22%) with 9 studies observed 0% incidence. The mean change in the heart rate was −17.26 (−21.60, −12.92); P < 0.00001. In the meta-regression analyses, age, body weight and dexmedetomidine dose were not significantly associated with the incidence of bradycardia. The minimum heart rate observed during the dexmedetomidine treatment period was positively associated with baseline heart rate. Conclusion Incidence of bradycardia in dexmedetomidine treated pediatric patients is 3%."
Plasticity of fine-root functional traits in the litter layer in response to nitrogen addition in a subtropical forest plantation,"Fine-root traits mediate the capacity of plants to acquire soil resources in different environments. This study aimed to examine the changes of fine-root traits when roots proliferate into the litter layer vs. mineral soils, and to determine fine-root trait plasticity of these roots in response to nitrogen (N) addition."
Inhibitory effects of Citrus unshiu pericarpium extracts on palmitate-induced lipotoxicity in HepG2 cells,"Citrus unshiu pericarpium (CP), a rich source of flavonoids, has been used as a traditional medicine for purposes of exhaustion, cold, and cancer treatment in East Asia including China and Korea. This study investigated the effect of CP extracts on palmitate-induced lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, HepG2. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured by Tryphan blue staining and Hoechst staining, respectively. Cellular uptake of free fatty acid was measured by Oil Red O staining. The results show that CP extracts attenuated palmitate-induced intracellular lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity in HepG2 cells. CP extracts also blocked the expression of apo B protein, an apolipoprotein with functional roles in intracellular lipid accumulation. Moreover, CP extracts inhibited the release of the mitochondrial cytochrome c through regulation of apoptosis-related proteins, Bax and Bcl-2. These results demonstrated a novel function of CP extracts in preventing lipotoxicity in HepG2 cells, implicating a promising phytotherapeutic approach for lipo-detoxification."
"Evaluation of the microbiological quality of jacopevers and plaices in Korea, 2015-2016","In Southeast Asian countries, including Korea, China, and Japan, the considerable amounts of raw fish have been annually consumed in the manner of live fish fillets without minimally thermal processing, increasing the risks of causing food-borne diseases. This study investigated the occurrence of total aerobic bacteria (TAB), coliform, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella enterica serovar spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus in jacopevers and plaices. Total 200 live fishes were collected from randomly selected restaurants located in Anseong-si, and then they were microbiologically monitored. TAB ranged from 3.09 to 3.21 Log10 CFU/g in jacopever and plaice. Coliform in the levels of 1.54 Log10 CFU/g were detected in samples. Out of 100 jacopevers, a single jacopever (1%) exhibited the prevalence of S. aureus in the edible part, though none of pathogenic bacteria were detected. These results will be useful for understanding the microbial prevalence in the domestic living jacopevers and plaices."
Effects of swelled pig skin with various natural vinegars on quality characteristics of traditional Korean blood sausages (Sundae),"This study evaluated effects of swelled pig skin (SPS) with various natural vinegars (Bokbunja, brown rice, cider, and lemon vinegars) on the quality of the Korean traditional blood sausages. Adding SPS with various natural vinegars resulted in increased moisture content, cooking loss, L* values, and a* values and decreases in fat, protein content (p<0.05), hardness and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance values in the meat product samples compared to those in the control. Treatments containing SPS with various natural vinegars decreased the warmed-over flavor but increased the tenderness. These results indicate that SPS with various natural vinegars would improve the quality characteristics and inhibit lipid oxidation of traditional Korean blood sausages."
Family structure and childhood mental disorders: new findings from Australia,"Many children now live in non-traditional families—including one-parent, blended, and step families. While a substantial body of international evidence indicates that these children display poorer cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes than children living in traditional families, research on childhood mental disorders is scarce. This report provides new evidence of the relationships between family structure and childhood mental disorders in an under-researched context, Australia."
Yields of three acids during simulated fermentation of inulin and xylo-oligosaccharides enhanced by six exogenous strains,"Three acids (acetic, propionic and butyric acids) yielded from simulated colonic fermentation of inulin and xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS) in the absence and presence of six exogenous strains were investigated in this study. Both inulin and XOS were fermented by fecal extract (FE) prepared from healthy adults and by an exogenous strain for 48 h, and three acids generated in fermentation products at five time periods were detected by gas chromatography. Inulin and XOS during fermentation were capable of producing more propionic and butyric acids, respectively, whilst inoculation using one strain culture into fermentation systems mostly increased yields of three acids. In inulin-containing fermentation systems, these strains increased yields of propionic and butyric acids by 6–34 and 206–250%, respectively. In XOS-containing fermentation systems, these strains did not enhance yield of propionic acid, but increased yield of butyric acid by 50–96%. In general, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were more efficient than Lactobacillus acidophilus to increase yields of propionic and butyric acids. It is thus concluded that the six strains in total displayed beneficial effects on simulated fermentation of inulin and XOS through enhancing yields of three acids especially propionic and butyric acids with healthcare functions."
Indeterminacy and the principle of need,"The principle of need—the idea that resources should be allocated according to need—is often invoked in priority setting in the health care sector. In this article, I argue that a reasonable principle of need must be indeterminate, and examine three different ways that this can be dealt with: appendicizing the principle with further principles, imposing determinacy, or empowering decision makers. I argue that need must be conceptualized as a composite property composed of at least two factors: health shortfall and capacity to benefit. When one examines how the different factors relate to each other, one discovers that this is sometimes indeterminate. I illustrate this indeterminacy in this article by applying the small improvement argument. If the relation between the factors are always determinate, the comparative relation changes by a small adjustment. Yet, if two needs are dissimilar but of seemingly equal magnitude, the comparative relation does not change by a small adjustment of one of the factors. I then outline arguments in favor of each of the three strategies for dealing with indeterminacy, but also point out that all strategies have significant shortcomings. More research is needed concerning how to deal with this indeterminacy, and the most promising path seems to be to scrutinize the position of the principle of need among a plurality of relevant principles for priority setting in the health care sector."
Impact of laser pulse duration on the reduction of intraocular pressure during selective laser trabeculoplasty,"To evaluate the efficacy of selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), normal tension glaucoma (NTG) or ocular hypertension (OHT), when performed with laser pulse duration of 1 ns compared with standard 3–5 ns."
Chinese Economic Development Policies as an Example for Mexico: The One-Belt-One-Road Program,"The purpose of this article is to analyze China’s economic development policies of the last few years from the viewpoint of some Mexican actors (businesspeople, public officials, and scholars) who live and work in China. The idea is to learn from these policies and perhaps transfer the best practices to Mexico through horizontal international cooperation, with the hope of contributing to Mexico’s growth and development, based on its reality. We put forward that there are international circumstances that could bring this about, thanks to sudden changes on the global scenario. Finally, the article highlights the importance of fostering, understanding, and deepening bilateral relations between Mexico and China."
Application of Life Cycle Assessment on Electronic Waste Management: A Review,"Electronic waste is a rich source of both valuable materials and toxic substances. Management of electronic waste is one of the biggest challenges of current worldwide concern. As an effective and prevailing environmental management tool, life cycle assessment can evaluate the environmental performance of electronic waste management activities. Quite a few scientific literatures reporting life cycle assessment of electronic waste management with significant outcomes have been recently published. This paper reviewed the trends, characteristics, research gaps, and challenges of these studies providing detailed information for practitioners involved in electronic waste management. The results showed that life cycle assessment studies were most carried out in Europe, followed by Asia and North America. The research subject of the studies mainly includes monitors, waste printed circuit boards, mobile phones, computers, printers, batteries, toys, dishwashers, and light-emitting diodes. CML was the most widely used life cycle impact assessment method in life cycle assessment studies on electronic waste management, followed by EI99. Furthermore, 40% of the reviewed studies combined with other environmental tools, including life cycle cost, material flow analysis, multi-criteria decision analysis, emergy analysis, and hazard assessment which came to more comprehensive conclusions from different aspects. The research gaps and challenges including uneven distribution of life cycle assessment studies, life cycle impact assessment methods selection, comparison of the results, and uncertainty of the life cycle assessment studies were examined. Although life cycle assessment of electronic waste management facing challenges, their results will play more and more important role in electronic waste management practices."
"Mechanism of fluoride enrichment in groundwater of hard rock aquifers in Medak, Telangana State, South India","A total of 194 groundwater samples were collected from wells in hard rock aquifers of the Medak district, South India, to assess the distribution of fluoride in groundwater and to determine whether this chemical constituent was likely to be causing adverse health effects on groundwater user in the region. The study revealed that the fluoride concentration in groundwater ranged between 0.2 and 7.4 mg/L with an average concentration of 2.7 mg/L. About 57% of groundwater tested has fluoride concentrations more than the maximum permissible limit of 1.5 mg/L. The highest concentrations of fluoride were measured in groundwater in the north-eastern part of the Medak region especially in the Siddipeta, Chinnakodur, Nanganoor and Dubhaka regions. The areas are underlain by granites which contain fluoride-bearing minerals like apatite and biotite. Due to water–rock interactions, the fluoride has become enriched in groundwater due to the weathering and leaching of fluoride-bearing minerals. The pH and bicarbonate concentrations of the groundwater are varied from 6.6 to 8.8 and 18 to 527 mg/L, respectively. High fluoride concentration in the groundwater of the study area is observed when pH and the bicarbonate concentration are high. Data plotted in Gibbs diagram show that all groundwater samples fall under rock weathering dominance group with a trend towards the evaporation dominance category. An assessment of the chemical composition of groundwater reveals that most of the groundwater samples have compositions of Ca2+–Mg2+–Cl− > Ca2+–Na+–HCO3
− > Ca2+–HCO3
− > Na+–HCO3
−. This suggests that the characteristics of the groundwater flow regime, long residence time and the extent of groundwater interaction with rocks are the major factors that influence the concentration of fluoride. It is advised not to utilize the groundwater for drinking purpose in the areas delineated, and they should depend on alternate safe source."
"Mineralogical and geochemical (stable C and O isotopes) variability of marbles from the Moldanubian Zone (Bohemian Massif, Czech Republic): implications for provenance studies","Metacarbonates of the Moldanubian Zone (Bohemian Massif, Czech Republic) were studied to obtain qualitative and quantitative mineralogical-petrographic as well as stable isotopic data for the purpose of stone provenance studies, potentially applicable in material research studies of cultural heritage artefacts. Twenty-six samples from twelve different historical quarries, as well as two samples from historical artefacts, were analysed by both mineralogical-petrographic and geochemical methods including: polarizing microscopy, cathodoluminescence, scanning electron microscopy with microanalysis, petrographic image analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, and isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The petrographic characteristics allowed for the discrimination of groups of (1) calcitic marbles, (2) dolomitic marbles, and (3) carbonate–silicate rocks. These groups exhibit characteristic features such as (1) the presence/abundance of major rock-forming minerals, (2) grain geometric characteristics (specifically, mean carbonate grain size and index of grain size homogeneity), and (3) the presence of specific accessory phases. The content of non-carbonate minerals, some rock fabric parameters, as well as the carbon and oxygen isotope data exhibited significant variability, even within a single quarry in the case of some impure marbles and carbonate–silicate rocks. Although the carbon and oxygen isotopic ranges displayed overlaps among the quarries studied, the isotopic signatures throughout the Moldanubian Zone allowed for discrimination of a group of white calcitic marbles with high carbon and oxygen depletion, as well as white dolomite–calcitic marble with higher carbon isotope values when compared with other marble resources of the Bohemian Massif. A combination of the isotopic signature with detailed mineralogical-petrographic characteristics seems to provide sufficient information for discrimination of the Moldanubian marbles from one another. The provenance of the Vrchotovy Janovice artefact is very probably from the Rabí quarry, among the Moldanubian marbles. The provenance of the artefact from the Prague Klementinum was not definitively assigned; however, the Nehodiv quarry was considered its probable source locality."
Blowout mechanism of Alasehir (Turkey) geothermal field and its effects on groundwater chemistry,"Anatolia region is one of the most seismically active regions in the world and has a considerably high level of geothermal energy potential. Some of these geothermal resources have been used for power generation and direct heating. Most of the high enthalpy geothermal systems are located in western part of Turkey. Alasehir is the most important geothermal site in western part of Turkey. Many geothermal wells have been drilled in Alasehir Plain to produce the geothermal fluid from the deep reservoir in the last 10 years. A blowout accident happened during a geothermal well drilling operation in Alasehir Plain, and significant amount of geothermal fluid surfaced out along the fault zone in three locations. When drilling string entered the reservoir rock about 1000 m, blowout occurred. As the well head preventer system was closed because of the blowout, high-pressure fluid surfaced out along the fault zone cutting the Neogene formation. In order to understand the geothermal fluid effects on groundwater chemistry, physical and chemical compositions of local cold groundwater were monitored from May 2012 to September 2014 in the study area. The geothermal fluid was found to be of Na–HCO3 water type, and especially, arsenic and boron concentrations reached levels as high as 3 and 127 mg/L, respectively. The concentrations of arsenic and boron in the geothermal fluid and groundwater exceeded the maximum allowable limits given in the national and international standards for drinking water quality. According to temporally monitored results, geothermal fluid has extremely high mineral content which influenced the quality of groundwater resources of the area where water resource is commonly used for agricultural irrigation."
Application of quantitative mineralogy on the neutralization–acid potential calculations within µm-scale stratified mine tailings,"Estimation of the long-term environmental impact of mining wastes is of socio-economic interest. Bulk analytical approaches of the neutralizing (NP) and acid potentials (AP) provide in general worst-case scenarios for acid rock drainage (ARD) predictions and long-term evaluation. Taking individual graded layers with variable reactive mineral ratios into consideration, alternating zones, highly contrasting in their neutralizing and acid potential, can be identified and quantified using scanning electron microscope–mineral liberation analyzer (SEM–MLA) and μ-energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF)–petrographic analyst (PA) for the first time. The bulk NP and AP values increased by a factor of 2.13 and 1.37, respectively, compared to the average values of the mineralogical NP/AP. At the contrasting boundaries, precipitation of pore-clogging secondary phases might be enhanced. These new information can be used as input parameters to model the future behavior of a non-homogeneous multiplied laminated body with reactive transport modeling."
Case study of the implications of climate change for lichen diversity and distributions,"There is ample evidence for species distributional changes in response to recent climate change, but most studies are biased toward better known taxa. Thus, an integrated approach is needed that includes the “cryptic diversity” represented partly by lichens, which are among the most sensitive organisms to environmental change due to their physiological characteristics. The use of functional traits and ecological attributes may improve the interpretation of how species respond to climate change. Thus, we quantified the future climate change impacts on 41 lichen species distributed in the Iberian Peninsula using ensemble climatic suitability maps (derived from generalized linear and generalized additive models, and classification and regression tree analysis) and different metrics. We also determined the lichen traits/attributes that might be related to a shared response to climate change. The results indicated a loss of bioclimatic space for 75% of the species studied and an increase for 10 species, especially in Mediterranean ones. Most of the species that will lose more than 70% of their current modeled distribution area comprised big macrolichens with cyanobacteria as the photobiont, thereby indicating a great biomass loss in forests, which might affect nutrient cycles. We also found that the predicted distributions were trait-related. Smaller species, green-algae lichens, and saxicolous and epiphyte species will respond better to future climate change. The results of this type of study may help to identify the species that are most vulnerable to climate change and facilitate the development of conservation measures to avoid their decline."
Quasi-steady-state model of a class of nonlinear singularly perturbed system in a bond graph approach,"A particular class of nonlinear singularly perturbed systems by using a bond graph approach is proposed. The class of nonlinear systems is defined by terms of product of state variables whose bond graph representation is described by MTF or MGY elements modulated by state variables. The singular pertubations applied to the system permit the separation of time scales. When the assumptions of Tikhonov Theorem are satisfied, then a new bond graph called singularly perturbed nonlinear bond graph (SPNBG) to determine the quasi-steady-state model of the system is presented. The SPNBG is characterized by having an integral causality assignment for the storage elements that represent the slow dynamics, and the storage elements of the fast dynamics have a derivative causality assignment. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to an illustrative example."

Black Patients with Colorectal Cancer Have More Advanced Cancer Stage at Time of Diagnosis: A Community-Based Safety-Net Hospital Experience,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Disparities in access to care contribute to advanced CRC stage at diagnosis, and these disparities are most pronounced among underserved populations and ethnic minorities. We aim to evaluate race/ethnicity-specific disparities in CRC stage at diagnosis among an ethnically diverse, urban safety-net hospital. We retrospectively evaluated all adult CRC patients diagnosed from January 1, 2009 to October 1, 2015. CRC cases were confirmed by histopathology specimens from biopsies and/or surgical resection. CRC staging utilized American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging systems and were stratified by race/ethnicity. Multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to evaluate disparities in AJCC stage at presentation (stage 3–4 vs. stage 0–2). Among 311 patients with CRC [51.5% male, 25.3% black, 18.7% Hispanic, 32.0% Asian, and mean age at diagnosis 58.1 years (SD 10.3)] 61.4% had advanced ACC stage 3–4 CRC at diagnosis. Among black patients with CRC, 73.3% had AJCC stage 3–4 cancer at time of diagnosis. On multivariate regression, blacks were nearly four times more likely to have advanced AJCC stage 3–4 CRC at diagnosis compared to whites (OR 3.70; 95% CI 0.97–14.11; p = 0.055). Among a diverse underserved population, over 60% of CRC were AJCC stage 3–4 at diagnosis, and nearly 75% of blacks with CRC had AJCC stage 3–4 at diagnosis. Advanced stage CRC at diagnosis limits options for potentially curative therapies, and increases the risk for cancer recurrence and mortality."
Misbeliefs About Gambling in a Convenience Sample from the General Population,"We examined knowledge about the role of randomness in gambling and the principle of independence of events, in a community sample. We also investigated whether this knowledge varies according to gender and age. A convenience sample of 1257 residents in French-speaking Switzerland, aged 18–88 years (28.5% of women) completed a short online questionnaire. This assessed the perceived role of human skills in four different games as well as beliefs relating to the principle of independence of events. The results show that 19.5% of the respondents perceived Roulette as a game for which the outcome is determined by skill. They also showed that 15.1% of the respondents did not hold beliefs about the independence of events principle. Gender and age differences were also observed: Men were proportionally more likely to hold erroneous beliefs about gambling skills and the independence of events, compared to women. The 18–25 year-old age group attributed Roulette outcomes to the gambler’s skill more frequently than the older categories. The implications of these findings for prevention and social support are discussed."
The truncation of a cage graph,"The modern nanotechnology applies various cage molecules having a polyhedral shape. Topologically, a polyhedron is represented by its map. Since such a map is a plane graph, one may apply various graph-theoretical methods also for studying polyhedra. Of similar use are molecular (multi)tori. The surface of a multitorus is locally plane and allows one to apply much the same mathematical methods. This text is an introduction into the spectral theory of truncated cage graphs and truncated multitori. It anticipates further extensions."
Understanding Evaluations of Foreigners in Modern South Africa: The Relationship Between Subjective Wellbeing and Xenophobia,"Recent and recurrent violence against immigrants in South Africa highlight the prevalence of xenophobia in the country. Is there a relationship between attitudes towards immigrant sentiment and life satisfaction at the individual level in that nation? Life satisfaction could be a proxy for anxiety, social alienation or insecurity which may be driving xenophobic sentiment. Using data from the 2013 South African Social Attitudes Survey, this paper examines the relationship between attitudes towards immigrants and life satisfaction (measured using the Personal Wellbeing Index). The study focuses exclusively on the attitudes of the country’s Black African majority. Bivariate and multivariate analysis found that life satisfaction did not have a strong relationship with pro-immigrant sentiments. Objective measures of socio-economic status (such as educational attainment) did not have a significant relationship with attitudes towards immigrants. Although improving subjective wellbeing among Black Africans is a worthwhile policy goal in of itself, the findings of this study suggest that addressing xenophobia among this group will require focus on other areas. Intergroup contact, interracial attitudes and perceptions about the consequences of immigration were found to be stronger predictors of pro-immigrant sentiment than life satisfaction. There was some evidence of `outsider solidarity ‘in the study—isiTsonga speakers and members of the ethnolinguistic Black African minority were more pro-immigrant in sentiment than other groups. The implications of this finding on the study of pro-immigration attitudes are discussed in the conclusion."
Protic Ionic Liquid Assisted Synthesis and Characterization of Ferromagnetic Cobalt Oxide Nanocatalyst,"Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanocatalyst was synthesized by sol-gel method using the protic ionic liquid namely 1-butylimidazolium glycolate as solvent and stabilizer. The obtained Co3O4 nanocatalyst was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared, High resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), Selected area electron diffraction, UV–Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Photoluminescence spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area and Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Powder XRD results showed the well-crystalline cubic structure of synthesized Co3O4 with size of 19.29 nm. Also, the sphere-like morphology of Co3O4 nanocatalyst was confirmed by HR-SEM and HR-TEM images. Furthermore, the synthesized Co3O4 nanocatalyst possessed optical band gap values of 1.75 and 2.46 eV and hence acted as a semiconducting material. In addition, the presence of small hysteresis loop in Magnetic measurement (VSM) confirmed the ferromagnetic nature of Co3O4 nanoparticles. Moreover, the synthesized Co3O4 nanocatalyst found to be used in photo-catalytic degradation of methylene blue and exhibited 94.61% efficiency."
A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Nintedanib in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis in the UK,International guidelines recommend nintedanib (OFEV®) as an option for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
Inflorescence and floral development in Trochodendron aralioides (Trochodendraceae),"In the early development of Trochodendron aralioides (Trochodendraceae) inflorescences lateral flowers are initiated after the appearance of the floral pherophylls (subtending bracts). The terminal flower is preceded by metaxyphylls and is initiated earlier than the uppermost lateral flowers of the botryoid inflorescence. Small scales (interpreted as rudimentary perianth organs) precede the stamens. These scales are more distinct in the terminal flower than in the lateral flowers. In the radially symmetrical terminal flower, small scales (or metaxyphylls) and stamens are initiated in a spiral during early development. At anthesis, stamen phyllotaxis appears irregular or approximately whorled as a result of the rapid elongation and irregular slight curvature of the stamen filaments which distorts the originally regular pattern. Finally, the numerous carpels arise simultaneously in a single whorl. It takes about 9 months for flowers to develop and the 2-year reproductive cycle of T. aralioides is typical of many trees. The floral development of T. aralioides is compared with that of other basal eudicots. The bottle-shaped, unicellular stigmatic papillae and long, decurrent stigma of basally united carpels are similar to those of the Buxales¸ suggesting a close relationship."
Effects of social media on consumers’ purchase decisions: evidence from Taobao,"Given the rapid growth of social media, it is important to understand the effects of social media on consumers’ purchase decisions in the e-commerce environment. However, although some e-commerce sites have started to link themselves to social media to enhance user interactions, previous studies of social media and service management have shed little light on the effects of social media on consumers’ purchase decisions. This study proposes a theoretical research model that includes social media factors, social impact transfer factors, and e-commerce outcome factors. We posit social interaction ties and social media commitment as key elements of social media. An online questionnaire was conducted to test the research model and hypotheses based on survey data collected from Taobao, the largest e-commerce site in China. The analysis results indicate that social interaction ties have significant positive effects on social impact transfer factors and trust in online vendor, whereas they do not directly influence visit intention. Social media commitment plays a crucial role in increasing social impact transfer factors and e-commerce outcomes. The findings reveal the different effects of normative and informational social influences on consumer purchase decisions. Further implications are discussed."

The ecology of diamond sourcing: from mined to synthetic gems as a sustainable transition,"Luxury goods such as gemstones constitute a challenge for moving towards a sustainable society. From a purely bio-economic perspective, such goods consume planetary resources to provide a human “want” rather than a “need”. However, their extraction or manufacturing also provides important livelihoods for communities along the supply chain and hence contribute towards development outcomes. Comparing mined versus synthetic gems can provide consumers with important benchmarks on choice. The energy usage and emissions in mined versus lab-created diamonds was evaluated, based on industrial data, since these two factors are often a general indicator of environmental impact that can be useful in product comparisons. Depending on the process and the location of the mine, the data can be highly divergent and cannot be used as a singular measure of environmental impact. There is a need to develop life cycle analysis techniques from industrial ecology to conduct a detailed comparison of synthetic versus mined stones. Informed consumers could help to transition this luxury good towards a mix of mined and synthetic gems that best meet ecological and social metrics of sustainability."
FPGA-realization of a self-tuning PID controller for X–Y table with RBF neural network identification,"Based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology, a realization of a servo/motion control system with the self-tuning PID controller for X–Y table is presented in this work. Firstly, to cope with the system and external load uncertainly, a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF NN) is applied to identify the dynamic model of the X-axis table and Y-axis table and to provide the information to adjust the PID controller gains. Then, the design of an FPGA-based motion control IC for X–Y table using the aforementioned controller is described. The motion controller IC includes two modules. The first module, which performs two PMSM’s position servo controllers for X–Y table, is implemented by hardware in FPGA. The position servo controller adopts self-tuning PID controller with RBF NN identification. The second module, which runs the motion trajectory planning for X–Y table, is implemented by software in Nios II processor. As the result, the hardware/software co-design technology can make the motion controller of X–Y table more compact, robust, flexible, and less cost."
Renal transplantation outcomes following heart and heart–lung transplantation,"Chronic kidney disease is a frequent complication following heart and combined heart–lung transplantation. The aim of this study was to analyse the outcome of a subsequent renal transplant in heart, lung and heart–lung transplantation recipients."
Spectral invariance for pseudodifferential operators in Hölder–Zygmund spaces of the variable smoothness,We consider the Hölder–Zygmund spaces of the variable smoothness. The smoothness depends on a point in the space and may take negative values. We study the invertibility of pseudodifferential operators with symbols from the Hörmander classes of zero order and prove coincidence of the spectra of considered operators in various spaces.
A Measure of Well-Being Across the Italian Urban Areas: An Integrated DEA-Entropy Approach,"In recent years, there has been an increasing proliferation of initiatives focusing on the concept of quality of life and well-being. At the centre of these studies there is the recognizing that the GDP offers only a partial perspective of factors affecting people’s lives. Following this line of the research, this paper is aimed at computing the well-being efficiencies of a sample of Italian Province capital cities, using a methodological approach that combines data envelopment analysis (DEA) with Shannon’s entropy formula. To avoid subjectivity in choosing a representative set of variables that proxy the phenomenon under study, we rely on the theoretical framework adopted by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) within the equitable and sustainable well-being (BES) project. The dashboard of indicators included in the analysis are related to the Ur-BES initiative, promoted by ISTAT to implement the BES framework at cities level. In a first step of the analysis, an immediate focus on separate dimensions of urban well-being is obtained by summarizing the plurality of available indicators through the building of composite indices. Next, the adopted integrated DEA–Shannon entropy approach has permitted to increase the discriminatory power of DEA procedure and attain a more reliable profiling of Italian Province capital cities well-being efficiencies. The results show a marked duality between the Northern and Southern cities, highlighting important differences in many aspects of human and ecosystem well-being."
Autologous osteochondral transplantation (mosaicplasty) in articular cartilage defects of the patellofemoral joint: retrospective analysis of 33 cases,The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the results of osteochondral autografting (mosaicplasty) in isolated articular cartilage defects of the patellofemoral joint.
Distributivity for Upper Continuous and Strongly Atomic Lattices,In the paper we introduce two conditions (D) and (\(\hbox {D}^*\)) which are strengthenings of Birkhoff’s conditions. We prove that an upper continuous and strongly atomic lattice is distributive if and only if it satisfies (D) and (\(\hbox {D}^*\)). This result extends a theorem of R.P. Dilworth characterizing distributivity in terms of local distributivity and a theorem of M. Ward characterizing distributivity by means of covering diamonds.
Dissecting the role of NtrC and RpoN in the expression of assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reductases in Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens,"Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens, a nitrogen-fixing endosymbiont of soybeans, is a model strain for studying rhizobial denitrification. This bacterium can also use nitrate as the sole nitrogen (N) source during aerobic growth by inducing an assimilatory nitrate reductase encoded by nasC located within the narK-bjgb-flp-nasC operon along with a nitrite reductase encoded by nirA at a different chromosomal locus. The global nitrogen two-component regulatory system NtrBC has been reported to coordinate the expression of key enzymes in nitrogen metabolism in several bacteria. In this study, we demonstrate that disruption of ntrC caused a growth defect in B. diazoefficiens cells in the presence of nitrate or nitrite as the sole N source and a decreased activity of the nitrate and nitrite reductase enzymes. Furthermore, the expression of narK-lacZ or nirA-lacZ transcriptional fusions was significantly reduced in the ntrC mutant after incubation under nitrate assimilation conditions. A B. diazoefficiens rpoN

1/2
 mutant, lacking both copies of the gene encoding the alternative sigma factor σ54, was also defective in aerobic growth with nitrate as the N source as well as in nitrate and nitrite reductase expression. These results demonstrate that the NtrC regulator is required for expression of the B. diazoefficiens nasC and nirA genes and that the sigma factor RpoN is also involved in this regulation."
"Existence, bifurcation, and geometric evolution of quasi-bilayers in the multicomponent functionalized Cahn–Hilliard equation","Multicomponent bilayer structures arise as the ubiquitous plasma membrane in cellular biology and as blends of amphiphilic copolymers used in electrolyte membranes, drug delivery, and emulsion stabilization within the context of synthetic chemistry. We present the multicomponent functionalized Cahn–Hilliard (mFCH) free energy as a model which allows competition between bilayers with distinct composition and between bilayers and higher codimensional structures, such as co-dimension two filaments and co-dimension three micelles. We construct symmetric and asymmetric homoclinic bilayer profiles via a billiard limit potential and show that co-dimensional bifurcation is driven by the experimentally observed layer-by-layer pearling mechanism. We investigate the stability and slow geometric evolution of multicomponent bilayer interfaces within the context of an \(H^{-1}\) gradient flow of the mFCH, addressing the impact of aspect ratio of the amphiphile (lipid or copolymer unit) on the intrinsic curvature and the codimensional bifurcation. In particular we derive a Canham–Helfrich sharp interface energy whose intrinsic curvature arises through a Melnikov parameter associated to amphiphile aspect ratio."
Seismic performance of buried electrical cables: evidence-based repair rates and fragility functions,"The fragility of buried electrical cables is often neglected in earthquakes but significant damage to cables was observed during the 2010–2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence in New Zealand. This study estimates Poisson repair rates, similar to those in existence for pipelines, using damage data retrieved from part of the electric power distribution network in the city of Christchurch. The functions have been developed separately for four seismic hazard zones: no liquefaction, all liquefaction effects, liquefaction-induced settlement only, and liquefaction-induced lateral spread. In each zone six different intensity measures (IMs) are tested, including peak ground velocity as a measure of ground shaking and five metrics of permanent ground deformation: vertical differential, horizontal, maximum, vector mean and geometric mean. The analysis confirms that the vulnerability of buried cables is influenced more by liquefaction than by ground shaking, and that lateral spread causes more damage than settlement alone. In areas where lateral spreading is observed, the geometric mean permanent ground deformation is identified as the best performing IM across all zones when considering both variance explained and uncertainty. In areas where only settlement is observed, there is only a moderate correlation between repair rate and vertical differential permanent ground deformation but the estimated model error is relatively small and so the model may be acceptable. In general, repair rates in the zone where no liquefaction occurred are very low and it is possible that repairs present in this area result from misclassification of hazard observations, either in the raw data or due to the approximations of the geospatial analysis. Along with hazard intensity, insulation material is identified as a critical factor influencing cable fragility, with paper-insulated lead covered armoured cables experiencing considerably higher repair rates than cross-linked polyethylene cables. The analysis shows no trend between cable age and repair rates and the differences in repair rates between conducting materials is shown not to be significant. In addition to repair rate functions, an example of a fragility curve suite for cables is presented, which may be more useful for analysis of network connectivity where cable functionality is of more interest than the number of repairs. These functions are one of the first to be produced for the prediction of damage to buried cables."
Trends in accumulation of pharmacologically important antioxidant-secondary metabolites in callus cultures of Linum usitatissimum L.,"Linum usitatissimum: L. is well-known for production of pharmacologically important secondary metabolites. Due to their tremendous beneficial effects on human health, these compounds are receiving greater attention throughout the World, especially in the treatment of various types of cancers. In present study, we have developed an efficient protocol for production of lignans like secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) and lariciresinol diglucoside (LDG) and neo-lignans like dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol glucoside (DCG) and guaiacylglycerol-β-coniferyl alcohol ether glucoside (GGCG) by exploiting in vitro callus cultures of Flax. These cultures were established from stem and leaf explants, inoculated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) media supplemented with various concentrations of α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), thidiazuron (TDZ) and 6-benzyl adenine (BA). Results revealed that the leaf-derived calli (1.0 mg/l NAA) accumulated highest levels of biomass (DW; 15.7 g/l) and antioxidant activity, while highest production of total phenolics (111.09 mg/l) and flavonoids (45.02 mg/l) were observed in stem-derived calli (1.0 mg/l NAA). The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed that the stem-derived calli (1.0 mg/l NAA) accumulated optimum concentrations of SDG (2.7 ± 0.021 mg/g DW), LDG (9.8 ± 0.062 mg/g DW) and DCG (13.8 ± 0.076 mg/g DW), while leaf-derived calli (1.0 mg/l NAA) showed optimum accumulation of GGCG (3.8 ± 0.022 mg/g DW) as compared to all other treatments. These results provided definite evidence that the NAA differentially influence the production of lignans and neo-lignans in callus culture of Flax. This study opens new dimensions to devise strategies to enhance the production of these valuable metabolites."
Parameter Determination Using 3D FIB-SEM Images for Development of Effective Model of Shale Gas Flow in Nanoscale Pore Clusters,"A large amount of nano-pores exists in pore clusters in shale gas reservoirs. In addition to the multiple transport regimes that occur on the nanoscale, the pore space is another major factor that significantly affects the shale gas recoverability. An investigation of the pore-scale shale gas flow is therefore important, and the results can be used to develop an effective cluster-scale pore network model for the convenient examination of the process efficiency. Focused ion beam scanning electron microscope imaging, which enables the acquisition of nanometre-resolution images that facilitate nano-pore identification, was used in conjunction with a high-precision pore network extraction algorithm to generate the equivalent pore network for the simulation of Darcy and shale gas flows through the pores. The characteristic parameters of the pores and the gas transport features were determined and analysed to obtain a deeper understanding of shale gas flow through nanoscale pore clusters, such as the importance of the throat flux–radius distribution and the variation of the tortuosity with pressure. The best parameter scheme for the proposed effective model of shale gas flow was selected out of three derived schemes based on the pore-scale prediction results. The model is applicable to pore-scale to cluster-scale shale gas flows and can be used to avoid the multiple-solution problems in the study of gas flows. It affords a foundation for further study to develop models for shale gas flows on larger scales."
"Carbon and nitrogen dynamics of the intertidal seagrass, Zostera japonica, on the southern coast of the Korean peninsula","Seagrasses require a large amount of nutrient assimilation to support high levels of production, and thus nutrient limitation for growth often occurs in seagrass habitats. Seagrasses can take up nutrients from both the water column and sediments. However, since seagrasses inhabiting in the intertidal zones are exposed to the air during low tide, the intertidal species may exhibit significantly different carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics compared to the subtidal species. To examine C and N dynamics of the intertidal seagrass, Zostera japonica, C and N content and stable isotope ratios of above- and below-ground tissues were measured monthly at the three intertidal zones in Koje Bay on the southern coast of Korea. The C and N content and stable isotope (δ13C and δ15N) ratios of seagrass tissues exhibited significant seasonal variations. Both leaf and rhizome C content were not significantly correlated with productivity. Leaf δ13C values usually exhibited negative correlations with leaf productivity. These results of tissue C content and δ13C values suggest that photosynthesis of Z. japonica in the study site was not limited by inorganic C supply, and sufficient inorganic C was provided from the atmosphere. The tissue N content usually exhibited negative correlations with leaf productivity except at the upper intertidal zone, suggesting that Z. japonica growth was probably limited by N availability during high growing season. In the upper intertidal zone, no correlations between leaf productivity and tissue elemental content and stable isotope ratios were observed due to the severely suppressed growth caused by strong desiccation stress."
Characteristics of drift pumice from New Caledonia beaches,"Siliceous drift pumice was collected from a total of 40 beaches around the main island of New Caledonia, Southwest Pacific, in order to determine its provenance. New Caledonia is enclosed by a barrier reef lagoon whose 2008 designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site brought attention to the environmental degradation caused by a century of open cast nickel mining. The frequent, voluminous pumice eruptions in the Southwest Pacific provide ample source material that is somewhat durable, highly transportable in water, and easy to collect and analyze. Geochemical and mineralogical analyses were used to identify the source of the pumice in order to map the transport vector across the open ocean and into the lagoon. Drift pumice was sampled during 2008 and 2010. The mineral assemblage of the pumice was consistently calcic plagioclase, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and opaque minerals. All of the pumice was of fairly uniform geochemistry: low in mafic elements, low in alkalis, with LILE enriched compared to HFSE, and negative Eu, Ti, and Zr anomalies. The pumice is predominately dacitic and tholeiitic. This geochemical signature was consistent with published data from the Tonga arc, which is further supported by the mineralogy. With the exception of two samples (which probably came from either the Kermadec arc or Vanuatu) all of the pumice comes from the Tonga arc. The samples from 2008 are consistent with pumice erupted from Metis Shoal in 2006, and the majority of 2010 samples are consistent with pumice erupted from an unnamed volcano (0403-091) that erupted in 2001."
"Effects of temperature on growth, photophysiology, Rubisco gene expression in Prorocentrum donghaiense and Karenia mikimotoi","To explore the effects of temperature changes on dinoflagellate bloom succession in the coastal waters of the East China Sea, changes in the growth, photophysiology, and Rubisco gene expression of Prorocentrum donghaiense and Karenia mikimotoi, two harmful algal species, were investigated at different temperatures (16 to 28°C). The maximal specific growth rate and the maximal mRNA expression of Rubisco gene in P. donghaiense and K. mikimotoi occurred at 20 and 24°C, respectively. The photosynthetic activity of P. donghaiense was generally stable, but K. mikimotoi photosynthesis increased when temperatures rose from 16 to 28°C. The effective photochemical efficiency (F

It is likely that temperature changes affect species composition during blooms, leading to the observed patterns of bloom succession."
The identity of ‘Berkeleya scopulorum’ from Northeast Asia: Report on Climaconeis mabikii sp. nov. from temperate marine waters with notes on biogeography of the genus,"While there have been many reports of the species ‘Berkeleya scopulorum’ from Northeast Asia mainly as Navicula scopulorum, the observation of the living specimen of the species has revealed that the species should be the member of the genus Climaconeis. Here we describe the species as Climaconeis mabikii sp. nov. based on microscopic observations by means of both light (LM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). As part of the review, the regional distribution of C. mabikii as well as the worldwide biogeography of the taxa belonging to the genus Climaconeis are discussed. Newly described C. mabikii from the present study is the seventeenth member of the genus. The discovery of the true identity of the diatom identified for a long time as ‘Berkeleya scopulorum’ and its description as a new Climaconeis species contributes to the proper appreciation of the diversity of the Northeast Asian diatom assemblage and fills old gaps in the published records."
Implementing Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS) with Latino Youth,"Many Latino youth are often unable to access mental health services and support following exposure to traumatic and stressful events. This study assesses the benefits and effectiveness of utilizing Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS), a school based intervention, with Spanish speaking, Latino youth residing in New Orleans, Louisiana, in effort to address presenting symptoms of trauma and depression."
There is exactly one \({\mathbb {Z}}_2{\mathbb {Z}}_4\)-cyclic 1-perfect code,"Let \(\mathcal{C}\) be a \({\mathbb {Z}}_2{\mathbb {Z}}_4\)-additive code of length \(n > 3\). We prove that if the binary Gray image of \(\mathcal{C}\) is a 1-perfect nonlinear code, then \(\mathcal{C}\) cannot be a \({\mathbb {Z}}_2{\mathbb {Z}}_4\)-cyclic code except for one case of length \(n=15\). Moreover, we give a parity check matrix for this cyclic code. Adding an even parity check coordinate to a \({\mathbb {Z}}_2{\mathbb {Z}}_4\)-additive 1-perfect code gives a \({\mathbb {Z}}_2{\mathbb {Z}}_4\)-additive extended 1-perfect code. We also prove that such a code cannot be \({\mathbb {Z}}_2{\mathbb {Z}}_4\)-cyclic."
Application of quantitative mineralogy on the neutralization–acid potential calculations within µm-scale stratified mine tailings,"Estimation of the long-term environmental impact of mining wastes is of socio-economic interest. Bulk analytical approaches of the neutralizing (NP) and acid potentials (AP) provide in general worst-case scenarios for acid rock drainage (ARD) predictions and long-term evaluation. Taking individual graded layers with variable reactive mineral ratios into consideration, alternating zones, highly contrasting in their neutralizing and acid potential, can be identified and quantified using scanning electron microscope–mineral liberation analyzer (SEM–MLA) and μ-energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF)–petrographic analyst (PA) for the first time. The bulk NP and AP values increased by a factor of 2.13 and 1.37, respectively, compared to the average values of the mineralogical NP/AP. At the contrasting boundaries, precipitation of pore-clogging secondary phases might be enhanced. These new information can be used as input parameters to model the future behavior of a non-homogeneous multiplied laminated body with reactive transport modeling."
"Mineralogical and geochemical (stable C and O isotopes) variability of marbles from the Moldanubian Zone (Bohemian Massif, Czech Republic): implications for provenance studies","Metacarbonates of the Moldanubian Zone (Bohemian Massif, Czech Republic) were studied to obtain qualitative and quantitative mineralogical-petrographic as well as stable isotopic data for the purpose of stone provenance studies, potentially applicable in material research studies of cultural heritage artefacts. Twenty-six samples from twelve different historical quarries, as well as two samples from historical artefacts, were analysed by both mineralogical-petrographic and geochemical methods including: polarizing microscopy, cathodoluminescence, scanning electron microscopy with microanalysis, petrographic image analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, and isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The petrographic characteristics allowed for the discrimination of groups of (1) calcitic marbles, (2) dolomitic marbles, and (3) carbonate–silicate rocks. These groups exhibit characteristic features such as (1) the presence/abundance of major rock-forming minerals, (2) grain geometric characteristics (specifically, mean carbonate grain size and index of grain size homogeneity), and (3) the presence of specific accessory phases. The content of non-carbonate minerals, some rock fabric parameters, as well as the carbon and oxygen isotope data exhibited significant variability, even within a single quarry in the case of some impure marbles and carbonate–silicate rocks. Although the carbon and oxygen isotopic ranges displayed overlaps among the quarries studied, the isotopic signatures throughout the Moldanubian Zone allowed for discrimination of a group of white calcitic marbles with high carbon and oxygen depletion, as well as white dolomite–calcitic marble with higher carbon isotope values when compared with other marble resources of the Bohemian Massif. A combination of the isotopic signature with detailed mineralogical-petrographic characteristics seems to provide sufficient information for discrimination of the Moldanubian marbles from one another. The provenance of the Vrchotovy Janovice artefact is very probably from the Rabí quarry, among the Moldanubian marbles. The provenance of the artefact from the Prague Klementinum was not definitively assigned; however, the Nehodiv quarry was considered its probable source locality."
Blowout mechanism of Alasehir (Turkey) geothermal field and its effects on groundwater chemistry,"Anatolia region is one of the most seismically active regions in the world and has a considerably high level of geothermal energy potential. Some of these geothermal resources have been used for power generation and direct heating. Most of the high enthalpy geothermal systems are located in western part of Turkey. Alasehir is the most important geothermal site in western part of Turkey. Many geothermal wells have been drilled in Alasehir Plain to produce the geothermal fluid from the deep reservoir in the last 10 years. A blowout accident happened during a geothermal well drilling operation in Alasehir Plain, and significant amount of geothermal fluid surfaced out along the fault zone in three locations. When drilling string entered the reservoir rock about 1000 m, blowout occurred. As the well head preventer system was closed because of the blowout, high-pressure fluid surfaced out along the fault zone cutting the Neogene formation. In order to understand the geothermal fluid effects on groundwater chemistry, physical and chemical compositions of local cold groundwater were monitored from May 2012 to September 2014 in the study area. The geothermal fluid was found to be of Na–HCO3 water type, and especially, arsenic and boron concentrations reached levels as high as 3 and 127 mg/L, respectively. The concentrations of arsenic and boron in the geothermal fluid and groundwater exceeded the maximum allowable limits given in the national and international standards for drinking water quality. According to temporally monitored results, geothermal fluid has extremely high mineral content which influenced the quality of groundwater resources of the area where water resource is commonly used for agricultural irrigation."
"Mechanism of fluoride enrichment in groundwater of hard rock aquifers in Medak, Telangana State, South India","A total of 194 groundwater samples were collected from wells in hard rock aquifers of the Medak district, South India, to assess the distribution of fluoride in groundwater and to determine whether this chemical constituent was likely to be causing adverse health effects on groundwater user in the region. The study revealed that the fluoride concentration in groundwater ranged between 0.2 and 7.4 mg/L with an average concentration of 2.7 mg/L. About 57% of groundwater tested has fluoride concentrations more than the maximum permissible limit of 1.5 mg/L. The highest concentrations of fluoride were measured in groundwater in the north-eastern part of the Medak region especially in the Siddipeta, Chinnakodur, Nanganoor and Dubhaka regions. The areas are underlain by granites which contain fluoride-bearing minerals like apatite and biotite. Due to water–rock interactions, the fluoride has become enriched in groundwater due to the weathering and leaching of fluoride-bearing minerals. The pH and bicarbonate concentrations of the groundwater are varied from 6.6 to 8.8 and 18 to 527 mg/L, respectively. High fluoride concentration in the groundwater of the study area is observed when pH and the bicarbonate concentration are high. Data plotted in Gibbs diagram show that all groundwater samples fall under rock weathering dominance group with a trend towards the evaporation dominance category. An assessment of the chemical composition of groundwater reveals that most of the groundwater samples have compositions of Ca2+–Mg2+–Cl− > Ca2+–Na+–HCO3
− > Ca2+–HCO3
− > Na+–HCO3
−. This suggests that the characteristics of the groundwater flow regime, long residence time and the extent of groundwater interaction with rocks are the major factors that influence the concentration of fluoride. It is advised not to utilize the groundwater for drinking purpose in the areas delineated, and they should depend on alternate safe source."
Indeterminacy and the principle of need,"The principle of need—the idea that resources should be allocated according to need—is often invoked in priority setting in the health care sector. In this article, I argue that a reasonable principle of need must be indeterminate, and examine three different ways that this can be dealt with: appendicizing the principle with further principles, imposing determinacy, or empowering decision makers. I argue that need must be conceptualized as a composite property composed of at least two factors: health shortfall and capacity to benefit. When one examines how the different factors relate to each other, one discovers that this is sometimes indeterminate. I illustrate this indeterminacy in this article by applying the small improvement argument. If the relation between the factors are always determinate, the comparative relation changes by a small adjustment. Yet, if two needs are dissimilar but of seemingly equal magnitude, the comparative relation does not change by a small adjustment of one of the factors. I then outline arguments in favor of each of the three strategies for dealing with indeterminacy, but also point out that all strategies have significant shortcomings. More research is needed concerning how to deal with this indeterminacy, and the most promising path seems to be to scrutinize the position of the principle of need among a plurality of relevant principles for priority setting in the health care sector."
A Measure of Well-Being Across the Italian Urban Areas: An Integrated DEA-Entropy Approach,"In recent years, there has been an increasing proliferation of initiatives focusing on the concept of quality of life and well-being. At the centre of these studies there is the recognizing that the GDP offers only a partial perspective of factors affecting people’s lives. Following this line of the research, this paper is aimed at computing the well-being efficiencies of a sample of Italian Province capital cities, using a methodological approach that combines data envelopment analysis (DEA) with Shannon’s entropy formula. To avoid subjectivity in choosing a representative set of variables that proxy the phenomenon under study, we rely on the theoretical framework adopted by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) within the equitable and sustainable well-being (BES) project. The dashboard of indicators included in the analysis are related to the Ur-BES initiative, promoted by ISTAT to implement the BES framework at cities level. In a first step of the analysis, an immediate focus on separate dimensions of urban well-being is obtained by summarizing the plurality of available indicators through the building of composite indices. Next, the adopted integrated DEA–Shannon entropy approach has permitted to increase the discriminatory power of DEA procedure and attain a more reliable profiling of Italian Province capital cities well-being efficiencies. The results show a marked duality between the Northern and Southern cities, highlighting important differences in many aspects of human and ecosystem well-being."
Autologous osteochondral transplantation (mosaicplasty) in articular cartilage defects of the patellofemoral joint: retrospective analysis of 33 cases,The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the results of osteochondral autografting (mosaicplasty) in isolated articular cartilage defects of the patellofemoral joint.
Dissecting the role of NtrC and RpoN in the expression of assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reductases in Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens,"Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens, a nitrogen-fixing endosymbiont of soybeans, is a model strain for studying rhizobial denitrification. This bacterium can also use nitrate as the sole nitrogen (N) source during aerobic growth by inducing an assimilatory nitrate reductase encoded by nasC located within the narK-bjgb-flp-nasC operon along with a nitrite reductase encoded by nirA at a different chromosomal locus. The global nitrogen two-component regulatory system NtrBC has been reported to coordinate the expression of key enzymes in nitrogen metabolism in several bacteria. In this study, we demonstrate that disruption of ntrC caused a growth defect in B. diazoefficiens cells in the presence of nitrate or nitrite as the sole N source and a decreased activity of the nitrate and nitrite reductase enzymes. Furthermore, the expression of narK-lacZ or nirA-lacZ transcriptional fusions was significantly reduced in the ntrC mutant after incubation under nitrate assimilation conditions. A B. diazoefficiens rpoN

1/2
 mutant, lacking both copies of the gene encoding the alternative sigma factor σ54, was also defective in aerobic growth with nitrate as the N source as well as in nitrate and nitrite reductase expression. These results demonstrate that the NtrC regulator is required for expression of the B. diazoefficiens nasC and nirA genes and that the sigma factor RpoN is also involved in this regulation."
Application of Life Cycle Assessment on Electronic Waste Management: A Review,"Electronic waste is a rich source of both valuable materials and toxic substances. Management of electronic waste is one of the biggest challenges of current worldwide concern. As an effective and prevailing environmental management tool, life cycle assessment can evaluate the environmental performance of electronic waste management activities. Quite a few scientific literatures reporting life cycle assessment of electronic waste management with significant outcomes have been recently published. This paper reviewed the trends, characteristics, research gaps, and challenges of these studies providing detailed information for practitioners involved in electronic waste management. The results showed that life cycle assessment studies were most carried out in Europe, followed by Asia and North America. The research subject of the studies mainly includes monitors, waste printed circuit boards, mobile phones, computers, printers, batteries, toys, dishwashers, and light-emitting diodes. CML was the most widely used life cycle impact assessment method in life cycle assessment studies on electronic waste management, followed by EI99. Furthermore, 40% of the reviewed studies combined with other environmental tools, including life cycle cost, material flow analysis, multi-criteria decision analysis, emergy analysis, and hazard assessment which came to more comprehensive conclusions from different aspects. The research gaps and challenges including uneven distribution of life cycle assessment studies, life cycle impact assessment methods selection, comparison of the results, and uncertainty of the life cycle assessment studies were examined. Although life cycle assessment of electronic waste management facing challenges, their results will play more and more important role in electronic waste management practices."
The role of rock joint frictional strength in the containment of fracture propagation,"The fracturing phenomenon within the reservoir environment is a complex process that is controlled by several factors and may occur either naturally or by artificial drivers.
 Even when deliberately induced, the fracturing behaviour is greatly influenced by the subsurface architecture and existing features. The presence of discontinuities such as joints, artificial and naturally occurring faults and interfaces between rock layers and microfractures plays an important role in the fracturing process and has been known to significantly alter the course of fracture growth. In this paper, an important property (joint friction) that governs the shear behaviour of discontinuities is considered. The applied numerical procedure entails the implementation of the discrete element method to enable a more dynamic monitoring of the fracturing process, where the joint frictional property is considered in isolation. Whereas fracture propagation is constrained by joints of low frictional resistance, in non-frictional joints, the unrestricted sliding of the joint plane increases the tendency for reinitiation and proliferation of fractures at other locations. The ability of a frictional joint to suppress fracture growth decreases as the frictional resistance increases; however, this phenomenon exacerbates the influence of other factors including in situ stresses and overburden conditions. The effect of the joint frictional property is not limited to the strength of rock formations; it also impacts on fracturing processes, which could be particularly evident in jointed rock masses or formations with prominent faults and/or discontinuities."
Do casinos pay their customers to become risk-averse? Revising the house money effect in a field experiment,"The house money effect predicts that individuals show increased risk-seeking behavior in the presence of prior windfall gains. Although the effect’s existence is widely accepted, experimental studies that compare individuals’ risk-taking behavior using house money to individuals’ risk-taking behavior using their own money produce contradictory results. This experimental field study analyzes the gambling behavior of 917 casino customers who face real losses. We find that customers who received free play at the entrance showed not higher but significantly lower levels of risk-taking behavior during their casino visit, expressed through lower average wagers. This study thus provides field evidence against the house money effect. Moreover, as a result of lower levels of risk seeking, endowed customers yield better economic results in the form of smaller own-money losses when leaving the casino."
New existence of multiple solutions for nonhomogeneous Schrödinger–Kirchhoff problems involving the fractional p-Laplacian with sign-changing potential,"In this paper, we prove the existence of multiple solutions for the following fractional p-Laplacian equation of Schrödinger–Kirchhoff type with sign-changing potential"
Modified Stancu type Dunkl generalization of Szász–Kantorovich operators,"In this paper, we introduce a modification of the Szász–Mirakjan–Kantorovich operators as well as Stancu operators (or a Dunkl generalization of modified Szász–Mirakjan–Kantrovich operators) which preserve the linearity. This type of modification enables better error estimation on the interval \([1/2,\infty )\) rather than the classical Dunkl Szász–Mirakjan–Kantrovich as well as Stancu operators. We obtain some approximation results via well known Korovkin’s type theorem. We also calculate the rate of convergence of operators by means of modulus of continuity and Lipschitz type maximal functions."

Total Robotic Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch Technique,"The use of robotic bariatric surgery has increased significantly since its advent in 1999. Its utility and safety has been demonstrated in the literature for all bariatric procedures, including most recently the biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPDDS). The robotic-assisted biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (RBPDDS) was first described by Sudan et al. in 2007 with the use of the robot primarily for the duodeno-ileal anastomosis, then in 2015, the same authors described 59 cases of totally RBPDDS using the robot for the most of the operation, but still utilizing laparoscopic staplers. Robotic staplers were introduced recently and it became possible to utilize robot throughout the entire procedure without relying on stapling performed by an assistant. Described here is the technique of a total RBPDDS utilizing robotic staplers."
Chinese Economic Development Policies as an Example for Mexico: The One-Belt-One-Road Program,"The purpose of this article is to analyze China’s economic development policies of the last few years from the viewpoint of some Mexican actors (businesspeople, public officials, and scholars) who live and work in China. The idea is to learn from these policies and perhaps transfer the best practices to Mexico through horizontal international cooperation, with the hope of contributing to Mexico’s growth and development, based on its reality. We put forward that there are international circumstances that could bring this about, thanks to sudden changes on the global scenario. Finally, the article highlights the importance of fostering, understanding, and deepening bilateral relations between Mexico and China."
Extracting Low-Frequency Information from Time Attenuation in Elastic Waveform Inversion,"Low-frequency information is crucial for recovering background velocity, but the lack of low-frequency information in field data makes inversion impractical without accurate initial models. Laplace–Fourier domain waveform inversion can recover a smooth model from real data without low-frequency information, which can be used for subsequent inversion as an ideal starting model. In general, it also starts with low frequencies and includes higher frequencies at later inversion stages, while the difference is that its ultralow frequency information comes from the Laplace–Fourier domain. Meanwhile, a direct implementation of the Laplace-transformed wavefield using frequency domain inversion is also very convenient. However, because broad frequency bands are often used in the pure time domain waveform inversion, it is difficult to extract the wavefields dominated by low frequencies in this case. In this paper, low-frequency components are constructed by introducing time attenuation into the recorded residuals, and the rest of the method is identical to the traditional time domain inversion. Time windowing and frequency filtering are also applied to mitigate the ambiguity of the inverse problem. Therefore, we can start at low frequencies and to move to higher frequencies. The experiment shows that the proposed method can achieve a good inversion result in the presence of a linear initial model and records without low-frequency information."
Spectral invariance for pseudodifferential operators in Hölder–Zygmund spaces of the variable smoothness,We consider the Hölder–Zygmund spaces of the variable smoothness. The smoothness depends on a point in the space and may take negative values. We study the invertibility of pseudodifferential operators with symbols from the Hörmander classes of zero order and prove coincidence of the spectra of considered operators in various spaces.
Distributivity for Upper Continuous and Strongly Atomic Lattices,In the paper we introduce two conditions (D) and (\(\hbox {D}^*\)) which are strengthenings of Birkhoff’s conditions. We prove that an upper continuous and strongly atomic lattice is distributive if and only if it satisfies (D) and (\(\hbox {D}^*\)). This result extends a theorem of R.P. Dilworth characterizing distributivity in terms of local distributivity and a theorem of M. Ward characterizing distributivity by means of covering diamonds.
"Existence, bifurcation, and geometric evolution of quasi-bilayers in the multicomponent functionalized Cahn–Hilliard equation","Multicomponent bilayer structures arise as the ubiquitous plasma membrane in cellular biology and as blends of amphiphilic copolymers used in electrolyte membranes, drug delivery, and emulsion stabilization within the context of synthetic chemistry. We present the multicomponent functionalized Cahn–Hilliard (mFCH) free energy as a model which allows competition between bilayers with distinct composition and between bilayers and higher codimensional structures, such as co-dimension two filaments and co-dimension three micelles. We construct symmetric and asymmetric homoclinic bilayer profiles via a billiard limit potential and show that co-dimensional bifurcation is driven by the experimentally observed layer-by-layer pearling mechanism. We investigate the stability and slow geometric evolution of multicomponent bilayer interfaces within the context of an \(H^{-1}\) gradient flow of the mFCH, addressing the impact of aspect ratio of the amphiphile (lipid or copolymer unit) on the intrinsic curvature and the codimensional bifurcation. In particular we derive a Canham–Helfrich sharp interface energy whose intrinsic curvature arises through a Melnikov parameter associated to amphiphile aspect ratio."
"Carbon and nitrogen dynamics of the intertidal seagrass, Zostera japonica, on the southern coast of the Korean peninsula","Seagrasses require a large amount of nutrient assimilation to support high levels of production, and thus nutrient limitation for growth often occurs in seagrass habitats. Seagrasses can take up nutrients from both the water column and sediments. However, since seagrasses inhabiting in the intertidal zones are exposed to the air during low tide, the intertidal species may exhibit significantly different carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics compared to the subtidal species. To examine C and N dynamics of the intertidal seagrass, Zostera japonica, C and N content and stable isotope ratios of above- and below-ground tissues were measured monthly at the three intertidal zones in Koje Bay on the southern coast of Korea. The C and N content and stable isotope (δ13C and δ15N) ratios of seagrass tissues exhibited significant seasonal variations. Both leaf and rhizome C content were not significantly correlated with productivity. Leaf δ13C values usually exhibited negative correlations with leaf productivity. These results of tissue C content and δ13C values suggest that photosynthesis of Z. japonica in the study site was not limited by inorganic C supply, and sufficient inorganic C was provided from the atmosphere. The tissue N content usually exhibited negative correlations with leaf productivity except at the upper intertidal zone, suggesting that Z. japonica growth was probably limited by N availability during high growing season. In the upper intertidal zone, no correlations between leaf productivity and tissue elemental content and stable isotope ratios were observed due to the severely suppressed growth caused by strong desiccation stress."
Characteristics of drift pumice from New Caledonia beaches,"Siliceous drift pumice was collected from a total of 40 beaches around the main island of New Caledonia, Southwest Pacific, in order to determine its provenance. New Caledonia is enclosed by a barrier reef lagoon whose 2008 designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site brought attention to the environmental degradation caused by a century of open cast nickel mining. The frequent, voluminous pumice eruptions in the Southwest Pacific provide ample source material that is somewhat durable, highly transportable in water, and easy to collect and analyze. Geochemical and mineralogical analyses were used to identify the source of the pumice in order to map the transport vector across the open ocean and into the lagoon. Drift pumice was sampled during 2008 and 2010. The mineral assemblage of the pumice was consistently calcic plagioclase, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and opaque minerals. All of the pumice was of fairly uniform geochemistry: low in mafic elements, low in alkalis, with LILE enriched compared to HFSE, and negative Eu, Ti, and Zr anomalies. The pumice is predominately dacitic and tholeiitic. This geochemical signature was consistent with published data from the Tonga arc, which is further supported by the mineralogy. With the exception of two samples (which probably came from either the Kermadec arc or Vanuatu) all of the pumice comes from the Tonga arc. The samples from 2008 are consistent with pumice erupted from Metis Shoal in 2006, and the majority of 2010 samples are consistent with pumice erupted from an unnamed volcano (0403-091) that erupted in 2001."
"Effects of temperature on growth, photophysiology, Rubisco gene expression in Prorocentrum donghaiense and Karenia mikimotoi","To explore the effects of temperature changes on dinoflagellate bloom succession in the coastal waters of the East China Sea, changes in the growth, photophysiology, and Rubisco gene expression of Prorocentrum donghaiense and Karenia mikimotoi, two harmful algal species, were investigated at different temperatures (16 to 28°C). The maximal specific growth rate and the maximal mRNA expression of Rubisco gene in P. donghaiense and K. mikimotoi occurred at 20 and 24°C, respectively. The photosynthetic activity of P. donghaiense was generally stable, but K. mikimotoi photosynthesis increased when temperatures rose from 16 to 28°C. The effective photochemical efficiency (F

, rETRmax, and photosynthetic efficiency (α). However, K. mikimotoi has a higher growth rate than P. donghaiense. These results suggest that the photosynthetic activity and genetic responses of dinoflagellates are species-dependent. It is likely that temperature changes affect species composition during blooms, leading to the observed patterns of bloom succession."
The identity of ‘Berkeleya scopulorum’ from Northeast Asia: Report on Climaconeis mabikii sp. nov. from temperate marine waters with notes on biogeography of the genus,"While there have been many reports of the species ‘Berkeleya scopulorum’ from Northeast Asia mainly as Navicula scopulorum, the observation of the living specimen of the species has revealed that the species should be the member of the genus Climaconeis. Here we describe the species as Climaconeis mabikii sp. nov. based on microscopic observations by means of both light (LM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). As part of the review, the regional distribution of C. mabikii as well as the worldwide biogeography of the taxa belonging to the genus Climaconeis are discussed. Newly described C. mabikii from the present study is the seventeenth member of the genus. The discovery of the true identity of the diatom identified for a long time as ‘Berkeleya scopulorum’ and its description as a new Climaconeis species contributes to the proper appreciation of the diversity of the Northeast Asian diatom assemblage and fills old gaps in the published records."
Parameter Determination Using 3D FIB-SEM Images for Development of Effective Model of Shale Gas Flow in Nanoscale Pore Clusters,"A large amount of nano-pores exists in pore clusters in shale gas reservoirs. In addition to the multiple transport regimes that occur on the nanoscale, the pore space is another major factor that significantly affects the shale gas recoverability. An investigation of the pore-scale shale gas flow is therefore important, and the results can be used to develop an effective cluster-scale pore network model for the convenient examination of the process efficiency. Focused ion beam scanning electron microscope imaging, which enables the acquisition of nanometre-resolution images that facilitate nano-pore identification, was used in conjunction with a high-precision pore network extraction algorithm to generate the equivalent pore network for the simulation of Darcy and shale gas flows through the pores. The characteristic parameters of the pores and the gas transport features were determined and analysed to obtain a deeper understanding of shale gas flow through nanoscale pore clusters, such as the importance of the throat flux–radius distribution and the variation of the tortuosity with pressure. The best parameter scheme for the proposed effective model of shale gas flow was selected out of three derived schemes based on the pore-scale prediction results. The model is applicable to pore-scale to cluster-scale shale gas flows and can be used to avoid the multiple-solution problems in the study of gas flows. It affords a foundation for further study to develop models for shale gas flows on larger scales."
Seismic performance of buried electrical cables: evidence-based repair rates and fragility functions,"The fragility of buried electrical cables is often neglected in earthquakes but significant damage to cables was observed during the 2010–2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence in New Zealand. This study estimates Poisson repair rates, similar to those in existence for pipelines, using damage data retrieved from part of the electric power distribution network in the city of Christchurch. The functions have been developed separately for four seismic hazard zones: no liquefaction, all liquefaction effects, liquefaction-induced settlement only, and liquefaction-induced lateral spread. In each zone six different intensity measures (IMs) are tested, including peak ground velocity as a measure of ground shaking and five metrics of permanent ground deformation: vertical differential, horizontal, maximum, vector mean and geometric mean. The analysis confirms that the vulnerability of buried cables is influenced more by liquefaction than by ground shaking, and that lateral spread causes more damage than settlement alone. In areas where lateral spreading is observed, the geometric mean permanent ground deformation is identified as the best performing IM across all zones when considering both variance explained and uncertainty. In areas where only settlement is observed, there is only a moderate correlation between repair rate and vertical differential permanent ground deformation but the estimated model error is relatively small and so the model may be acceptable. In general, repair rates in the zone where no liquefaction occurred are very low and it is possible that repairs present in this area result from misclassification of hazard observations, either in the raw data or due to the approximations of the geospatial analysis. Along with hazard intensity, insulation material is identified as a critical factor influencing cable fragility, with paper-insulated lead covered armoured cables experiencing considerably higher repair rates than cross-linked polyethylene cables. The analysis shows no trend between cable age and repair rates and the differences in repair rates between conducting materials is shown not to be significant. In addition to repair rate functions, an example of a fragility curve suite for cables is presented, which may be more useful for analysis of network connectivity where cable functionality is of more interest than the number of repairs. These functions are one of the first to be produced for the prediction of damage to buried cables."
Trends in accumulation of pharmacologically important antioxidant-secondary metabolites in callus cultures of Linum usitatissimum L.,"Linum usitatissimum: L. is well-known for production of pharmacologically important secondary metabolites. Due to their tremendous beneficial effects on human health, these compounds are receiving greater attention throughout the World, especially in the treatment of various types of cancers. In present study, we have developed an efficient protocol for production of lignans like secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) and lariciresinol diglucoside (LDG) and neo-lignans like dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol glucoside (DCG) and guaiacylglycerol-β-coniferyl alcohol ether glucoside (GGCG) by exploiting in vitro callus cultures of Flax. These cultures were established from stem and leaf explants, inoculated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) media supplemented with various concentrations of α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), thidiazuron (TDZ) and 6-benzyl adenine (BA). Results revealed that the leaf-derived calli (1.0 mg/l NAA) accumulated highest levels of biomass (DW; 15.7 g/l) and antioxidant activity, while highest production of total phenolics (111.09 mg/l) and flavonoids (45.02 mg/l) were observed in stem-derived calli (1.0 mg/l NAA). The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed that the stem-derived calli (1.0 mg/l NAA) accumulated optimum concentrations of SDG (2.7 ± 0.021 mg/g DW), LDG (9.8 ± 0.062 mg/g DW) and DCG (13.8 ± 0.076 mg/g DW), while leaf-derived calli (1.0 mg/l NAA) showed optimum accumulation of GGCG (3.8 ± 0.022 mg/g DW) as compared to all other treatments. These results provided definite evidence that the NAA differentially influence the production of lignans and neo-lignans in callus culture of Flax. This study opens new dimensions to devise strategies to enhance the production of these valuable metabolites."
Case study of the implications of climate change for lichen diversity and distributions,"There is ample evidence for species distributional changes in response to recent climate change, but most studies are biased toward better known taxa. Thus, an integrated approach is needed that includes the “cryptic diversity” represented partly by lichens, which are among the most sensitive organisms to environmental change due to their physiological characteristics. The use of functional traits and ecological attributes may improve the interpretation of how species respond to climate change. Thus, we quantified the future climate change impacts on 41 lichen species distributed in the Iberian Peninsula using ensemble climatic suitability maps (derived from generalized linear and generalized additive models, and classification and regression tree analysis) and different metrics. We also determined the lichen traits/attributes that might be related to a shared response to climate change. The results indicated a loss of bioclimatic space for 75% of the species studied and an increase for 10 species, especially in Mediterranean ones. Most of the species that will lose more than 70% of their current modeled distribution area comprised big macrolichens with cyanobacteria as the photobiont, thereby indicating a great biomass loss in forests, which might affect nutrient cycles. We also found that the predicted distributions were trait-related. Smaller species, green-algae lichens, and saxicolous and epiphyte species will respond better to future climate change. The results of this type of study may help to identify the species that are most vulnerable to climate change and facilitate the development of conservation measures to avoid their decline."
SBA-Pr-SO3H: an efficient catalyst for the combinatorial synthesis of functionalized 2-aryl-4-quinazolinones using unusual γ-amino acids,"SBA-Pr-SO3H was found as a nanocatalyst for the cyclocondensation of isatoic anhydride, aromatic aldehydes and γ-amino acids (gabapentin and baclofen) to access novel 2-aryl-4-quinazolinone γ-amino acid derivatives in solvent-free reaction conditions in good to high yields. Compared to the classical approaches, this process is a simple, highly yielding, time saving, and environmentally friendly method."
"4-Phenylsulfonyl-2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine: synthesis and synthetic utility","4-Phenylsulfonyl-2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine was synthesized from the reaction of sodium phenylsulfinate with pentachloropyridine in optimized reaction condition. The reaction of some mono- and bidentate N and O nucleophiles with 4-phenylsulfonyl-2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine was studied in order to assess the impact of electron-withdrawing functional group (PhSO2−) upon regiochemistry of aromatic nucleophilic substitution. Substitution generally occurs at 4-position of pyridine ring, by less steric hindrance nucleophiles although mixtures of products (ortho- and para-substituted) are obtained with more steric hindrance cases. The structures of all the compounds were confirmed by IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy as well as elemental analysis and X-ray crystallography."
Impact of Higher Frequency Content of Input Motion Upon Equivalent Linear Site Response Analysis for the Study Area of Delhi,"While travelling through the subsoil layers, earthquake generated bedrock motions get modified significantly due to local soil and should be quantified using ground response analysis. Present study concentrates on equivalent linear method of site response analysis in SHAKE2000 software. It is a frequency based analysis tool having default frequency set to 15 Hz. While due consideration is given to amplitude, no to very limited information about the frequency content of the input motion to be considered in ground response analysis is available. In the present work, the effect of the maximum frequency of ground motion in site response analysis using SHAKE2000 is examined. Two sets of analyses are carried out in this work based on 30 globally recorded input motions. In the first analyses, input motion up to 15 Hz maximum frequency, which is a default value in SHAKE2000 is considered while second analyses are based on considering each of the 30 input motions up to the Nyquist frequency. Comparing the results from the two sets of analyses highlight that selection of maximum frequency in SHAKE2000 has considerable effect in ground motion amplification at different depths. As a result, even the peak ground acceleration which controls the building behavior and damage scenario, is going to change considerably even in case same input motion is used in the analysis."
Inflorescence and floral development in Trochodendron aralioides (Trochodendraceae),"In the early development of Trochodendron aralioides (Trochodendraceae) inflorescences lateral flowers are initiated after the appearance of the floral pherophylls (subtending bracts). The terminal flower is preceded by metaxyphylls and is initiated earlier than the uppermost lateral flowers of the botryoid inflorescence. Small scales (interpreted as rudimentary perianth organs) precede the stamens. These scales are more distinct in the terminal flower than in the lateral flowers. In the radially symmetrical terminal flower, small scales (or metaxyphylls) and stamens are initiated in a spiral during early development. At anthesis, stamen phyllotaxis appears irregular or approximately whorled as a result of the rapid elongation and irregular slight curvature of the stamen filaments which distorts the originally regular pattern. Finally, the numerous carpels arise simultaneously in a single whorl. It takes about 9 months for flowers to develop and the 2-year reproductive cycle of T. aralioides is typical of many trees. The floral development of T. aralioides is compared with that of other basal eudicots. The bottle-shaped, unicellular stigmatic papillae and long, decurrent stigma of basally united carpels are similar to those of the Buxales¸ suggesting a close relationship."
Elliptic inequalities with \(L^1\) data in Musielak–Orlicz spaces,"In this paper, we prove a Poincaré inequality in Musielak–Orlicz spaces under the assumption that the Musielak function depends only on \(N-1\) coordinates of the spatial variable x. We will use this inequality to show the existence of solutions for some elliptic inequalities with lower order terms and \(L^1\) data in Musielak–Orlicz spaces."
Electron-Spin Relaxation Measurements of Biological [2Fe-2S] Cluster System in View of Electron Spin Quantum Bits,"At 20 K, as long as \(T_m\sim 800-1000\) ns were measured for the [2Fe-2S] cluster in its intrinsic protein environment. Such relaxations are a relatively long coherence time for the low-spin \(S=1/2\) system. For this biological cluster, the phase memory time was found significantly affected by the nuclear hyperfine interactions of \(^{14}\)N with \(I=1\). When labeling the surrounding ligands with the \(^{15}\)N isotope uniformly, \(T_m\) are enhanced between \({\sim }1.1-1.4~\upmu\)s at the canonical orientations. This is already an order of magnitude longer than the duration of a single-spin qubit manipulation \({\sim }10-100\) ns. While \(T_1\) are of the order of \({\sim }130\)
\(\upmu\)s at the canonical orientations, the transient nutation experiments reflect on the coherent manipulation of the electron spin."
"Analysis of information quality requirements in business processes, revisited","Many business processes (BPs) involving critical decision-making activities require good-quality information for their successful enactment. Despite this fact, existing BP approaches focus on control flow and ignore the complementary information perspective, or simply treat it as a technical issue, rather than a social and organizational one. To tackle this problem, we propose a comprehensive framework for modeling and analyzing information quality requirements for business processes using the WFA-net BP modeling language. In addition, we describe a prototype implementation and present two realistic examples concerning the stock market domain, intended to illustrate our approach

The role of immobilized rennet on carbon cloth in flavor development during ripening of Gouda cheese,"Rennet-free Gouda (RFG) cheese was prepared to investigate the influence of rennet on the non-volatile and volatile profiles of cheese and was characterized by HPLC and GC/MS analyses. Chymosin, a major protease in rennet, was immobilized onto oxidized and chemically modified carbon cloth. The chymosin immobilization efficiency was 60.4%, and the milk-clotting activity used as an index of the stability of the immobilized chymosin decreased by around 20% in 2 weeks. However, the activity was maintained at 70–80% from 2 weeks to 32 weeks and was more stable than that of chymosin solution alone. Non-volatile (organic acids) and volatile profiles of the RFG cheese and rennet-containing normal Gouda cheese were not significantly different during ripening with a few exceptions. Therefore, it can be concluded that cheese flavor is developed by lactic acid fermentation, irrespective of the presence of rennet."
Effect of genotype on the physicochemical and functional attributes of faba bean (Vicia faba L.) protein isolates,"The functionality and surface characteristics of protein isolates prepared from seven genotypes of faba bean were investigated. All factors studied were independent of genotype. The average protein and isolate (~94% protein) yields were ~77% and ~25%, respectively, using an alkaline extraction process followed by isoelectric precipitation. The overall averages were: surface charge +22.1 mV, surface hydrophobicity 47.2 arbitrary units, and surface and interfacial tensions of 65.0 mN/m and 10.7 mN/m, respectively. The ratio of the major globulin fractions (legumin:vicilin) shifted from 3.8 for the flours to 4.5 in the isolates. Average values for foaming capacity and stability, emulsion capacity, creaming stability, oil holding capacity, emulsifying activity and stability indices, and solubility were 162.0%, 65.0%, 184.0 g/g, 94.0%, 5.7 g/g, 13.0 m2/g, 10.7 min, and 81.0%, respectively. The lack of significant varietal effects would be advantageous to food processors as the source of the feedstock would not affect ingredient functionality."
Protective effect of gallic acid on the thermal oxidation of corn and soybean oils during high temperature heating,"The comparative protective effects of gallic acid with well-known synthetic antioxidants (tert-butylhydroquinone, butylated hydroxylanisole, propylgallate) on the thermal oxidations of corn and soybean oils during heating for 8 h at 180°C were studied. The quantitative effects of gallic acid at three different concentrations on the time-course thermal oxidations in the two different vegetable oils were also studied for a prolonged heating of 6 days at 180°C. Gallic acid at 200 ppm exhibited higher protective activity than the synthetic antioxidants at the same concentration. Gallic acid also exhibited persistently strong protective activity, in a concentration dependent manner, on the changes in oxidation indices in corn and soybean oils throughout the prolonged heating period (6 days) at 180°C. The present results clearly suggested that gallic acid would be a potential natural substitute of synthetic antioxidants for the protection of vegetable oils during high temperature heating."
Comparative evaluation of free radical scavenging activities and cytotoxicity of various solvent fractions of Sandong Sageretia thea (Osbeck) M.C. Johnst. branches,"Sageretia thea (Osbeck) M.C.Johnst., an evergreen tender shrub of the Rhamnaceae, has been used as folk medicine and in traditional tea. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the free radical scavenging activity and cell cytotoxicity of S. thea branches. The ethyl acetate fraction and n-butanol fraction were identified to be rich in phenolic compounds exhibiting impressive antioxidant activity after stepwise partitioning of solvent fractions of the methanol extracts of S. thea branches (MB). Among the different human cancer cells tested, maximum cytotoxicity was found in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells with MB, chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and water fraction. A significant (p<0.05) correlation between antioxidant activities and cytotoxicity exists in each fraction. These results suggest the branches of S. thea can be a valuable source of antioxidants, and they can serve as natural anticancer constituents in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications."
A GC-MS based metabolic profiling of fermented sausage supplemented with pineapple,"A GC-MS based metabolomic study was performed to understand metabolic changes during sausage fermentation and to investigate how the incorporation of pineapple affects the metabolic profiles of fermented sausages. Principal component analysis models showed clear metabolic differences among the fermented sausages according to the fermentation periods and the pineapple addition. Increased amounts of amino acids and organic acids except for citric acid, along with decreased levels of sugars were observed after fermentation. Higher levels of sugars and citric acid in the pineapple supplemented sausages dramatically decreased during the early stage of fermentation. The contents of lactic acid, phosphoric acid, succinic acid, ribonic acid, valine, leucine, isoleucine, glycine, threonine, glutamic acid, glucose, and sucrose were significantly increased in the 2% pineapple addition sausages. GC-MS and PCA analytical methods provide a new approach to understand of the metabolic changes in fermented sausages during fermentation."
Evaluating a dual-frequency-phase-shift soil moisture and electrical conductivity sensor,"For soil water and solute transport research, time domain reflectometry (TDR) has been commonly used since its introduction to soil research in 1980 by Topp and his colleagues. Although TDR seems to be very versatile for laboratory and field experiments, it requires modest user skills for accurate measurements and the instrument itself is still expensive. A new soil moisture and electrical conductivity (EC) sensor was recently developed at a reduced cost. The new sensor independently measures soil water content, and soil bulk electrical conductivity using frequency phase-shift techniques, and soil temperatures using a thermistor. We evaluated the new sensor for measurements of water content, and EC using three different sensors in variably saturated soils. There was little deviation among the units for water content measurement except at near saturation. Separate exponential curves provided good calibrations for all the soils used in the full range of water content between air-dry and saturation. In saline water up to 54 mS m−1, the mV output in the EC measurement mode was linearly related to solution EC. Although slopes were quite similar among the three sensors, the intercepts differed from the manufacturer’s calibration. The calibrations for volumetric water content and electrical conductivity provided by the manufacturer were not good enough for any use. The temperature effect on volumetric water content could be negligible or easily compensated with a simple formula. Little EC dependency of the sensor on volumetric water content was observed."
As contamination alters rhizosphere microbial community composition with soil type dependency during the rice growing season,"Rhizosphere microbes play a cardinal role in transformation and crop uptake of arsenic (As), thereby relieving or intensifying the risk of As contamination in the food webs. How rhizosphere microbiomes respond to As contamination in different paddy soils and rice growth stages is still unclear. Here, we conducted a rice pot experiment to address the effects of rice developmental stage and As contamination on the rhizosphere microbial communities in two contrast paddy soils, a yellow clayey paddy soil (YP, pH 5.1, soil organic matter 20.8 g/kg) and red paddy soil (RP, pH 6.2, soil organic matter 46.1 g/kg). The rhizosphere microbial communities were investigated using phospholipid fatty acids analysis at tillering, panicle initiation, and maturity stages. The results showed that rice growing in YP soil accumulated 2-10 times higher contents of As in root than that in RP soil. There was a significant effect of rice growing stage, independent of soil types and As treatment, on rhizosphere microbial community composition in both YP and RP soils as depicted by canonical correspondence analysis. As contamination significantly altered rhizosphere microbial community composition only in YP soil, which showed the soil type dependency of the As contamination effect. In RP soil, the higher content of soil organic matter reduced the impact of As contamination. Soil pH explained more percentage of variation in microbial community composition than soil DOC and DON did. These influences of soil physiochemical properties on heavy metal available and rhizosphere microbial community may lay the foundation for exploration of bioremediation potential."
Enhancing learning outcomes through self-regulated learning support with an Open Learner Model,"Open Learner Models (OLMs) have great potential to support students’ Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). Yet few classroom experiments have been conducted to empirically evaluate whether and how an OLM can enhance students’ domain level learning outcomes through the scaffolding of SRL processes in an ITS. In two classroom experiments with a total of 302 7th- and 8th-grade students, we investigated the effect of (a) an OLM that supports students’ self-assessment of their equation-solving skills and (b) shared control over problem selection, on students’ equation-solving abilities, enjoyment of learning with the tutor, self-assessment accuracy, and problem selection decisions. In the first, smaller experiment, the hypothesized main effect of the OLM on students’ learning outcomes was confirmed; we found no main effect of shared control of problem selection, nor an interaction. In the second, larger experiment, the hypothesized main effects were not confirmed, but we found an interaction such that the students who had access to the OLM learned significantly better equation-solving skills than their counterparts when shared control over problem selection was offered in the system. Thus, the two experiments support the notion that an OLM can enhance students’ domain-level learning outcomes through scaffolding of SRL processes, and are among the first in-vivo classroom experiments to do so. They suggest that an OLM is especially effective if it is designed to support multiple SRL processes."
Seismic response analysis of self-anchored suspension bridge with multi-tower,"Seismic performance of a self-anchored suspension bridge with three-tower were investigated. A three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model of the bridge was developed using Sap2000. Nonlinear time history analysis was conducted using Fast Nonlinear Analysis Method (FNA), while beam-column effect and nonlinear behavior of bearing and damper were taken into consideration. The analyze results showed that the middle tower was more vulnerable compared with the two side towers; there existed risk of buckling of composite beam, and the most vulnerable part lied near steel-concrete composite segment. Viscous dampers were effective to reduce seismic response of towers as well as girders."
The impact vibration-based fatigue damage assessment of steel and steel fiber reinforced concrete composite girder,"The steel-concrete composite girder has been usually applied in the civil structures. The current fatigue damage assessment on the composite girder, especially the negative bending region, mainly bases on the crack observation and deflection measurement. It is not stable sometimes, thus the impact vibration-based fatigue damage assessment was considered instead. A 3.3m steel-steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) composite girder was designed and tested. The fatigue load, the impact load, and the static load were applied in the test. It showed that the local fatigue damage reflected by the tensile SFRC cracks may not be easily evaluated through observing the global mechanical change. However, the vibration modal parameters such as the vibration frequency, vibration mode, damping ratio might be useful for this. In particular, the vibration mode variation, which can be expressed by the Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) value, may reflect the local fatigue damage on the composite girder."
Prediction of cyclic behavior of WUF-W connections with various weld access hole configurations using nonlinear FEA,"The welded unreinforced flange-welded web (WUF-W) moment connection is one of seven prequalified connections for the special moment frames (SMF) specified in AISC 358-10. Previous studies reported that some WUF-W connections with a steep access hole slope failed before completing a loading cycle of 4% drift ratio. For investigating in detail the effect of access hole geometry including access hole slopes on the connection behavior, experimental tests require excessive costs and efforts because there are the large number of combinations of configuration parameters for access hole geometry. In this study, the cyclic behavior of WUF-W connections is evaluated using three-dimensional nonlinear finite element (FE) analyses with an adequate solid element and failure index. Based on the results of FEA, the effect of configuration parameters on the connection behavior is investigated."
Assessment of vibration serviceability for steel cable-stayed bridges using GNSS data,"Assessment of deflection and vibration serviceability is important for flexible structures such as long-span bridges. The purpose of deflection criteria in bridge design is to ensure user-comfort and structural safety by evaluating hazardous vibrations. The vibration of the bridge is mainly due to vehicular or wind loading. The objective of this study is to evaluate or assess the deflection and vibration serviceability by vehicular loading of steel cable stayed bridge based on experimental and theoretical studies. The test bridge is a cable-stayed bridge with a steel box girder and a main span length of 240 m. The bridge maintenance authority measures the deflection of the bridge using the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) in real-time. Accelerometers are also installed for the test, and measurements were performed for both a test truck and under normal traffic conditions. Measured data are compared with the theoretical values and evaluated against the deflection and/or vibration design criteria and other relevant research results. The results of this study can be used to provide a basis for deflection criterion in long-span bridges."
Numerical study on temperature distribution of high-strength concrete-filled steel tubes subjected to a fire,"High-strength concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) columns offer a number of benefits and are widely used in high-rise building construction. This paper presents a brand new thermal modeling approach in comparison with tremendous test data for the heat transfer analysis. A heat transfer model has been developed to predict the thermal response of high-strength CFST columns under standard fire conditions with consideration of a number of parameters: steel and furnace emissivity, thermal interface conductance and concrete strength. The verified numerical models discussed the variation of emissivity of steel surfaces and thermal interface conductance in fire. It can be concluded that the influence of emissivity and thermal interface conductance is considerable in the numerical analysis. It is also demonstrated that thermal behavior of high-strength CFST columns subjected to fire during heating and cooling stages, and providing the guidance on predicting thermal response of high-strength concrete-filled steel tube columns."
A reconciliation of experimental and analytical results for piping systems,"This paper is focused on developing experimentally validated models of piping components as well as a complete two story piping system. The damage in a piping system is characterized in terms of “First Leakage” based on the observations made in laboratory experiments. Monotonic and cyclic testing for pipe components of various sizes shows that the limit-state for leakage is governed predominantly by flexural deformations at the threaded and groove fit T-joints. As a first step in the validation process, the nonlinear models for the flexural behavior of T-joints are reconciled with the experimental results. Next, the validated component models are incorporated in the piping model for a two story sprinkler system. The system level piping model is then integrated with ceiling systems that interact with sprinkler heads. The complex piping ceiling system model is validated by comparison with the corresponding experimental data."
Energy dissipation capacity of an unstiffened extended end-plate connection with a SMA plate,"The unstiffened extended end-plate connection exhibits different behavioral characteristics and energy dissipation capacities depending on the thickness of the end-plate and the change in the gauge distance of the high-strength bolts. In particular, the energy dissipation capacity of the unstiffened extended end-plate connection is affected by the failure modes of the connection: the beam failure mode and the connection failure mode. That is, the energy dissipation capacity varies depending on the case, where the failure is caused by the occurrence of plastic hinges acting like fuses in the beam ends, and the failure results from the plastic deformation after the flexural yielding of the end-plate. This study was conducted to design and construct the connection in such a way that it could provide sufficient strength, stiffness, and energy dissipation capacity in response to the fracture of the connection that may occur in case of an emergency, by inducing a position where the plastic hinge fuse occurs in the end-plate of the connection. For the evaluation of the energy dissipation capacity of the connection, a three-dimensional nonlinear finite-element analysis of the unstiffened extended end-plate connection was performed by changing the thickness of the end-plates. The finite-element analysis results showed that the energy dissipation capacity increased when the thickness of each end-plate decreased, and that the residual deformation did not occur when an SMA end-plate was installed instead of the end-plate with the conventional SN steel applied."
Direct shear strength of rebar-coupler anchor systems for steel-plate composite (SC) walls,"This paper focuses on the direct shear behavior of rebar-coupler anchor systems, and their use for anchorage of steel-plate composite (SC) walls to the concrete basemat of safety-related nuclear facilities. Large-scale rebar-coupler anchor specimens were tested under direct shear loading until failure. The results included the applied load-slip displacement responses of the specimens, the direct shear strength, and the observed failure mode. The American Concrete Institute (ACI) 349 code equation for calculating the direct shear strength of embedded anchors was compared with the direct shear strengths from the tests. The code equation underestimated the direct shear strength of the anchor system, because shear failure was assumed to occur in the rebars, whereas experimental observations indicated that shear fracture failure occurred in the couplers rather than the rebars. The design equation was updated to utilize the net shear area of the couplers instead of the rebars, after which the direct shear strengths from the tests could be calculated with reasonable accuracy. The experimental results were also used to propose an empirical model for the shear force vs. slip displacement response of rebar-coupler anchor systems."
Experimental study and numerical simulation on steel plate shear walls with non-uniform spacing slits,"Numerous experimental and finite element studies have shown that steel plate shear walls with slits have several beneficial characteristics, such as good ductility and excellent energy dissipation capacity, which make them a feasible lateral load resisting and energy dissipation system for high-rise buildings in high seismic regions. The width of the flexural links between slits has a significant effect on the mechanical behavior and hysteretic performance of steel plate shear walls with slits. This paper presented two kinds of steel plate shear walls with non-uniform spacing slits (SPWNS) and investigated their performance under low-cycle loading based on tests and finite element software. The study mainly focused on the ultimate bearing capacity, the lateral stiffness, the energy dissipation capacity and the ductility of SPWNS. The results from numerical analysis and test study were compared with each other. The ultimate bearing capacity and the lateral stiffness of traditional steel plate shear walls with uniform spacing slits (SPWUS) were similar to that of SPWNS. In contrast, the ductility and the energy dissipation capacity of SPWUS were much higher."

 denoting, respectively, the nitroxide rings 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-imidazoline and 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-N–oxide imidazoline, have been studied by X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Variations of the intramolecular electron spin exchange in these biradicals dissolved in ethanol and the room temperature ionic liquid bmimBF4 were characterized as a function of temperature by means of the analysis of the EPR lines shape. Thermodynamic parameters of the conformational rearrangements in ethanol were calculated. Analyzing the EPR spectra of these biradicals in bmimBF4, it was revealed that the two-conformational model does not describe their conformational transitions. Moreover, the observed EPR spectra are not central symmetric especially at low temperatures that cannot be described and explained in the framework of the current theory of the intramolecular spin exchange. Probable reasons of this “strange” behavior are discussed."
Testing Local Adaptation in Five Populations of Hyalella azteca in Northern Alberta’s Oil Sands Region,"Canada’s oil sands hold the third largest petroleum reserves worldwide and have experienced rapid economic growth. The oil sands region provides an ideal location for studying local adaptations through reciprocal transplant (RT) because populations within the region have been historically exposed to naturally occurring bitumen. Our objectives were to (1) determine if Hyalella azteca from habitats within the oil sands region exhibited increased tolerance to constituents associated with industrial bitumen extraction compared with H. azteca from habitats outside the region; and (2) determine if any observed tolerance was attributable to local adaptation. Five populations of H. azteca were reciprocally transplanted from reclaimed and reference wetlands: four from local wetlands plus one naïve laboratory population. Survival, toxicity, and behaviour were measured before and after the RT period. Survival varied by population and site. These results show that the differences in responses among populations are likely not attributable to local adaptation and that laboratory populations of H. azteca provide ecologically relevant results when tested in the field."
A-optimal convolutional neural network,"In this paper, we propose a novel data representation-classification model learning algorithm. The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN), and we learn its parameters to achieve A-optimality. The input multi-instance data are represented by a CNN model, and then classified by a linear classification model. The A-optimality of a classification model is measured by the trace of the covariance matrix of the model parameter vector. To achieve the A-optimality of the CNN model, we minimize the classification errors and a regularization term to present the classification model parameter as a function of the CNN filter parameters, and minimize its trace of the covariance matrix. We show that the minimization problem can be solved easily by transferring it to another coupled minimization problem. In the experiments over benchmark data sets of molecular, image, and seismic waveform, we show the advantages of the proposed A-optimal CNN model."
An archive-based artificial bee colony optimization algorithm for multi-objective continuous optimization problem,"Research on multi-objective optimization (MO) has become one of the hot points of intelligent computation. In this paper, an archive-based multi-objective artificial bee colony optimization algorithm (AMOABC) is proposed, in which an external archive is used to preserve the current obtained non-dominated best solutions, and a novel Pareto local search mechanism is designed and incorporated into the optimization process. To prevent the searching process from being trapped into local minimum, a novel food source generating mechanism is put forward, and different search strategies are designed for bees and local search process. Comprehensive benchmarking and comparison of AMOABC with the some current-related MO algorithms demonstrate its effectiveness."
Circular autocorrelation of stationary circular Markov processes,"The stationary Markov process is considered and its circular autocorrelation function is investigated. More specifically, the transition density of the stationary Markov circular process is defined by two circular distributions, and we elucidate the structure of the circular autocorrelation when one of these distributions is uniform and the other is arbitrary. The asymptotic properties of the natural estimator of the circular autocorrelation function are derived. Furthermore, we consider the bivariate process of trigonometric functions and provide the explicit form of its spectral density matrix. The validity of the model was assessed by applying it to a series of wind direction data."
Ranking and Prioritization of Emergency Departments Based on Multi-indicator Systems,"In this work we discuss how Emergency Departments (EDs) can be ranked on the basis of multiple indicators. This problem is of absolute relevance due to the increasing importance of EDs in regional healthcare systems and it is also complex as the number of indicators that have been proposed in the literature to measure ED performance is very high. Current literature faces this problem using synthetic (or numerically aggregated) indicators of a set of performance measures but, although simple, this solution has a number of drawbacks that make this choice inefficient: a compensation effect among the indicators; a high degree of subjectivism in the indicators weighting; opacity in the decision making; all the EDs are considered to be comparable. Indeed, the situations in which EDs are comparable (i.e. when all the performance of one ED are not lower than the performance indicators of the other) are a minority and incomparability is by itself a source of information that should be used to identify situations for which different policy actions should be designed. In this work we propose to use non compensatory composite indicators and partial ordering theory to rank and compare EDs giving value to the reasons of such an incomparability. These methods are applied on a case study of 19 EDs in an administrative region in Italy."
"Design, synthesis and evaluation of 5-substituted 1-H-tetrazoles as potent anticonvulsant agents","A series of 5-substituted 1-H-tetrazoles were designed and synthesized as potent anticonvulsant agents. Their preliminary anticonvulsant activities were evaluated using maximal electroshock and subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole (scPTZ) seizure tests. Neurotoxicity was determined using rotarod test. The results indicated that the compound 2j in scPTZ model exhibited the ED50 values of 83.3 mg/kg, superior to the standard drug ethosuximide with the maximum activity. In addition, compound 2k showed the most potent activity in MES model with ED50 value of 9.6 mg/kg and TD50 value of 189.5 mg/kg after intraperitoneal injection in mice, and displayed a high protective index (TD50/ED50) of 19.7 compared to reference antiepileptic drugs."
Development of a Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modelling Approach to Predict the Pharmacokinetics of Vancomycin in Critically Ill Septic Patients,"Sepsis is characterised by an excessive release of inflammatory mediators substantially affecting body composition and physiology, which can be further affected by intensive care management. Consequently, drug pharmacokinetics can be substantially altered. This study aimed to extend a whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for healthy adults based on disease-related physiological changes of critically ill septic patients and to evaluate the accuracy of this PBPK model using vancomycin as a clinically relevant drug."
Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity plays no functional role in stem cell-like properties in anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines,"Recent studies have revealed that aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is a candidate marker for thyroid cancer stem cells, although its activity is flexible. The goal of this study is to clarify the functional significance of ALDH enzymatic activity on thyroid cancer stem cells properties in anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines. In vitro sphere formation assay was used to judge the stemness of 4 anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines (FRO, ACT1, 8505C, and KTC3). Two well-known ALDH inhibitors, N,N-diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) and disulfiram (DS), were first used. DEAB (50 μM) almost completely suppressed ALDH activity without affecting cell proliferation or spherogenicity. Lack of effect of ALDH suppression on spherogenicity was confirmed using shRNA for ALDH1A3, an ALDH isozyme predominantly expressed in anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines. In contrast, an ALDH2 inhibitor DS (1 μM) inhibited spherogenicity but did not inhibit ALDH1A3 activity. Based on the recent article from another group reporting the importance of sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in ALDH activity and spherogenicity in thyroid cancer, the effects of the Shh inhibitor cyclopamine were also studied. Like DS, cyclopamine (1 μM) decreased spherogenicity but not ALDH activity. Finally, exogenous expression of ALDH1A3 in otherwise ALDH− TPC1 cells (a papillary thyroid cancer cell line) revealed no effect on spherogenicity. In conclusion, we here show no functional role for ALDH activity in thyroid thyroid cancer stem cells properties. That is, ALDH activity and spherogenicity are clearly dissociable. Further understanding of thyroid cancer stem cells biology in thyroid cancers remains necessary for the future development of thyroid thyroid cancer stem cells-targeted therapies."
Tax evasion in a Cournot oligopoly with endogenous entry,"If an additional competitor reduces output per firm in a homogenous Cournot oligopoly, market entry will be excessive. Taxes can correct the so-called business stealing externality. We investigate how evading a tax on operating profits affects the excessive entry prediction. Tax evasion raises the number of firms in market equilibrium and can alter their welfare-maximising number. In consequence, evasion can aggravate or mitigate excessive entry. Which of these outcomes prevails is determined by the direct welfare consequences of tax evasion and the relationship between evasion and the tax base. We also determine conditions which imply that overall welfare declines with tax evasion."
Bio-nano interactions: cellulase on iron oxide nanoparticle surfaces,"Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs) may well represent the most promising magnetic nanostructures for a plethora of applications in health, life and environmental science. IONs are already used in medicine, catalysis and downstream processing of biotechnological products. Since most particles, utilized industrially, need expensive coatings, the application of bare nanoparticles seems economically worthwhile. In this study, three different ION species were synthesized by co-precipitation methods without stabilizing agents and were thoroughly characterized with a multi-analytical approach. We emphasize the importance of the particle characterization as transitions of the ION polymorphs into each other are possible as well as merging of distinct properties. The particle sizes, which here range from 10 to 30 nm, and the magnetic properties of IONs are crucial for the further application. The adsorption behavior of the enzyme cellulase (CEL) as a model protein is investigated on the different IONs in order to gain deeper insights into bio-nano interactions to different surface sites, charges, curvatures and morphologies, as given by the three applied adsorber materials. The protein-particle interactions are driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic forces in the case of CEL. The CEL adsorption follows a Langmuir behavior and does not exceed maximum loads of around 0.6 g g−1. IR spectroscopy gives insights into the orientation of bound CEL and indicates a stronger affinity for the β-sheet tertiary structure content while a higher load can be reached with a higher α-helix content."
A validated model of passive skeletal muscle to predict force and intramuscular pressure,"The passive properties of skeletal muscle are often overlooked in muscle studies, yet they play a key role in tissue function in vivo. Studies analyzing and modeling muscle passive properties, while not uncommon, have never investigated the role of fluid content within the tissue. Additionally, intramuscular pressure (IMP) has been shown to correlate with muscle force in vivo and could be used to predict muscle force in the clinic. In this study, a novel model of skeletal muscle was developed and validated to predict both muscle stress and IMP under passive conditions for the New Zealand White Rabbit tibialis anterior. This model is the first to include fluid content within the tissue and uses whole muscle geometry. A nonlinear optimization scheme was highly effective at fitting model stress output to experimental stress data (normalized mean square error or NMSE fit value of 0.993) and validation showed very good agreement to experimental data (NMSE fit values of 0.955 and 0.860 for IMP and stress, respectively). While future work to include muscle activation would broaden the physiological application of this model, the passive implementation could be used to guide surgeries where passive muscle is stretched."
On the periodic solutions of the Michelson continuous and discontinuous piecewise linear differential system,"Applying new results from the averaging theory for continuous and discontinuous differential systems, we study the periodic solutions of two distinct versions of the Michelson differential system: a Michelson continuous piecewise linear differential system and a Michelson discontinuous piecewise linear differential system. The tools here used can be applied to general nonsmooth differential systems."
Characterization of a Triticum aestivum–Dasypyrum villosum T1VS·6BL translocation line and its effect on wheat quality,"Bread wheat quality is mainly correlated with protein quality, particularly the glutenin content and high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) of grain endosperm. The number of HMW-GS alleles and loci are limited in bread wheat cultivars, though ideally, a large amount of HMW-GS alleles in wheat-related grasses should be exploited. In this study, a novel wheat-Dasypyrum villosum GP005 translocation line, NAU425, carrying a pair of T1VS·6BL translocation chromosomes was developed and assessed via molecular cytogenetic analysis. Grain quality analysis indicated that NAU425 has a positive effect on protein content, Zeleny sedimentation value, wet gluten content, and the rheological characteristics of wheat flour dough compared to the same qualities of recurrent parent ‘Chinese Spring’ attributed to the additional HMW-GS donated by 1VS of D. villosum. The protein content of T1VS·6BL was significantly improved compared to ‘Chinese Spring’ likely owing to the dramatic increase in glutenin content. Considering the importance of glutenin content for bread wheat end-use quality, and T1VS·6BL line with good plant vigor, full fertility and cytogenetic stability, NAU425 may be valuable in bread wheat quality improvement. Our results presented here may provide an approach to improve bread wheat quality through additional alien HMW-GS introgression."
Hierarchical and distributed demand response control strategy for thermostatically controlled appliances in smart grid,"Thermostatically controlled appliances (TCAs) have great thermal storage capability and are therefore excellent demand response (DR) resources to solve the problem of power fluctuation caused by renewable energy. Traditional centralized management is affected by communication quality severely and thus usually has poor real-time control performance. To tackle this problem, a hierarchical and distributed control strategy for TCAs is established. In the proposed control strategy, target assignment has the feature of self-regulating, owing to the designed target assignment and compensating algorithm which can utilize DR resources maximally in the controlled regions and get better control effects. Besides, the model prediction strategy and customers’ responsive behavior model are integrated into the original optimal temperature regulation (OTR-O), and OTR-O will be evolved into improved optimal temperature regulation. A series of case studies have been given to demonstrate the control effectiveness of the proposed control strategy."
Effect of resistance exercise on oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation in trained and untrained men,"Exercise-induced free radical production and damage to cellular macromolecules have been previously documented. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to determine the effects of acute resistance exercise (RE) on the 8-iso PGF2α and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), markers of lipids and DNA oxidation, and whether resistance training status influences these markers of oxidative stress."
Climate-change driven range shifts of anchovy biomass projected by bio-physical coupling individual based model in the marginal seas of East Asia,"Recent studies in the western North Pacific reported a declining standing stock biomass of anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) in the Yellow Sea and a climate-driven southward shift of anchovy catch in Korean waters. We investigated the effects of a warming ocean on the latitudinal shift of anchovy catch by developing and applying individual-based models (IBMs) based on a regional ocean circulation model and an IPCC climate change scenario. Despite the greater uncertainty, our two IBMs projected that, by the 2030s, the strengthened Tsushima warm current in the Korea Strait and the East Sea, driven by global warming, and the subsequent confinement of the relatively cold water masses within the Yellow Sea will decrease larval anchovy biomass in the Yellow Sea, but will increase it in the Korea Strait and the East Sea. The decreasing trend of anchovy biomass in the Yellow Sea was reproduced by our models, but further validation and enhancement of the models is required together with extended ichthyoplankton surveys to understand and reliably project range shifts of anchovy and the impacts such range shifts will have on the marine ecosystems and fisheries in the region."
Modeling the largest inflow of Changjiang freshwater into the Yellow Sea in 2012 with particle-tracking experiment,"Abnormally low-salinity water originating from the Changjiang River (CR) was observed at the central Yellow Sea (YS) in 2012, which was quite unique compared to other years. In this study, the intrusion process of the Changjiang Diluted Water (CDW) into the YS interior was examined using a hindcast simulation (2003–2012) with particle-tracking experiments. The particles representing the behavior of the CDW were released at the CR mouth from May to August, and then tracked. The simulated salinity patterns coincide fairly well with those derived from observations, particularly showing a large low-salinity structure around the central YS in 2012. A substantial intrusion of freshwater into the YS occurred in 2012, and this accounted for approximately 16% of all the released particles in 2012 which is twice as high as the mean average covering the 10 years. According to the trajectories in 2012, the particles took less than 50 days to travel from the mouth to the YS interior and followed mainly two paths toward the YS. One pathway traveled northward to the central entrance of the YS and then reached the western coast of Korea. This pathway was attributed to the strong easterly winds in late June and early August when three consecutive typhoons passed through the YS, which was a unique pattern that is rarely found in other years. The other pathway involved particles trapped along the Jiangsu coast drifting farther to the north up to the Shandon Peninsula against the anticyclonic tidal residual circulations during the passage of typhoons."
Probabilistic seismic hazard assessment for sliding displacement of slopes: an application in Turkey,"Earthquake-induced slope instability is one of the major sources of earthquake hazards in near fault regions. Simplified tools such as Newmark’s sliding block (NSB) analysis are widely used to estimate the sliding displacement of slopes during earthquake shaking. Additionally, empirical models for predicting NSB displacement using single or multiple ground motion intensity measures based on global (e.g. NGA-W1 database, Chiou et al. 2008) or regional datasets are available. The objective of this study is to evaluate the compatibility of candidate NSB displacement prediction models for the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) applications in Turkey using a comprehensive dataset of ground motions recorded during the earthquakes occurred in Turkey. Then, application of the most suitable NSB displacement prediction model in the vector-valued PSHA framework is demonstrated using the seismic source characterization models developed for Bolu-Gerede Region (in northwest Turkey). The results are presented in terms of the NSB displacement hazard curves and the hazard curves are evaluated for the influence of parameter selection (site conditions, yield acceleration, distance to the fault plane, and other seismic source model parameters) on the final hazard output."
Developing hybrid parameters for measuring damage potential of earthquake records: case for RC building stock,"This study investigates the feasibility of using combination of present ground motion parameters to have a hybrid parameter that is more correlated with damage. Since RC buildings constitute the prevailing type of construction in many earthquake prone countries, low and mid-rise RC buildings are targeted in an example study. Displacement demand is assumed to represent the seismic damage. Its mean value is determined for 1056 capacity curves for each of 466 acceleration records. Then an optimization study is performed to select and weight the commonly used ground motion parameters to have a high correlation with displacement demands. Hence, equations for hybrid parameters are defined. It is observed that by combining the ground motion parameters, better results up to 6–28% may be achieved depending on the relevant factors and cases. This approach may be applied to other types of structures, as well. Using this type of case specific hybrid ground motion parameter relations, significant improvements may be obtained for the evaluation and assessment of seismic damage."
On trace formulae of the generalised heat potential operator,"This paper deals with a generalised heat potential for the degenerate (heat) diffusion equation, which satisfies the initial condition with respect to the time variable. An interesting question having several important applications (in general) is what boundary condition can be put on the generalised heat potential on the lateral boundary of the rectangle so that the degenerate diffusion equation complemented by this boundary condition would have a unique solution in the domain still given by the same formula of the generalised heat potential (with the same kernel). This amounts to finding the trace of the generalised heat potential to the lateral boundary of the rectangle. That is in this work a boundary condition for this potential is found. Obtained boundary conditions in the spatial variable will be nonlocal boundary conditions."
Application of new oligomeric plasticizers based on waste poly(ethylene terephthalate) for poly(vinyl chloride) compositions,"In this study, chemical recycling products of waste poly(ethylene terephthalate) with oligoesters were used as new plasticizers for poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). The preparation conditions of the dry blend mixtures of the suspension PVC containing synthesised plasticizers were similar to the conditions of the preparing mixtures with commercial plasticizers. The plasticization efficiency of PVC plasticizers was then examined by analysis of the mechanical, physical and chemical properties, as well as the thermal resistance and migration of plasticizer molecules from polymer matrix. Test results proved that compositions with synthesised oligomeric plasticizers possessed similar or better properties than those containing commercial oligomeric plasticizers and much better properties than those having monomeric plasticizers. Thermal stabilities of the proposed plasticizers were higher than those of the commercial plasticizers either monomeric (bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate) or oligomeric, despite the fact that the synthesised oligoesters did not contain any antioxidant. The best properties, especially low volatility, very good mechanical properties, low migration were resulted of the transesterification of the waste PET with oligoesters based on adipic acid, triethylene glycol and 2-ethylhexanol which were selected as plasticizers synthesised on the technical scale. The tested plasticized PVC compositions possessed very good tear resistance, tensile strength, decrease of weight loss after 168 h at 80 °C and low migration. Processing properties of PVC compositions containing these synthesised plasticizers confirmed their effectiveness in these compositions for extrusion process."
Antixenosis and Antibiosis Resistance in Rice Cultivars against Chilo suppressalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae),"The striped stem borer, Chilo suppressalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is an important pest afflicting rice in most rice-growing countries in the world. Deliniating the categories of resistance in rice genotypes under field conditions could be helpful in managment of this pest. Two categories of resistance, antixenosis and antibiosis, were examined in ten popular and diverse rice genotypes of different origin that had been selected for their resistance to the striped stem borer in a previous study. Significant differences were found between genotypes for the number of egg masses, number of eggs, preference index, larval and pupal weight, larval development time, larval survival rate, larval mine length, and leaf trichome density. It was found that the rice genotypes Novator, A7801, and Nemat had the more pronounced antixenosis-type resistance, whereas AB1 and Shirodi had better antiobiosis-type resistance. Interestingly, the rice genotype AN-74 for which Nemat is the parental line showed both types of resistance and could be effectively used in an integrated pest management of the rice striped stem borer."
Multifractal spectra and multifractal zeta-functions,"We introduce multifractal zetafunctions providing precise information of a very general class of multifractal spectra, including, for example, the multifractal spectra of self-conformal measures and the multifractal spectra of ergodic Birkhoff averages of continuous functions. More precisely, we prove that these and more general multifractal spectra equal the abscissae of convergence of the associated zeta-functions."
Catalytic hydrothermal carbonization of invasive macrophyte Hornwort (Ceratophyllum demersum) for production of hydrochar: a potential biofuel,"Biofuels are environment friendly and economical. First-generation biofuels are made from sugar, starch and vegetable oils, and have an impact on food security, while second generation biofuels are generated from plant or algal material and are greener and sustainable. The present work focused on lab-scale application of hydrothermal carbonization to convert aquatic weed Ceratophyllum demersum into a second-generation biofuel—hydrochar. Hydrothermal carbonization has been carried out with and without catalysts in a high-pressure reactor under subcritical temperatures 240–320 °C, residence times 10–40 min and biomass to water dilution ratios varying from 1:4 to 1:12. Under noncatalytic conditions higher heating value and energy density were highest, 24.11 MJ/kg and 1.64 respectively at temperature of 300 °C and residence time of 30 min. The calorific value of noncatalytic hydrochar was enhanced further, respectively, to 29.0, 27.5 and 26.48 MJ/kg by catalysts KOH, Na2CO3 and acetic acid. Catalytic hydrochar had H/C and O/C atomic ratios of same order as that of high-rank bituminous coal. Van Krevelen diagram indicated KOH to be better catalyst followed by Na2CO3 and acetic acid. Hydrochar yield of 38% obtained in noncatalytic hydrothermal carbonization decreased with catalysts in following order; acetic acid > Na2CO3 > KOH, however, energy density was enhanced in order KOH > Na2CO3 > acetic acid. The research can prove a way forward in the direction of meeting part of global energy demand. At the same time, the problem of secondary pollution caused by piling up and decay of aquatic weeds will also be addressed to."
Chemometric analysis of 137Cs activity and heavy metals distribution in the Tatras’ soil,"The goal of the paper was to determine the activity of 137Cs and 40K radionuclides as well as heavy metals Zn, Cr, Pb in soil samples taken from the Tatra National Park in the south of Poland. The samples were obtained as cores (10 cm in diameter) from the top 10-cm layer of the soil. Each sample was divided into three subsamples (a, b and c), where a was the subsample closest to the surface and c was the deepest one. Activity of the radionuclides was determined by means of gamma spectrometry, while analysis of heavy metals was performed (after microwave digestion) using atomic absorption spectrometry technique. The highest activity of cesium-137 was detected (5112 ± 120 Bq kg−1) in the “a” layer of the core with the peak concentration of cesium-137 (14,452 ± 278 Bq m−2) in the whole soil core. The highest detected concentration of heavy metals was: Zn—52.8 ± 4.4 mg kg−1, Pb—260.1 ± 9.4 mg kg−1, Cr—52.8 ± 4.4 mg kg−1, respectively. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis were used to examine the obtained data. Application of statistical analysis tools allowed specifying the interdependencies between the examined variables."
Treatment of secondary effluents by infiltration-percolation process using sand fortified with activated charcoal,"The main purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of sand/granular activated charcoal mixture medium to treat urban wastewater effluents. Several laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the best combination ratio of sand/activated charcoal which would allow the optimum water purification. A comparative study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of the addition of activated charcoal on infiltration-percolation efficiency. Experiments demonstrated that fortifying sand medium with granular activated charcoal improved the pollutants removal efficiencies. Results showed that a combination ratio of 3:1 (by volume) of sand and granular activated charcoal gave the best depuration efficiency regarding organic matter, nitrogen and orthophosphorous. The mean removal rates of COD, NH4–N and PO4–P were 83.29, 95.85 and 65.21%, respectively. Furthermore, experiments demonstrated that a mixture of sand/activated charcoal in a 3:1 ratio resulted in the optimum oxidation capacity."
Design and implementation of a highly efficient fractional motion estimation for the HEVC encoder,"This paper presents the VLSI architecture and implementation of the highly efficient fractional motion estimation (FME) for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) systems. In this design, the processing sequence of input pixels is highly optimized so that large parts of the hardware resources in the interpolator circuit are shared and the area complexity is greatly reduced. In order to further enhance the efficiency of hardware utilization and to achieve high throughput, the sum of absolute transformed differences circuit is realized using a pipelined time-multiplexing scheme, and the hardware-sharing structure is utilized to reduce the required computation components. Furthermore, comparing to the literature based on HEVC systems, this design enhances the rate-distortion performance by supporting more prediction modes. The proposed design has been synthesized, placed, and routed through cell-based design flow using TSMC 90-nm technology. The post-layout estimations show that, occupying the area complexity of 525.4 kGE, the presented FME architecture achieves 39 frames per second (fps) with resolution of 3840 × 2160 and 29 fps with resolution of 7680 × 4320. In addition, comparing to the prior art that supports 30 fps and the same number of prediction modes, this design achieves a 2 × improvement of hardware efficiency."
Circular autocorrelation of stationary circular Markov processes,"The stationary Markov process is considered and its circular autocorrelation function is investigated. More specifically, the transition density of the stationary Markov circular process is defined by two circular distributions, and we elucidate the structure of the circular autocorrelation when one of these distributions is uniform and the other is arbitrary. The asymptotic properties of the natural estimator of the circular autocorrelation function are derived. Furthermore, we consider the bivariate process of trigonometric functions and provide the explicit form of its spectral density matrix. The validity of the model was assessed by applying it to a series of wind direction data."
Ranking and Prioritization of Emergency Departments Based on Multi-indicator Systems,"In this work we discuss how Emergency Departments (EDs) can be ranked on the basis of multiple indicators. This problem is of absolute relevance due to the increasing importance of EDs in regional healthcare systems and it is also complex as the number of indicators that have been proposed in the literature to measure ED performance is very high. Current literature faces this problem using synthetic (or numerically aggregated) indicators of a set of performance measures but, although simple, this solution has a number of drawbacks that make this choice inefficient: a compensation effect among the indicators; a high degree of subjectivism in the indicators weighting; opacity in the decision making; all the EDs are considered to be comparable. Indeed, the situations in which EDs are comparable (i.e. when all the performance of one ED are not lower than the performance indicators of the other) are a minority and incomparability is by itself a source of information that should be used to identify situations for which different policy actions should be designed. In this work we propose to use non compensatory composite indicators and partial ordering theory to rank and compare EDs giving value to the reasons of such an incomparability. These methods are applied on a case study of 19 EDs in an administrative region in Italy."
Strategies to improve digital service of newspaper utilizing service design methodology,"This study aims to establish the best strategy for digital media services for newspapers. For this purpose, we propose substantive service strategies, such as reorganization of various sections of the page to attract different segments of readers, and improvement of digital advertising products. Different methodologies were used in deriving the best strategy for digital media services for newspapers. First of all, literature related to service design and digital services for newspapers was reviewed, and analysis of digital services in the media, field research, and service modeling were conducted utilizing service design methodology. Consequently, the best service strategy for newspapers in the digital services was derived. It was found that for digital media services for newspapers, it is important to increase direct visits of customers, rather than enhancing loyalty of existing customers. This is because indirect visitors expect professional service that cannot be retrieved through websites. In addition, it is suggested that firms need to respond actively to external environment changes to increase revisit intentions for existing visitors because of the limited experiences provided in their current usages."
Antiplatelet Strategies and Outcomes in Patients with Noncardioembolic Ischemic Stroke from a Real-World Study with a Five-Year Follow-Up,"Aspirin and clopidogrel are both acceptable antiplatelet options for the secondary prevention of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. Associations between Essen Stroke Risk Score (ESRS) and antiplatelet treatment in Chinese patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke were assessed. This retrospective study was taken in a tertiary care hospital located in eastern China. Patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke hospitalized during January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2011, were classified according to ESRS during index stroke hospitalization. Antiplatelet strategy at the time of discharge was categorized as aspirin (100 mg/day) vs. clopidogrel (75 mg/day). Patients received follow-up from July 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015, and the efficacy of clopidogrel and aspirin in different ESRS subgroups was assessed with respect to reducing the risk of a combined vascular event of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, or primary intracranial hemorrhage. Totally, 1175 non-cardiac stroke patients were included, among which 878 patients completed follow-up surveys. Of the patients who completed the follow-up, 458 (52.2%) had an ESRS > 3, and 621 (70.7%) received aspirin. Patients who received clopidogrel tended to be older, and more patients had hypertension, diabetes, and an ESRS > 3 than patients who received aspirin. Over a mean follow-up of 5.2 years, the rate of combined vascular events was 19.3% in the aspirin group and 16.7% in the clopidogrel group. Compared with clopidogrel-treated patients, a significant (P = 0.044) reduction in combined vascular events in aspirin-treated patients was observed in patients with an ESRS ≤ 3 (OR, odds ratio 0.5; 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9). However, a significant (P = 0.002) increase in combined vascular events was observed in patients with an ESRS > 3 (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3 to 3.8). More clopidogrel-treated patients with ESRS < 3 and ESRS = 3 discontinued treatment than their counterparts who took aspirin (P < 0.05). Adverse drug events, such as digestive discomfort and bleeding, were similar. In conclusion, clopidogrel is suggested for patients with an ESRS > 3 and aspirin for patients with an ESRS ≤ 3 for the secondary prevention of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke in Chinese patients."
High-throughput sequencing reveals that pale green lethal disorder in apple (Malus) stimulates stress responses and affects senescence,"Pale green lethal (PGL) is a recessive genetic disorder of apple (Malus) characterized by severe chlorophyll deficiency and seedling lethality. Following germination, seedlings cannot photosynthesize and die at the cotyledon stage. We previously reported that the genetic and biochemical basis of PGL is due to a loss-of-function mutation in a gene required for the biosynthesis of phylloquinone (vitamin K1), a molecule essential for photosynthesis. For the present study, we used Illumina high-throughput RNA sequencing to identify genes differentially regulated between wild-type and PGL cotyledons. Changes in the expression of chlorophyll-related genes alone cannot explain the reduced chlorophyll content of PGL seedlings. However, genes putatively responding to numerous stress-related conditions including carbohydrate starvation, water deficit, and senescence were differentially regulated. This pattern of transcript accumulation suggests PGL seedlings alter many physiological and metabolic processes such as sorbitol metabolism, osmoprotectant production, and abscisic acid activity. The functions of individual genes relating to specific stresses are discussed. These findings provide insight into possible mechanisms PGL seedlings employ during stress response. Pale green lethal disorder may be a useful model for studying abiotic stress and senescence in rosaceous fruit tree species."
Optimization and Rapid Prototyping of Catadioptric Omnidirectional Stereo Sensors,"Omnidirectional stereo imaging provides useful depth information for autonomous navigation. In principle, omnidirectional stereo images can be achieved at a low cost, using a single camera and two curved mirrors, but such systems are not widely deployed. Here we describe the optimization and rapid prototyping of a low-cost omnidirectional stereo sensor for a telepresence robot. We consider single-viewpoint and non-single-viewpoint designs. We present a new way of relaxing single-viewpoint constraints, while retaining the ability to vertically rectify images. We also present a method of optimizing the resulting design to minimize depth errors. However, we show that despite these steps, nonsingle-viewpoint designs produce stereo disparities over a more practical range of distances. The lack of a single viewpoint could potentially introduce distortions that affect stereo matching, but these distortions are removed by projecting rays through the mirror geometry. We also describe a new method for rapid prototyping of curved mirrors using 3D printing and vacuum forming."
"Effect of Gd2O3 addition on mechanical, thermal and shielding properties of Al2O3 ceramics","Gd2O3/Al2O3 ceramic composites with different weight percent of Gd2O3 were prepared by adopting a pressureless sintering approach. The effect of Gd2O3 addition on the phase composition, sintering property, microstructure, bending strength, thermal conductivity and shielding property of the composites was investigated. The results show that the properties of ceramic can be improved greatly by introducing a small amount of Gd2O3, owing to the promotion of reaction between MgO, SiO2 and Al2O3 to produce spinel and forsterite. Compared with ordinary Al2O3 ceramic, the bending strength and thermal conductivity coefficient of Gd2O3/Al2O3 composite with 5 wt% Gd2O3 have increased by 38.03 MPa and 8.95 W/(m K), respectively. When the amount of Gd2O3 surpasses 15 wt%, however, the performances of the composite would become worse for excessive new phases formed in the composite hindering its densification. In addition, screening ratio of the composites for Co-60 gamma rays radiation increases with the addition of Gd2O3. And the Gd2O3/Al2O3 composites also exhibit good mechanical stability when exposed to continuous gamma rays irradiation."
Forecasting economic activity by Bayesian bridge model averaging,"This paper proposes the use of Bayesian model averaging (BMA) as an alternative tool to forecast GDP relative to simple bridge models and factor models. BMA is a computationally feasible method that allows us to explore the model space even in the presence of a large set of candidate predictors. We test the performance of BMA in now-casting by means of a recursive experiment for the euro area and the three largest countries. This method allows flexibility in selecting the information set month by month. We find that BMA-based forecasts produce smaller forecast errors than standard bridge model when forecasting GDP in Germany, France and Italy. At the same time, it also performs as well as medium-scale factor models when forecasting Eurozone GDP."
Development of a Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modelling Approach to Predict the Pharmacokinetics of Vancomycin in Critically Ill Septic Patients,"Sepsis is characterised by an excessive release of inflammatory mediators substantially affecting body composition and physiology, which can be further affected by intensive care management. Consequently, drug pharmacokinetics can be substantially altered. This study aimed to extend a whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for healthy adults based on disease-related physiological changes of critically ill septic patients and to evaluate the accuracy of this PBPK model using vancomycin as a clinically relevant drug."
Revisiting carbon Kuznets curves with endogenous breaks modeling: evidence of decoupling and saturation (but few inverted-Us) for individual OECD countries,"This paper tests for a carbon Kuznets curve (CKC) by examining the carbon emissions per capita–GDP per capita relationship individually, for 21 OECD countries over 1870–2010 using a reduced-form, linear model that allows for multiple endogenously determined breaks. This approach addresses several important econometric and modeling issues, e.g., (1) it is highly flexible and can approximate complicated nonlinear relationships without presuming a priori any particular relationship; (2) it avoids the nonlinear transformations of potentially nonstationary income. For 10 of 14 countries that were ultimately estimated, the uncovered emission–income relationship was either (1) decoupling—where income no longer affected emissions in a statistically significant way, (2) saturation—where the emissions elasticity of income is declining, less than proportional, but still positive, or (3) no transition—where the emissions elasticity of income is (or very near) unity. For only four countries did the emissions–income relationship become negative—i.e., a CKC. In concert with previous work, we conclude that the finding of a CKC is country-specific and that the shared timing among countries is important in income-environment transitions."
Magnetic pulse welding of aluminum to steel using uniform pressure electromagnetic actuator,"The joining of dissimilar metals is required for lightweight structures. The efficient and mechanically robust uniform pressure electromagnetic actuator (UPEA) was used to magnetic pulse welding (MPW) dissimilar metal sheets in this study. This study explored the feasibility of MPW of AA 1060 to Q235 steel sheet. The effects of discharge voltage, vertical gaps between two sheets, and the effect of the width of the joining zone on the connection quality were investigated. The metallurgical joints were obtained under a discharge voltage above 9.5 kV, and the weldability window of AA1060 to Q235 steel sheets was established. Microstructure observations of the MPW joint revealed that the interface of the joint is close to flat. EDS mapping showed mutual diffusion of basic elements across the interface."
Evaluation of microstructure and mechanical properties of dissimilar welding of copper alloy and stainless steel,"The dissimilar welding of copper alloy and stainless steel was achieved with a gas tungsten arc welding method. We evaluated the mechanical properties of the post weld. The experimental results indicated that the tensile stress of the post weld of a CuCrZr/SS and OFHC/SS dissimilar joint achieved 310 and 220 MPa, respectively. The morphology of the fracture surface of the post tensile showed a dimple pattern structure; the microhardness showed a distribution of hardness 70~130 Hv in the fusion zone. Observations with a scanning electron microscope indicated that the Fe and Cr elements of stainless steel were mutually soluble in the copper substrate and confirmed that the dissimilar joint was successfully combined."

"Approximation of Solutions of Fractional-Order Delayed Cellular Neural Network on \(\varvec{[0,\infty )}\)","In this paper, we study a class of fractional-order cellular neural network containing delay. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium solution followed by boundedness. Based on the theory of fractional calculus, we approximate the solution of the corresponding neural network model over the interval \([0,\infty )\) using discretization method with piecewise constant arguments and variation of constants formula for fractional differential equations. Furthermore, we conclude that the solution of the fractional-delayed system can be approximated for large t by the solution of the equation with piecewise constant arguments, if the corresponding linear system is exponentially stable. At the end, we give two numerical examples to validate our theoretical findings."
On the periodic solutions of the Michelson continuous and discontinuous piecewise linear differential system,"Applying new results from the averaging theory for continuous and discontinuous differential systems, we study the periodic solutions of two distinct versions of the Michelson differential system: a Michelson continuous piecewise linear differential system and a Michelson discontinuous piecewise linear differential system. The tools here used can be applied to general nonsmooth differential systems."
Hierarchical and distributed demand response control strategy for thermostatically controlled appliances in smart grid,"Thermostatically controlled appliances (TCAs) have great thermal storage capability and are therefore excellent demand response (DR) resources to solve the problem of power fluctuation caused by renewable energy. Traditional centralized management is affected by communication quality severely and thus usually has poor real-time control performance. To tackle this problem, a hierarchical and distributed control strategy for TCAs is established. In the proposed control strategy, target assignment has the feature of self-regulating, owing to the designed target assignment and compensating algorithm which can utilize DR resources maximally in the controlled regions and get better control effects. Besides, the model prediction strategy and customers’ responsive behavior model are integrated into the original optimal temperature regulation (OTR-O), and OTR-O will be evolved into improved optimal temperature regulation. A series of case studies have been given to demonstrate the control effectiveness of the proposed control strategy."
Climate-change driven range shifts of anchovy biomass projected by bio-physical coupling individual based model in the marginal seas of East Asia,"Recent studies in the western North Pacific reported a declining standing stock biomass of anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) in the Yellow Sea and a climate-driven southward shift of anchovy catch in Korean waters. We investigated the effects of a warming ocean on the latitudinal shift of anchovy catch by developing and applying individual-based models (IBMs) based on a regional ocean circulation model and an IPCC climate change scenario. Despite the greater uncertainty, our two IBMs projected that, by the 2030s, the strengthened Tsushima warm current in the Korea Strait and the East Sea, driven by global warming, and the subsequent confinement of the relatively cold water masses within the Yellow Sea will decrease larval anchovy biomass in the Yellow Sea, but will increase it in the Korea Strait and the East Sea. The decreasing trend of anchovy biomass in the Yellow Sea was reproduced by our models, but further validation and enhancement of the models is required together with extended ichthyoplankton surveys to understand and reliably project range shifts of anchovy and the impacts such range shifts will have on the marine ecosystems and fisheries in the region."
Modeling the largest inflow of Changjiang freshwater into the Yellow Sea in 2012 with particle-tracking experiment,"Abnormally low-salinity water originating from the Changjiang River (CR) was observed at the central Yellow Sea (YS) in 2012, which was quite unique compared to other years. In this study, the intrusion process of the Changjiang Diluted Water (CDW) into the YS interior was examined using a hindcast simulation (2003–2012) with particle-tracking experiments. The particles representing the behavior of the CDW were released at the CR mouth from May to August, and then tracked. The simulated salinity patterns coincide fairly well with those derived from observations, particularly showing a large low-salinity structure around the central YS in 2012. A substantial intrusion of freshwater into the YS occurred in 2012, and this accounted for approximately 16% of all the released particles in 2012 which is twice as high as the mean average covering the 10 years. According to the trajectories in 2012, the particles took less than 50 days to travel from the mouth to the YS interior and followed mainly two paths toward the YS. One pathway traveled northward to the central entrance of the YS and then reached the western coast of Korea. This pathway was attributed to the strong easterly winds in late June and early August when three consecutive typhoons passed through the YS, which was a unique pattern that is rarely found in other years. The other pathway involved particles trapped along the Jiangsu coast drifting farther to the north up to the Shandon Peninsula against the anticyclonic tidal residual circulations during the passage of typhoons."
Probabilistic seismic hazard assessment for sliding displacement of slopes: an application in Turkey,"Earthquake-induced slope instability is one of the major sources of earthquake hazards in near fault regions. Simplified tools such as Newmark’s sliding block (NSB) analysis are widely used to estimate the sliding displacement of slopes during earthquake shaking. Additionally, empirical models for predicting NSB displacement using single or multiple ground motion intensity measures based on global (e.g. NGA-W1 database, Chiou et al. 2008) or regional datasets are available. The objective of this study is to evaluate the compatibility of candidate NSB displacement prediction models for the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) applications in Turkey using a comprehensive dataset of ground motions recorded during the earthquakes occurred in Turkey. Then, application of the most suitable NSB displacement prediction model in the vector-valued PSHA framework is demonstrated using the seismic source characterization models developed for Bolu-Gerede Region (in northwest Turkey). The results are presented in terms of the NSB displacement hazard curves and the hazard curves are evaluated for the influence of parameter selection (site conditions, yield acceleration, distance to the fault plane, and other seismic source model parameters) on the final hazard output."
Developing hybrid parameters for measuring damage potential of earthquake records: case for RC building stock,"This study investigates the feasibility of using combination of present ground motion parameters to have a hybrid parameter that is more correlated with damage. Since RC buildings constitute the prevailing type of construction in many earthquake prone countries, low and mid-rise RC buildings are targeted in an example study. Displacement demand is assumed to represent the seismic damage. Its mean value is determined for 1056 capacity curves for each of 466 acceleration records. Then an optimization study is performed to select and weight the commonly used ground motion parameters to have a high correlation with displacement demands. Hence, equations for hybrid parameters are defined. It is observed that by combining the ground motion parameters, better results up to 6–28% may be achieved depending on the relevant factors and cases. This approach may be applied to other types of structures, as well. Using this type of case specific hybrid ground motion parameter relations, significant improvements may be obtained for the evaluation and assessment of seismic damage."
Enhancing learning outcomes through self-regulated learning support with an Open Learner Model,"Open Learner Models (OLMs) have great potential to support students’ Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). Yet few classroom experiments have been conducted to empirically evaluate whether and how an OLM can enhance students’ domain level learning outcomes through the scaffolding of SRL processes in an ITS. In two classroom experiments with a total of 302 7th- and 8th-grade students, we investigated the effect of (a) an OLM that supports students’ self-assessment of their equation-solving skills and (b) shared control over problem selection, on students’ equation-solving abilities, enjoyment of learning with the tutor, self-assessment accuracy, and problem selection decisions. In the first, smaller experiment, the hypothesized main effect of the OLM on students’ learning outcomes was confirmed; we found no main effect of shared control of problem selection, nor an interaction. In the second, larger experiment, the hypothesized main effects were not confirmed, but we found an interaction such that the students who had access to the OLM learned significantly better equation-solving skills than their counterparts when shared control over problem selection was offered in the system. Thus, the two experiments support the notion that an OLM can enhance students’ domain-level learning outcomes through scaffolding of SRL processes, and are among the first in-vivo classroom experiments to do so. They suggest that an OLM is especially effective if it is designed to support multiple SRL processes."
Congruence Effects in Post-crisis CSR Communication: The Mediating Role of Attribution of Corporate Motives,"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has grown on the corporate agenda and is at the heart of today’s corporate culture. While much research has examined CSR strategies and effects, the effects of post-crisis CSR communication have received relatively little academic attention. Therefore, this paper uses two experimental studies to examine several key contingency factors that influence consumers’ responses to post-crisis CSR initiatives. Results suggest that consumers demonstrate more favorable responses when a company launches a CSR initiative congruent with the crisis issue, or when the crisis is the result of an accident rather than a transgression. Further, the congruence between the crisis issue and the pre-crisis CSR initiative moderates the consistency effects between pre- and post-crisis initiatives. Such findings should be understood by considering the mediating role of corporate CSR motives’ consumer attributions, which was evidenced in this study. This study theoretically contributes to an improved understanding of the underlying mechanism of the post-crisis CSR information process and managerially contributes to the strategic development of effective post-crisis CSR initiatives given a particular situation."
Type of sweet flavour carrier affects thyroid axis activity in male rats,"Non-nutritive sweeteners are the most widely used food additives worldwide. However, their metabolic outcomes are still a matter of controversy and their effect on the thyroid activity, a key regulator of metabolism, has not been previously studied. Therefore, we aim to determine the influence of the sweet type flavour carrier on selected parameters of thyroid axis activity."
Cost-effectiveness of conservative versus surgical treatment strategies of lumbar spinal stenosis in the Swiss setting: analysis of the prospective multicenter Lumbar Stenosis Outcome Study (LSOS),To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of conservative versus surgical treatment strategies for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS).
Bot detection using unsupervised machine learning,"This research focuses on bot detection through implementation of techniques such as traffic analysis, unsupervised machine learning, and similarity analysis between benign traffic data and bot traffic data. In this study, we tested and experimented with different clustering algorithms and recorded their accuracy with our prepared datasets. Later, the best clustering algorithm was used to proceed with the next steps of the methodology such as determination of majority clusters (cluster with most flows), removal of duplicate flows, and calculation of similarity analysis. Results were recorded for the removal of duplicate flows stage, the results indicate how many flows each majority cluster contains and how many duplicate flows were removed from this majority cluster. Next, results for similarity analysis indicate the value of the similarity coefficient for the comparisons between all datasets (bot datasets and benign dataset). With these results we can present some heuristic conclusion for determining possible bot infection in a certain host."
A-optimal convolutional neural network,"In this paper, we propose a novel data representation-classification model learning algorithm. The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN), and we learn its parameters to achieve A-optimality. The input multi-instance data are represented by a CNN model, and then classified by a linear classification model. The A-optimality of a classification model is measured by the trace of the covariance matrix of the model parameter vector. To achieve the A-optimality of the CNN model, we minimize the classification errors and a regularization term to present the classification model parameter as a function of the CNN filter parameters, and minimize its trace of the covariance matrix. We show that the minimization problem can be solved easily by transferring it to another coupled minimization problem. In the experiments over benchmark data sets of molecular, image, and seismic waveform, we show the advantages of the proposed A-optimal CNN model."
An archive-based artificial bee colony optimization algorithm for multi-objective continuous optimization problem,"Research on multi-objective optimization (MO) has become one of the hot points of intelligent computation. In this paper, an archive-based multi-objective artificial bee colony optimization algorithm (AMOABC) is proposed, in which an external archive is used to preserve the current obtained non-dominated best solutions, and a novel Pareto local search mechanism is designed and incorporated into the optimization process. To prevent the searching process from being trapped into local minimum, a novel food source generating mechanism is put forward, and different search strategies are designed for bees and local search process. Comprehensive benchmarking and comparison of AMOABC with the some current-related MO algorithms demonstrate its effectiveness."
Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity plays no functional role in stem cell-like properties in anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines,"Recent studies have revealed that aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is a candidate marker for thyroid cancer stem cells, although its activity is flexible. The goal of this study is to clarify the functional significance of ALDH enzymatic activity on thyroid cancer stem cells properties in anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines. In vitro sphere formation assay was used to judge the stemness of 4 anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines (FRO, ACT1, 8505C, and KTC3). Two well-known ALDH inhibitors, N,N-diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) and disulfiram (DS), were first used. DEAB (50 μM) almost completely suppressed ALDH activity without affecting cell proliferation or spherogenicity. Lack of effect of ALDH suppression on spherogenicity was confirmed using shRNA for ALDH1A3, an ALDH isozyme predominantly expressed in anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines. In contrast, an ALDH2 inhibitor DS (1 μM) inhibited spherogenicity but did not inhibit ALDH1A3 activity. Based on the recent article from another group reporting the importance of sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in ALDH activity and spherogenicity in thyroid cancer, the effects of the Shh inhibitor cyclopamine were also studied. Like DS, cyclopamine (1 μM) decreased spherogenicity but not ALDH activity. Finally, exogenous expression of ALDH1A3 in otherwise ALDH− TPC1 cells (a papillary thyroid cancer cell line) revealed no effect on spherogenicity. In conclusion, we here show no functional role for ALDH activity in thyroid thyroid cancer stem cells properties. That is, ALDH activity and spherogenicity are clearly dissociable. Further understanding of thyroid cancer stem cells biology in thyroid cancers remains necessary for the future development of thyroid thyroid cancer stem cells-targeted therapies."
"Measuring Care-Related Quality of Life of Caregivers for Use in Economic Evaluations: CarerQol Tariffs for Australia, Germany, Sweden, UK, and US","Informal care is often not included in economic evaluations in healthcare, while the impact of caregiving can be relevant for cost-effectiveness recommendations from a societal perspective. The impact of informal care can be measured and valued with the CarerQol instrument, which measures the impact of informal care on seven important burden dimensions (CarerQol-7D) and values this in terms of general quality of life (CarerQol-VAS). The CarerQol can be included at the effect side of multi-criteria analyses of patient interventions or in cost-effectiveness or utility analysis of interventions targeted at caregivers."
On trace formulae of the generalised heat potential operator,"This paper deals with a generalised heat potential for the degenerate (heat) diffusion equation, which satisfies the initial condition with respect to the time variable. An interesting question having several important applications (in general) is what boundary condition can be put on the generalised heat potential on the lateral boundary of the rectangle so that the degenerate diffusion equation complemented by this boundary condition would have a unique solution in the domain still given by the same formula of the generalised heat potential (with the same kernel). This amounts to finding the trace of the generalised heat potential to the lateral boundary of the rectangle. That is in this work a boundary condition for this potential is found. Obtained boundary conditions in the spatial variable will be nonlocal boundary conditions."
Convex optimization of measurement allocation for magnetic tracking systems,"Magnetic tracking is a popular technique that exploits static and low-frequency magnetic fields for positioning of quasi-stationary objects. One important system design aspect, which substantially influences the performance of the tracking system, is how to collect as much information as possible with a given number of measurements. In this work, we optimize the allocation of measurements given a large number of possible measurements of a generic magnetic tracking system that exploits time-division multiplexing. We exploit performance metrics based on the Fisher information matrix. In particular, the performance metrics measure worst-case or average performance in a measurement domain, i.e. the domain where the tracking is to be performed. An optimization problem with integer variables is formulated. By relaxing the constraint that the variables should be integer, a convex optimization problem is obtained. The two performance metrics are compared for several realistic measurement scenarios with planar transmitter constellations. The results show that the worst performance is obtained in the most distant parts of the measurement domain. Furthermore, measurement allocations optimized for worst-case performance require measurements in a larger area than measurement allocations optimized for average performance."
Linear and nonlinear optical properties of fluorescein sodium salt doped droplet,"The Uv-Vis, fluorescence, Raman spectroscopy and Z-scan were used to study optical properties of fluorescein sodium salt (FSS) in AOT/Oil/Water microemaulsion. The FSS-microemulsion was prepared by two types of Oil (Heptane and Hexane) at two molar ratios of water to surfactant (X = 3 and 8), different droplet concentrations at constant ratios of dye in water (Y = FSS/water). In the AOT microemulsion media, both the emission and absorption spectra of the FSS present a red shift with respect to droplet concentration and water droplet size. A change is molecular structure was observed from Anion to Dianionic by increase of droplet concentration. The Raman spectra shows, the polarity of samples doesn’t change with change of droplet concentration. The ratios of the excited state to the ground state of dipole moments (μe/μg) of FSS-microemulsion were determined by perturbation theory. At the same dye concentrations in samples, the μe/μg depending on the oil type (Oil polarity) and size of water droplet (X) of the microemulsion. The dipole moment of the ground sate is decreasing by decrease of the droplet size and increase of the droplet concentration. The FSS in both microemulsion systems is localized in the interface of droplet because of the negative interface of AOT and the probabilities, the dye aggregation inside of the droplets change by the size of droplet and it can change the dipole moment of the ground state. The photophysics properties tend to bulk water with the increase of the droplet size. The nonlinear optical properties of FSS/AOT/Heptane/Water microemaulsion were investigated. The magnitude of the third-order nonlinear refractive index (n
2) and nonlinear absorption coefficient (ß) the second order hyperpolarizabilities (γR) and the real third order susceptibilities (χR) were measured using single-beam z-scan at different droplet concentration and two molar ratio. The results shows, the ratio of dipole moment (μe/μg) has behavior similar to the 1/γR."
Optimization of ultrafast reverse saturable to saturable absorption transition in Ru dioxolene complex for all-optical logic applications,"A detailed theoretical analysis of reverse saturable absorption (RSA) to saturable absorption (SA) transition has been presented in Ru complex [{Ru (bipy)2}2L][PF6], with picosecond laser pulses at 532 nm wavelength. Interestingly, it is shown that an increase in pulse intensity leads to transition from RSA to SA, with increased contrast, due to strong excited-state absorption. Theoretical results are in good agreement with reported experimental results. The effect of pulse intensity, pulse width, frequency and concentration has been studied to optimize the RSA to SA transition, which has been used to design all-optical picosecond NOT, AND, OR, and the universal NAND and NOR logic gates. The designs are the first application of Ru dioxolene complex based all-optical logic gates with picosecond switch off/on time. These results show the potential of transition-metal complexes for photonic applications."
Characterization of a Triticum aestivum–Dasypyrum villosum T1VS·6BL translocation line and its effect on wheat quality,"Bread wheat quality is mainly correlated with protein quality, particularly the glutenin content and high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) of grain endosperm. The number of HMW-GS alleles and loci are limited in bread wheat cultivars, though ideally, a large amount of HMW-GS alleles in wheat-related grasses should be exploited. In this study, a novel wheat-Dasypyrum villosum GP005 translocation line, NAU425, carrying a pair of T1VS·6BL translocation chromosomes was developed and assessed via molecular cytogenetic analysis. Grain quality analysis indicated that NAU425 has a positive effect on protein content, Zeleny sedimentation value, wet gluten content, and the rheological characteristics of wheat flour dough compared to the same qualities of recurrent parent ‘Chinese Spring’ attributed to the additional HMW-GS donated by 1VS of D. villosum. The protein content of T1VS·6BL was significantly improved compared to ‘Chinese Spring’ likely owing to the dramatic increase in glutenin content. Considering the importance of glutenin content for bread wheat end-use quality, and T1VS·6BL line with good plant vigor, full fertility and cytogenetic stability, NAU425 may be valuable in bread wheat quality improvement. Our results presented here may provide an approach to improve bread wheat quality through additional alien HMW-GS introgression."
Exponential Decay of Loop Lengths in the Loop O(n) Model with Large n,"The loop O(n) model is a model for a random collection of non-intersecting loops on the hexagonal lattice, which is believed to be in the same universality class as the spin O(n) model. It has been conjectured that both the spin and the loop O(n) models exhibit exponential decay of correlations when \(n > 2\). We verify this for the loop O(n) model with large parameter n, showing that long loops are exponentially unlikely to occur, uniformly in the edge weight x. Our proof provides further detail on the structure of typical configurations in this regime. Putting appropriate boundary conditions, when nx
6 is sufficiently small, the model is in a dilute, disordered phase in which each vertex is unlikely to be surrounded by any loops, whereas when nx
6 is sufficiently large, the model is in a dense, ordered phase which is a small perturbation of one of the three ground states."
Diagnostic classification of unipolar depression based on resting-state functional connectivity MRI: effects of generalization to a diverse sample,"In small, selected samples, an approach combining resting-state functional connectivity MRI and multivariate pattern analysis has been able to successfully classify patients diagnosed with unipolar depression. Purposes of this investigation were to assess the generalizability of this approach to a large clinically more realistic sample and secondarily to assess the replicability of previously reported methodological feasibility in a more homogeneous subgroup with pronounced depressive symptoms. Two independent subsets were drawn from the depression and control cohorts of the BiDirect study, each with 180 patients with and 180 controls without depression. Functional connectivity either among regions covering the gray matter or selected regions with known alterations in depression was assessed by resting-state fMRI. Support vector machines with and without automated feature selection were used to train classifiers differentiating between individual patients and controls in the entire first subset as well as in the subgroup. Model parameters were explored systematically. The second independent subset was used for validation of successful models. Classification accuracies in the large, heterogeneous sample ranged from 45.0 to 56.1% (chance level 50.0%). In the subgroup with higher depression severity, three out of 90 models performed significantly above chance (60.8–61.7% at independent validation). In conclusion, common classification methods previously successful in small homogenous depression samples do not immediately translate to a more realistic population. Future research to develop diagnostic classification approaches in depression should focus on more specific clinical questions and consider heterogeneity, including symptom severity as an important factor."
I/O efficient ECC graph decomposition via graph reduction,"The problem of computing k-edge connected components (k-\(\mathsf {ECC}\)s) of a graph G for a specific k is a fundamental graph problem and has been investigated recently. In this paper, we study the problem of \(\mathsf {ECC}\) decomposition, which computes the k-\(\mathsf {ECC}\)s of a graph G for all possible k values. \(\mathsf {ECC}\) decomposition can be widely applied in a variety of applications such as graph-topology analysis, community detection, Steiner Component Search, and graph visualization. A straightforward solution for \(\mathsf {ECC}\) decomposition is to apply the existing k-\(\mathsf {ECC}\) computation algorithm to compute the k-\(\mathsf {ECC}\)s for all k values. However, this solution is not applicable to large graphs for two challenging reasons. First, all existing k-\(\mathsf {ECC}\) computation algorithms are highly memory intensive due to the complex data structures used in the algorithms. Second, the number of possible k values can be very large, resulting in a high computational cost when each k value is independently considered. In this paper, we address the above challenges, and study I/O efficient \(\mathsf {ECC}\) decomposition via graph reduction. We introduce two elegant graph reduction operators which aim to reduce the size of the graph loaded in memory while preserving the connectivity information of a certain set of edges to be computed for a specific k. We also propose three novel I/O efficient algorithms, \(\mathsf {Bottom}\)-\(\mathsf {Up}\), \(\mathsf {Top}\)-\(\mathsf {Down}\), and \(\mathsf {Hybrid}\), that explore the k values in different orders to reduce the redundant computations between different k values. We analyze the I/O and memory costs for all proposed algorithms. In addition, we extend our algorithm to build an efficient index for Steiner Component Search. We show that our index can be used to perform Steiner Component Search in optimal I/Os when only the node information of the graph is allowed to be loaded in memory. In our experiments, we evaluate our algorithms using seven real large datasets with various graph properties, one of which contains 1.95 billion edges. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithms are scalable and efficient."
"Urban expansion and local land-cover change both significantly contribute to urban warming, but their relative importance changes over time","The urban heat island (UHI) affects both biogeochemical cycles and human society. Previous studies of UHI indicate urban expansion and local land-cover change can lead to higher temperatures in cities compared to the adjacent countryside. Few studies have examined the joint effects of city- and local-scale factors on urban warming, and their relative importance."
On the structure of business incubators: de-coupling issues and the mis-alignment of managerial incentives,"Business incubators are structurally complex and have resisted any major change to their internal structure, replicating throughout the world in large numbers, and delivering value through numerous models. A question, thus arises, what specific structural properties of incubators facilitate the organizational form’s replication and performance in a range of institutional contexts? In order to shed light on this question, an exploratory-inductive approach is adopted; and, utilizing the tools of organization theory, the internal environment of the business incubator is de-coded. This draws attention to attributes of the hybrid incubator-form’s internal structural properties that have not been discussed in the past, including de-coupling issues and the mis-alignment of managerial incentives with the actual role of incubating. These properties, rather than impacting incubators’ status, award incubators with ceremonial value and help their managements avoid close inspections of performance. This in turn, it is proposed, has allowed for their rapid replication in a variety of socio- cultural, economic and institutional contexts."
Sharp Weak Type Inequalities for Fractional Integral Operators,"Suppose that d≥1 is an integer, α∈(0,d) is a fixed parameter and let I

 be the fractional integral operator associated with d-dimensional Walsh-Fourier series on (0,1]d. Let p, q be arbitrary numbers satisfying the conditions 1≤p<d/α and 1/q=1/p−α/d. We determine the optimal constant K, which depends on α, d and p, such that for any f∈L

Entanglement of two hybrid optomechanical cavities composed of BEC atoms under Bell detection,"In this paper, firstly, we consider bipartite entanglement between each part of an optomechanical cavity composed of one-dimensional Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC). We investigate atomic collision on the behaviour of the BEC in the week photon–atom coupling constant and use Bogoliubov approximation for the BEC. Secondly under above condition, we propose a scheme for entanglement swapping protocol which involves tripartite systems. In our investigation, we consider a scenario where BECs, moving mirrors, and optical cavity modes are given in a Gaussian state with a covariance matrix. By applying the Bell measurement to the output optical field modes, we show how the remote entanglement between two BECs, two moving mirrors, and BEC-mirror modes in different optomechanical cavity can be generated."
A quantitative investigation of prospective teachers’ hopes and their motivational forces,"The present study aimed to investigate the diverse aspects of prospective teachers’ dispositional hopes, teaching-specific hopes, and their sources, as well as to explore whether these would significantly predict their preparation for the teaching profession. A total of 851 prospective teachers voluntarily participated in the study. A series of confirmatory factor analyses, multiple regression analyses, and structural equation modeling analyses were conducted to answer the research questions appropriately. The results showed that prospective teachers’ dispositional hopes can be examined based on four factors (i.e. active hope, passive hope, internal sources, and external sources), whereas their teaching-specific hopes can be examined based on seven factors (i.e. student motivation, student development, student achievement, teaching, relationships with students, internal sources, and external sources). The results also demonstrated that the teaching-specific hopes in relation to student development, relationships with students, teaching, and their external sources significantly motivated prospective teachers to be involved in a number of activities related to teaching during teacher education."
Trace formulas for Schrödinger operators on star graphs,We derive trace formulas of the Buslaev–Faddeev type for quantum star graphs. One of the new ingredients is high energy asymptotics of the perturbation determinant.
Reciprocal Ontological Models Show Indeterminism Comparable to Quantum Theory,"We show that within the class of ontological models due to Harrigan and Spekkens, those satisfying preparation-measurement reciprocity must allow indeterminism comparable to that in quantum theory. Our result implies that one can design quantum random number generator, for which it is impossible, even in principle, to construct a reciprocal deterministic model."
Diffraction of line source field by a resistive half-plane between isorefractive media,"The scattering process of cylindrical waves by a resistive half-plane, residing at the interface of isorefractive media, is investigated. The uniform expression of the diffracted cylindrical waves by a resistive half-screen is obtained for a single medium. Then the initial fields are found for an interface between isorefractive media. The scattered geometrical optics waves are derived by subtracting the initial fields from the total geometrical optics waves when the resistive half-plane exists at the interface. The diffracted fields are determined by using the scattered geometrical optics waves. The behavior of the resultant waves is analyzed numerically."
Regularized least-squares migration of simultaneous-source seismic data with adaptive singular spectrum analysis,"Simultaneous-source acquisition has been recognized as an economic and efficient acquisition method, but the direct imaging of the simultaneous-source data produces migration artifacts because of the interference of adjacent sources. To overcome this problem, we propose the regularized least-squares reverse time migration method (RLSRTM) using the singular spectrum analysis technique that imposes sparseness constraints on the inverted model. Additionally, the difference spectrum theory of singular values is presented so that RLSRTM can be implemented adaptively to eliminate the migration artifacts. With numerical tests on a flat layer model and a Marmousi model, we validate the superior imaging quality, efficiency and convergence of RLSRTM compared with LSRTM when dealing with simultaneous-source data, incomplete data and noisy data."
Strategies Developed by Service Providers to Enhance Treatment Engagement by Immigrant Parents Raising a Child with a Disability,"Barriers associated with treatment engagement exist at multiple levels for immigrant parents (IP) raising a child with a disability (e.g. divergent beliefs between family and service providers (SP) concerning the child’s diagnosis and treatment, poor therapeutic alliance, limited language skills, daily stresses, lack of flexibility and complexity of the health care system, the SP’s lack of training in cultural sensitivity). The SP have a primary role to play in the families’ engagement process. Presently, little is known about SP’s knowledge of barriers and strategies to enhance the engagement in treatment by IP raising a child with a disability. The aim of this qualitative study is to contribute to filling this gap. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 SP from three large cities from Canada. Participants are SP including speech language pathologists, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, specialized educators, and psychologists who work with children with a language, motor, hearing or visual disability on a regular basis. Data analysis included inductive and iterative processes typically used for qualitative research as well as a thematic content analysis approach. To address the barriers that diminish the IP’s engagement in their child’s treatment, the SP highlighted three primary strategies: (a) overcoming the language barrier; (b) developing a shared understanding of the child’s disability, and (c) helping the parents to understand the treatment process. A conceptual framework is presented which illustrates barriers and facilitators of IP’s engagement. These findings suggest that several adaptations are needed within the health care services for the IP. They can help guide clinical practice in order to increase the level of treatment engagement of the IP raising a child with a disability."
Prevention of spinal cord injury using brain-evoked muscle-action potential (Br(E)-MsEP) monitoring in cervical spinal screw fixation,"The goal of the study was to examine waveform deterioration in intraoperative monitoring during posterior fusion with a cervical screw. This surgery is useful for alignment correction, but worsening of neurological symptoms may occur in association with screw insertion and rod installation. Therefore, spinal cord monitoring is important for safe surgery."
Separation and concentration of Phytophthora ramorum sporangia by inertial focusing in curving microfluidic flows,"We present an integrated microfluidic system for performing isolation and concentration of Phytophthora ramorum pathogens using a chip whose working principle is based on inertial lateral migration in curving flows. The chip was fabricated from multiple layers of thermoplastic polymers and features an embedded spiral separation channel along with peristaltic microvalves for fluidic operation and process control. A pumping system paired with a fully programmable pressure manifold is used to boost concentration levels by recirculating the sample liquid multiple times through the separation chip, making it possible to reduce sample volumes from 10 to 1 mL or less. The system was calibrated using fluorescent polymer particles with a nominal diameter of 30 µm which is comparable to that of P. ramorum sporangia. The separation process has been shown to be highly effective and more than 99% of the beads can be recovered in the concentrated batch. Experiments conducted with P. ramorum sporangia have shown that a 5.3-fold increase in pathogen content with 95% recovery can be achieved using three subsequent concentration cycles. The utility of the method has been validated by processing a sample derived from infested Rhododendron leaves where a 6.1-fold increase in the concentration of P. ramorum has been obtained after four concentration cycles. Although specifically designed and demonstrated for sporangia of P. ramorum, the method and related design rules can easily be extended to other microbial organisms, effectively supporting bioanalytical applications where efficient, high-throughput separation of target species is of primary concern."
Quantile regression based on counting process approach under semi-competing risks data,"In this paper, we investigate the quantile regression analysis for semi-competing risks data in which a non-terminal event may be dependently censored by a terminal event. The estimation of quantile regression parameters for the non-terminal event is complicated. We cannot make inference on the non-terminal event without extra assumptions. Thus, we handle this problem by assuming that the joint distribution of the terminal event and the non-terminal event follows a parametric copula model with unspecified marginal distributions. We use the stochastic property of the martingale method to estimate the quantile regression parameters under semi-competing risks data. We also prove the large sample properties of the proposed estimator, and introduce a model diagnostic approach to check model adequacy. From simulation results, it shows that the proposed estimator performs well. For illustration, we apply our proposed approach to analyze a real data."
F-wave of single firing motor units: correct or misleading criterion of motoneuron excitability in humans?,"Motoneuron excitability is a critical property for information processing during motor control. F-wave (a motoneuronal recurrent discharge evoked by a motor antidromic volley) is often used as a criterion of motoneuron pool excitability in normal and neuromuscular diseases. However, such using of F-wave calls in question. The present study was designed to explore excitability of single low-threshold motoneurons during their natural firing in healthy humans and to ascertain whether F-wave is a correct measure of motoneuronal excitability. Single motor units (MUs) were activated by gentle voluntary muscle contractions. MU peri-stimulus time histograms and motoneuron excitability changes within a target interspike interval were analysed during testing by motor antidromic and Ia-afferent volleys. It was found that F-waves could be occasionally recorded in some low-threshold MUs. However, during evoking F-wave, in contrast with the H-reflex, peri-stimulus time histograms revealed no statistically significant increase in MU discharge probability. Moreover, surprisingly, motoneurons appeared commonly incapable to fire a recurrent discharge within the most excitable part of a target interval. Thus, the F-wave, unlike the H-reflex, is the incorrect criterion of motoneuron excitability resulting in misleading conclusions. However, it does not exclude the validity of the F-wave as a clinical tool for other aims. It was concluded that the F-wave was first explored in low-threshold MUs during their natural firing. The findings may be useful at interpretations of changes in the motoneuron pool excitability in neuromuscular diseases."
Long-chain bases from Cucumaria frondosa inhibit adipogenesis and regulate lipid metabolism in 3T3-L1 adipocytes,"This study aims to investigate anti-adipogenic effects of long-chain bases from Cucumaria frondosa (Cf-LCBs) in vitro. Results showed that Cf-LCBs inhibited adipocyte differentiation and the expressions of CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Cf-LCBs increased β-catenin mRNA and nuclear translocation and increased its target genes, cyclin D1 and c-myc. Cf-LCBs enhanced fizzled and lipoprotein-receptor-related protein5/6 (LRP5/6) expressions, whereas wingless-type MMTV integration site10b (WNT10b) and glycogen syntheses kinase 3β (GSK3β) remained unchanged. Cf-LCBs also reduced adipogenesis and recovered WNT/β-catenin signaling in the cells suffering from 21H7, a β-catenin inhibitor. In addition, Cf-LCBs decreased triglyceride content and the expressions of lipogenesis genes. Cf-LCBs increased FFA levels and the expressions of lipidolytic factors. Cf-LCBs promoted the phosphorylation of adenosine-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. These findings indicate that Cf-LCBs inhibit adipogenesis through activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling and regulate lipid metabolism via activation of AMPK pathway."
Investigation of antimicrobial activity and entA and entB genes in Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis strains isolated from naturally fermented Turkish white cheeses,"In this research, the antagonistic effects of Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium bacteria isolated from naturally fermented Turkish white cheeses, produced without starter culture, against Listeria monocytogenes, L. innocua, L. ivanovii, Staphylococcus aureus, and E. faecalis were evaluated. The presence of entA and entB genes was also detected in the isolates, which had antimicrobial activity. Total 71 strains of E. faecalis and 7 strains of E. faecium were tested; 20 of E. faecalis and none of E. faecium strains showed antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria using agar spot method. Among E. faecalis strains, which had antimicrobial activity, three strains contained both entA and entB genes, two strains carried only entA gene, and five strains had only entB gene. These cheese-sourced enterococcal strains or their enterocins should be considered to be used for food preservation especially in the dairy industry."
White ginseng extract induces immunomodulatory effects via the MKK4-JNK pathway,"Panax ginseng Meyer (white ginseng) is a popular functional food and its biological effects on the human body have been noted for hundreds of years. In the present study, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the immunomodulatory effects of white ginseng extract (WGE) were investigated. WGE increased NO production via upregulation of iNOS expression levels. Mouse cytokine array results also revealed that the expression of 13 cytokines was elevated by WGE treatment in IFN-γ-primed macrophage cells. Although both MKK4-JNK and MEK-ERK signaling pathways were activated after treatment with WGE, only the MKK4-JNK signaling pathway appears to have any significant immunomodulatory significance. Oral administration of WGE for 28 days recovered cyclophosphamide (CY)-induced suppression of the immune system in mice via the MKK4-JNK pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that the MKK4-JNK signaling pathway is a crucial mechanism of WGE-induced immunomodulation."
Biotransformation and detoxification of aflatoxin B1 by extracellular extract of Cladosporium uredinicola,"Aflatoxin contamination of food and grain poses a serious economic and health problem globally. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is extremely mutagenic and toxic as well as a potent carcinogen to both humans and livestock. In this study, the degradation of AFB1 by extracellular extract of Cladosporium uredinicola was examined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Within 24 h of incubation, AFB1 was efficiently eliminated by the culture supernatant of C. uredinicola (84.5±5.7%) at 37°C; the elimination was proven to be enzymatic, and the enzyme was thermostable. The biotransformation products of AFB1 detected by HPLC and TLC were proven to be the same compound. Analysis with LCMS showed that AFB1 was bio-transformed to a structurally different compound (m/z=365 [M+Na]+), which is first reported. The cytotoxicity study to HeLa cells indicated that culture supernatant-treated AFB1 is less toxic as compared with AFB1."
Effect of composite biological preservative containing Lactobacillus plantarum on postharvest litchi quality,"Biological preservatives containing live microorganisms are environmentally friendly and non-toxic substances used to preserve the quality of fresh fruits. This study investigated whether a composite biological preservative containing live Lactobacillus plantarum (designated as DN003) could preserve the quality of postharvest litchi fruits at high temperature and in humid environment. Postharvest litchi fruits were briefly soaked in DN003, then dried and stored at 29–33°C with 95–98% relative humidity; prochloraz treatment was included as positive control and non-treatment as negative control. In comparison with negative control group, litchi fruits in both DN003-treated and positive control groups better retained their appearance with lower polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase activities and showed higher concentrations of vitamin C, titratable acids, and total sugar content. These data demonstrated that the new composite biological preservative containing L. plantarum is promising to be used in the preservation of postharvest litchi fruit, particularly in high-temperature and humid environment."
A novel method for the discrimination of Hawthorn and its processed products using an intelligent sensory system and artificial neural networks,"Hawthorn (CFS) has commonly been applied as an important traditional Chinese medicine and food for thousands of years. The raw material of CFS is commonly processed by stir-frying to obtain yellow (CFY), dark brown (CFD), and carbon dark (CFC) colored products, which are used for different clinical uses. In this study, an intelligent sensory system (ISS) was used to obtain the color, gas, and flavor samples data, which were further employed to develop a novel and accurate method for the identification of CFS and its processed products using principal component analysis. Moreover, this research developed a model of an artificial neural network, which could be used to predict the total organic acid, total flavonoids, citric acid, hyperin, and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural via determination of the color, odor, and taste of a sample. In conclusion, the ISS and the artificial neural network are useful tools for rapid, accurate, and effective discrimination of CFS and its processed products."
Effects of smoking and marination on the sensory characteristics of cold-cut chicken breast filets: A pilot study,"This study aimed to determine individual and combined effects of smoking and marination on the sensory characteristics of boneless, skinless chicken breast meat. Four types of cooked, cold-cut chicken breast meat, i.e., marinated cooked, marinated smoked, and controls of non-marinated cooked and non-marinated smoked chicken, were evaluated for 28 sensory characteristics. Marination significantly increased saltiness, sweetness, roasted flavor, smoked flavor, and moistness of the cold-cut chicken breast meat. In addition, smoking significantly enhanced the saltiness, bitterness, roasted flavor, smoked flavor, and moistness of mass. Interestingly, a combination of smoking and marination processes resulted in a synergistic increase in the perceived moistness of mass compared to their individual treatments. In conclusion, this study demonstrates individual and combined influences of smoking and marination on the sensory characteristics of cold-cut chicken breast meat."
Synthesis and controlled-release properties of chitosan/β-Lactoglobulin nanoparticles as carriers for oral administration of epigallocatechin gallate,"A nano-sized double-walled carrier composed of chitosan and β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) for oral administration of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was developed to achieve a prolonged release of EGCG in the gastrointestinal tract. Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) solution was added dropwise to chitosan hydrochloride (CHC) containing EGCG to form a primary coating by ionic complexation. Subsequently, β-Lg was added to create a secondary layer by ionic gelation. The obtained EGCG-loaded chitosan/β-Lg nanoparticles had sizes between 100 and 500 nm and zeta potentials ranging from 10 to 35mV. FT-IR spectroscopy revealed a high number of hydrogen-bonding sites in the nanoparticles, which could incorporate EGCG, resulting in high encapsulation efficiency. EGCG incorporated in the primary coating was released slowly over time by diffusion from the swollen CMC-CHC matrix after the outer layer of β-Lg was degraded in the intestinal fluid. The sustained-release property makes chitosan/β-Lg nanoparticles an attractive candidate for effective delivery of EGCG."
Optimization of ergosterol to vitamin D2 synthesis in Agaricus bisporus powder using ultraviolet-B radiation,"Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to determine the optimum circumstances for conversion of ergosterol to vitamin D2 via ultraviolet-B (UV-B) in white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) powder. Three independent variables, namely, exposure time, ambient temperature, and irradiation intensity were investigated using a central composite rotatable design. The RSM ridge analysis determined the following ideal states: exposure time of 10.4 min, ambient temperature of 26.33°C, and UV-B irradiation intensity of 1.36 W/m2. A vitamin D2 content of 741.50±23.75 μg/g (the predicted value was 780.4 μg/g) was obtained under these ideal conditions."
"Nutritional constituents, phytochemical profiles, in vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of various solvent extracts from grape seeds (Vitis vinifera L.)","The present study revealed that the nutritive value of grape seeds (Vitis vinifera L.) was 383.55±0.13 Kcal/100 g, with magnesium as the most abundant mineral element (70.44±0.88 mg/L). The maximum phenolic (392.58±1.70mg of GAE/g), flavonoid (256.16±1.60 mg of QE/g), and tannin (30.95±0.17mg of CE/g) contents were also found in the ethanol, dichloromethane, and hexane extracts, respectively. The major phytochemical compounds in the ethyl acetate extract were identified via gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis. The ethanol extract has the highest antioxidant activity (IC50=140±1.20 μg/mL for DPPH, 145.28±0.45mg α-tocopherol/g for total antioxidant capacity, and EC50=80±1.41 μg/mL for ferric-reducing power assays). For β-carotene test, the highest antioxidant activity was obtained in the hexane extract. A satisfactory antimicrobial activity was found against a panel of microorganisms with the ethyl acetate extract as the best antimicrobial agent. Additionally, it was found that the bactericidal concentration required for the grape seed extract to kill Listeria monocytogenes should be less than 12.50 mg/mL (minimum inhibitory concentration=4)."
"Antimicrobial activity of a novel furan fatty acid, 7,10-epoxyoctadeca-7,9-dienoic acid against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","We analyzed the antimicrobial potential of a novel furan fatty acid, 7,10-epoxyoctadeca-7,9-dienoic acid (7,10-EODA) against methicillin-resistant and -sensitive S. aureus (MRSA and MSSA). The anti-staphylococcal activity of 7,10-EODA and its consequences on cell physiology was determined by disc diffusion, broth microdilution, and flow cytometry. Anti-virulence activity of 7,10-EODA was evaluated by bioassays. 7,10-EODA was anti-staphylococcal with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 125-250 mg/L. 7,10-EODA exhibited a dose response and inhibited MRSA 01ST001 by 90.5% and ATCC 29213 (MSSA) by 85.3% at 125 mg/L. MIC of 7,10-EODA permeabilized >95 % of MRSA 01ST001 cells to small molecules. Sublethal dose of 7,10-EODA was non-toxic but markedly reduced the hemolytic, coagulase, and autolytic activities of MRSA and MSSA at 15.6 mg/L. The results provide a lead for the utilization of natural furan fatty acids as novel anti-MRSA agents."
Sigumjang (fermented barley bran) water-soluble extracts inhibit the expression of adipogenic and lipogenic regulators in 3T3-L1 adipocytes,"Sigumjang prepared from fermented barley bran is a traditional fermented food found only in the Gyeongsang-do area of South Korea. There have been no studies reported to date despite the potential bioactivities of sigumjang. In this study, the anti-obesity activities of sigumjang extracts (SEs) during 3T3-L1 differentiation into adipocytes were investigated. SEs inhibited adipocyte differentiation by suppressing the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-β and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c expression in the early stage of differentiation, followed by the suppression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α, and adiponectin. These changes in adipogenic markers induced inhibition of lipogenesis via down-regulation of mainly fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid binding protein 4, and perilipin. These results were more significant in the extract of sigumjang fermented with isolated Bacillus amyloliquefaciens MFST compared to naturally fermented sigumjang group. SEs can be considered as a useful material for developing food with health benefits and anti-obesity properties."
Protein functionality of concentrates prepared from yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) roe by cook-dried process,"Three kinds of roe protein concentrates (RPCs: boil-dried concentrate, BDC; steam-dried concentrate, SDC; freeze-dried concentrate, FDC) were prepared from yellowfin tuna to produce value added products for food applications. The buffer capacities of the RPCs were higher under alkaline than under acidic conditions. The water holding capacities of the RPCs were in range 4.5–4.7 g/g protein at pH 6.0. The protein solubility of the FDC (14.2%) was higher than those of the BDC (5.4%) and SDC (5.5%) at pH 6.0. The foaming capacity of the FDC (156.8%) was higher than those of the BDC (109.7%) and SDC (109.4%); the FDC foam was stable for 60 min. The oil-in-water emulsifying activity index of the FDC (12.2m2/g protein) exceeded those of the BDC and SDC (2.2m2/g protein). Protein concentrates from yellowfin tuna roe may be useful as a potential protein source and as a high-value food ingredient."
Enhancement of antioxidative and antimicrobial activities of immature pear (Pyrus pyrifolia cv. Niitaka) fruits by fermentation with Leuconostoc mesenteroides,"Immature pear (Pyrus pyrifolia cv. Niitaka) fruits were fermented with Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Aspergillus oryzae, which are commonly used as starters for manufacturing fermented foods. Fermented immature pear fruit extracts (FIPF) by L. mesenteroides showed significantly higher radical-scavenging activity using DPPH, ABTS, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radicals and reducing power capacity than unfermented immature pear fruit extracts. L. mesenteroides-FIPF more effectively inhibited the formation of cholesteryl ester hydroperoxide in copper ion-induced rat blood plasma. In addition, the L. mesenteroides-FIPF strongly inhibited tyrosinase activity and the growth of pathogenic skin bacteria. In contrast, enhanced antioxidative and antibacterial activities were not apparent in A. oryzae-FIPF. The antioxidative and antimicrobial activities of the fermented and unfermented immature pear fruits were correlated with the flavonoid contents. These results indicate that fermentation enhances antioxidative and antimicrobial activities of immature pear fruits."
Measurement of 131I activity in thyroid of nuclear medical staff and internal dose assessment in a Polish nuclear medical hospital,"This paper presents results of 131I thyroid activity measurements in 30 members of the nuclear medicine personnel of the Department of Endocrinology and Nuclear Medicine Holy Cross Cancer Centre in Kielce, Poland. A whole-body spectrometer equipped with two semiconductor gamma radiation detectors served as the basic research instrument. In ten out of 30 examined staff members, the determined 131I activity was found to be above the detection limit (DL = 5 Bq of 131I in the thyroid). The measured activities ranged from (5 ± 2) Bq to (217 ± 56) Bq. The highest activities in thyroids were detected for technical and cleaning personnel, whereas the lowest values were recorded for medical doctors. Having measured the activities, an attempt has been made to estimate the corresponding annual effective doses, which were found to range from 0.02 to 0.8 mSv. The highest annual equivalent doses have been found for thyroid, ranging from 0.4 to 15.4 mSv, detected for a cleaner and a technician, respectively. The maximum estimated effective dose corresponds to 32% of the annual background dose in Poland, and to circa 4% of the annual limit for the effective dose due to occupational exposure of 20 mSv per year, which is in compliance with the value recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection."
A simplified FE simulation of welded I beam-to-RHS column joints,"This paper presents a study of the validity of different finite element models that can be used to simulate the welds at beam-column joints involving rectangular hollow sections (RHS). By comparing with actual test results several finite element models that include shell and solid element types and the presence or not of the welds, it is possible to extract some interesting conclusions about which is the simplest and most appropriate simulation mode to faithfully represent the behavior of these connections. Research in this field will guide and help further work to better knowledge of the behavior in terms of strength and stiffness of the semi-rigid joints involving welded rectangular hollow section as columns to be able to propose an extension of the component method to these kind of joints."
Steel-concrete-steel sandwich composite structures subjected to extreme loads,"This paper summarizes the latest research and development work on steel-concrete-steel (SCS) sandwich composite structures for the use as Arctic offshore platform, and to resist impact and blast loads. Current development of ultra-lightweight cement composite (ULCC) and a floatable structural cement composite (FSCC) to be used as infilled materials for SCS sandwich structure are presented. This paper aims to advance the application of SCS sandwich composite with the use of steel plate and lightweight concrete materials. A series of tests on lightweight SCS sandwich panels with shear connectors has been carried out. The superior performance of SCS sandwich panel is demonstrated. The results show that SCS sandwich with novel J-hook connectors is effective in preventing plate separation from concrete core, maintaining the structural integrity."
Extending fatigue life of out-of-plane gusset joint by bonding CFRP plates under bending moment,"Carbon fiber reinforced plastic, CFRP, plates bonding method is one of the new repair methods for fatigue cracks. In this method, propagation of fatigue crack will be delay because of the suppression of crack opening by crack bridging and stress reduction by composite effect of bonding CFRP plates. In this study, to clarify the effect of bonding CFRP plates on fatigue life extension, bending fatigue tests were carried out. First, fatigue tests on the specimens in as-welded condition were conducted until fatigue crack propagated to 10mm away from the weld toe. Then, fatigue crack was covered by CFRP plates and the specimens were re-tested until fatigue crack penetrated through the base plate. As the results of bending fatigue tests, the fatigue test data of the specimens repaired by bonding CFRP plates showed much longer fatigue life compared with that in as-welded condition, under stress ratio, R=0 and -infinity"
Effect of joint stiffness on the stability of cable-braced grid shells,"Bolted joints used in cable-braced grid shells are typically semi-rigid joints, and the joint stiffness has a significant effect on the stability of cable-braced grid shells. The effect of joint stiffness on the stability of cable-braced grid shells is studied in this paper. Based on the experimental results of improved bolted joints, finite element models of elliptic paraboloid cable-braced grid shells with bolted joints are established, and spring elements are used to simulate the joint stiffness. The effect of the joint stiffness on the nonlinear buckling load is studied by changing the joint stiffness. The main conclusions are as follows. First, the joint rotational stiffness has a significant effect on the failure mode. When the joint rotational stiffness is small to a certain extent, the failure mode of cable-braced grid shells changes from overall buckling to local buckling. Second, the nonlinear failure mode is similar to the first-order eigenvalue buckling mode and the maximal compression stress distribution. The structural integrity is weakened, and the maximal steel tube compression stress decreases with the decrease of the joint rotational stiffness. The smaller the joint rotational stiffness, the lower the utilization rate of steel strength. The results suggest that the joint stiffness of elliptic paraboloid cable-braced grid shells should not be less than 20% of the rigid joint stiffness."
Corrosion damage assessment method for steel guardrail post roots,"Steel guardrail posts are typically used on the highway system of Japan, but these can experience the corrosion damage at their root near the road surface. This damage may be particularly severe in the seaside areas or regions that experience cold weather and employ salt as a deicing agent. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a non-destructive way of estimating the extent of corrosion in the guardrail post roots. Particularly, 11 test specimens were parametrically designed to investigate the efficiency of using the impact vibration mode to assess the corrosion damage. The corrosion angle, range and thickness at the post root were the main parameters. Meanwhile, a parametric FEM analysis was executed as well to analyze the vibration behavior, the stiffness and the load-carrying capacity. In general, the study reveals that the high-order vibration modes are sensitive to the corrosion damage at the guardrail post roots, and based on this, an impact vibration method for assessing the corrosion damage was proposed."
Dynamic responses of a cable-stayed bridge under a high speed train with random track irregularities and a vertical seismic load,"The dynamic analysis of train-bridge systems has been a popular research topic for a long time; however, studies on cable-stayed bridges subject to train and seismic loads remain limited. Cable-stayed bridges can experience large vibrations under external periodical loads due to the high flexibility caused by their long decks and cables. Previous approaches to modeling the cables have limitations in accuracy, principle, or calculation efficiency, making them unsuitable for dynamic analysis with numerous time steps for long-span bridges with many cables. Furthermore, track irregularities and earthquakes bring additional excitations to the train-bridge system and threaten its structural and running safety. Thus, an accurate and fast approach to modeling and analyzing cable-stayed bridges under train loads and other excitations is needed. In this study, an improved parabolic cable element is included for dynamic analysis. This cable element facilitates a faster calculation while maintaining an accuracy similar to that of a catenary cable element. The coupled equation-of-motion of the train and cable-stayed bridge system is derived and solved via the time integration method. The effects of railway track quality and seismic load are investigated through the dynamic responses of train-bridge systems by considering various classes of tracks and levels of seismic intensities, respectively. The impact factors of the vertical displacement of the deck and the tensions in cables are used to represent the behaviors of the bridge, while the maximum accelerations of vehicle bodies are used to represent the behaviors of the train. Track irregularities and seismic load significantly increase the responses of the bridge and train. With increased train speed, the negative effects of poor quality track on the responses of the train-bridge system increased; however, with increased seismic loads the effects were found to decrease."
Finite element analysis of optimized brace angle for the diagrid structural system,"The Diagrid structural system is considered to be the best structural system for constructing free form structures, but it is also a very effective system for resisting lateral load. As a newly investigated structural system, its complicated node has not yet been completely investigated, and only minimal experimentation with the manufacturing and construction of the system has been conducted. Therefore, the construction cost of the diagrid structural system is still comparatively high. In this study, the cyclic performance of a diagrid node with an H-section brace is discussed with an emphasis on the welding methods, overlapped length, and diagrid angle. Details considering productivity were proposed, and their structural performance was assessed through experimental and analytical investigation."
Experimental investigation of beam-to-column connection with SHN490 steel under cyclic loading,"Seismic performance of beam-to-column connections used in the middle-low rise buildings was investigated through the cyclic loading test. Four joint specimens were prepared in accordance with the variables of material and connection type. In two cases of welded connection, the brittle fracture in weld did not occur but cracked at heat-affected zone (HAZ) and/or near weld access hole. In the connections with extended end-plate, punching failure followed by end-plate failure occurred at the flange of column around bolt head. The moment capacities based on failure modes were calculated and compared with the test results. The connections were classified as rigid, semi-rigid, flexible in terms of bending stiffness and strength."
Analytical investigation on cyclic response of buckling-restrained braces with short yielding core segments,"Buckling-restrained braced frames (BRBFs) are considered to be one of the efficient lateral force-resisting systems used in buildings located in the seismically active regions. Nearly symmetric hysteretic response of buckling-restrained braces (BRBs) in tension and compression due to the yielding of steel core plates helps the BRBFs to withstand the seismic excitations without causing any extensive damage to the primary frame members. However, BRBFs may exhibit the excessive post-earthquake residual drift response due to the low axial stiffness of BRBs under the strong ground motions. A reduction in the yielding core segments of BRBs results in the improved elastic and post-elastic axial stiffness of BRBs which may help in controlling the excessive residual drift response. This study is focussed on the analytical evaluation of hysteretic response of BRBs of varying lengths using finite element (FE) software. The results of FE study are further used to evaluate the inter-story and residual drift response of a 3-story braced frame fitted with BRBs of short core lengths (referred as SBRBF). Nonlinear dynamic analysis results of SBRBF are compared with the conventional BRBF and concentrically braced frame (CBF). It is concluded that the optimum reduction in yielding core lengths of BRBs can improve the overall seismic response of BRBFs with a reduction in the residual drift response."
Seismic performance evaluation of Korean column-tree steel moment connections,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the seismic performance of existing Korean column-tree connection type in steel moment frames. The column-tree connection has frequently been used in steel moment frames because it is well known to provide high quality and economy with shop-welding and field-bolting in Korea and Japan. However, there have been no studies on the design details and ductility of column-tree connections. Therefore, in this paper, the seismic performance of non-composite and composite column-tree specimens was evaluated to investigate their problems. Full-scale specimens were fabricated with non-composite/composite strong axis and weak axis column-tree connections, respectively. The testing results showed that, although non-composite column-tree specimens reached a 5% story drift ratio, tiny cracks occurred at beam-to-column connections. In the case of composite specimens, the expected brittle fracture at the bottom flange was not detected. However, severe crushing of concrete slab occurred, and the bottom flange underwent great stress. Therefore, composite action should be considered when composite structures are designed because bottom flanges may fracture."
Lateral-torsional buckling analysis of cantilever beam with tip lateral elastic brace under uniform and concentrated load,"The studies on the lateral-torsional buckling of cantilever steel beam with tip lateral elastic brace are rarely reported. The total potential energy is first established for the lateral-torsional buckling of cantilever steel beam with tip lateral elastic brace under uniform and concentrated load. The modal trial function of the lateral displacement and torsional angle are expressed as trigonometric function combination with six terms. By introducing new dimensionless parameters, the analytical solution of the dimensionless buckling equation for the lateral-torsional buckling of cantilever steel beam with tip lateral elastic brace is obtained. With the help of 1stOpt software which is mathematical optimization analysis software, the non-dimensional critical moment formula of the lateral-torsional buckling of cantilever beam with tip lateral elastic brace is obtained. Then, the accuracy of the formula is verified by ADINA finite element software. The results show that the given critical moment formula is of high accuracy. It provides convenient and simple design method for practical engineering."
Application of steel sheet to the toe boards,"The scaffold system have been used to assist the smooth construction works and to assure the safety of workers. The toe boards is one of the scaffold elements. It has been applied for workers and constructional materials on a scaffold deck to prevent the falling down. In this paper, thin steel sheets were applied to the toe boards to reduce the self weight. The proposed boards were designed under the recommendation of the temporal construction elements. Also, the wind effects were considered in designing the proposed toe board. The applied design load was the horizontal load from the scaffold deck or the load perpendicular to the scaffold deck. The proposed toe boards were examined numerically by use of the finite element method and experimentally by the loading tests. From both numerical and experimental results, the performance of the thin steel toe board proposed here was confirmed."
Developing of steel plate shear walls braced with slidable multiple X-shaped restrainers: Hysteretic analyses and design recommendations,"This paper proposed a light-weight buckling restrained steel plate shear wall (XSPSW) to improve the earthquake energy dissipation of unstiffened steel plate shear walls. It consisted of two slidable multiple X-shaped restrainers placed on the either side of a steel infill plate. The two restrainers could continue to provide out-of-plane restraint for infill plates to achieve stable energy dissipating capacity under cyclic reversal loads. Theoretical analyses and numerical simulating analyses have been conducted to investigate the hysteretic behaviors of XSPSWs and the stability of their sub-plates. Based on the analysis results, it could be concluded that the proposed XSPSWs were efficient lateral-load resisting members for the buildings in high seismic regions."
Fatigue evaluation of grouted connections under bending moment in offshore wind turbines based on ABAQUS scripting interface,"The fatigue behavior evaluation under bending moment is extremely important to the grouted connection in monopile offshore wind turbines. Based on the scripting interface of ABAQUS software, finite element model of the grouted connections was established automatically in accordance with the user defined parameters by Python language. Based on the experimental material test of grout material, the grout material was simulated by using three-dimensional concrete damaged plasticity (CDP) model in ABAQUS. Full model and half model were compared under fatigue limit state (FLS), and numerical results are presented in terms of hot spot stress in steel and third principle stress in grout material. It was found that half model could decrease calculation time significantly with more conservative evaluation result. Furthermore, parametric studies were conducted based on the half models about two different shear keys’ arrangements as well as the height and distance of shear keys. And it is found that there are slight differences for two models in calculated design life when the interface behavior between steel and grout material is modeled by Coulomb friction law."
Buckling behavior of steel girder in integral abutment bridges under thermal loadings in summer season during deck replacement,"Integral abutment bridges (IABs) have been built and successfully served for several decades, especially in the U.S. and Europe, because of their many advantages, such as their structural efficiency, stability and low construction and maintenance costs. Recently, the deck slabs of IABs have reached the end of their service lives and bridge administrators have decided to replace the deck slabs to extend the bridge service life. Due to the restraints at both abutments, the steel girder IAB is subjected to high axial forces and the steel girders have laterally buckled during deck slab replacement. This study performed numerical simulations to identify the buckling modes that may occur during deck replacement and the results were compared to the recent accident which happened in Missouri, U.S. Key parameters such as the length of the girder, width and thickness of the flange and the imperfection level were selected and a parametric study was performed. Using the obtained critical buckling stress, an equation for predicting the critical buckling stress of the girder in IABs during deck removal was developed. The results provide a better and safer, long-lasting IAB design and maintenance regime."
Strong up-conversion luminescence and electrical properties of SrBi4Ti4O15 multifunctional ceramics by Er3+ doping,"Novel green-emitting piezoelectric ceramics of SrBi4−x
Er
x
Ti4O15 (SBT-xEr) were prepared. Strong up-conversion with bright green (524 and 548 nm) and a relatively weak red (660 nm) emission bands were obtained under 980 nm excitation at room temperature, which is attributed to the intra 4f–4f electronic transition of (2H11/2, 4S3/2)–4I15/2 and the transition from 4F9/2 to 4I15/2 of Er3+ ions, respectively. Simultaneously, Er3+ doping promotes the electrical properties. At 0.8 mol%Er, the optimal electric properties with high Curie temperature of T
c ~527 °C, large remanent polarization of 2P
r ~14.92 μC/cm2 and piezoelectric constant of d
33 ~17 pC/N was achieved. As a multifunctional material, Er3+ doped SBT showed a great potential to be used in 3D-display, bio-imaging, solid state laser and optical temperature sensor."
A dynamic SVR–ARMA model with improved fruit fly algorithm for the nonlinear fiber stretching process,"The fiber stretching process plays the key role in the process of fiber production and its effects is measured by the stretching ratio. The stretching ratio is determined by the relative speed of the winding roller. The stretching ratio has impact on the performance of the final fiber filament and production directly. Focused on the importance of the stretching ratio, the support vector regression (SVR) predictive model, called nonlinear auto-regressive exogenous model, for the fiber stretching rate based on existing industry data is proposed. Furthermore, the fruit fly optimization algorithm inspired by immune mechanism and cooperation functional (IFOA) is presented, and then is used to optimize the parameters in SVR. Furthermore, taking into account the high cost and accurate precision of the fiber stretching process, a time series autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model is introduced to reduce the prediction error of the IFOA–SVR model. Simulations results demonstrate that the proposed IFOA–SVR method can increase the prediction accuracy than the traditional FOA and the SVR method, and the ARMA model is essential to modify the prediction error of the IFOA–SVR model."
CSE database: extended annotations and new recommendations for ECG software testing,"Nowadays, cardiovascular diseases represent the most common cause of death in western countries. Among various examination techniques, electrocardiography (ECG) is still a highly valuable tool used for the diagnosis of many cardiovascular disorders. In order to diagnose a person based on ECG, cardiologists can use automatic diagnostic algorithms. Research in this area is still necessary. In order to compare various algorithms correctly, it is necessary to test them on standard annotated databases, such as the Common Standards for Quantitative Electrocardiography (CSE) database. According to Scopus, the CSE database is the second most cited standard database. There were two main objectives in this work. First, new diagnoses were added to the CSE database, which extended its original annotations. Second, new recommendations for diagnostic software quality estimation were established. The ECG recordings were diagnosed by five new cardiologists independently, and in total, 59 different diagnoses were found. Such a large number of diagnoses is unique, even in terms of standard databases. Based on the cardiologists’ diagnoses, a four-round consensus (4R consensus) was established. Such a 4R consensus means a correct final diagnosis, which should ideally be the output of any tested classification software. The accuracy of the cardiologists’ diagnoses compared with the 4R consensus was the basis for the establishment of accuracy recommendations. The accuracy was determined in terms of sensitivity = 79.20–86.81%, positive predictive value = 79.10–87.11%, and the Jaccard coefficient = 72.21–81.14%, respectively. Within these ranges, the accuracy of the software is comparable with the accuracy of cardiologists. The accuracy quantification of the correct classification is unique. Diagnostic software developers can objectively evaluate the success of their algorithm and promote its further development. The annotations and recommendations proposed in this work will allow for faster development and testing of classification software. As a result, this might facilitate cardiologists’ work and lead to faster diagnoses and earlier treatment."
"We Have Never Been Secular: Religious Identities, Duties, and Ethics in Audit Practice",
"Male spider mites use chemical cues, but not the female mating interval, to choose between mates","The choice of the partner an individual will mate with is expected to strongly impact its fitness. Hence, natural selection has favoured the evolution of cues to distinguish among mates that will provide different fitness benefits to the individual that is choosing. In species with first-male sperm precedence, this is particularly important for males, as mating with mated females will result in no offspring. In the spider mite Tetranychus urticae only the first mating is effective, except if the interval between first and second copulations is shorter than 24 h. In line with this, males prefer to mate with virgin over mated females. They do not, however, choose between females that have mated at different time intervals. Here, we tested which type of cues males use to distinguish between females with different mating status (virgin versus mated). To do so, we firstly confirmed that males prefer virgins over mated females and that they do not select females on the basis of their age or mating interval. Next, we tested whether contact and volatile compounds or chemical trails affected male discrimination between mated and virgin females, by systematically varying the exposure of males to these cues. We found that volatile compounds and chemical trails were sufficient to induce discrimination between virgin and mated females in males. Direct contact with females, however, does not seem to play a role in this discrimination. The composition of such chemical cues (trails and volatiles) remains to be identified."
New Proof-of-Concept in Viral Inactivation: Virucidal Efficacy of 405 nm Light Against Feline Calicivirus as a Model for Norovirus Decontamination,"The requirement for novel decontamination technologies for use in hospitals is ever present. One such system uses 405 nm visible light to inactivate microorganisms via ROS-generated oxidative damage. Although effective for bacterial and fungal inactivation, little is known about the virucidal effects of 405 nm light. Norovirus (NoV) gastroenteritis outbreaks often occur in the clinical setting, and this study was designed to investigate potential inactivation effects of 405 nm light on the NoV surrogate, feline calicivirus (FCV). FCV was exposed to 405 nm light whilst suspended in minimal and organically-rich media to establish the virucidal efficacy and the effect biologically-relevant material may play in viral susceptibility. Antiviral activity was successfully demonstrated with a 4 Log10 (99.99%) reduction in infectivity when suspended in minimal media evident after a dose of 2.8 kJ cm−2. FCV exposed in artificial faeces, artificial saliva, blood plasma and other organically rich media exhibited an equivalent level of inactivation using between 50–85% less dose of the light, indicating enhanced inactivation when the virus is present in organically-rich biologically-relevant media. Further research in this area could aid in the development of 405 nm light technology for effective NoV decontamination within the hospital environment."
Nature of the interactions between hypocrealean fungi and the mutualistic fungus of leaf-cutter ants,"Leaf-cutter ants cultivate and feed on the mutualistic fungus, Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, which is threatened by parasitic fungi of the genus Escovopsis. The mechanism of Escovopsis parasitism is poorly understood. Here, we assessed the nature of the antagonism of different Escovopsis species against its host. We also evaluated the potential antagonism of Escovopsioides, a recently described fungal genus from the attine ant environment whose role in the colonies of these insects is unknown. We performed dual-culture assays to assess the interactions between L. gongylophorus and both fungi. We also evaluated the antifungal activity of compounds secreted by the latter on L. gongylophorus growth using crude extracts of Escovopsis spp. and Escovopsioides nivea obtained either in (1) absence or (2) presence of the mutualistic fungus. The physical interaction between these fungi and the mutualistic fungus was examined under scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Escovopsis spp. and E. nivea negatively affected the growth of L. gongylophorus, which was also significantly inhibited by both types of crude extract. These results indicate that Escovopsis spp. and E. nivea produce antifungal metabolites against the mutualistic fungus. SEM showed that Escovopsis spp. and E. nivea maintained physical contact with the mutualistic fungus, though no specialised structures related to mycoparasitism were observed. These results showed that Escovopsis is a destructive mycoparasite that needs physical contact for the death of the mutualistic fungus to occur. Also, our findings suggest that E. nivea is an antagonist of the ant fungal cultivar."
"Whose Knowledge, Whose Development? Use and Role of Local and External Knowledge in Agroforestry Projects in Bolivia","Agroforestry often relies on local knowledge, which is gaining recognition in development projects. However, how local knowledge can articulate with external and scientific knowledge is little known. Our study explored the use and integration of local and external knowledge in agroforestry projects in Bolivia. In 42 field visits and 62 interviews with agroforestry farmers, civil society representatives, and policymakers, we found a diverse knowledge base. We examined how local and external knowledge contribute to livelihood assets and tree and crop diversity. Projects based predominantly on external knowledge tended to promote a single combination of tree and crop species and targeted mainly financial capital, whereas projects with a local or mixed knowledge base tended to focus on food security and increased natural capital (e.g., soil restoration) and used a higher diversity of trees and crops than those with an external knowledge base. The integration of different forms of knowledge can enable farmers to better cope with new challenges emerging as a result of climate change, fluctuating market prices for cash crops, and surrounding destructive land use strategies such as uncontrolled fires and aerial fumigation with herbicides. However, many projects still tended to prioritize external knowledge and undervalue local knowledge—a tendency that has long been institutionalized in the formal educational system and in extension services. More dialogue is needed between different forms of knowledge, which can be promoted by strengthening local organizations and their networks, reforming agricultural educational institutions, and working in close interaction with policymakers."
Effect of nanoclay on carbon black reinforced blend of amorphous–semicrystalline polymers,"In this work, the effect of nanoclay in carbon black reinforced PC-PBT has been investigated on the basis of changes in their mechanical and thermal properties. It has been believed on the basis of FESEM images that CB supports for the expansion of PBT rods and PC wraps around these expanded rods. However, the effect of reinforcing filler for improvement in mechanical properties has been found insignificant which may be due to the agglomeration of reinforcing particles. Addition of nanoclay in carbon black reinforced PC-PBT composite blend shown considerable improvement in its tensile strength (113%). This should be due to the improved dispersion of CB in polymer matrix and better linked-up structure of PBT rods after addition of NC. In addition, this combination has shown simultaneous improvement in tensile strength and ductility which is unusual and may be desirable in many structural applications."
"Metagenomic characterization of viral communities in Goseong Bay, Korea","In this study, seawater samples were collected from Goseong Bay, Korea in March 2014 and viral populations were examined by metagenomics assembly. Enrichment of marine viral particles using FeCl3 followed by next-generation sequencing produced numerous sequences. De novo assembly and BLAST search showed that most of the obtained contigs were unknown sequences and only 0.74% of sequences were associated with known viruses. As a result, 138 viruses, including bacteriophages (87%), viruses infecting algae and others (13%) were identified. The identified 138 viruses were divided into 11 orders, 14 families, 34 genera, and 133 species. The dominant viruses were Pelagibacter phage HTVC010P and Roseobacter phage SIO1. The viruses infecting algae, including the Ostreococcus species, accounted for 9.4% of total identified viruses. In addition, we identified pathogenic herpes viruses infecting fishes and giant viruses infecting parasitic acanthamoeba species. This is a comprehensive study to reveal the viral populations in the Goseong Bay using metagenomics. The information associated with the marine viral community in Goseong Bay, Korea will be useful for comparative analysis in other marine viral communities."
Host coexistence in a model for two host–one parasitoid interactions,"Building from a continuous-time host–parasitoid model introduced by Murdoch et al. (Am Nat 129:263–282, 1987), we study the dynamics of a 2 host–parasitoid model assuming, for the sake of simplicity, that larval stages have a fixed duration. If each host is subjected to density-dependent mortality in its larval stage, we obtain explicit conditions for the existence of an equilibrium where the two host species coexist with the parasitoid. However, if host demography is density-independent, equilibrium coexistence is impossible. If at least one of the 1 host–parasitoid systems has an oscillatory dynamics (which happens under some parameter values), we found, through numerical bifurcation, that coexistence is favoured. Coexistence between the two hosts may occur along a periodic solution even without density-dependence. Models of this type may be relevant for the use of parasitoids as biocontrol agents of insect pests."
Consequences of employees’ collective engagement in knowledge-based service firms,"This study focuses on employees’ collective engagement (CE) in knowledge-based service firms. CE is a climate-related construct that refers to how employees collectively express themselves psychically, cognitively, and emotionally in their work role. Moreover, the study explores the consequences of CE, specifically, these that are linked to relationship learning (RL) in intrafirm professional service teams (IPSTs), employee commitment (EC), firms’ innovative capability (FIC), and customers’ creative strategy generation (CCSG). The suggested conceptual model was tested in a survey. All survey participants were employed in consultancy firms and represent the population of employees within the domain of knowledge-based service firms. The findings give support to the conceptual model of consequences of CE. Specifically, the findings reveal that CE plays an imperative role especially for EC and RL in IPSTs. This study contributes to deepen and extend research on employee engagement, which is a relatively new concept. Specifically, the study contributes to reveal how CE is linked to several outcomes critical for service firms. No previous research has examined these aspects. Therefore, this unique study enriches our understanding of knowledge-based service firms with the finding that CE is a key factor to orchestrate successfully to trigger RL in IPSTs, strengthen EC, generate customers’ creative strategies in their service offerings, and boost the knowledge-based service firms’ overall capability to innovate."
QoS prediction of Web service based on US-AWS,"In parallel with the rapid growth of the number of research works, there exist some disadvantages and advantages of each model, how to combine the strengths of each model to create a new model for more effective. This is an important issue that should be studied in the context of increasing the number of new models. In this paper, we proposed a new combined model for predicting the QoS values of Web service. We first construct the AWS model based on an AutoenCoder with two predictions: User-based AWS (U-AWS) and Service-based AWS (S-AWS). Then we combine two predictions (U-AWS and S-AWS) to produce a more accurate one. To train the combined model, we generate the level one data by using the J-fold cross-validation data and using regression models to combine predictive modeling. Experimental results showed that the combined method has better results than single methods."
A case study of take away restaurant using simulation modelling approach,"A model is proposed here for The Take away Restaurant. The model is developed under the assumption that there is no limit for the number of customer’s arrival and there is limited number of servers who will attend customers. At the time of heavy rush that is at dinner time, overcrowding is major problem, which may effect profit as well as goodwill of restaurant. Studying and analyzing such type of restaurants from long period of time, we have noticed continuous increase in number of customers as well as in number of restaurants. So it is a big question in front of management how to provide best service in lesser time so that their customer could not move to other options. Long waiting queues is a big issue for a customer as he is not ready to wait for a long time. When we asked to many customers the reason for switching to other restaurants from a particular restaurant, they pointed on issues like insufficient personnel and long waiting time. To overcome these situations, we will use queuing model which can provide reasonably accurate evaluations of our system’s performance in the light of Simulation modeling."
"Leather processing and its possible impact on groundwater quality in Silk Road sites: a case study from Chennai, India","Water plays an important role in human civilisation. Since ancient times people started to settle in regions with ensured water availability. Trade was an important factor for the development of civilisation. Silk Road is an important route used for the trading between China and other countries across Eurasia. Not only silk, many goods including leather were exchanged during trading. Leather was processing lead to release of large amount of wastewater. This study was carried out to understand how the leather processing would have affected the groundwater quality in Silk Road sites by studying the current scenarios of groundwater quality near tanning industries. Chennai and nearby cities such as Ranipet and Vaniyambadi are chosen for case studies. Groundwater quality around the tanneries was poor due to high electrical conductivity and concentration of chromium. This is due to the effluents released by the tanneries into the ground or open drains without proper treatment. Similarly, the leather processing in Silk Road sites would have also affected the groundwater quality."
Influence of Strontium Addition on Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of an Al–10Si–5Cu Alloy,"The microstructure and mechanical properties of Al–10Si–5Cu cast alloys with micro-addition of alloying elements (V, Cr and Ni) were studied before and after strontium addition. Samples were examined using the X-Ray diffraction, the optical microscope, the scanning electron microscope and the energy dispersive spectrometer. The results indicated that the α-Al matrix, eutectic Si phase and Al2Cu phase were the main constituent phases of Al–10Si–5Cu alloys before or after strontium addition. Strontium addition affected the refining of the α-Al grains and transforming the configuration of interdendritic phases. The un-modified alloy showed a brittle nature because of existing brittle and aggregated AlSiMnFe phases. Contributing to the alteration of microstructure in strontium modified alloy, the strength and elongation of the alloy were improved. In addition, the fracture mechanism and crack propagation process were investigated in both  the alloys."
"Reconstruction of March–June precipitation from tree rings in central Liaoning, China","A dendrochronological profile was generated from Chinese pines (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) in the Qianshan Mountains in northeastern China. Based on correlation analyses, the pattern of precipitation from March to June (P

36
) was reconstructed using a simple linear model, which explained 42.7% of the total variance in observed precipitation from 1951 to 2012. The reconstructed P

36
 series revealed a consistently increasing trend in precipitation during the twentieth century in the Qianshan Mountains. The reconstructed data showed trends that were similar to those in the variation in trends for March–June precipitation observed at the Shenyang station, the reconstructed January–May precipitation trends in Shenyang City, and the reconstructed average June–September relative humidity for Yiwulü Mountain. The reconstructed data also showed good agreement with the droughts reported in historical documents and recorded by meteorological stations in Liaoning. Spatial correlation analyses show that the reconstructed data reflect the variability in precipitation that occurs over much of northeastern China. In addition, our reconstruction showed a significant periodicity. The significant correlations between the reconstructed P

36
 and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and sunspot numbers indicate that precipitation variability in the Qianshan Mountain region is probably driven by extensive atmosphere-sea interactions and solar activities."

"We Have Never Been Secular: Religious Identities, Duties, and Ethics in Audit Practice",
A quantitative investigation of prospective teachers’ hopes and their motivational forces,"The present study aimed to investigate the diverse aspects of prospective teachers’ dispositional hopes, teaching-specific hopes, and their sources, as well as to explore whether these would significantly predict their preparation for the teaching profession. A total of 851 prospective teachers voluntarily participated in the study. A series of confirmatory factor analyses, multiple regression analyses, and structural equation modeling analyses were conducted to answer the research questions appropriately. The results showed that prospective teachers’ dispositional hopes can be examined based on four factors (i.e. active hope, passive hope, internal sources, and external sources), whereas their teaching-specific hopes can be examined based on seven factors (i.e. student motivation, student development, student achievement, teaching, relationships with students, internal sources, and external sources). The results also demonstrated that the teaching-specific hopes in relation to student development, relationships with students, teaching, and their external sources significantly motivated prospective teachers to be involved in a number of activities related to teaching during teacher education."
Trace formulas for Schrödinger operators on star graphs,We derive trace formulas of the Buslaev–Faddeev type for quantum star graphs. One of the new ingredients is high energy asymptotics of the perturbation determinant.
Reciprocal Ontological Models Show Indeterminism Comparable to Quantum Theory,"We show that within the class of ontological models due to Harrigan and Spekkens, those satisfying preparation-measurement reciprocity must allow indeterminism comparable to that in quantum theory. Our result implies that one can design quantum random number generator, for which it is impossible, even in principle, to construct a reciprocal deterministic model."
CSE database: extended annotations and new recommendations for ECG software testing,"Nowadays, cardiovascular diseases represent the most common cause of death in western countries. Among various examination techniques, electrocardiography (ECG) is still a highly valuable tool used for the diagnosis of many cardiovascular disorders. In order to diagnose a person based on ECG, cardiologists can use automatic diagnostic algorithms. Research in this area is still necessary. In order to compare various algorithms correctly, it is necessary to test them on standard annotated databases, such as the Common Standards for Quantitative Electrocardiography (CSE) database. According to Scopus, the CSE database is the second most cited standard database. There were two main objectives in this work. First, new diagnoses were added to the CSE database, which extended its original annotations. Second, new recommendations for diagnostic software quality estimation were established. The ECG recordings were diagnosed by five new cardiologists independently, and in total, 59 different diagnoses were found. Such a large number of diagnoses is unique, even in terms of standard databases. Based on the cardiologists’ diagnoses, a four-round consensus (4R consensus) was established. Such a 4R consensus means a correct final diagnosis, which should ideally be the output of any tested classification software. The accuracy of the cardiologists’ diagnoses compared with the 4R consensus was the basis for the establishment of accuracy recommendations. The accuracy was determined in terms of sensitivity = 79.20–86.81%, positive predictive value = 79.10–87.11%, and the Jaccard coefficient = 72.21–81.14%, respectively. Within these ranges, the accuracy of the software is comparable with the accuracy of cardiologists. The accuracy quantification of the correct classification is unique. Diagnostic software developers can objectively evaluate the success of their algorithm and promote its further development. The annotations and recommendations proposed in this work will allow for faster development and testing of classification software. As a result, this might facilitate cardiologists’ work and lead to faster diagnoses and earlier treatment."

Numerical Solution Based on Hat Functions for Solving Nonlinear Stochastic Itô Volterra Integral Equations Driven by Fractional Brownian Motion,"This paper presents a numerical method for solving nonlinear stochastic Itô Volterra integral equations driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter \( H \in (0,1)\) via of hat functions. Using properties of the generalized hat basis functions and fractional Brownian motion, new stochastic operational matrix of integration is achieved and the nonlinear stochastic equation is transformed into nonlinear system of algebraic equations which by solving it, an approximation solution with high accuracy is obtained. In addition, error analysis of the method is investigated, and by some examples, efficiency and accuracy of the suggested method are shown."
The Precision of Parameter Estimation for Dephasing Model Under Squeezed Reservoir,"We study the precision of parameter estimation for dephasing model under squeezed environment. We analytically calculate the dephasing factor γ(t) and obtain the analytic quantum Fisher information (QFI) for the amplitude parameter α and the phase parameter ϕ. It is shown that the QFI for the amplitude parameter α is invariant in the whole process, while the QFI for the phase parameter ϕ strongly depends on the reservoir squeezing. It is shown that the QFI can be enhanced for appropriate squeeze parameters r and θ. Finally, we also investigate the effects of temperature on the QFI."
The Influence of Specimen Type on Tensile Fracture Toughness of Rock Materials,"Up to now, several methods have been proposed to determine the mode I fracture toughness of rocks. In this research, different cylindrical and disc shape samples, namely: chevron bend (CB), short rod (SR), cracked chevron notched Brazilian disc (CCNBD), and semi-circular bend (SCB) specimens were considered for investigating mode I fracture behavior of a marble rock. It is shown experimentally that the fracture toughness values of the tested rock material obtained from different test specimens are not consistent. Indeed, depending on the geometry and loading type of the specimen, noticeable discrepancies can be observed for the fracture toughness of a same rock material. The difference between the experimental mode I fracture resistance results is related to the magnitude and sign of T-stress that is dependent on the geometry and loading configuration of the specimen. For the chevron-notched samples, the critical value of T-stress corresponding to the critical crack length was determined using the finite element method. The CCNBD and SR specimens had the most negative and positive T-stress values, respectively. The dependency of mode I fracture resistance to the T-stress was shown using the extended maximum tangential strain (EMTSN) criterion and the obtained experimental rock fracture toughness data were predicted successfully with this criterion."
A Stress Condition in Aquifer Rock for Detecting Anomalous Radon Decline Precursory to an Earthquake,"Recurrent groundwater radon anomalous declines were observed from well measurements in the Antung hot spring area (eastern Taiwan) prior to five of six earthquakes that occurred between 2003 and 2011 (M
w range 5.0–6.8). The relationship between the detectability of radon anomalies and the first motions of P-waves was investigated. Based on the first motions of P-waves recorded near the investigated well, a precursory decrease in groundwater radon can be detected only when the first motion is compression. No precursory change in groundwater radon concentration was observed for the downward first motion of P-waves."
The effect of sodium valproate on acetic acid-induced colitis in rats,"Ulcerative colitis is a chronic recurrent disease with incomplete treatment options. The current article evaluated the effect of sodium valproate on acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis in rats. Rats were randomly distributed into six groups including Sham group, colitis control group, sodium valproate treatment groups (50, 100 and 300 mg/kg, i.p.) and dexamethasone-treatment group. Dexamethasone was used as a reference drug. Colitis was induced by intracolonic instillation of 2 mL of 3% acetic acid solution. The efficacy of sodium valproate was evaluated by macroscopical and histopathological scoring systems, hematocrit measurement as well as biochemical analysis including myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines assessment. Sodium valproate, particularly with doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg significantly improved weight loss, and macroscopic damage, reduced ulcer area, colon weight, microscopic colitis index and elevated hematocrit level. Biochemical experiments showed elevated levels of colonic MPO activity, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in colitis control group. Treatment with sodium valproate at the doses of 100 and 300 mg/Kg) decreased the MPO activity and colonic concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. The results provide evidence that sodium valproate has a protective effect in acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis which might be due to its anti-inflammatory activities, and it may be useful in patients with ulcerative colitis."
Representations of Nilpotent Groups on Spaces with Indefinite Metric,"The paper studies the structure of J-unitary representations of connected nilpotent groups on \(\Pi _{k}\)-spaces, that is, the representations on a Hilbert space preserving a quadratic form “with a finite number of negative squares”. Apart from some comparatively simple cases, such representations can be realized as double extensions of finite-dimensional representations by unitary ones. So their study is based on some special cohomological technique. We concentrate mostly on the problems of the decomposition of these representations and the classification of “non-decomposable” ones."
Improved Cuckoo Search and Chaotic Flower Pollination optimization algorithm for maximizing area coverage in Wireless Sensor Networks,"The popularity of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is rapidly growing due to its wide-ranged applications such as industrial diagnostics, environment monitoring or surveillance. High-quality construction of WSNs is increasingly demanding due to the ubiquity of WSNs. The current work is focused on improving one of the most crucial criteria that appear to exert an enormous impact on the WSNs performance, namely the area coverage. The proposed model is involved with sensor nodes deployment which maximizes the area coverage. This problem is proved to be NP-hard. Although such algorithms to handle this problem with fairly acceptable solutions had been introduced, most of them still heavily suffer from several issues including the large computation time and solution instability. Hence, the existing work proposed ways to overcome such difficulties by proposing two nature-based algorithms, namely Improved Cuckoo Search (ICS) and Chaotic Flower Pollination algorithm (CFPA). By adopting the concept of calculating the adaptability and a well-designed local search in previous studies, those two algorithms are able to improve their performance. The experimental results on 15 instances established a huge enhancement in terms of computation time, solution quality and stability."
On the structure of business incubators: de-coupling issues and the mis-alignment of managerial incentives,"Business incubators are structurally complex and have resisted any major change to their internal structure, replicating throughout the world in large numbers, and delivering value through numerous models. A question, thus arises, what specific structural properties of incubators facilitate the organizational form’s replication and performance in a range of institutional contexts? In order to shed light on this question, an exploratory-inductive approach is adopted; and, utilizing the tools of organization theory, the internal environment of the business incubator is de-coded. This draws attention to attributes of the hybrid incubator-form’s internal structural properties that have not been discussed in the past, including de-coupling issues and the mis-alignment of managerial incentives with the actual role of incubating. These properties, rather than impacting incubators’ status, award incubators with ceremonial value and help their managements avoid close inspections of performance. This in turn, it is proposed, has allowed for their rapid replication in a variety of socio- cultural, economic and institutional contexts."
Diffraction of line source field by a resistive half-plane between isorefractive media,"The scattering process of cylindrical waves by a resistive half-plane, residing at the interface of isorefractive media, is investigated. The uniform expression of the diffracted cylindrical waves by a resistive half-screen is obtained for a single medium. Then the initial fields are found for an interface between isorefractive media. The scattered geometrical optics waves are derived by subtracting the initial fields from the total geometrical optics waves when the resistive half-plane exists at the interface. The diffracted fields are determined by using the scattered geometrical optics waves. The behavior of the resultant waves is analyzed numerically."
Regularized least-squares migration of simultaneous-source seismic data with adaptive singular spectrum analysis,"Simultaneous-source acquisition has been recognized as an economic and efficient acquisition method, but the direct imaging of the simultaneous-source data produces migration artifacts because of the interference of adjacent sources. To overcome this problem, we propose the regularized least-squares reverse time migration method (RLSRTM) using the singular spectrum analysis technique that imposes sparseness constraints on the inverted model. Additionally, the difference spectrum theory of singular values is presented so that RLSRTM can be implemented adaptively to eliminate the migration artifacts. With numerical tests on a flat layer model and a Marmousi model, we validate the superior imaging quality, efficiency and convergence of RLSRTM compared with LSRTM when dealing with simultaneous-source data, incomplete data and noisy data."

Entanglement of two hybrid optomechanical cavities composed of BEC atoms under Bell detection,"In this paper, firstly, we consider bipartite entanglement between each part of an optomechanical cavity composed of one-dimensional Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC). We investigate atomic collision on the behaviour of the BEC in the week photon–atom coupling constant and use Bogoliubov approximation for the BEC. Secondly under above condition, we propose a scheme for entanglement swapping protocol which involves tripartite systems. In our investigation, we consider a scenario where BECs, moving mirrors, and optical cavity modes are given in a Gaussian state with a covariance matrix. By applying the Bell measurement to the output optical field modes, we show how the remote entanglement between two BECs, two moving mirrors, and BEC-mirror modes in different optomechanical cavity can be generated."
Learning curve and clinical outcome of gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection performed by trainee operators,"Although endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) represents a significant progress in therapeutic endoscopy, little is known about how trainees attain its technical proficiency. The aims of this study were to evaluate the learning curve and clinical outcomes of gastric ESD performed by trainee endoscopists."
OR fire virtual training simulator: design and face validity,"The Virtual Electrosurgical Skill Trainer is a tool for training surgeons the safe operation of electrosurgery tools in both open and minimally invasive surgery. This training includes a dedicated team-training module that focuses on operating room (OR) fire prevention and response. The module was developed to allow trainees, practicing surgeons, anesthesiologist, and nurses to interact with a virtual OR environment, which includes anesthesia apparatus, electrosurgical equipment, a virtual patient, and a fire extinguisher. Wearing a head-mounted display, participants must correctly identify the “fire triangle” elements and then successfully contain an OR fire. Within these virtual reality scenarios, trainees learn to react appropriately to the simulated emergency. A study targeted at establishing the face validity of the virtual OR fire simulator was undertaken at the 2015 Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons conference."
"Effect of ultrasound-guided phrenic nerve block on shoulder pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy—a prospective, randomized controlled trial","Post-laparoscopic shoulder pain (PLSP) frequently follows a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A proposed mechanism for PLSP is the irritation or injury of the phrenic nerve by the CO2 pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery. Here, we investigated whether a phrenic nerve block (PNB), performed under ultrasound guidance, could reduce the incidence and severity of PLSP after laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
Electrochemical oxidation of some catechol derivatives in the presence of some betadicetone derivatives: mechanistic and thermodynamic study,"Electrochemical oxidations of 4-methylcatechol (1), 4-tert-butylcatechol (5) and catechol (7) in the presence of different nucleophiles have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Experimental results have been obtained by means of cyclic voltammetry and controlled-potential coulometry. Also the theoretical results were calculated at DFT (B3LYP) level of theory and 6–311+G (p, d) basis set. The calculated results indicate that oxidation potential of catechols (1, 5, 7) and their substituted species are directly dependent on the ∆G
tot, and continuance of reactions during electrolysis is dependent on ∆G
tot of produced species on the surface of electrode. The current study indicates that theoretical studies along with empirical research can be useful in displaying electrochemical reaction mechanisms."
Signature of postglacial colonization on contemporary genetic structure and diversity of Quadrula quadrula (Bivalvia: Unionidae),"Contemporary species distributions and geographic patterns of genetic structure largely reflect pre-historic events, often with subsequent alterations from human influences. The geographic genetic structure of a relatively common and widespread unionid species, Quadrula quadrula, was investigated to reconstruct its postglacial history. Hypotheses regarding colonization routes of Q. quadrula into the Great Lakes basin after the most recent glacial retreat were tested. Samples were collected from Q. quadrula at sites spanning hypothesized glacial refugia and postglacial expansion routes in the Mississippi River drainage, including the Ohio and Missouri rivers, and the Great Lakes. Broad-scale phylogeography and population structure were assessed by sequencing a fragment of the mitochondrial CO1 gene and genotyping eight microsatellites. Results of analyses showed marked differences among the Great Lakes, Mississippi River, and Ohio River drainages, and suggested colonization of the Great Lakes basin from a Mississippian source. Populations showed patterns of isolation by distance: geographic and genetic distances were significantly correlated among Great Lakes populations based on colonization through the Chicago–Illinois outlet, but not when following the Wabash–Maumee outlet. All evidence indicates that postglacial colonization of the Great Lakes basin occurred almost exclusively through the Chicago–Illinois outlet, with subsequent expansion into the lower Great Lakes."
Adipokines: A Possible Contribution to Vascular and Bone Remodeling in Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,"Osteoporosis is a major comorbidity of cardio-respiratory diseases, but the mechanistic links between pulmonary arterial hypertension and bone remain elusive. The purpose of the stud was to evaluate serum adipokines and endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels in the patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) NYHA class III-IV and to determine its associations with bone mineral density (BMD). Pulmonary and hemodynamic parameters, BMD Z-scores at the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN), serum leptin, adiponectin, visfatin and endothelin-1 (ET-1), were evaluated in 32 patients with IPAH NYHA class III-IV and 30 healthy volunteers. Leptin, adiponectin and ET-1 were higher in the patients with IPAH than in healthy subjects. Visfatin level showed a tendency to increase compared to that of healthy subjects (p = 0.076). The univariate analysis revealed a positive correlation between BMD Z-scores at both sites and 6-min walk test, and inverse relation with pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP). Adiponectin and visfatin showed positive correlations with PVR (p = 0.009 and p = 0.006). Serum adiponectin, visfatin and leptin were inversely associated with Z-scores. After adjusting for BMI and FMI, such associations persisted between visfatin and adiponectin levels and Z-scores at both sites. ET-1 related to mPAP, cardiac index and PVR. Negative correlation was observed between ET-1 and FN BMD (p = 0.01). Positive correlations have revealed between ET-1 and adiponectin (p = 0.02), visfatin (p = 0.004) in IPAH patients. These results provide further evidence that adipokine and endothelial dysregulation may cause not only a decrease in BMD, but also an increase in hemodynamic disorders of IPAH."
"Reference values of hematology, biochemistry, and blood type in cynomolgus monkeys from cambodia origin","Cynomolgus monkeys as nonhuman primates are valuable animal models because they have a high level of human gene homology. There are many reference values for hematology and biochemistry of Cynomolgus monkeys that are needed for proper clinical diagnosis and biomedical research conduct. The body weight information and blood type are also key success factors in allogeneic or xenogeneic models. Moreover, the biological parameters could be different according to the origin of the Cynomolgus monkey. However, there are limited references provided, especially of Cambodia origin. In this study, we measured average body weight of 2,518 Cynomolgus monkeys and analyzed hematology and serum biochemistry using 119 males, and determined blood types in 642 monkeys with Cambodia origin. The average body weight of male Cynomolgus monkeys were 2.56±0.345 kg and female group was 2.43± 0.330 kg at the age from 2 to 3 years. The male group showed relatively sharp increased average body weight from the 3 to 4 age period compared to the female group. In hematology and biochemistry, it was found that most of the data was similar when compared to other references even though some results showed differences. The ABO blood type result showed that type A, B, AB, and O was approximately 15.6, 33.3, 44.2, and 6.9%, respectively. The main blood type in this facility was B and AB. These biological background references of Cambodia origin could be used to provide important information to researchers who are using them in their biomedical research."
Prevalence of Salmonella spp. in pet turtles and their environment,"Pet turtles are known as a source of Salmonella infection to humans when handled in captivity. Thirty four turtles purchased from pet shops and online markets in Korea were examined to determine whether the turtles and their environment were contaminated with Salmonella spp. Salmonella spp. were isolated from fecal samples of 17 turtles. These isolates were identified as S. enterica through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The isolation rate of Salmonella spp. from the soil and water samples increased over time. We concluded that a high percentage of turtles being sold in pet shops were infected with Salmonella spp., and their environments tend to become contaminated over time unless they are maintained properly. These results indicate that pet turtles could be a potential risk of salmonellosis in Korea."
Reference values of clinical pathology parameters in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) used in preclinical studies,"Nonhuman primates are increasingly used in biomedical research since they are highly homologous to humans compared to other rodent animals. However, there is limited reliable reference data of the clinical pathology parameters in cynomolgus monkeys, and in particular, only some coagulation and urinalysis parameters have been reported. Here, we reported the reference data of clinical chemical, hematological, blood coagulation, and urinalysis parameters in cynomolgus monkeys. The role of sex differences was analyzed and several parameters (including hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell, blood urea nitrogen, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine kinase, gamma-glutamyl tranferase, and lactate dehydrogenase) significantly differed between male and female subjects. In addition, compared to previous study results, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine kinase, and aspartate aminotransferase showed significant variation. Interstudy differences could be affected by several factors, including age, sex, geographic origin, presence/absence of anesthetics, fasting state, and the analytical methods used. Therefore, it is important to deliberate with the overall reference indices. In conclusion, the current study provides a comprehensive and updated reference data of the clinical pathology parameters in cynomolgus monkeys and provides improved assessment criteria for evaluating preclinical studies or biomedical research."
Ischemic brain injury decreases dynamin-like protein 1 expression in a middle cerebral artery occlusion animal model and glutamate-exposed HT22 cells,"Dynamin-like protein I (DLP-1) is an important mitochondrial fission and fusion protein that is associated with apoptotic cell death in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated DLP-1 expression in a focal cerebral ischemia animal model and glutamate-exposed hippocampal-derived cell line. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was surgically induced in adult male rats to induce focal cerebral ischemic injury. Brain tissues were collected 24 hours after the onset of MCAO. MCAO induces an increase in infarct volume and histopathological changes in the cerebral cortex. We identified a decrease in DLP-1 in the cerebral cortices of MCAO-injured animals using a proteomic approach and Western blot analysis. Moreover, glutamate treatment significantly decreased DLP-1 expression in a hippocampalderived cell line. The decrease in DLP-1 indicates mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, these results suggest that neuronal cell injury induces a decrease in DLP-1 levels and consequently leads to neuronal cell death."
Evaluation of stability and biocompatibility of PHEMA-PMMA keratoprosthesis by penetrating keratoplasty in rabbits,"Artificial corneas have been developed as an alternative to natural donor tissue to replace damaged or diseased corneas. This study was conducted to evaluate the stability and biocompatibility of PHEMAPMMA [poly (2-hydroxyl methacrylate)-poly (methyl methacrylate)] keratoprostheses in rabbits following penetrating keratoplasty. Sixteen male New Zealand White rabbits aged 16 weeks were divided into three groups. Group I and group II contained six rabbits each, while the control group had four rabbits. Experimental surgery was conducted under general anesthesia. The cornea was penetrated using an 8 mm diameter biopsy punch. In group I (core 5 mm & skirt 3 mm) and group II (core 6 mm & skirt 2 mm), the keratoprosthesis was placed into the recipient full thickness bed and sutured into position with double-layer continuous. In the control group, corneal transplantation using normal allogenic corneal tissue was performed with the same suture method. After four and eight weeks, keratoprosthesis devices were evaluated by histopathological analysis of gross lesions. Post-operative complications were observed, such as extrusion and infection in experimental groups. Most corneas were maintained in the defect site by double-layer continuous suture materials for 4 weeks and kept good light transmission. However, most artificial cornea were extruded before 8 weeks. Overall, combined PHEMA and PMMA appears to have sufficient advantages for production of artificial corneas because of its optical transparency, flexibility and other mechanical features. However, the stability and biocompatibility were not sufficient to enable application in humans and animals at the present time using penetrating keratoplasty. Further studies are essential to improve the stability and biocompatibility with or without other types of keratoplasty."
Laxative effects of Liriope platyphylla are tightly correlated with suppression of endoplasmic reticulum stress in loperamide-induced constipation of SD rats,"A dysfunction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response can result in various diseases, including cancer, inflammation, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. To investigate whether ER stress response can play an essential role in the induction and treatment of chronic constipation, alterations in the key parameters for ER stress were measured in loperamide (Lop) induced constipation Sprague Dawley (SD) rats treated with aqueous extracts of Liriope platyphylla (AEtLP), which has been shown to have a laxative effect. Symptoms of chronic constipation including alteration of stool parameters and the transverse colon’s structure were successfully induced by Lop treatment. Laxative effects such as enhancement of stools parameters, recovery of the mucosa thickness, increased muscle thickness and recovery of flat luminal surface were also observed in the Lop+AEtLP treated group. Furthermore, enhancement of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) phosphorylation and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 beta (IRE1β) expression, key indicators for ER stress, that were observed in the Lop+vehicle treated group were significantly recovered in the Lop+AEtLP treated group, although the phosphorylation level of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) remained constant. Moreover, alterations in the transcription level of the marker genes X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) and growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein (GADD34) were similar to those of eIF2α and IRE1β. However, their level was slightly or completely recovered after AEtLP treatment. Overall, this study provides the first evidence that ER stress response may be tightly correlated with chronic constipation induced by Lop treatment, as well as the laxative effects of AEtLP."
Diallyl disulfide attenuates acetaminophen-induced renal injury in rats,"This study investigated the protective effects of diallyl disulfide (DADS) against acetaminophen (AAP)-induced acute renal injury in male rats. We also investigated the effects of DADS on kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NCAL), which are novel biomarkers of nephrotoxicity in renal tissues, in response to AAP treatment. The following four experimental groups were evaluated: (1) vehicle control, (2) AAP (1,000 mg/kg), (3) AAP&DADS, and (4) DADS (50 mg/kg/day). AAP treatment caused acute kidney injury evidenced by increased serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and histopathological alterations. Additionally, Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis showed increased expression of KIM-1 and NCAL proteins in renal tissues of AAP-treated rats. In contrast, DADS pretreatment significantly attenuated the AAP-induced nephrotoxic effects, including serum BUN level and expression of KIM-1 and NCAL proteins. Histopathological studies confirmed the renoprotective effect of DADS. The results suggest that DADS prevents AAP-induced acute nephrotoxicity, and that KIM-1 and NCAL may be useful biomarkers for the detection and monitoring of acute kidney injury associated with AAP exposure."
Acute toxicity and cytotoxicity evaluation of Dendrobium moniliforme aqueous extract in vivo and in vitro,"Dendrobium moniliforme (L.) Sw., an herb of the Orchidaceae family, has long been used in traditional medicine to strengthen bones, nourish the stomach, and promote the production of bodily fluid. Recently, polysaccharides isolated from Dendrobium have been used in functional foods and nutraceutical products. A traditional method to process Dendrobium is to soak fresh stems in an ethanol solution, which is the most important factor to ensure high yields of aqueous-extractable polysaccharides. The present study was carried out to investigate the potential acute toxicity of D. moniliforme aqueous extract (DMAE), by a single oral dose in Sprague-Dawley rats. The test article was orally administered once by gavage to male and female rats at doses of 0, 2,500, and 5,000 mg/kg body weight (n=5 male and female rats for each dose). Throughout the study period, no treatment-related deaths were observed and no adverse effects were noted in clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, serum biochemistry, organ weight, or gross findings at any dose tested. The results show that a single oral administration of DMAE did not induce any toxic effects at a dose below 5,000 mg/kg in rats, and the minimal lethal dose was considered to be over 5,000 mg/kg body weight for both sexes. With respect to cytotoxicity, the cell viability of human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells was less than 50% when the cells were treated with 10 mg/mL aqueous extract for 24 h."
Anti-inflammatory effect of egg white-chalcanthite and purple bamboo salts mixture on arthritis induced by monosodium iodoacetate in Sprague-Dawley rats,"The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of anti-osteoarthritis effects on egg white-chalcanthite (EC), purple bamboo salts (PBS), and a mixture of EC and PBS (EC+PBS). EC is a mixture of egg white and pulverized chalcanthite. PBS has been widely used as one of functional foods in Korea and shows unique features compared with common salt. Osteoarthritis was induced by intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA, 4mg/kg bw) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Test substances were administered once daily for 6 weeks at doses of 10 mg EC, EC+100 mg PBS, EC+200 mg PBS before and after MIA injection. Each substance was assessed by blood chemistry parameters, and by serum cytokines including IL-1β and IL-6, and nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2). Structural changes of articular cartilage were also evaluated by histopathological examination. As a result, body weight and blood chemistry parameter were not different in all experimental groups. EC+PBS mixture reduced the production of PGE2, NO, IL-1β, and IL-6. In histological grade of osteoarthritis, EC+PBS mixture had a tendency to ameliorate damage of articular cartilage induced by MIA in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, EC+PBS mixture was demonstrated to have a potential for anti-inflammatory effect against osteoarthritis induced by MIA in a dose-dependent manner."
Assessment of collagen antibody-induced arthritis in BALB/c mice using bioimaging analysis and histopathological examination,"The aim of this study was to examine the therapeutic potential of sulfasalazine and prednisolone in a mouse collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) model. Twenty-five male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into five groups: group 1 (G1): control, group 2 (G2): probe control, group 3 (G3): CAIA, group 4 (G4): CAIA+sulfasalazine (10 mg/kg, oral), and group 5 (G5): CAIA+prednisolone (100 mg/kg, oral). Fluorescence bioimaging was performed in vivo 24 and 48 h after treatment with a fluorescence probe (OsteoSense 680 EX), and all mice were sacrificed. The hind knee joints were fixed in 10% neutral phosphate-buffered formalin, and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histopathological analyses were performed. The paw thickness increased in a time-dependent manner in G3 mice, but trended toward a decrease in both G4 and G5 mice. Fluorescence intensity increased in G3 mice at 24 and 48 h after fluorescence probe treatment, but the fluorescence intensity in G4 and G5 mice was lower than that in G3. Micro-CT analyses showed that the joint surfaces of G3 mice had a rough and irregular articular appearance, but the occurrence of these irregularities was lower in G4 and G5. Hematoxylin and eosin and Safranin O-fast green staining confirmed that destruction of the cartilage and bony structures, synovial hyperplasia, and inflammatory cell infiltration all occurred in G3, and that the occurrence of these phenomena was lower in G4 and G5 than in G3. Taken together, these results suggest that sulfasalazine and prednisolone can reduce acute rheumatoid arthritis in mice."
Retrospective growth kinetics and radiosensitivity analysis of various human xenograft models,"The purpose of this study was to delineate the various factors that affect the growth characteristics of human cancer xenografts in nude mice and to reveal the relationship between the growth characteristics and radiosensitivity. We retrospectively analyzed 390 xenografts comprising nine different human cancer lines grown in nude mice used in our institute between 2009 and 2015. Tumor growth rate (TCR) was calculated using exponential growth equations. The relationship between the TCR of xenografts and the proliferation of the cells in vitro was examined. Additionally, we examined the correlations between the surviving fractions of cells after 2 Cy irradiation in vitro and the response of the xenograft to radiation. The TCR of xenografts was positively related to the proliferation of the cells in vitro (rp=0.9714, p < 0.0001), whereas it was independent of the histological type of the xenografts. Radiation-induced suppression of the growth rate (T/C%) of xenografts was positively related to the radiosensitivity of the cells in vitro (SF2; rp=0.8684, p=0.0284) and TCR (rp=0.7623, p=0.0780). The proliferation of human cancer cells in vitro and the growth rate of xenografts were positively related. The radiosensitivity of cancer cells, as judged from the SF2 values in vitro, and the radiation-induced suppression of xenograft growth were positively related. In conclusion, the growth rate of human xenografts was independent of histological type and origin of the cancer cells, and was positively related to the proliferation of the cancer cells in vitro."
Changes of hematological references depends on storage period and temperature conditions in rats and dogs,"Because changes in rat and dog hematological parameters according to storage conditions have been poorly documented, we sought to examine such changes. Blood analysis was performed using two hematology analyzers (ADVIA 2120i and Sysmex XN-V) after storage at room temperature and in cold storage for 5, 24, and 48 h, respectively. Interassay coefficients of variation for hematological parameters analyzed with the ADVIA 2120i and the XN-V showed similar. The levels of hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and platelet (PLT) showed significant variations with time in blood samples of rats and dogs. The leukocyte subpopulation showed high variation with storage conditions. The data for leukocyte differential counts obtained using the ADVIA 2120i, XN-V, and a manual differential counting procedure showed good agreement for neutrophils and lymphocyte counts, but monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils showed differences between the procedures. In conclusions, most rat and dog hematological parameters showed minimal changes; however, some showed high variation with storage time and temperature, especially PLT and leukocyte subpopulations. In conclusion, when performing hematological analysis in dogs and rats, it will be exactitude to analyze blood samples in fresh condition and at least within 24 h in the cold storage."
Biodiesel Synthesis from Palm Fatty Acid Distillate Using Tungstophosphoric Acid Supported on Cesium-Containing Niobia,"Tungstophosphoric acid supported on cesium-containing niobia (TPA/Cs
x
/Nb2O5, x = 1.0–2.5) catalysts were prepared by a two-step impregnation method, and their physico-chemical properties were investigated. The initial studies on the esterification of oleic acid with methanol revealed that TPA/Cs ratio affected the acidity as well as the activity of the catalysts. Among the catalysts tested, TPA/Cs1.0/Nb2O5 exhibited the best performance. In addition, the efficiency of TPA/Cs1.0/Nb2O5 for biodiesel synthesis from palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), a by-product from palm oil industry, was demonstrated, and the reaction parameters were also evaluated. Over 90% yield of FAME was achieved, and the properties of the biodiesel obtained from PFAD met the standard requirements for biodiesel fuel. However, deactivation of the catalysts was observed, possibly due to structural transformation or organic residues blocking the active sites."
Estimating Thermodynamic Properties of Pure Triglyceride Systems Using the Triglyceride Property Calculator,"To date, the most comprehensive model for predicting thermodynamic properties of pure triglycerides was presented by Wesdorp in “Liquid-multiple solid phase equilibria in fats: theory and experiments” (1990). In this paper, we present (1) corrections to the published model, as well as (2) a software implementation of the model for numerical assessment. The software tool, Triglyceride Property Calculator (TPC), uses a semi-empirical model to estimate the enthalpy of fusion and melting temperature for a given triglyceride based on its molecular composition and polymorphic form. These estimates are compared to experimentally collected data when available. The web application is available at http://www.crcfoodandhealth.com (under research tools) and through the AOCS Lipid Library. The quality of estimates is characterized according to defined counting metrics and presented for TAG subcategories. Additionally, the extrapolative value of the TPC is assessed by checking for consistency with underlying thermodynamic constraints. The current TPC implementation is effective in describing experimentally collected melting point data, with greater than 91% of the fitted values falling within 10% of the actual data. The TPC is also very good at describing collected enthalpy data. The underlying semi-empirical model and parameter set perform well in ensuring enthalpy predictions are thermodynamically consistent, however, extrapolated melting temperatures appear unreliable. Developing models and parameter sets that ensure thermodynamic consistency is a priority with future TPC iterations."
Controlling of material flow in the quasi-bulk forming of thin-walled corrugated rings through optimization of contact pressure,"Corrugated rings made of difficult-to-deform superalloy sheet with extremely thin wall are hardly manufactured since the forming processes are rather sensitive to parameters, such as axial feeding, cavity pressure, contact pressure, and so forth. The quasi-bulk forming method proposed in the author’s previous work, which gets rid of axial compression, was demonstrated to be an effective solution. In this work, forming strategy based on the controlling of material flow in this process is further developed. Since the pressure-carrying medium (i.e., viscous medium) is of high viscosity, the sealing pressure of this process is lowered down in comparison with that of forming processes utilizing nonviscous fluid as forming medium. The contact pressure at blank ends becomes adjustable as a result. Effects of contact pressure at sealing/blank interface (P

m
) on the blank draw-in were investigated numerically. An optimal load path of P

m
 was obtained. Regulatory mechanism of contact pressure was presented, and contact pressure was considered to be the resultant pressure caused by the static pressure (P

s
) and cavity pressure (P

v
). Thereafter, process optimization was conducted through adjusting the path of P

v
 to approximate to the optimal path of P

m
. On the basis of that, geometrical parameters of die cavity were improved and forming experiments were conducted accordingly to form two sorts of nickel-based superalloy corrugated rings. Sufficient blank draw-in was observed and thickness thinning is acceptable. The forming strategy, which is based on the adjustment of contact pressure, was verified to be feasible to improve the manufacturability of thin-walled corrugated rings."
An evaluation system for surface waviness generated by the dynamic behavior of a hydrostatic spindle in ultra-precision machining,"The generation mechanism of the surface waviness, influenced by the dynamic behavior of the hydrostatic spindle system, is critical for evaluating the machining accuracy of a machine tool. In this study, an evaluation system is proposed to identify the key parameters of a shaft supported by the hydrostatic bearings and to decide the order preference of the influencing factors in the spindle system. The balance analysis is performed to describe the key parameters; then, the generation model of the waviness is built up according to the spindle vibration information. The relationship between the generation model and the actual waviness results is evaluated through the correlation method. It is found that the degree coefficient is above 0.45. Finally, the corresponding spectral characteristics of the spindle system are extracted from the actual waviness results with power spectral density. This verifies that the spindle error is the main factor affecting the accuracy of the actual machining; furthermore, the generation model of the waviness under the effect of the spindle error is correct."
Ceramic core shifting monitoring through clamping rods optimization for wax pattern of turbine blade,"The wall thickness of hollow turbine blade has great influences on its performance and service life. The precision of the wall thickness of blade is mostly inherited from its corresponding wax pattern. Since the clamping rods do not normally come into contact with the surfaces of ceramic core, the core can shift under the uneven distribution of wax flow during injection process, which results in deviation of wall thickness of wax pattern. To solve this issue, a ceramic core shifting monitoring method was proposed in this study. First, the force and moment that wax flow exerted on the ceramic core were predicted with the help of numerical simulation. Then, the shifting model of ceramic core with the contactless constraints of clamping rods was proposed. Moreover, in order to control core shifting, clamping rod layout optimization model was established, and an improved genetic algorithm was presented to minimize core shifting. The optimization result indicated that the maximum and average deviation of the inner cavity dimensions of wax pattern decreased greatly."
Study on 3D topography of machined surface in high-speed hard cutting with PCBN tool,"The 3D topography characterization method can more accurately reflect the micro structure and its state than the 2D method. In this work, the experiments on cylindrical turning of bearing outer rings with PCBN tools are conducted. The influences of flank wear and cutting parameters on the 3D topography parameters, including 3D profile, kurtosis, slope, area parameters of support rate, volume parameters of surface bearing, and side flow, are determined. It is found that high cutting speed and flank wear generate coarse surface, and the peaks and troughs on the surface are more random. The kurtosis and slope of the machined surface both increase with flank wear and cutting speed. More flat peaks are generated at low speed cutting, and the machined surface will become steep with flank wear. The area parameters of support rate and volume parameters of surface bearing decrease with the increasing of tool wear and cutting speed, which will decrease the wear resistance of the surface and surface bearing capacity. Side flow increases with increasing cutting speed and flank wear, and irregular ridge line is found, which has a negative influence on the machined surface topography."
Improving the pose accuracy of the Delta robot in machining operations,"The main objective of this work is to study the elastic deformations affecting Delta parallel robots during machining operations (e.g., milling). These deformations always induce errors on the programmed tool trajectories. A mathematical evaluation model of these errors has been established. Firstly, this model enables the evaluation of positional errors. Secondly, a compensation procedure of these errors can be performed by instantaneously correcting the motorized joints variables. This procedure is based on the concepts of beam theory involving in particular CASTIGLIANO’s theorem. These deformations (errors) are evaluated at the end effector of the mobile platform. They are estimated as differences between the poses of the end-effector in both hypothesis cases: rigid and flexible. The correction values are obtained by the inverse differential model. The error compensation procedure is performed by an instantaneous correction of the motorized joints variables; the developed approach is applied and exemplified for the Delta parallel robot but remains generalizable to other class of parallel robots."
Plasma Phospholipid Fatty Acid Profile is Altered in Both Septic and Non-Septic Critically Ill: A Correlation with Inflammatory Markers and Albumin,"This study analyzes fatty acid (FA) composition in plasma lipids and erythrocyte phospholipids while comparing septic and non-septic critically ill patients. The aim was to describe impacts of infection and the inflammatory process. Patients with severe sepsis (SP, n = 13); age-, sex- and APACHE II score-matched non-septic critically ill with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (NSP, n = 13); and age-/sex-matched healthy controls (HC, n = 13) were included in a prospective case–control study during the first 24 h after admission to the intensive care unit. In both SP and NSP, lower n-6 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) accompanied by higher proportions of monounsaturated FA (MUFA) in plasma phospholipids (PPL) was observed relative to HC. MUFA proportion was negatively correlated with n-6 PUFA, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and albumin. MUFA was positively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukins (IL-6, IL-10), oxidized low density lipoproteins (ox-LDL), and conjugated dienes (CD). In both SP and NSP, inflammatory and lipid peroxidation markers were significantly higher—CRP (p < 0.001; p = 0.08), IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α (p < 0.01, p = 0.06), ox-LDL, and CD while total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C albumin, and 20:4n-6/22:6n-3 and n-6/n-3 ratios were lower compared to HC. In conclusion, the changes in plasma lipid FA profile relate to the intensity of inflammatory and peroxidative response regardless of insult etiology. The lower MUFA and higher n-6 PUFA proportions in PPL were inversely correlated with cholesterol and albumin levels."
TGF-β Down-regulates Apolipoprotein M Expression through the TAK-1-JNK-c-Jun Pathway in HepG2 Cells,"Apolipoprotein M (apoM) is a relatively novel apolipoprotein that plays pivotal roles in many dyslipidemia-associated diseases; however, its regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Many cytokines have been identified that down-regulate apoM expression in HepG2 cells, among which transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) exerts the most potent effects. In addition, c-Jun, a member of the activated protein 1 (AP-1) family whose activity is modulated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), decreases apoM expression at the transcriptional level by binding to the regulatory element in the proximal apoM promoter. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms through which TGF-β decreases the apoM level in HepG2 cells. The results revealed that TGF-β inhibited apoM expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner and that it suppressed apoM secretion. These effects were attenuated by treatment of cells with either SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) or c-Jun siRNA. 5Z-7-oxozeaenol [(a TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK-1) inhibitor)] also attenuated the TGF-β-mediated inhibition of apoM expression and suppressed the activation of JNK and c-Jun. These results have demonstrated that TGF-β suppresses apoM expression through the TAK-1-JNK-c-Jun pathway in HepG2 cells."
CaCl2 treatment improves drought stress tolerance in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.),"Spring drought can adversely affect the productivity of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) by reducing the yield. Because seed osmopriming can enhance crop productivity, we examined the potential of CaCl2 treatment to improve drought tolerance in spring barley. Initially, we applied the priming procedure (5, 50, and 500 mM) to caryopses and assessed its effectiveness using a routine germination test, followed by measuring the level of divalent cations. Since drought adaptation is a complex phenomenon, we tested a comprehensive set of physiological parameters including (1) relative water content (RWC), (2) gas exchange parameters, and (3) photosynthetic pigments concentration in leaves of 3-week-old plants developed from the seeds subjected to osmopriming, followed by exposure to increasing water shortage. The plants were sampled at two selected time points, determined by soil moisture retention (pF = 3.6 and 4.2). The effect of CaCl2 pretreatment was characterized in three distinct spring barley varieties, which differed in their response to drought stress (drought-tolerant Sebastian and Cam/B1/C1 and drought-susceptible Georgie), to assess potential interactions between osmopriming and genetically determined drought tolerance. Our results clearly demonstrate that CaCl2 priming improves drought tolerance in stress-tolerant as well as drought-susceptible barley cultivars. Furthermore, we show that the beneficial effects of calcium preconditioning interact significantly with genetically determined drought tolerance."
"The Water Margin, Moral Criticism, and Cultural Confrontation","The Water Margin (Shuihu Zhuan 水滸傳) is one of the four great classical novels of China. It describes how people from different walks of life were driven to become outlaws as a result of poor governance and widespread corruption. These outlaws have been regarded by some commentators as heroes, despite the fact that they perform wanton killing, over retribution, and cannibalism. Liu Zaifu 劉再復 argues that the novel has contributed to the moral downfall of the Chinese people. In this essay, I put forward various arguments in objection to Liu. I think Liu’s argument is unsound, partly because he fails to address the nature of the cultural confrontation between modern readers and The Water Margin. By conducting an evaluation of Liu, I also consider a range of issues concerning how we may understand The Water Margin, and how the novel may morally relate to us in modern society."
“Benevolence-Righteousness” as Strategic Terminology: Reading Mengzi’s “Ren-Yi” through Strategic Manuals,"This essay offers an experimental interpretation for Mengzi’s 孟子 ren-yi 仁義 discourses, reading them as strategic prescriptions akin to those presented in classical strategic manuals. However, rather than arguing that it is the correct interpretation of Mengzi, I use it to highlight the ambiguity of Mengzi’s discourses. This ambiguity, I argue, motivated Zhuangzi’s 莊子 criticisms of moral language abuse and rationalizes some early narratives about Mengzi."
Q2Stress: A database for multiple cues to stress assignment in Italian,"In languages where the position of lexical stress within a word is not predictable from print, readers rely on distributional information extracted from the lexicon in order to assign stress. Lexical databases are thus especially important for researchers willing to address stress assignment in those languages. Here we present Q2Stress, a new database aimed to fill the lack of such a resource for Italian. Q2Stress includes multiple cues readers may use in assigning stress, such as type and token frequency of stress patterns as well as their distribution with respect to number of syllables, grammatical category, word beginnings, word endings, and consonant-vowel structures. Furthermore, for the first time, data for both adults and children are available. Q2Stress may help researchers to answer empirical as well as theoretical questions about stress assignment and stress-related issues, and more in general, to explore the orthography-to-phonology relation in reading. Q2Stress is designed as a user-friendly resource, as it comes with scripts allowing researchers to explore and select their own stimuli according to several criteria as well as summary tables for overall data analysis."
Statistical power of likelihood ratio and Wald tests in latent class models with covariates,"This paper discusses power and sample-size computation for likelihood ratio and Wald testing of the significance of covariate effects in latent class models. For both tests, asymptotic distributions can be used; that is, the test statistic can be assumed to follow a central Chi-square under the null hypothesis and a non-central Chi-square under the alternative hypothesis. Power or sample-size computation using these asymptotic distributions requires specification of the non-centrality parameter, which in practice is rarely known. We show how to calculate this non-centrality parameter using a large simulated data set from the model under the alternative hypothesis. A simulation study is conducted evaluating the adequacy of the proposed power analysis methods, determining the key study design factor affecting the power level, and comparing the performance of the likelihood ratio and Wald test. The proposed power analysis methods turn out to perform very well for a broad range of conditions. Moreover, apart from effect size and sample size, an important factor affecting the power is the class separation, implying that when class separation is low, rather large sample sizes are needed to achieve a reasonable power level."
The High Cost of Stroke and Stroke Cytoprotection Research,"Acute ischemic stroke is inadequately treated in the USA and worldwide due to a lengthy history of neuroprotective drug failures in clinical trials. The majority of victims must endure life-long disabilities that not only affect their livelihood, but also have an enormous societal economic impact. The rapid development of a neuroprotective or cytoprotective compound would allow future stroke victims to receive a treatment to reduce disabilities and further promote recovery of function. This opinion article reviews in detail the enormous costs associated with developing a small molecule to treat stroke, as well as providing a timely overview of the cell-death time-course and relationship to the ischemic cascade. Distinct temporal patterns of cell-death of neurovascular unit components provide opportunities to intervene and optimize new cytoprotective strategies. However, adequate research funding is mandatory to allow stroke researchers to develop and test their novel therapeutic approach to treat stroke victims."
The role of the North Atlantic Oscillation in European climate projections,"This study highlights the expected range of projected winter air temperature and precipitation trends over the next 30–50 years due to unpredictable fluctuations of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) superimposed upon forced anthropogenic climate change. The findings are based on a 40-member initial-condition ensemble of simulations covering the period 1920–2100 conducted with the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) at 1° spatial resolution. The magnitude (and in some regions, even the sign) of the projected temperature and precipitation trends over Europe, Russia and parts of the Middle East vary considerably across the ensemble depending on the evolution of the NAO in each individual member. Thus, internal variability of the NAO imparts substantial uncertainty to future changes in regional climate over the coming decades. To validate the model results, we apply a simple scaling approach that relates the margin-of-error on a trend to the statistics of the interannual variability. In this way, we can obtain the expected range of projected climate trends using the interannual statistics of the observed NAO record in combination with the model’s radiatively-forced response (given by the ensemble-mean of the 40 simulations). The results of this observationally-based estimate are similar to those obtained directly from the CESM ensemble, attesting to the fidelity of the model’s representation of the NAO and the utility of this approach. Finally, we note that the interannual statistics of the NAO and associated surface climate impacts are subject to uncertainty due to sampling fluctuations, even when based on a century of data."
Hindcast skill for the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation at 26.5°N within two MPI-ESM decadal climate prediction systems,"We analyse the hindcast skill for the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) against 10 years of RAPID/MOCHA AMOC observations, which are now long enough to remove the mean seasonal cycle prior to the hindcast skill analysis. We analyse AMOC hindcast skill in two hindcast ensembles generated with two differently initialised decadal prediction systems that are both based on the earth system model MPI-ESM. We evaluate the hindcast skill for the AMOC and its components in both prediction systems against RAPID/MOCHA observations both with and without the mean seasonal cycle removed using anomaly correlation (COR) and root-mean-square error as skill measures. We find significant hindcast skill for most lead years up to 5 for monthly-mean AMOC variations only in the newer of the two prediction systems and only using COR, but with and without the mean seasonal cycle removed. In both systems and for all analysed lead years, the two geostrophic transport components (the upper-mid-ocean transport and Florida Strait combined, that is: AMOC minus Ekman) are the main source of hindcast skill. In the present model setup and with the currently available observational time series, we cannot relate AMOC hindcast skill to the upper-mid-ocean transport alone. Yet, we can show that the seasonal variability of the upper-mid-ocean transport in the free coupled model originates from eastern boundary density variability. Overall, our results indicate modest yet robust AMOC hindcast skill above the uninitialized simulation, independent of the treatment of the seasonal cycle, although we cannot directly link this hindcast skill to the initialisation of the density field with either initialisation method."
Transcriptomic analysis of Casuarina equisetifolia L. in responses to cold stress,"Casuarina species are valued as pioneer trees for coastal shelter forest construction. However, low temperature stress limits its cultivation expansion, fast growth, and high yield. To investigate the molecular mechanism by which Casuarina trees cope with cold stress and to provide a comprehensive sequence resource for further molecular genetic research on Casuarina species, we employed RNA-Seq technology to study the genome-wide expression profiles during cold stress in Casuarina equisetifolia L. Four cDNA libraries constructed from mRNAs of control and cold-treated seedlings (at −5 °C for 5 h) were sequenced by using the Illumina sequencing platform. A total of 118,270 unigenes were obtained by de novo assembly, creating an initial reference transcriptome dataset of C. equisetifolia. Among these unigenes, 4639 were identified as early cold response genes including 2331 cold up-regulated and 2308 down-regulated. Furthermore, the expression changes of 18 genes under cold stress from RNA-Seq analysis were further validated by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Functional network analysis indicate that modifications in the expression of genes involved in signal regulation by transcription factors, metabolic pathways including synthesis of carbohydrate, secondary metabolites, and antioxidant enzymes might play vital roles in responses to cold stress in C. equisetifolia. This study represents the first large-scale transcriptome annotation of C. equisetifolia and may be beneficial to elucidate the cold response mechanisms of Casuarina trees and will be useful in cold-tolerant Casuarina species breeding."
Brief exposure to Pope Francis heightens moral beliefs about climate change,"In his recent encyclical letter Laudato Si’: On Care for Our Common Home, Pope Francis issued a moral appeal to the global community for swift action on climate change. However, social science research suggests a complex relationship between religious concepts and environmental attitudes, raising the question of what influence the pope’s position may have on public opinion regarding this polarizing issue. In a national probability survey experiment of U.S. adults (n = 1212), we find that brief exposure to Pope Francis influenced the climate-related beliefs of broad segments of the public: it increased perceptions of climate change as a moral issue for the overall sample (and among Republicans in particular) and increased felt personal responsibility for contributing to climate change and its mitigation (among Democrats). Moreover, prior awareness of the pope’s views on climate change mattered, such that those who indicated greater awareness of the pope’s position showed stronger treatment effects, consistent with a priming account of these effects. Results complement recent correlational findings and offer further evidence of the Vatican’s influence on climate change public opinion."
Hurricane damage assessment for residential construction considering the non-stationarity in hurricane intensity and frequency,"Natural hazards such as hurricanes may cause extensive economic losses and social disruption for civil structures and infrastructures in coastal areas, implying the importance of understanding the construction performance subjected to hurricanes and assessing the hurricane damages properly. The intensity and frequency of hurricanes have been reported to change with time due to the potential impact of climate change. In this paper, a probability-based model of hurricane damage assessment for coastal constructions is proposed taking into account the non-stationarity in hurricane intensity and frequency. The non-homogeneous Poisson process is employed to model the non-stationarity in hurricane occurrence while the non-stationarity in hurricane intensity is reflected by the time-variant statistical parameters (e.g., mean value and/or standard deviation), with which the mean value and variation of the cumulative hurricane damage are evaluated explicitly. The Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA, is chosen to illustrate the hurricane damage assessment method proposed in this paper. The role of non-stationarity in hurricane intensity and occurrence rate due to climate change in hurricane damage is investigated using some representative changing patterns of hurricane parameters."
Effect of Elevation on Soil Properties in Reconstructed Back Barrier Island Coastal Marsh Using Dredged Materials,"Soil physical, chemical and bio-geochemical properties of a back barrier island coastal marsh restored by low pressure hydraulic dredging were monitored and analyzed from 2005 to 2009. A 109 ha restored marsh located at Port Fourchon, Louisiana, was divided into five habitats based on elevation. The habitats were classified as high (knoll), flat (swale), upper intertidal, intertidal and open water (submerged soils). The higher habitats were created nearer the dredged material source by deposited dredged coarser sediment mainly sand and oyster shells in mounds. Material with higher clay and silt content in the slurry were found in the habitats located at greater distances from the dredged material source. Soil elemental contents were statistically significantly different among habitats. Soil redox potential was also significantly different among habitats with the higher elevations having more oxidized redox values. Soil elevation was a strong influence on soil physical and chemical properties for several years post construction. Uneven distribution of dredged materials during the construction phase resulted in distinct variation in elevation and soil properties and the conclusion was that marsh creation would be more effective if dredged materials were uniformly distributed."
Novel and reported pathogenic variants in exon 11 of BRCA2 gene in a cohort of Sri Lankan young breast cancer patients,"Women with breast carcinoma diagnosed before 40 years of age with a strong familial risk have a greater prevalence of germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants than late onset breast cancer. Previously germline variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were characterized in a cohort of Sri Lankan breast cancer patients unselected for age of onset. This study focused on young breast cancer patients who were screened for previously identified hotspot regions in BRCA2 gene. A total of 48 young breast cancer patients with family history of cancer and 25 healthy controls were studied. Direct sequencing was used to detect pathogenic and other sequence variants in the hotspot regions of BRCA2 gene. Thirty-six sequence variants including seven pathogenic (c.2411_2412delAA/p.Glu804Valfs*2, c.2500_2501insG/p.Leu834Cysfs*4, c.3881T>G/p.Leu1294*, c.4768A>T/p.Lys1590*, c.5645C>G/p.Ser1882*, c.5747delC/p.His1916Phefs*3, c.6728C>T/p.Ser2243Phe) and two likely pathogenic (c.1922C>T and c.3378A>T) variants, two intronic variants of unknown significance (c.1910-74T>C, c.1910-51G>T), two variants of uncertain significance (c.2324C>T c.5104C>T) and 23 benign variants were detected. Among them, seven were novel (pathogenic 5 and likely pathogenic 2). Prevalence of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in the hotspots regions of BRCA2 was 23 and 6.3 % respectively in this cohort. This justifies BRCA2 variant testing in young breast cancer patients with family history of cancer in Sri Lanka."
Evolution of stiffness anisotropy during creep of engineered silty sand in South Korea,"The variation in elastic shear moduli measured through bender element tests and the nonlinear strains in the axial and radial directions of triaxial specimens during creep were experimentally investigated. To consider various conditions of different relative densities and different stress ratios, a number of triaxial specimens were prepared. The engineered silty sand reconstituted from weathered residual soil in South Korea was used as the testing material. Due to aging, the post-creep stress-strain curve exhibited a stiffer response compared to the pre-creep stress-strain curve. It was found that the variation in elastic shear stiffness and the nonlinear deformation during creep depends on the stress ratio and initial relative density. The continuous change in the stiffness anisotropy during creep was closely related to the creep deformation patterns."

"The structure of FCPb, a light-harvesting complex in the diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana","Diatoms possess fucoxanthin chlorophyll proteins (FCP) as light-harvesting systems. These membrane intrinsic proteins bind fucoxanthin as major carotenoid and Chl c as accessory chlorophyll. The relatively high sequence homology to higher plant light-harvesting complex II gave rise to the assumption of a similar overall structure. From centric diatoms like Cyclotella meneghiniana, however, two major FCP complexes can be isolated. FCPa, composed of Fcp2 and Fcp6 subunits, was demonstrated to be trimeric, whereas FCPb, known to contain Fcp5 polypeptides, is of higher oligomeric state. No molecular structure of either complex is available so far. Here we used electron microscopy and single particle analysis to elucidate the overall architecture of FCPb. The complexes are built from trimers as basic unit, assembling into nonameric moieties. The trimer itself is smaller, i.e. more compact than LHCII, but the main structural features are conserved."
Bisperylene bisimide based conjugated polymer as electron acceptor for polymer-polymer solar cells,"Perylene bisimide (PBI) unit has been widely used to design conjugated materials, which can be used as electron acceptor in organic solar cells due to its strong electron-deficient ability. In this work, a conjugated polymer based on PBI dimer as monomer was designed, synthesized, and compared to the conjugated polymer containing single PBI as repeating units. The two conjugated polymers were found to have similar molecular weight, absorption spectra and energy levels. Density functional theory calculation revealed that the PBI dimer-based polymer exhibited highly twisted conjugated backbone due to the large dihedral angle between the two PBI units. The PBI-based polymers as electron acceptor were applied into polymer-polymer solar cells, in which PBI dimer-based polymer solar cells were found to show a high short circuit current density (J
sc = 11.2 mA∙cm−2 and a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.5%. In comparison, the solar cells based on PBI-based polymer acceptor only provided a J
sc of 7.2 mA∙cm−2 and PCE of 2.5%. The significantly enhanced PCE in PBI dimer-based solar cells was attributed to the mixed phase in blended thin films, as revealed by atom force microscopy. This study demonstrates that PBI dimer can be used to design polymer acceptors for high performance polymerpolymer solar cells."
Highly efficient random terpolymers for photovoltaic applications with enhanced absorption and molecular aggregation,"A series of copolymers, based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as the electron donor and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT)/diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP) as the electron acceptors, were synthesized for highly efficient polymer solar cells. By changing the BT/DPP ratio in the conjugated backbone, the absorption, energy levels, molecular aggregation and carrier mobility could be finely tuned. With increased DPP content, the absorption range was extended to the longer wavelength region with narrower bandgaps. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels were also raised up and the molecular aggregation was enhanced. The balance of these factors would afford a remarkable device performance enhancement. Polymer P3 with BT:DPP = 0.7:0.3 (molar ratio) exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.01%, with open circuit voltage (V
oc = 0.73 V, short current density (J
sc = 18.45 mA·cm−2, and fill factor (FF) = 66.9%. The PCE value was improved by 48.7% compared to P1 and by 117.6% compared to P7, respectively, indicating a great potential in photovoltaic application."
An alternating polymer of two building blocks based on B←N unit: Non-fullerene acceptor for organic photovoltaics,"B←N coordination bond can be used to develop polymer electron acceptors for efficient all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). Here, we report a new alternating conjugated polymer containing two building blocks based on B←N unit. The polymer exhibits strong light absorption in the visible range, low-lying LUMO/HOMO energy levels and moderate electron mobility. The resulting all-PSC devices exhibit power conversion efficiencies of 1.50%–2.47%."
Improved photovoltaic performance from high quality perovskite thin film grown with the assistance of PC71BM,"The strategy of sequentially spin-coating a perovskite film from the perovskite precursor and an electron transporting layer of [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) is developed to simplify the fabrication procedure of perovskite solar cells. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy indicate that PC71BM film on perovskite layer can retard the evaporation of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) efficiently, thus prolonging the transformation of intermediate phase to perovskite crystals, leading to a high quality perovskite thin film. The solar cells with the structure of indium tin oxides (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/CH3NH3PbI3/PC71BM/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag made from this simplified method exhibit a higher efficiency (12.68%) than those from the conventional one-step method (9.49%)."
"Efficient P3HT:PC61BM solar cells employing 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the processing additives","The efficiency of the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) based organic solar cells was enhanced by using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) as a processing additive to control the blend morphology. The addition of TCB improved the arrangement of P3HT which resulted in good phase separated blend films. Correspondingly, the optimized solar cells showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.17% with a fill factor (FF) of 0.69, which were higher than those of common thermal annealing devices (PCE 3.84%, FF 0.67). The efficiency was further improved to 4.74% by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min with a higher FF of 0.74."
"Existence, uniqueness and approximation for L
p solutions of reflected BSDEs with generators of one-sided Osgood type","We prove several existence and uniqueness results for L
p (p > 1) solutions of reflected BSDEs with continuous barriers and generators satisfying a one-sided Osgood condition together with a general growth condition in y and a uniform continuity condition or a linear growth condition in z. A necessary and sufficient condition with respect to the growth of barrier is also explored to ensure the existence of a solution. And, we show that the solutions may be approximated by the penalization method and by some sequences of solutions of reflected BSDEs. These results are obtained due to the development of those existing ideas and methods together with the application of new ideas and techniques, and they unify and improve some known works."
Chung’s law of the iterated logarithm for subfractional Brownian motion,"Let X

H has the property of strong local nondeterminism. Applying this property and a stochastic integral representation of X
H, we establish Chung’s law of the iterated logarithm for X

Using video-reflexive ethnography to capture the complexity of leadership enactment in the healthcare workplace,"Current theoretical thinking asserts that leadership should be distributed across many levels of healthcare organisations to improve the patient experience and staff morale. However, much healthcare leadership education focusses on the training and competence of individuals and little attention is paid to the interprofessional workplace and how its inherent complexities might contribute to the emergence of leadership. Underpinned by complexity theory, this research aimed to explore how interprofessional healthcare teams enact leadership at a micro-level through influential acts of organising. A whole (interprofessional) team workplace-based study utilising video-reflexive ethnography occurred in two UK clinical sites. Thematic framework analyses of the video data (video-observation and video-reflexivity sessions) were undertaken, followed by in-depth analyses of human–human and human–material interactions. Data analysis revealed a complex interprofessional environment where leadership is a dynamic process, negotiated and renegotiated in various ways throughout interactions (both formal and informal). Being able to “see” themselves at work gave participants the opportunity to discuss and analyse their everyday leadership practices and challenge some of their sometimes deeply entrenched values, beliefs, practices and assumptions about healthcare leadership. These study findings therefore indicate a need to redefine the way that medical and healthcare educators facilitate leadership development and argue for new approaches to research which shifts the focus from leaders to leadership."
Maternal liver elasticity determined by acoustic radiation force impulse elastosonography in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy,Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a pregnancy-specific liver disorder characterized by maternal pruritus and impaired liver function. The objective of the study was to evaluate maternal liver elasticity by acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastosonography in ICP and to compare it with that in healthy pregnant women.
Improving particle detection sensitivity of a microfluidic resistive pulse sensor by a novel electrokinetic flow focusing method,"A novel and simple method of improving the particle detection sensitivity of a microfluidic resistive pulse sensor was presented in this paper. This novel electrokinetic flow focusing method utilizes a focusing solution (with high resistivity) flowing from the upstream focusing channel to the downstream focusing channel. The focusing solution in the sensing gate works like a virtual insulation wall that greatly narrows the gate and thus improves the detection sensitivity. An equation was derived to relate the magnitude of the output signal to the resistivity and the width of the focusing solution. The width of the focused particle solution under different voltages was numerically predicted. The results show that the magnitude of output signal increases with the decrease in the width of the focused particle stream. More importantly, the detection sensitivity can be improved by decreasing the space occupied by the focusing solution in the upstream and downstream channels as much as possible. Detection of 1 μm particle with a sensing gate of 30 × 40 × 10 μm (width × length × height) was successfully achieved. The proposed method is simple and advantageous in detecting smaller particles without fabricating a small sensing gate."
Effect of Elevation on Soil Properties in Reconstructed Back Barrier Island Coastal Marsh Using Dredged Materials,"Soil physical, chemical and bio-geochemical properties of a back barrier island coastal marsh restored by low pressure hydraulic dredging were monitored and analyzed from 2005 to 2009.

The higher habitats were created nearer the dredged material source by deposited dredged coarser sediment mainly sand and oyster shells in mounds. Material with higher clay and silt content in the slurry were found in the habitats located at greater distances from the dredged material source. Soil elemental contents were statistically significantly different among habitats. Soil redox potential was also significantly different among habitats with the higher elevations having more oxidized redox values. Soil elevation was a strong influence on soil physical and chemical properties for several years post construction. Uneven distribution of dredged materials during the construction phase resulted in distinct variation in elevation and soil properties and the conclusion was that marsh creation would be more effective if dredged materials were uniformly distributed."
Pressure-sensitive adhesive composites with a hydrophobic form of graphene oxide for enhanced thermal conductivity,"Pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) composites containing oleylamine functionalized graphene oxide (OA-f-GO) fillers were prepared. The effects of the surface modification of graphene oxide (GO) on the morphology of the PSA composites and on its thermal and adhesive properties were investigated. In contrast to GO fillers, the OA-f-GO fillers were found to be uniformly dispersed in the PSA matrix without any agglomeration and voids. The hydrophobization of GO resulting from the oleylamine functionalization improved the compatibility of the GO sheets with the PSA matrix. The thermal conductivity of the OA-f-GO (5 wt%)/PSA composites at UV energy of 2,000 mJ/cm2 was 55%, 140%, and 300% greater than the thermal conductivities of the OA-f-GO (5 wt%)/PSA composites, GO (5 wt%)/PSA composites, and bare PSA at UV energy of 800 mJ/cm2, respectively. In addition, the higher peel strength of the OA-f-GO/PSA composites compared to that of the GO/PSA composites was explained by the better wetting of hydrophobic OA-f-GO fillers in the PSA matrix."
Deficient amygdala–prefrontal intrinsic connectivity after effortful emotion regulation in borderline personality disorder,"Emotion instability in borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been associated with an impaired fronto-limbic inhibitory network. However, functional connectivity (FC) underlying altered emotion regulation in BPD has yet to be established. Here, we used resting-state fMRI to investigate enduring effects of effortful emotion regulation on the amygdala intrinsic FC in BPD. In this multicenter study, resting-state fMRI was acquired before and after an emotion regulation task in 48 BPD patients and 39 non-patient comparison individuals. The bilateral amygdalae were used as a seed in the whole-brain FC analysis and two-way mixed ANOVA to test whether BPD patients exhibited weaker post-task increase in the amygdala intrinsic FC with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), compared to non-patients. Subsequently, we explored whether the results are common for personality disorders characterized by emotional problems, using additional data of 21 cluster-C personality disorder patients. In contrast to non-patients, BPD patients failed to show increased post-task amygdala resting-state FC with the medial, dorsolateral, ventrolateral PFC, and superior temporal gyrus, but surprisingly exhibited decreased FC with the posterior cingulate cortex and increased FC with the superior parietal lobule. In BPD patients, the emotion regulation task failed to increase resting-state amygdala FC with brain regions essential for effortful emotion regulation, which suggests: (a) altered cognitive control typically used to indirectly alleviate distress by reinterpreting the meaning of emotional stimuli; (b) impaired direct regulation of emotional responses, which might be common for personality disorders; (c) avoidance of self-related appraisals induced by social emotional stimuli."
Resale Price Maintenance by Japanese Newspapers,"In Japan, newspapers enjoy a special exemption from antimonopoly prohibitions against resale price maintenance (suppliers’ stipulations that bar downstream firms from price discounting). However, if a newspaper company does stipulate retail prices, it is required to set uniform prices throughout Japan. Econometric analysis here shows that Japanese newspaper subscription prices are far below the levels that would maximize joint profit, given the newspaper content. The authorized resale price maintenance seems to have a motivation other than cartelization."
Appraising Unhappiness in the Wake of the Great East Japan Earthquake,"Considering the case of the Great East Japan Earthquake, we use the experienced-utility approach to appraise the psychological distress from disaster-related news. We take advantage of the serendipitous timing of our original nationwide weekly panel survey that became a fitting resource for the investigation of subjective well-being in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake. Although all of Japanese society was affected, we found geographical heterogeneity between the affected areas (Sendai and Tokyo) and the unaffected areas in terms of mental costs. Our finding reminds us of the focusing effect (Kahneman et al., 2006; Dolan and Kahneman, 2008) as captured by Schkade and Kahneman (1998) in the maxim “Nothing in life is quite as important as you think it is while you are thinking about it”."
How Big is the Gap in Wellbeing between Marginalised and Non-Marginalised Young People as They Approach Adolescence? Evidence from a National Survey of 9–14 Year Old Australians,"While research shows that wellbeing among disadvantaged or marginalised young people is often low, few analyses compare wellbeing across different groups of young people recognised by policy as marginalised, and the non-marginalised. This paper examines the extent to which wellbeing varies across five marginalised groups (young people with disability, young carers, materially disadvantaged young people, young people from non-English speaking background, and Indigenous young people) and the non-marginalised. Analysis was conducted on data from a nationally representative sample of 9–14 year old Australians in school years 4, 6 and 8 (N = 5440), designed following extensive consultations with young people. Their perspectives shaped the construction of the wellbeing index, operationalised using 12 indicators within domains of family, peer relationships, health, school, and life satisfaction. Analysis found a significant gap in wellbeing between young people with disability, young carers and materially disadvantaged young people on the one hand, and the non-marginalised on the other. Analysis also found gaps between Indigenous young people and the non-marginalised but these were mostly not significant. However, there was little difference in wellbeing between young people from non-English speaking background and the non-marginalised. For four of the five groups, gaps were larger among 13–14 year olds than among 9–12 year olds. Young people from non-English speaking backgrounds were exceptions in this respect. Latent Class Analysis was used to identify different wellbeing clusters. Odds of three marginalised groups (with disability, carers and materially disadvantaged) being in the lowest wellbeing cluster were particularly high, after controlling for other factors. However, half of those in the lowest wellbeing cluster were not in any of the marginalised groups. The analysis concludes that young people’s wellbeing can best be enhanced through universalist policies that seek to include everyone rather than only through targeting specific groups."
Kinderen op de fiets: helm op!,"Kinderen vormen een risicogroep voor het krijgen van traumatisch hersenletsel na een fietsongeval. In Nederland is er geen wet- of regelgeving opgesteld omtrent het gebruik van de fietshelm. Een kind dat van de fiets valt of geschept wordt, valt bijna altijd op zijn hoofd. Het preventieve effect van de fietshelm is aangetoond. Ook is uit de literatuur bekend dat verplichten van de fietshelm leidt tot toename van het gebruik ervan, in het bijzonder als dit beleid maatschappijbreed wordt doorgevoerd. De fietshelm kan een belangrijke bijdrage leveren aan de bescherming tegen risico’s die kinderen lopen als zij van de fiets vallen en de risico’s van verkeersongelukken. Daarom zijn wij van mening dat de fietshelm in Nederland verplicht gesteld dient te worden voor alle kinderen jonger dan 16 jaar."

Radiocarpale luxatie,"Een 59-jarige, verder gezonde man meldde zich op de Spoedeisende Hulp nadat de giek van zijn zeilboot bij een zogenaamde klapgijp zijn pols had getroffen. Bij lichamelijk onderzoek was er sprake van een bajonetstand van de pols, met een intacte neurovasculaire status."
Behandeling van het chronisch compartimentsyndroom met behulp van de KnifeLight® (Stryker®): een minimaal invasieve techniek,De behandeling van het chronisch compartimentsyndroom bestaat uit een fasciotomie. In dit artikel wordt het gebruik van de KnifeLight® voor een minimaal invasieve techniek besproken. In 2014 en 2015 zijn zes patiënten voor het chronisch compartimentsyndroom met deze minimale invasieve techniek behandeld. Tijdens de procedure is gebruikgemaakt van één incisie. Na de procedure waren de patiënten klachtenvrij. Schade aan de zenuwen trad niet op. Gebruik van de KnifeLight® bij het chronisch compartimentsyndroom is eerder beschreven in de literatuur. Onze techniek verschilt ten opzichte van de eerder beschreven techniek wat betreft het aantal incisies.
Os iliumfractuur na spongiosaplastiek,Os iliumfracturen worden vooral gezien na hoogenergetische traumata. Iatrogene fracturen na een bottransplantatie vanuit de crista iliaca zijn zeldzaam en kunnen bij afwezigheid van andere complicaties over het algemeen conservatief worden behandeld met klinisch goede uitkomsten. Men dient bedacht te zijn op risicofactoren voor fracturen na oogsten van spongiosa uit de crista iliaca en moet zo nodig uitwijken naar mogelijke alternatieven.
Reactie op Interbeoordelaarsbetrouwbaarheid van de Schatzker- en de three-columnclassificatie bij tibiaplateaufracturen,"Met veel interesse heb ik in nummer 4 van het Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Traumachirurgie van dit jaar, uw bijdrage over het 3-pijlerconcept voor de behandeling van tibiaplateaufracturen gelezen."
Transport Processes from Mechanics: Minimal and Simplest Models,"We review the current state of a fundamental problem of rigorous derivation of transport processes in classical statistical mechanics from classical mechanics. Such derivations for diffusion and momentum transport (viscosities) were obtained for minimal models of these processes involving one and two particles respectively. However, a minimal model which demonstrates heat conductivity contains three particles. Its rigorous analysis is currently out of reach for existing mathematical techniques. The gas of localized balls is widely accepted as a basis for a simplest model for derivation of Fourier’s law. We suggest a modification of the localized balls gas and argue that this gas of localized activated balls is a good candidate to rigorously prove Fourier’s law. In particular, hyperbolicity is derived for a reduced version of this model."
Synthesis and Properties Modified Feather Keratin-Based Motor Oil Sorbing Cryogels with High Oil Holding Capacity,"Oleic acid was used to modify keratin extracted from chicken feathers by free radical initiated graft copolymerization. Thereafter, the modified keratin was used for the synthesis of cryogels. The influence of oleic acid modification, the crosslinker content, and the protein concentration on the properties of the cryogels were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, SDS-PAGE, and through oil holding capacity tests. To enhance the sorption properties, the cryogels were crosslinked with glutaraldehyde. Varying protein concentration from 1.27 to 5.09 wt% and glutaraldehyde concentration from 0 to 5 wt% produced cryogels with oil holding capacity ranging from 4.56 to 10.76 g/g. The highest results exceeded the sorption capacity of previously published oleic acid modified woodchips (6.3 g/g) as well as polypropylene (6 g/g), which is the standard material used in industry."
The Anugītā as a Gloss on the Bhagavadgītā—Part II: Comparison of a Few Themes in the Two Texts,"This essay is the Part II and the concluding part of the essay under the same main title, whose Part I is subtitled ‘The Origin of Erroneous Exegetical Tradition of Bhagavadgītā.’ The aim of this essay is to bring out differences in the treatment of themes in the two texts, i.e. the Bhagavadgītā and the Anugītā, to show how erroneous interpretation is given in Anugītā of the themes from Bhagavadgītā. The misinterpretation of themes of Bhagavadgītā in Anugītā arises due to the latter’s non-adherence to the required hermeneutics, which is indicated in the Bhagavadgītā and which is elaborated to some extent in the Mahābhārata, which is the larger text in which Bhagavadgītā is embedded."
Disrupting and democratising higher education provision or entrenching academic elitism: towards a model of MOOCs adoption at African universities,"Challenges of broadening access, escalating cost, maintaining desirable quality and enhancing meaningful learning experiences in African higher education (HE) have spurred debates on how to restructure higher education delivery to meet the diverse needs of heterogeneous learners and adapt pedagogical models to the educational realities of low-income African countries. In view of these complexities, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have been advanced by Western Consortia, universities and online platform providers as panaceas for disrupting/transforming existing education models African universities. MOOCs have been touted as disruptive innovations with the potential to create new niche markets for HE courses, disrupt traditional models of instruction and content delivery and create new revenue streams for higher education. Yet academic elitism which manifests in the exclusive selection of top American universities to develop, host and deliver MOOCs, MOOC providers’ use of university brand and reputation as benchmarks for charging recruitment fees on headhunters recruiting MOOC graduates and their complex business models involving the sale of students’ big data (e.g. learning analytics) for profit seem to be inconsistent with claims about philanthropic and egalitarian drive of MOOCs. Drawing on disruptive innovation theory and a review of mainstream literature on MOOCs adoption in American and African tertiary sectors, this study argues that behind the MOOC rhetoric of disrupting and democratizing higher education lies the projection of top academic brands on the marketing pedestal, financial piggybacking on the hype and politics of academic exclusion."
Integration of an intelligent tutoring system in a course of computer network design,"INTUITEL is a research project aiming to offer a personalized learning environment. The INTUITEL approach includes an Intelligent Tutoring System that gives students recommendations and feedback about what the best learning path is for them according to their profile, learning progress, context and environmental influences. INTUITEL combines efficient pedagogical-based recommendations with freedom of choice and it introduces this tutoring support in different Learning Management Systems. During the INTUITEL project various software and pedagogical testing procedures were defined to provide the development teams with feedback, both summative and formative. The current paper describes the initial user test, which was conducted at the University of Valladolid for the course “Network Design”. The experiment was focused on real learners’ reactions to INTUITEL recommendations received by an INTUITEL-enabled LMS. Nineteen students participated in a two phase testing procedure in order to analyze the learners’ behavior with INTUITEL, as well as obtaining information about how learners perceive the influence and usefulness of the tutoring system in online learning courses. Results show that students with INTUITEL follow learning paths that are more suitable for them. Besides, the general satisfaction level of participants is high. Most learners appreciate INTUITEL, would follow its recommendations and consider the messages shown by INTUITEL as useful and caring."
Rural science education as social justice,"What part can science education play in the dismantling of obstacles to social justice in rural places? In this Forum contribution, I use “Learning in and about Rural Places: Connections and Tensions Between Students’ Everyday Experiences and Environmental Quality Issues in their Community”(Zimmerman and Weible 2016) to explicitly position rural education as a project of social justice that seeks full participatory parity for rural citizens. Fraser’s (2009) conceptualization of social justice in rural education requires attention to the just distribution of resources, the recognition of the inherent capacities of rural people, and the right to equal participation in democratic processes that lead to opportunities to make decisions affecting local, regional, and global lives. This Forum piece considers the potential of place-based science education to contribute to this project."
Mr. Red in the American South: a response to Lisa Borgerding,"This review essay affirms the work Mr. Red does with his students to support their learning about evolution and how his approach agrees with the realities of teaching evolution in the American South. It then shows how focusing on understanding, but not necessarily belief, adds to Mr. Red’s apparent neutrality a complimentary pedagogical approach that legitimizes more strongly accepted science while at the same time attending to the deep conflict many rural students feel when they are asked to learn evolution."
General experiences + race + racism = Work lives of Black faculty in postsecondary science education,"Existent research indicates that postsecondary Black faculty members, who are sorely underrepresented in the academy especially in STEM fields, assume essential roles; chief among these roles is diversifying higher education. Their recruitment and retention become more challenging in light of research findings on work life for postsecondary faculty. Research has shown that postsecondary faculty members in general have become increasingly stressed and job satisfaction has declined with dissatisfaction with endeavors and work overload cited as major stressors. In addition to the stresses managed by higher education faculty at large, Black faculty must navigate diversity-related challenges. Illuminating and understanding their experiences can be instrumental in lessening stress and job dissatisfaction, outcomes that facilitate recruitment and retention. This study featured the experiences and perceptions of Black faculty in science education. This study, framed by critical race theory, examines two questions: What characterizes the work life of some Black faculty members who teach, research, and serve in science education? How are race and racism present in the experiences of these postsecondary Black faculty members? A phenomenological approach to the study situates the experiences of the Black participants as valid phenomena worthy of investigation, illuminates their experiences, and seeks to retain the authenticity of their voices."
Offshore drilling effects in Brazilian SE marine sediments: a meta-analytical approach,"The exploration and production of oil and gas reserves often result to drill cutting accumulations on the seafloor adjacent to drill locations. In this study, the detection of drilling influence on marine sediments was performed by meta-analytical comparison between data from pre- and post-drilling surveys undertaken in offshore Campos Basin, southeast of Brazil. Besides this overall appraisal on the geochemical variables, a multivariate assessment, considering only the post-drilling data, was performed. Among the variables, fines content, carbonates, total organic carbon, barium, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead, vanadium, zinc, and total petroleum hydrocarbons, only barium, copper, and hydrocarbons were related to drilling impacts. In relation to the point of discharge, relative elevated levels in the post-drilling campaigns were observed preferentially up to 500 m in the northeast and southwest directions, associated to the Brazil Current-predominant direction. Other distributed concentrations in the surroundings seem to indicate the dilution and dispersion of drilling waste promoted by meteoceanographic factors."
Does hybrid LCA with a complete system boundary yield adequate results for product promotion?,"Hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) with a complete system boundary is recognized as an advanced approach widely applied in comparative analysis with the goal of product promotion. Here, I evaluate the theoretical foundation, or assumptions, of hybrid LCA in this application and discuss alternative models. The goal of this article is partly to call attention to the restrictive assumptions involved in the models used in LCA and to instigate further research and effort to improve these models."
Assessment of collagen antibody-induced arthritis in BALB/c mice using bioimaging analysis and histopathological examination,"The aim of this study was to examine the therapeutic potential of sulfasalazine and prednisolone in a mouse collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) model. Twenty-five male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into five groups: group 1 (G1): control, group 2 (G2): probe control, group 3 (G3): CAIA, group 4 (G4): CAIA+sulfasalazine (10 mg/kg, oral), and group 5 (G5): CAIA+prednisolone (100 mg/kg, oral). Fluorescence bioimaging was performed in vivo 24 and 48 h after treatment with a fluorescence probe (OsteoSense 680 EX), and all mice were sacrificed. The hind knee joints were fixed in 10% neutral phosphate-buffered formalin, and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histopathological analyses were performed. The paw thickness increased in a time-dependent manner in G3 mice, but trended toward a decrease in both G4 and G5 mice. Fluorescence intensity increased in G3 mice at 24 and 48 h after fluorescence probe treatment, but the fluorescence intensity in G4 and G5 mice was lower than that in G3. Micro-CT analyses showed that the joint surfaces of G3 mice had a rough and irregular articular appearance, but the occurrence of these irregularities was lower in G4 and G5. Hematoxylin and eosin and Safranin O-fast green staining confirmed that destruction of the cartilage and bony structures, synovial hyperplasia, and inflammatory cell infiltration all occurred in G3, and that the occurrence of these phenomena was lower in G4 and G5 than in G3. Taken together, these results suggest that sulfasalazine and prednisolone can reduce acute rheumatoid arthritis in mice."
Acute toxicity and cytotoxicity evaluation of Dendrobium moniliforme aqueous extract in vivo and in vitro,"Dendrobium moniliforme (L.) Sw., an herb of the Orchidaceae family, has long been used in traditional medicine to strengthen bones, nourish the stomach, and promote the production of bodily fluid. Recently, polysaccharides isolated from Dendrobium have been used in functional foods and nutraceutical products. A traditional method to process Dendrobium is to soak fresh stems in an ethanol solution, which is the most important factor to ensure high yields of aqueous-extractable polysaccharides. The present study was carried out to investigate the potential acute toxicity of D. moniliforme aqueous extract (DMAE), by a single oral dose in Sprague-Dawley rats. The test article was orally administered once by gavage to male and female rats at doses of 0, 2,500, and 5,000 mg/kg body weight (n=5 male and female rats for each dose). Throughout the study period, no treatment-related deaths were observed and no adverse effects were noted in clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, serum biochemistry, organ weight, or gross findings at any dose tested. The results show that a single oral administration of DMAE did not induce any toxic effects at a dose below 5,000 mg/kg in rats, and the minimal lethal dose was considered to be over 5,000 mg/kg body weight for both sexes. With respect to cytotoxicity, the cell viability of human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells was less than 50% when the cells were treated with 10 mg/mL aqueous extract for 24 h."
Changes of hematological references depends on storage period and temperature conditions in rats and dogs,"Because changes in rat and dog hematological parameters according to storage conditions have been poorly documented, we sought to examine such changes. Blood analysis was performed using two hematology analyzers (ADVIA 2120i and Sysmex XN-V) after storage at room temperature and in cold storage for 5, 24, and 48 h, respectively. Interassay coefficients of variation for hematological parameters analyzed with the ADVIA 2120i and the XN-V showed similar. The levels of hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and platelet (PLT) showed significant variations with time in blood samples of rats and dogs. The leukocyte subpopulation showed high variation with storage conditions. The data for leukocyte differential counts obtained using the ADVIA 2120i, XN-V, and a manual differential counting procedure showed good agreement for neutrophils and lymphocyte counts, but monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils showed differences between the procedures. In conclusions, most rat and dog hematological parameters showed minimal changes; however, some showed high variation with storage time and temperature, especially PLT and leukocyte subpopulations. In conclusion, when performing hematological analysis in dogs and rats, it will be exactitude to analyze blood samples in fresh condition and at least within 24 h in the cold storage."
Laxative effects of Liriope platyphylla are tightly correlated with suppression of endoplasmic reticulum stress in loperamide-induced constipation of SD rats,"A dysfunction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response can result in various diseases, including cancer, inflammation, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. To investigate whether ER stress response can play an essential role in the induction and treatment of chronic constipation, alterations in the key parameters for ER stress were measured in loperamide (Lop) induced constipation Sprague Dawley (SD) rats treated with aqueous extracts of Liriope platyphylla (AEtLP), which has been shown to have a laxative effect. Symptoms of chronic constipation including alteration of stool parameters and the transverse colon’s structure were successfully induced by Lop treatment. Laxative effects such as enhancement of stools parameters, recovery of the mucosa thickness, increased muscle thickness and recovery of flat luminal surface were also observed in the Lop+AEtLP treated group. Furthermore, enhancement of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) phosphorylation and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 beta (IRE1β) expression, key indicators for ER stress, that were observed in the Lop+vehicle treated group were significantly recovered in the Lop+AEtLP treated group, although the phosphorylation level of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) remained constant. Moreover, alterations in the transcription level of the marker genes X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) and growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein (GADD34) were similar to those of eIF2α and IRE1β. However, their level was slightly or completely recovered after AEtLP treatment. Overall, this study provides the first evidence that ER stress response may be tightly correlated with chronic constipation induced by Lop treatment, as well as the laxative effects of AEtLP."
Anti-inflammatory effect of egg white-chalcanthite and purple bamboo salts mixture on arthritis induced by monosodium iodoacetate in Sprague-Dawley rats,"The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of anti-osteoarthritis effects on egg white-chalcanthite (EC), purple bamboo salts (PBS), and a mixture of EC and PBS (EC+PBS). EC is a mixture of egg white and pulverized chalcanthite. PBS has been widely used as one of functional foods in Korea and shows unique features compared with common salt. Osteoarthritis was induced by intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA, 4mg/kg bw) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Test substances were administered once daily for 6 weeks at doses of 10 mg EC, EC+100 mg PBS, EC+200 mg PBS before and after MIA injection. Each substance was assessed by blood chemistry parameters, and by serum cytokines including IL-1β and IL-6, and nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2). Structural changes of articular cartilage were also evaluated by histopathological examination. As a result, body weight and blood chemistry parameter were not different in all experimental groups. EC+PBS mixture reduced the production of PGE2, NO, IL-1β, and IL-6. In histological grade of osteoarthritis, EC+PBS mixture had a tendency to ameliorate damage of articular cartilage induced by MIA in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, EC+PBS mixture was demonstrated to have a potential for anti-inflammatory effect against osteoarthritis induced by MIA in a dose-dependent manner."
Highly efficient random terpolymers for photovoltaic applications with enhanced absorption and molecular aggregation,"A series of copolymers, based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as the electron donor and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT)/diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP) as the electron acceptors, were synthesized for highly efficient polymer solar cells. By changing the BT/DPP ratio in the conjugated backbone, the absorption, energy levels, molecular aggregation and carrier mobility could be finely tuned. With increased DPP content, the absorption range was extended to the longer wavelength region with narrower bandgaps. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels were also raised up and the molecular aggregation was enhanced. The balance of these factors would afford a remarkable device performance enhancement. Polymer P3 with BT:DPP = 0.7:0.3 (molar ratio) exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.01%, with open circuit voltage (V
oc = 0.73 V, short current density (J
sc = 18.45 mA·cm−2, and fill factor (FF) = 66.9%. The PCE value was improved by 48.7% compared to P1 and by 117.6% compared to P7, respectively, indicating a great potential in photovoltaic application."
An alternating polymer of two building blocks based on B←N unit: Non-fullerene acceptor for organic photovoltaics,"B←N coordination bond can be used to develop polymer electron acceptors for efficient all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). Here, we report a new alternating conjugated polymer containing two building blocks based on B←N unit. The polymer exhibits strong light absorption in the visible range, low-lying LUMO/HOMO energy levels and moderate electron mobility. The resulting all-PSC devices exhibit power conversion efficiencies of 1.50%–2.47%."
Improved photovoltaic performance from high quality perovskite thin film grown with the assistance of PC71BM,"The strategy of sequentially spin-coating a perovskite film from the perovskite precursor and an electron transporting layer of [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) is developed to simplify the fabrication procedure of perovskite solar cells. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy indicate that PC71BM film on perovskite layer can retard the evaporation of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) efficiently, thus prolonging the transformation of intermediate phase to perovskite crystals, leading to a high quality perovskite thin film. The solar cells with the structure of indium tin oxides (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/CH3NH3PbI3/PC71BM/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag made from this simplified method exhibit a higher efficiency (12.68%) than those from the conventional one-step method (9.49%)."
"Efficient P3HT:PC61BM solar cells employing 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the processing additives","The efficiency of the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) based organic solar cells was enhanced by using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) as a processing additive to control the blend morphology. The addition of TCB improved the arrangement of P3HT which resulted in good phase separated blend films. Correspondingly, the optimized solar cells showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.17% with a fill factor (FF) of 0.69, which were higher than those of common thermal annealing devices (PCE 3.84%, FF 0.67). The efficiency was further improved to 4.74% by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min with a higher FF of 0.74."
"Existence, uniqueness and approximation for L
p solutions of reflected BSDEs with generators of one-sided Osgood type","We prove several existence and uniqueness results for L
p (p > 1) solutions of reflected BSDEs with continuous barriers and generators satisfying a one-sided Osgood condition together with a general growth condition in y and a uniform continuity condition or a linear growth condition in z. A necessary and sufficient condition with respect to the growth of barrier is also explored to ensure the existence of a solution. And, we show that the solutions may be approximated by the penalization method and by some sequences of solutions of reflected BSDEs. These results are obtained due to the development of those existing ideas and methods together with the application of new ideas and techniques, and they unify and improve some known works."

Evaluation of the effect of fluorescein angiography on retinal vessel diameter: an optical coherence tomography study,To evaluate the effect of fluorescein angiography on retinal vessel diameter with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).
3D radial invariant of dual Hahn moments,"In this work, we propose new sets of 2D and 3D rotation invariants based on orthogonal radial dual Hahn moments, which are orthogonal on a non-uniform lattice. We also present theoretical mathematics to derive them. Thus, this paper presents in the first case new 2D radial dual Hahn moments based on polar representation of an image by one-dimensional orthogonal discrete dual Hahn polynomials and a circular function. The dual Hahn polynomials are general case of Tchebichef and Krawtchouk polynomials. In the second case, we introduce new 3D radial dual Hahn moments employing a spherical representation of volumetric image by one-dimensional orthogonal discrete dual Hahn polynomials and a spherical function, which are orthogonal on a non-uniform lattice. The 2D and 3D rotational invariants are extracts from the proposed 2D and 3D radial dual Hahn moments respectively. In order to test the proposed approach, three problems namely image reconstruction, rotational invariance and pattern recognition are attempted using the proposed moments. The result of experiments shows that the radial dual Hahn moments have performed better than the radial Tchebichef and Krawtchouk moments, with and without noise. Simultaneously, the mentioned reconstruction converges quickly to the original image using 2D and 3D radial dual Hahn moments, and the test images are clearly recognized from a set of images that are available in COIL-20 database for 2D image and PSB database for 3D image."
Some Results on Rota–Baxter Monoidal Hom-Algebras,"We give constructions of Rota–Baxter monoidal Hom-(co)algebras from Hom-Hopf module (co)algebras, and then introduce the concept of Rota–Baxter monoidal Hom-bialgebras. Furthermore, we consider the relations between Rota–Baxter monoidal Hom-systems and monoidal Hom-dendriform algebras, and also derive the structures of pre-Lie Hom-(co)algebras via Rota–Baxter monoidal Hom-(co)algebras of different weight."
"A developmental, longitudinal investigation of autism phenotypic profiles in fragile X syndrome","Targeting overlapping behavioral phenotypes in neurogenetic disorders can help elucidate gene-behavior relationships. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been studied as a model for this approach, and important areas of phenotypic overlap and divergence have been documented. However, few studies have examined how the manifestation of ASD-related phenotypes in FXS may change over development, a question which has important implications for conceptualizing shared etiologies of these disorders and their constituent phenotypes. The goal of this study was to characterize ASD phenotypes in boys and girls with FXS across development, as well as to compare individual component phenotypes among boys with FXS and boys with idiopathic ASD (ASD-O) over time."
Primordial germ cell differentiation of nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells using surface modified electroconductive scaffolds,"A combination of nanotopographical cues and surface modification of collagen and fibronectin is a potential platform in primordial germ cells (PGCs) differentiation. In the present study, the synergistic effect of nanotopography and surface modification on differentiation of nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells (nt-ESCs) toward PGC lineage was investigated. In order to achieve this goal, poly-anyline (PANi) was mix within poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA). Afterward, the random composite mats were fabricated using PLLA and PANi mix solution. The nanofiber topography notably upregulated the expressions of prdm14, mvh and c-kit compared with tissue culture polystyrene (TCP). Moreover, the combination of nanofiber topography and surface modification resulted in more enhancement of PGCs differentiation compared with non-modified nanofibrous scaffold. Additionally, gene expression results showed that mvh and c-kit were expressed at higher intensity in cells exposed to collagen and fibronectin rather than collagen or fibronectin solitary. These results demonstrated the importance of combined effect of collagen and fibronectin in order to develop a functional extracellular matrix (ECM) mimic in directing stem cell fate and the potential of such biofunctional scaffolds for treatment of infertility."

Feature visualization and classification for the discrimination between individuals with Parkinson’s disease under levodopa and DBS treatments,"Over the years, a number of distinct treatments have been adopted for the management of the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD), including pharmacologic therapies and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Efficacy is most often evaluated by subjective assessments, which are prone to error and dependent on the experience of the examiner. Our goal was to identify an objective means of assessing response to therapy."
Sri Chinmoy on the nature and goals of contemplative practice,"Sri Chinmoy (1931–2007) has written extensively on the concrete details of contemplative practice as well as its purpose in the wider context of yoga as a system of spiritual disciplines leading to God-realization. The paper summarizes his teachings with an emphasis on how contemplative practice is done and how it works in attaining its goals. Sri Chinmoy distinguishes between concentration, meditation and contemplation (the last a term he reserves for highly advanced practice). While not offering a single “technique” but rather a toolbox of many techniques from which the practitioner can choose, he commends a particular basic approach or method while always recognizing the validity of other approaches. On the path of love, devotion and surrender, Sri Chinmoy emphasizes a focus on the heart and cultivation of aspiration, an inner cry for self-transcendence. In actual practice, this approach attenuates the ego and eventually brings illumination into a person’s entire consciousness. The paper explains how this process relates to samādhi, which is described, and the difference between samādhi and realization. The paper also touches on the relation between meditation and action and the further goal, beyond God-realization, of “God-manifestation” or integral transformation of the individual, human society and the evolving cosmos."
Visualizing polymeric bioresorbable scaffolds with three-dimensional image reconstruction using contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography,"There are no previous studies showing how to visualize polymeric bioresorbable scaffolds (BRSs) by micro-computed tomography (mCT). There are no previous studies showing how to visualize polymeric bioresorbable scaffolds (BRSs) by micro-computed tomography (mCT). This study aimed to explore the feasibility of detecting polymeric BRS with 3-dimensional reconstruction of BRS images by contrast-enhanced mCT and to determine the optimal imaging settings. BRSs, made of poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA), were implanted in coronary bifurcation models. Five treatments were conducted to examine an optimal condition for imaging BRSs: Baseline treatment, samples were filled with normal saline and scanned with mCT immediately; Treatment-1, -2, -3 and -4, samples were filled with contrast medium and scanned with mCT immediately and 1, 2 and 3 h thereafter, corresponding to soaking time of contrast medium of 0, 1, 2 and 3 h. Compared to Baseline, mCT scanning completely discriminate the scaffold struts from the vascular lumen immediately after filling the samples with contrast agent but not from the vascular wall until the contrast agent soaking time was more than 2 h (Treatment-3 and -4). By setting 10–15 HU as a cut-point of CT values, the scaffold strut detectable rate at Baseline and Teatment-1, -2, -3 and -4 were 1.23 ± 0.31%, 1.65 ± 0.26%, 58.14 ± 12.84%, 97.97 ± 1.43% and 98.90 ± 0.38%, respectively (Treatment-3 vs. Treatment-2, p < 0.01); meanwhile, the success rate of 3D BRS reconstruction with high quality images at Baseline and Teatment-1, -2, -3 and -4 were 1.23%, 1.65%, 58.14%, 97.97% and 98.90%, respectively (Treatment-3 vs. Treatment-2, p < 0.01). In conclusions, reconstruction of 3D BRS images is technically feasible by contrast-enhanced mCT and soaking time of contrast agent for more than 2 h is necessary for complete separation of scaffold struts from the surrounding structures in the phantom samples."
Enhancement of mechanical stability of waste dump slope through establishing vegetation in a surface iron ore mine,"From the perspective of economic and safety, the mechanical stability of a waste dump is crucial; therefore, re-vegetation is considered to be the most pertinent and eco-friendly approach to achieve this goal. However, not many studies address this concern and support the type of vegetation to be carried out on these waste dump slopes. This study has, therefore, explored the possibilities of using local species for the mechanical stability of the waste dump in surface iron ore mine for long-term protection of the environment. Commonly available local species are considered as prospective candidates that can adapt quickly to the climate and fit into the ecosystem, and an in situ test was used to calculate the shear strength of the vegetated waste dump. This test used a customized shear box (0.15 m × 0.15 m × 0.15 m) to evaluate the increased mechanical stability of the vegetated waste dump on the surface iron mine. From the analysis of in situ field data, it is concluded that the mechanical stability of waste dump has significantly improved with a possibility of extending its role toward maintaining long-term stability."
Nine years of climber community dynamics in a Nigerian lowland rain forest 31 years after a ground fire,"Successional studies in tropical forests have generally emphasized the tree component, ignoring the community dynamics of non-tree life-forms, and so there is a limited understanding of how the plant community as a whole is changing during succession within forests. Thus, this study examined the changes in climber community composition and structure in a regenerating secondary lowland rain forest at Ile-Ife that was ravaged by a ground fire 31 years ago using six sample plots. All individual climbers in each sample plot were identified, enumerated and their girths at breast height were measured. The girths were measured at 1.3 m height or just before the point of branching. Our data were compared with those of previous studies in the forest to determine the changes in floristics and structure of climber community over the years using Sorenson’s similarity index. The mortality and recruitment rates in the forest during the course of succession were determined. Climber species increased from 49 (2005) to 61 (2014). Climber density increased astronomically from 448–1152 ha−1 (2005) to 1712–4492 ha−1 but basal area only increased slightly from 0.37–1.10 m2 ha−1 (2005) to 0.40–1.14 m2 ha−1. The recruitment rate (8%) was higher than the mortality rate (5.8%). The similarity of the climber species composition calculated using the Sorenson similarity index showed that the similarity between the two periods of study was 0.53 (53%). This study concluded that during the study period, the climber community changed, and climber species abundance and structure increased."
Scratching of Copper and Silicon: Acoustic Emission Analysis,"The effect of scratching as one of the dominant modes of grinding, cutting, mechanical, and abrasive wear on the parameters of acoustic emission (AE) is considered in the present work. A connection between the AE signals emitted during the scratching associated with elastic or plastic shear stress due to material removal, plastic deformation, and damage development is studied. Cu and Si samples were scratched by a Knoop indenter at a load of 0.1 N and the rubbing velocities V = 1 and 100 µm/s. In order to evaluate the effect of ploughing on the AE parameters during scratching of Cu, rolling tests were also carried out. The AE parameters as the number of counts (HITs), frequency range, energy, and energy rate were evaluated, and the waveforms were analyzed. The AE waveforms during scratching and rolling of Cu present a low-amplitude wide noisy high-frequency range band. The low-frequency range in the scratching of Cu is associated with the ploughing. Brittle fracture of Si is accompanied by accumulation of the shear stress waves leading finally to the formation of shear bands, cracking around and inside the scratch track, and microchip formation. Scratching of brittle Si is characterized by scrubbing damage at the nanoscale (depth of scratching is 50–100 nm) and the development of microchips formed in the track, each 40–50 µm. Two typical signals under the scratching of Si were revealed: the first is a burst–shape waveform corresponding to the formation of microchips and microcracking damage; and the second presents the separated individual bursts of relatively high amplitude, associated with scrubbing and local fracture at the nanoscale. The effect of sliding velocity on the AE parameters during the scratching of Cu and Si was analyzed. It was found that practically all the AE parameters were larger under scratching with low velocity, V = 1 µm/s, in comparison to a relatively high velocity, 100 μm/s. Damage and the distance between the microchips were also larger under the scratching of Si with a minimal velocity, V = 1 µm/s."
Synthesis and Properties Modified Feather Keratin-Based Motor Oil Sorbing Cryogels with High Oil Holding Capacity,"Oleic acid was used to modify keratin extracted from chicken feathers by free radical initiated graft copolymerization. Thereafter, the modified keratin was used for the synthesis of cryogels. The influence of oleic acid modification, the crosslinker content, and the protein concentration on the properties of the cryogels were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, SDS-PAGE, and through oil holding capacity tests. To enhance the sorption properties, the cryogels were crosslinked with glutaraldehyde. Varying protein concentration from 1.27 to 5.09 wt% and glutaraldehyde concentration from 0 to 5 wt% produced cryogels with oil holding capacity ranging from 4.56 to 10.76 g/g. The highest results exceeded the sorption capacity of previously published oleic acid modified woodchips (6.3 g/g) as well as polypropylene (6 g/g), which is the standard material used in industry."
Quaternionic k-Hyperbolic Derivative,Complex holomorphic functions are defined using a complex derivative. In higher dimensions the meaningful generalization of complex derivative is not straight forward. Sudbery defined a derivative for quaternion regular functions using differential forms. Gürlebeck and Malonek generalized that for monogenic functions. In this paper we find similar characterizations for k-hypermonogenic functions which are holomorphic functions based on the Riemannian metric
Historical Biogeography of Delphininae Dolphins and Related Taxa (Artiodactyla: Delphinidae),"Delphinine dolphins arose via a recent, rapid radiation, probably within the last four million years. Although molecular phylogenies are increasingly well resolved, patterns of morphology-ecology-geography are hard to link to phylogeny or to translate into taxonomy. Such problems might be tackled through understanding the drivers of the delphinine radiation. Here, we examine delphinine historical biogeography using the phylogeny of McGowen et al. (Mol Phylogenet Evol 53:891–906, 2009) as our working hypothesis. We used the “Spatial Analysis of Vicariance” method to delimit modern distribution patterns, including disjunctions involving sister nodes in the Delphininae. The analysis identified disjunct sister nodes, allowing some interpretation of Delphininae biogeography. The Central American Seaway was probably an important gateway for early delphinids, but the succeeding “hard” barrier of the Panama Isthmus had little influence. Southern African waters form the Atlantic-Indo-Pacific gateway, which is sometimes considered a “soft” barrier because of the variation in the Benguela and Agulhas currents, in turn driven by tectonic changes and/or Pleistocene glacial and interglacial cycles. The latter cycles probably fragmented coastal habitats, allowing allopatric speciation. Geological patterns of turnover in Southern Ocean diatoms, which link to physical oceanic change, closely match the main cluster of delphinine divergences. The Eastern Pacific Barrier, and perhaps the associated Humboldt Current and equatorial “cold tongue,” affect modern distributions, but cause and effect are poorly understood. Future research should involve molecular-morphological phylogenetics for all species, subspecies, and ecomorphs. Complete distributions must be known for all taxa to understand how vicariance and dispersal shaped the distribution of delphinines."
No-reference image quality assessment based on hybrid model,"The aim of research on the no-reference image quality assessment problem is to design models that can predict the quality of distorted images consistently with human visual perception. Due to the little prior knowledge of the images, it is still a difficult problem. This paper proposes a computational algorithm based on hybrid model to automatically extract vision perception features from raw image patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector regression (SVR) are combined for this purpose. In the hybrid model, the CNN is trained as an efficient feature extractor, and the SVR performs as the regression operator. Extensive experiments demonstrate very competitive quality prediction performance of the proposed method."
Kinderen op de fiets: helm op!,"Kinderen vormen een risicogroep voor het krijgen van traumatisch hersenletsel na een fietsongeval. In Nederland is er geen wet- of regelgeving opgesteld omtrent het gebruik van de fietshelm. Een kind dat van de fiets valt of geschept wordt, valt bijna altijd op zijn hoofd. Het preventieve effect van de fietshelm is aangetoond. Ook is uit de literatuur bekend dat verplichten van de fietshelm leidt tot toename van het gebruik ervan, in het bijzonder als dit beleid maatschappijbreed wordt doorgevoerd. De fietshelm kan een belangrijke bijdrage leveren aan de bescherming tegen risico’s die kinderen lopen als zij van de fiets vallen en de risico’s van verkeersongelukken. Daarom zijn wij van mening dat de fietshelm in Nederland verplicht gesteld dient te worden voor alle kinderen jonger dan 16 jaar."
Radiocarpale luxatie,"Een 59-jarige, verder gezonde man meldde zich op de Spoedeisende Hulp nadat de giek van zijn zeilboot bij een zogenaamde klapgijp zijn pols had getroffen. Bij lichamelijk onderzoek was er sprake van een bajonetstand van de pols, met een intacte neurovasculaire status."
Behandeling van het chronisch compartimentsyndroom met behulp van de KnifeLight® (Stryker®): een minimaal invasieve techniek,De behandeling van het chronisch compartimentsyndroom bestaat uit een fasciotomie. In dit artikel wordt het gebruik van de KnifeLight® voor een minimaal invasieve techniek besproken. In 2014 en 2015 zijn zes patiënten voor het chronisch compartimentsyndroom met deze minimale invasieve techniek behandeld. Tijdens de procedure is gebruikgemaakt van één incisie. Na de procedure waren de patiënten klachtenvrij. Schade aan de zenuwen trad niet op. Gebruik van de KnifeLight® bij het chronisch compartimentsyndroom is eerder beschreven in de literatuur. Onze techniek verschilt ten opzichte van de eerder beschreven techniek wat betreft het aantal incisies.

Os iliumfractuur na spongiosaplastiek,Os iliumfracturen worden vooral gezien na hoogenergetische traumata. Iatrogene fracturen na een bottransplantatie vanuit de crista iliaca zijn zeldzaam en kunnen bij afwezigheid van andere complicaties over het algemeen conservatief worden behandeld met klinisch goede uitkomsten. Men dient bedacht te zijn op risicofactoren voor fracturen na oogsten van spongiosa uit de crista iliaca en moet zo nodig uitwijken naar mogelijke alternatieven.
Patient-centered design of alarm limits in a complex pediatric population,"In pediatric populations, alarm defaults can be more complex to set, as the normal values for heart rate and respiratory rate vary widely by age range. Therefore we sought to develop more relevant alarm thresholds that were specific to the unique population within our pediatric institution. Complete physiological recordings were collected from 1806 patients in the Progressive Care Unit at Texas Children’s Hospital over a five month period in 2014. Patients were grouped by age and centiles plots for Heart Rate, Respiration Rate and SpO2 were calculated and compared to current alarm limits. Comparison of current alarm limits to actual physiologic data shows the mismatch in alarm setting to patient physiology. As an example, the value for the Heart Rate High alarm limit is set such that it falls near the 50% centile, meaning that 50% of the patients will alarm at this value. By re-setting the default settings for Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate and SpO2 limits based on the actual data of a large group of medically complex children, one can reduce non-necessary alarms. However, default alarms need to be set conservatively as complications from complex comorbidities can skew the baseline for the population. Our results demonstrate that age based recommended alarm limits that are derived from healthy cohorts can lead to higher than desired alarm loads in this pediatric population. With data based on the population, more appropriate alarm settings can be derived."
An analytic approach to sunset diagrams in chiral perturbation theory: Theory and practice,"We demonstrate the use of several code implementations of the Mellin-Barnes method available in the public domain to derive analytic expressions for the sunset diagrams that arise in the two-loop contribution to the pion mass and decay constant in three-flavoured chiral perturbation theory. We also provide results for all possible two mass configurations of the sunset integral, and derive a new one-dimensional integral representation for the one mass sunset integral with arbitrary external momentum. Thoroughly annotated Mathematica notebooks are provided as ancillary files in the Electronic Supplementary Material to this paper, which may serve as pedagogical supplements to the methods described in this paper."
B-decay anomalies in a composite leptoquark model,"The collection of a few anomalies in semileptonic B-decays, especially in \(b\rightarrow c \tau \bar{\nu }\), invites to speculate about the emergence of some striking new phenomena, perhaps interpretable in terms of a weakly broken \(U(2)^n\) flavor symmetry and of leptoquark mediators. Here we aim at a partial UV completion of this interpretation by generalizing the minimal composite Higgs model to include a composite vector leptoquark as well."
Studying lowest energy structures of carbon clusters by bond-order empirical potentials,"A very recently developed optimization algorithm for carbon clusters (C

n
s) (Yen and Lai J Chem Phys 142:084313, 2015) is combined separately with different empirical bond-order potentials which were proposed also for carbon materials, and they are applied to calculate the lowest energy structures of C

n
s studying their structural changes at different size n. Based on predicted structures, we evaluate the practicality of four analytic bond-order empirical potentials, namely the Tersoff, Tersoff–Erhart–Albe, first-generation Brenner and second-generation Brenner (SGB) potentials. Generally, we found that the cluster C

n
 (n = 3–60) obtained by the SGB potential undergoes a series of dramatic structural transitions, i.e., from a linear → a single ring → a multi-ring/quasi-two-dimensional bowl-like → three-dimensional fullerene-like shape; such variability of structural forms was not seen in the other three potentials. On closer examination of the C

n
s calculated using this potential and further comparing them with those obtained by the semiempirical density functional tight-binding theory calculations, we found that these C

n
 are more realistic than similar works reported in the literature. In this respect, due to its potential applications in the study of chemically complex systems of different atoms especially chemical reactions (Che et al. Theor Chem Acc 102:346, 1999), the SGB potential can, moreover, be used to investigate larger size C

n
, and calculated structural results by this potential are naturally input configurations for higher-level density functional theory calculations. Another most remarkable finding in the present work is the C

n
 results calculated by Tersoff–Erhart–Albe empirical potential. It predicts a two-dimensional development of graphene structure, exhibiting always a zigzag edge in the optimized clusters. This empirical potential can thus be applied to study graphene-related materials such as that shown in a recent paper (Yoon et al. J Chem Phys 139:204702,  2013)."
"Interactive effects of nutrient availability, temperature, and irradiance on photosynthetic pigments and color of the brown alga Undaria pinnatifida","Color is one of the important factors that determine the commercial value of cultivated marine macroalgae such as the brown alga Undaria pinnatifida (Laminariales; Phaeophyta) in Japan. Macroalgal color is fundamentally derived from the algal photosynthetic pigment content, which is affected by abiotic factors. However, little is known about the quantitative relationship between pigment content and color and the direct effects of abiotic factors on the color of marine macroalgae. We conducted a 24-day indoor culture experiment to assess the combined effects of nutrient availability (enriched and nonenriched seawater), seawater temperature (15 and 5 °C), and irradiance (180 and 30 μmol photons m−2 s−1) on the concentrations of six pigments (chlorophyll (Chl) a, Chl c
1, Chl c
2, fucoxanthin, violaxanthin, and zeaxanthin) and three color values (lightness L*, redness a*, and yellowness b*) of U. pinnatifida sporophytes. Negative correlations between pigment content and color values of the cultured algae were detected. Reduced nutrient availability, decrease in temperature, and elevated irradiance resulted in decreased pigment contents and increased color values. Moreover, a significant interaction between nutrient availability and temperature indicated that the positive effect of nutrient enrichment was antagonized by a decrease in temperature. These results suggest that U. pinnatifida can discolor under nutrient-poor, winter temperature, and saturated irradiance conditions. To increase the commercial value of this species, artificial nutrient enrichment during spring or cultivation from a deeper depth may be effective."
"Spatial pattern analysis and associations of different growth stages of populations of Abies georgei var. smithii in Southeast Tibet, China","Abies georgei var. smithii is an important plant species in Southeast Tibet, China. It has high ecological value in terms of biodiversity protection, as well as soil and water conservation. We analyzed the spatial pattern and associations of A. georgei var. smithii populations at different growth stages by using Ripley’s L function for point pattern analysis. The diameter structure was a nearly reverse ‘J’ shape. The amount of saplings and medium-sized trees accounts for a large part of the entire population, suggesting a high regeneration rate and an expanding population. In the transition from saplings to medium trees or to large trees, saplings show a significant aggregation distribution at small scales, while medium trees and large trees show a random distribution. There are significant inverse associations between saplings and medium trees and large trees at small scales, while there are no obvious associations between medium trees and large trees. The natural regeneration was affected by interspecific competition, and it was also affected by intraspecific competition. The joint effects of biological characteristics and environmental factors contribute to the spatial distribution pattern and associations of this A. georgei var. smithii population."
Off-pump versus on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with diabetes: a meta-analysis,The effects of off-pump CABG (OFF-CABG) versus on-pump CABG (ON-CABG) in diabetic patients remain controversial. The aim of our study was to compare mortality and postoperative morbidity between OFF-CABG and ON-CABG for diabetic patients.
A pilot study of d-chiro-inositol plus folic acid in overweight patients with type 1 diabetes,"To improve insulin sensitivity, insulin-sensitizing drugs such as metformin are commonly used in overweight and obese T1D patients. Similarly to metformin, d-chiro-inositol (DCI), as putative mediator of intracellular insulin action, can act as insulin sensitizer. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the hypothesis that DCI plus folic acid may improve glucose control reducing insulin resistance in overweight or obese T1D patients."
MicroRNA expression profiles of human iPSCs differentiation into insulin-producing cells,"MicroRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs, which control gene expression by inhibition of mRNA translation. MicroRNAs are involved in the control of biological processes including cell differentiation. Here, we aim at characterizing microRNA expression profiles during differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into insulin-producing cells."
Multi-label classification via multi-target regression on data streams,"Multi-label classification (MLC) tasks are encountered more and more frequently in machine learning applications. While MLC methods exist for the classical batch setting, only a few methods are available for streaming setting. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for MLC via multi-target regression in a streaming setting. Moreover, we develop a streaming multi-target regressor iSOUP-Tree that uses this approach. We experimentally compare two variants of the iSOUP-Tree method (building regression and model trees), as well as ensembles of iSOUP-Trees with state-of-the-art tree and ensemble methods for MLC on data streams. We evaluate these methods on a variety of measures of predictive performance (appropriate for the MLC task). The ensembles of iSOUP-Trees perform significantly better on some of these measures, especially the ones based on label ranking, and are not significantly worse than the competitors on any of the remaining measures. We identify the thresholding problem for the task of MLC on data streams as a key issue that needs to be addressed in order to obtain even better results in terms of predictive performance."
"Birth Settings and the Validation of Neonatal Seizures Recorded in Birth Certificates Compared to Medicaid Claims and Hospital Discharge Abstracts Among Live Births in South Carolina, 1996–2013","Objective Neonatal seizures in the first 28 days of life often reflect underlying brain injury or abnormalities, and measure the quality of perinatal care in out-of-hospital births. Using the 2003 revision of birth certificates only, three studies reported more neonatal seizures recorded among home births ​or planned out-of-hospital births compared to hospital births. However, the validity of recording neonatal seizures or serious neurologic dysfunction across birth settings in birth certificates has not been evaluated. We aimed to validate seizure recording in birth certificates across birth settings using multiple datasets. Methods We examined checkbox items “seizures” and “seizure or serious neurologic dysfunction” in the 1989 and 2003 revisions of birth certificates in South Carolina from 1996 to 2013. Gold standards were ICD-9-CM codes 779.0, 345.X, and 780.3 in either hospital discharge abstracts or Medicaid encounters jointly. Results Sensitivity, positive predictive value, false positive rate, and the kappa statistic of neonatal seizures recording were 7%, 66%, 34%, and 0.12 for the 2003 revision of birth certificates in 547,177 hospital births from 2004 to 2013 and 5%, 33%, 67%, and 0.09 for the 1998 revision in 396,776 hospital births from 1996 to 2003, and 0, 0, 100%, −0.002 among 660 intended home births from 2004 to 2013 and 920 home births from 1996 to 2003, respectively. Conclusions for Practice Despite slight improvement across revisions, South Carolina birth certificates under-reported or falsely reported seizures among hospital births and especially home births. Birth certificates alone should not be used to measure neonatal seizures or serious neurologic dysfunction."
"Is Institutional Delivery Protective Against Neonatal Mortality Among Poor or Tribal Women? A Cohort Study From Gujarat, India","Objectives In low-income settings, neonatal mortality rates (NMR) are higher among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Institutional deliveries have been shown to be protective against neonatal mortality. In Gujarat, India, the access of disadvantaged women to institutional deliveries has increased. However, the impact of increased institutional delivery on NMR has not been studied here. This paper examined if institutional childbirth is associated with lower NMR among disadvantaged women in Gujarat, India. Methods A community-based prospective cohort of pregnant women was followed in three districts in Gujarat, India (July 2013–November 2014). Two thousand nine hundred and nineteen live births to disadvantaged women (tribal or below poverty line) were included in the study. Data was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results The overall NMR was 25 deaths per 1000 live births. Multivariable analysis showed that institutional childbirth was protective against neonatal mortality only among disadvantaged women with obstetric complications during delivery. Among mothers with obstetric complications during delivery, those who gave birth in a private or public facility had significantly lower odds of having a neonatal death than women delivering at home (AOR 0.07 95% CI 0.01–0.45 and AOR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00–0.33 respectively). Conclusions for Practice Our findings highlight the crucial role of institutional delivery to prevent neonatal deaths among those born to disadvantaged women with complications during delivery in this setting. Efforts to improve disadvantaged women’s access to good quality obstetric care must continue in order to further reduce the NMR in Gujarat, India."
Focal task specific dystonia: a review and update,"In this review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the etiology, risk factors and pathophysiology of focal task specific dystonia (FTSD), movement disorders characterized by abnormal motor activation during the performance of specific, repetitive actions. We focus on two common FTSD, musician’s dystonia and writer’s cramp. FTSD may pose a threat to the patient’s livelihood, and improved therapeutic treatments are needed."
Electromagnetic Selection Rules for \(\varvec{^{12}}\)C in a 3 \(\varvec{\alpha }\) Cluster Model,"The recent successful application of the Algebraic Cluster Model to the energy spectrum of \(^{12}\)C has brought a new impetus on spectroscopy of this and other \(\alpha -\)conjugate nuclei. In fact, known spectral properties have been reexamined on the basis of vibrations and rotations of three \(\alpha \) particles at the vertexes of an equilateral triangle and new excited states have been measured that fit into this scheme. The analysis of this system entails the application of molecular models for rotational–vibrational spectra to the nuclear context and requires deep knowledge of the underlying group-theoretical properties, based on the \(\mathcal {D}_{3h}\) symmetry, similarly to what is done in quantum chemistry. We have recently analyzed the symmetries of the model and the quantum numbers in great depth, reproducing the all-important results of Wheeler and we have derived electromagnetic selection rules for the system of three \(\alpha \) particles, finding, for instance, that electric dipole E1 and magnetic dipole M1 excitations are excluded from the model. The lowest active modes are therefore E2, E3,\(\cdots \) and M2, M3, \(\cdots \) although there are further restrictions between certain types of bands. The selection rules summarized in the text provide a criterion for assigning of observed lines to the alpha cluster model or not and they might help to further unravel the electromagnetic properties of \(^{12}\)C. With the perspective of new facilities (such as ELI) where photo-excitation and photo-dissociation experiments will play a major role, a complete understanding of e.m. selection rules as a tool to confirm or disprove nuclear structure models, is mandatory."
Trion and Biexciton in Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides,We study the trion and biexciton in transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers within the framework of a nonrelativistic potential model using the method of hyperspherical harmonics (HH). We solve the three- and four-body Schrödinger equations with the Keldysh potential by expanding the wave functions of a trion and biexciton in terms of the antisymmetrized HH. Results of the calculations for the ground state energies are in good agreement with similar calculations for the Keldysh potential and in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements of trion and biexciton binding energies.
Facile synthesis of iron-doped hollow urchin-like MnO2 for supercapacitors,"Hollow urchin-like iron-doped manganese dioxide (Fe–MnO2) architectures were successfully prepared without any template or surfactant via a facile one-step hydrothermal route. Hollow urchin-like Fe–MnO2 architectures were made up of interleaving nanosheets, resulting in porous structures and high specific surface area. The formation mechanism of hollow urchin-like Fe–MnO2 architectures was proposed based on the Ostwald ripening process. When employed as supercapacitor electrode material, hollow urchin-like Fe–MnO2 delivered a specific capacitance of 203.3 F g−1 at 250 mA g−1 as well as a good capacity retention of 88.1% after 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Coupled with activated carbon (AC) negative electrode, Fe–MnO2//AC asymmetric supercapacitor (Fe–MnO2//AC ASC) achieved an energy density of 20.2 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 225 W kg−1 and 83.8% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 3 A g−1, suggesting its potential applications for energy storage."
Physical properties of Fe films electrodeposited on porous Al substrates,"Two series of Fe thin films have been electrodeposited onto polycrystalline porous Al substrates using two baths:  iron chloride (FeCl2) and iron sulfate (FeSO4). The texture, strain, and grain size values have been derived from X-ray diffraction experiments. Scanning electron microscopy has been employed for surface morphology. The magnetic properties were inferred from hysteresis curves that were obtained from a vibrating sample magnetometer; the external magnetic field was applied in different directions of the film plane and also perpendicular to the film. Hysteresis curves have been obtained at low temperatures (120 K (−153 °C) to room temperature). We investigate the effects of Al porosity, bath type, and deposition rate on physical properties of these Fe films. A correlation between the structural and magnetic properties is made. Different mechanisms responsible for the coercive field (H
C) behavior have also been investigated."
Finite element analysis of the damage mechanism of 3D braided composites under high-velocity impact,"The integrated near-net-shape structure of 3D braided composites provides excellent impact resistant properties over laminated composites. However, the load 
distribution and damage mechanism throughout the braided structures become more complicated. In this paper, a finite element model based on three unit-cells is established to assess the penetration process of 3D braided composites under high-velocity impact. A 3D rate-dependent constitutive model is employed to determine the constituent behavior in the three unit-cells. An instantaneous degradation scheme is proposed initiated by appropriate failure criteria of yarns and matrix. All these constitutive models are coded by a user-material 
subroutine VUMAT developed in ABAQUS/Explicit. The whole process of ballistic damage evolution of 3D braided composites is simulated, and the impact resistance and damage mechanisms are analyzed in detail in the simulation process. The effects of impact velocity on the ballistic properties and energy absorption characteristics of the composite structures are also discussed."

Individual differences in spontaneous analogical transfer,"Research on analogical problem solving has shown that people often fail to spontaneously notice the relevance of a semantically remote source analog when solving a target problem, although they are able to form mappings and derive inferences when given a hint to recall the source. Relatively little work has investigated possible individual differences that predict spontaneous transfer, or how such differences may interact with interventions that facilitate transfer. In this study, fluid intelligence was measured for participants in an analogical problem-solving task, using an abridged version of the Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM) test. In two experiments, we systematically compared the effect of augmenting verbal descriptions of the source with animations or static diagrams. Solution rates to Duncker’s radiation problem were measured across varying source presentation conditions, and participants’ understanding of the relevant source material was assessed. The pattern of transfer was best fit by a moderated mediation model: the positive impact of fluid intelligence on spontaneous transfer was mediated by its influence on source comprehension; however, this path was in turn modulated by provision of a supplemental animation via its influence on comprehension of the source. Animated source depictions were most beneficial in facilitating spontaneous transfer for those participants with low scores on the fluid intelligence measure."
Microwave synthesis of metal doped TiO2 for photocatalytic applications,"Nanostructured metal (Sn, Cu and Ni) doped TiO2 was successfully synthesized by microwave irradiation method. Metal doped TiO2 was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and UV–Vis spectroscopy (UV–Vis). The XRD pattern confirms the formation of monoclinic phase TiO2 and metal doped TiO2 samples. SEM images show the attractive morphologies for metal doped TiO2 nanopowders. The photocatalytic activity of the synthesized sample was also studied by the decomposition of methylene blue dye under UV light irradiation."
Growth and characterization of sol–gel processed rectangular shaped nanostructured ferric oxide thin film followed by humidity and gas sensing,"In the present work nanostructured ferric oxide has been synthesized using sol–gel method. Thin films of ferric oxide were fabricated via spin coating process. The surface of the thin film was scanned by scanning electron microscope that exhibited the surface morphology of ferric oxide nanostructures. The material was also characterized by XRD, Acoustic particle sizer and FTIR. All the particles distributed on the surface have some spaces among them known as pores. These pores serve as adsorption sites for moisture and other gases. EDX confirmed the elements forming the ferric oxide in pure form. The particle size of the ferric oxide was estimated as ~12.2 nm. The pore size of the film was ~50 nm i.e., nature is mesoporous. Annealing effect on the surface morphology was also observed. Humidity sensing, electrical as well as optical of the prepared film was carried out. The results showed the suitability of material for the development of humidity sensors. Variations in resistance with the exposure of LPG were recorded and found that resistance of film increases with the increasing exposure time and concentration of gas. The maximum sensing response of the sensor was recorded as 3.26 for 1000 ppm at room temperature. The response and recovery times of the sensor were found to be ~12 and 9 min, respectively."
One-pot solvothermal synthesis of flower-like copper sulfide/reduced graphene oxide composite superstructures as high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials,"A series of CuS/RGO composite superstructures with different RGO contents as well as contrastive bare CuS superstructure were one-pot solvothermally synthesized. The structure, morphology, chemical composition and crystalline phase of these products were systematically studied and characterized by a number of modern techniques like field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectra, X-ray diffraction, atomic absorption spectroscopy and Raman characterizations. Their electrochemical performances were also carefully examined by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests. It was found that all the CuS/RGO superstructures featured unique hierarchically flower-like architecture. When used as supercapacitor electrode material, CuS/RGO-4 superstructure with the RGO content of 31.7 wt% delivered a maximum specific capacitance of 368.3 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1, which was much higher than that of the other CuS-containing superstructures synthesized in this work and lots of CuS-based electrode materials reported recently. It is assumed that the unique morphology, improved conductivity and favorable synergetic effect between the two constituents of CuS and RGO are responsible for the enhanced supercapacitive behaviors of CuS/RGO-4 superstructure, which not only expedite the charge transport but also elevate the electrolyte diffusion. Additionally, CuS/RGO-4 superstructure electrode gave satisfactory long-term stability and durability and 88.4% of the initial capacitance was maintained after repetitive charge/discharge for 1000 cycles at the current density of 3 A g−1, exhibiting promising applicability in energy-storage devices."
Q2Stress: A database for multiple cues to stress assignment in Italian,"In languages where the position of lexical stress within a word is not predictable from print, readers rely on distributional information extracted from the lexicon in order to assign stress. Lexical databases are thus especially important for researchers willing to address stress assignment in those languages. Here we present Q2Stress, a new database aimed to fill the lack of such a resource for Italian. Q2Stress includes multiple cues readers may use in assigning stress, such as type and token frequency of stress patterns as well as their distribution with respect to number of syllables, grammatical category, word beginnings, word endings, and consonant-vowel structures. Furthermore, for the first time, data for both adults and children are available. Q2Stress may help researchers to answer empirical as well as theoretical questions about stress assignment and stress-related issues, and more in general, to explore the orthography-to-phonology relation in reading. Q2Stress is designed as a user-friendly resource, as it comes with scripts allowing researchers to explore and select their own stimuli according to several criteria as well as summary tables for overall data analysis."
Statistical power of likelihood ratio and Wald tests in latent class models with covariates,"This paper discusses power and sample-size computation for likelihood ratio and Wald testing of the significance of covariate effects in latent class models. For both tests, asymptotic distributions can be used; that is, the test statistic can be assumed to follow a central Chi-square under the null hypothesis and a non-central Chi-square under the alternative hypothesis. Power or sample-size computation using these asymptotic distributions requires specification of the non-centrality parameter, which in practice is rarely known. We show how to calculate this non-centrality parameter using a large simulated data set from the model under the alternative hypothesis. A simulation study is conducted evaluating the adequacy of the proposed power analysis methods, determining the key study design factor affecting the power level, and comparing the performance of the likelihood ratio and Wald test. The proposed power analysis methods turn out to perform very well for a broad range of conditions. Moreover, apart from effect size and sample size, an important factor affecting the power is the class separation, implying that when class separation is low, rather large sample sizes are needed to achieve a reasonable power level."
Genotoxicity Assessment of Volatile Organic Compounds in Landfill Gas Emission Using Comet Assay in Higher Terrestrial Plant,"Genotoxicity model is developed to assess the individual subacute toxicity of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) at very low levels as in a landfill gas. Golden Pothos (Epipremnum aureum), a higher plant, was tested under variation of benzene 54–5656 ng/L, toluene 10–4362 ng/L, ethylbenzene 28–4997 ng/L, xylene 53–4845 ng/L, for 96 h. DNA fragmentation in plant leaves were investigated via comet assay. The results show that DNA migration ratio increased with the BTEX concentrations, but at different rates. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) of DNA fragmentation from the dose–response relationships indicated toluene has the highest EC50 value and followed by benzene, xylene and ethylbenzene. Alternatively, ethylbenzene has the highest toxicity unit and followed by xylene, benzene and toluene as described by toxicity unit (TU). In conclusion, comet assay of Pothos can be used in differentiating DNA fragmentation against very low levels of BTEX in the atmosphere.

A pilot study of d-chiro-inositol plus folic acid in overweight patients with type 1 diabetes,"To improve insulin sensitivity, insulin-sensitizing drugs such as metformin are commonly used in overweight and obese T1D patients. Similarly to metformin, d-chiro-inositol (DCI), as putative mediator of intracellular insulin action, can act as insulin sensitizer. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the hypothesis that DCI plus folic acid may improve glucose control reducing insulin resistance in overweight or obese T1D patients."
MicroRNA expression profiles of human iPSCs differentiation into insulin-producing cells,"MicroRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs, which control gene expression by inhibition of mRNA translation. MicroRNAs are involved in the control of biological processes including cell differentiation. Here, we aim at characterizing microRNA expression profiles during differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into insulin-producing cells."
Off-pump versus on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with diabetes: a meta-analysis,The effects of off-pump CABG (OFF-CABG) versus on-pump CABG (ON-CABG) in diabetic patients remain controversial. The aim of our study was to compare mortality and postoperative morbidity between OFF-CABG and ON-CABG for diabetic patients.
"Health care professionals’ experience, understanding and perception of need of advanced cancer patients with cachexia and their families: The benefits of a dedicated clinic",Cachexia is defined as the on-going loss of skeletal muscle mass that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support. It is found in up to 80% of patients with advanced cancer and has profound psycho-social consequences for patients and their families. Previous studies demonstrate that many healthcare professionals receive little formal education in cachexia management leading them to feel that they have limited understanding of the syndrome and cannot intervene effectively. This study aims to examine the value of a dedicated cachexia clinic and its influence on staff understanding and practice.
Green neighbourhoods in low voltage networks: measuring impact of electric vehicles and photovoltaics on load profiles,"In the near future, various types of low-carbon technologies (LCTs) are expected to be widely employed throughout the United Kingdom. However, the effect that these technologies will have at a household level on the existing low voltage (LV) network is still an area of extensive research. We propose an agent based model that estimates the growth of LCTs within local neighbourhoods, where social influence is imposed. Real-life data from an LV network is used that comprises of many socially diverse neighbourhoods. Both electric vehicle uptake and the combined scenario of electric vehicle and photovoltaic adoption are investigated with this data. A probabilistic approach is outlined, which determines lower and upper bounds for the model response at every neighbourhood. This technique is used to assess the implications of modifying model assumptions and introducing new model features. Moreover, we discuss how the calculation of these bounds can inform future network planning decisions."
Generation of dense granular deposits for porosity analysis: assessment and application of large-scale non-smooth granular dynamics,"The knowledge of structural properties of granular materials such as porosity is highly important in many application-oriented and scientific fields. In this paper we present new results of computer-based packing simulations where we use the non-smooth granular dynamics (NSGD) method to simulate gravitational random dense packing of spherical particles with various particle size distributions and two types of depositional conditions. A bin packing scenario was used to compare simulation results to laboratory porosity measurements and to quantify the sensitivity of the NSGD regarding critical simulation parameters such as time step size. The results of the bin packing simulations agree well with laboratory measurements across all particle size distributions with all absolute errors below 1%. A large-scale packing scenario with periodic side walls was used to simulate the packing of up to 855,600 spherical particles with various particle size distributions (PSD). Simulation outcomes are used to quantify the effect of particle-domain-size ratio on the packing compaction. A simple correction model, based on the coordination number, is employed to compensate for this effect on the porosity and to determine the relationship between PSD and porosity. Promising accuracy and stability results paired with excellent computational performance recommend the application of NSGD for large-scale packing simulations, e.g. to further enhance the generation of representative granular deposits."
Residential Segregation and Racial Cancer Disparities: A Systematic Review,This paper provides the first review of empirical studies of segregation and black-white cancer disparities.
Feature visualization and classification for the discrimination between individuals with Parkinson’s disease under levodopa and DBS treatments,"Over the years, a number of distinct treatments have been adopted for the management of the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD), including pharmacologic therapies and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Efficacy is most often evaluated by subjective assessments, which are prone to error and dependent on the experience of the examiner. Our goal was to identify an objective means of assessing response to therapy."
Influence of elevated CO2 and temperature on physiological traits and yield attributes of heat tolerant wheat genotype Halna grown inside open top chambers,"Both CO2 and temperature caused significant changes in crop productivity. An experiment was conducted wherein wheat was grown inside open top chambers (OTCs) in order to determine the effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature on physiology and yield attributes of wheat genotype Halna. Halna was grown with two levels of carbon dioxide, i.e., ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (500 ± 20 ppm) and two levels of temperature, i.e., ambient, and ambient +2 °C during the Rabi (November–April) season of 2014–2015 at ICAR-RCER, Patna, India. The study revealed that elevated CO2 improved water use efficiency by 26.3%, photosynthetic rate by 14.6%, relative water content (RWC) by 15.9%, membrane stability index (MSI) by 6.6%, leaf area (LA) by 4.6%, plant height by 2.53% and grain yield by 26.9% as compared to ambient, while the activity of antioxidant enzymes were decreased, i.e., catalase by −12.59% and peroxidase by −21.04%. However, elevation of temperature by 2 °C decreased the photosynthetic rate by 15.9%, LA by 8.7% and grain yield by 11.7% but activity of CAT (+64.8%), and POX (+7.2%) were increased as compared to ambient condition. Simultaneous elevation of both (CO2 and temperature) caused non-significant increase in leaf area, number of grains ear−1, 1000 grain weight and grain yield as compared to ambient condition. The results indicated that elevated CO2 had positive effects, whereas elevated temperature had negative effects and with simultaneous elevation of CO2 and temperature, elevated CO2 nullified the negative effects of elevated temperature on photosynthetic characteristics and yield components of Halna."
Some Results on Rota–Baxter Monoidal Hom-Algebras,"We give constructions of Rota–Baxter monoidal Hom-(co)algebras from Hom-Hopf module (co)algebras, and then introduce the concept of Rota–Baxter monoidal Hom-bialgebras. Furthermore, we consider the relations between Rota–Baxter monoidal Hom-systems and monoidal Hom-dendriform algebras, and also derive the structures of pre-Lie Hom-(co)algebras via Rota–Baxter monoidal Hom-(co)algebras of different weight."
"Is Institutional Delivery Protective Against Neonatal Mortality Among Poor or Tribal Women? A Cohort Study From Gujarat, India","Objectives In low-income settings, neonatal mortality rates (NMR) are higher among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Institutional deliveries have been shown to be protective against neonatal mortality. In Gujarat, India, the access of disadvantaged women to institutional deliveries has increased. However, the impact of increased institutional delivery on NMR has not been studied here. This paper examined if institutional childbirth is associated with lower NMR among disadvantaged women in Gujarat, India. Methods A community-based prospective cohort of pregnant women was followed in three districts in Gujarat, India (July 2013–November 2014). Two thousand nine hundred and nineteen live births to disadvantaged women (tribal or below poverty line) were included in the study. Data was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results The overall NMR was 25 deaths per 1000 live births. Multivariable analysis showed that institutional childbirth was protective against neonatal mortality only among disadvantaged women with obstetric complications during delivery. Among mothers with obstetric complications during delivery, those who gave birth in a private or public facility had significantly lower odds of having a neonatal death than women delivering at home (AOR 0.07 95% CI 0.01–0.45 and AOR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00–0.33 respectively). Conclusions for Practice Our findings highlight the crucial role of institutional delivery to prevent neonatal deaths among those born to disadvantaged women with complications during delivery in this setting. Efforts to improve disadvantaged women’s access to good quality obstetric care must continue in order to further reduce the NMR in Gujarat, India."
"Birth Settings and the Validation of Neonatal Seizures Recorded in Birth Certificates Compared to Medicaid Claims and Hospital Discharge Abstracts Among Live Births in South Carolina, 1996–2013","Objective Neonatal seizures in the first 28 days of life often reflect underlying brain injury or abnormalities, and measure the quality of perinatal care in out-of-hospital births. Using the 2003 revision of birth certificates only, three studies reported more neonatal seizures recorded among home births ​or planned out-of-hospital births compared to hospital births. However, the validity of recording neonatal seizures or serious neurologic dysfunction across birth settings in birth certificates has not been evaluated. We aimed to validate seizure recording in birth certificates across birth settings using multiple datasets. Methods We examined checkbox items “seizures” and “seizure or serious neurologic dysfunction” in the 1989 and 2003 revisions of birth certificates in South Carolina from 1996 to 2013. Gold standards were ICD-9-CM codes 779.0, 345.X, and 780.3 in either hospital discharge abstracts or Medicaid encounters jointly. Results Sensitivity, positive predictive value, false positive rate, and the kappa statistic of neonatal seizures recording were 7%, 66%, 34%, and 0.12 for the 2003 revision of birth certificates in 547,177 hospital births from 2004 to 2013 and 5%, 33%, 67%, and 0.09 for the 1998 revision in 396,776 hospital births from 1996 to 2003, and 0, 0, 100%, −0.002 among 660 intended home births from 2004 to 2013 and 920 home births from 1996 to 2003, respectively. Conclusions for Practice Despite slight improvement across revisions, South Carolina birth certificates under-reported or falsely reported seizures among hospital births and especially home births. Birth certificates alone should not be used to measure neonatal seizures or serious neurologic dysfunction."
Agri-science to agri-business: the technology transfer dimension,"Among challenges that stakeholders within the agri-food sector face, namely the Government, Universities and public or private Research Institutes, consumers, farmers and the industry, one of paramount importance refers to the knowledge and technology transfer from agricultural science to enhance industry competitiveness and social welfare. Papers edited in this special issue have been presented in the 2015 EAAE seminar [146th seminar of the European Association of Agricultural Economists held in MAICh, Chania, Greece, July 15–16, 2015 (http://146eaae.maich.gr/)] entitled “Technology transfer as a driver of innovative entrepreneurship in agriculture and the agri-food industry.” They examine how knowledge producers and consumers cope with and device ways to trigger moving from institutional tactical fragmentation to strategic technological integration of the agribusiness value adding. Focus is given in analyzing academic technology transfer activity development in a follower innovator country to study dynamics and whether practices undertaken take advantage of what others have done in the past and the probability of learning resulting in leap-frog to appropriate initiatives so that to promote research outcomes commercialization."
Preparation of 166Dy/166Ho-chitosan as an in vivo generator for radiosynovectomy,166Ho is one of the most effective radionuclides used for radiosynovectomy. One method to deliver this radioisotope to target tissue is via the 166Dy/166Ho in vivo generator system. The aim of this work was to prepare 166Dy/166Ho-chitosan (166Dy/166Ho-CHIT) in vivo generator for radiosynovectomy applications. 166Dy obtained by the irradiation of natural 164Dy target. 166Dy was separated from 166Ho by extraction chromatographic method (separation yield; 93% and separation factor;1.7). Chitosan labeling was performed in acetic acid with 99.3 ± 0.6% radiochemical purity. Biodistribution studies on intraarticular injected rats demonstrated high retention in the knee joint even 7 days showing no radioactivity leakage from the injection site into other organs as well as any translocation of the daughter nucleus after β− decay of 166Dy.
The developing hypopharyngeal microbiota in early life,"The airways of healthy humans harbor a distinct microbial community. Perturbations in the microbial community have been associated with disease, yet little is known about the formation and development of a healthy airway microbiota in early life. Our goal was to understand the establishment of the airway microbiota within the first 3 months of life."
Influence of maternal breast milk ingestion on acquisition of the intestinal microbiome in preterm infants,"The initial acquisition and early development of the intestinal microbiome during infancy are important to human health across the lifespan. Mode of birth, antibiotic administration, environment of care, and nutrition have all been shown to play a role in the assembly of the intestinal microbiome during early life. For preterm infants, who are disproportionately at risk of inflammatory intestinal disease (i.e., necrotizing enterocolitis), a unique set of clinical factors influence the establishment of the microbiome. The purpose of this study was to establish the influence of nutritional exposures on the intestinal microbiome in a cohort of preterm infants early in life."
Review and results of a survey about biosimilars prescription and challenges in the Middle East and North Africa region,"Only drafts of regulatory guidelines for the registration of biosimilars are available in Lebanon. We analyzed the results of a regional survey conducted in Lebanon to understand the impact of different parameters on the acceptance and future prescription of biosimilars. We also reviewed the current situation of biosimilars around the world. The study surveyed healthcare professionals from the Arab countries, Iran, Belgium and Italy. Data about the participants’ specialty, country of residence, their knowledge about biosimilars, biosimilars’ prescription, price influence and the manufacturer’s credibility were collected."
Molecular diagnostic markers of Tachysurus fulvidraco and Leiocassis longirostris and their hybrids,"Bagridae is an important family of catfishes and has a high market demand. Recently, more cultivable Bagridae fishes are being exploited in China, and hybridization of some species has been carried out to achieve better growth performance, favorable sex ratios and better disease resistance. Yet, these hybrids have further increased the difficulties of taxonomy identification due to morphological indistinguishableness."
Pim1 kinase regulates c-Kit gene translation,"Receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Kit (CD117) plays a pivotal role in the maintenance and expansion of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Additionally, over-expression and/or mutational activation of c-Kit have been implicated in numerous malignant diseases including acute myeloid leukemia. However, the translational regulation of c-Kit expression remains largely unknown."
Response to anti-PD1 therapy with nivolumab in metastatic sarcomas,Manipulation of immune checkpoints such as CTLA4 or PD-1 with targeted antibodies has recently emerged as an effective anticancer strategy in multiple malignancies. Sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of diseases in need of more effective treatments. Different subtypes of soft tissue and bone sarcomas have been shown to express PD-1 ligand.
Metastatic meningioma presenting as a malignant soft tissue tumour,"Extracranial metastasis of malignant meningioma to soft tissues is extremely rare and its clinical, radiological and pathological features are not well-characterised."
Multi-level hp-adaptivity and explicit error estimation,"Recently, a multi-level hp-version of the finite element method (FEM) was proposed to ease the difficulties of treating hanging nodes, while providing full hp-approximation capabilities. In the original paper, the refinement procedure made use of a-priori knowledge of the solution. However, adaptive procedures can produce discretizations which are more effective than an intuitive choice of element sizes h and polynomial degree distributions p. This is particularly prominent when a-priori knowledge of the solution is only vague or unavailable. The present contribution demonstrates that multi-level hp-adaptive schemes can be efficiently driven by an explicit a-posteriori error estimator. To this end, we adopt the classical residual-based error estimator. The main insight here is that its extension to multi-level hp-FEM is possible by considering the refined-most overlay elements as integration domains. We demonstrate on several two- and three-dimensional examples that exponential convergence rates can be obtained."
The alleviating effects of salicylic acid application against aluminium toxicity in barley (Hordeum vulgare) roots,"Aluminium (Al) toxicity is one of the major growth limiting factors that affects large agricultural areas resulting in reduced crop production in acid soils. The present study aims to investigate alleviating effects of salicylic acid (SA) on Al toxicity in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) roots. The roots were exposed to 20 μ.M AlCl3 with or without SA (5 and 10 μM) for 72 h. In an alternative group, roots were pre-treated with 5 μM and 10 μM SA for 24 h, and then they were exposed to 20 μM AlCl3. To evaluate the ameliorating effects of SA on Al toxicity some cellular stress responses were investigated including root elongation, Al uptake, loss of plasma membrane integrity, mitotic abnormalities, superoxide dismutase activity, peroxidase activity, total protein content and DNA fragmentation. The obtained results suggested that both pre-treatment and co-treatment of 10 μM SA could alleviate Al-induced toxicity in barley roots in relation to inhibition of Al uptake and activation of the antioxidant enzyme system."
Predictions of marbled crayfish establishment in conurbations fulfilled: Evidences from the Czech Republic,"The marbled crayfish (Procambarus fallax f. virginalis) has become one of the potentially most dangerous non-indigenous crayfish species spreading in European countries and elsewhere. This taxon reproduces parthenogenetically and recently has been verified as a vector of the crayfish plague pathogen. Here, we report on two established populations of marbled crayfish in the Czech Republic. The marbled crayfish was observed during autumn 2015 in an urban pond connected by sewer piping with the Rokytka brook near its mouth to the Vltava River in Prague. Subsequently, three adult females, two of them having well-developed glair glands and oocytes, were captured in this pond during spring 2016, suggesting successful overwintering of the local population. Furthermore, four adult females were captured in an artificial pond at the Radovesická lignite spoil heap in the vicinity to the industrial conurbation of Bílina in summer 2016; one of them carried eggs. We tested these for the presence of the crayfish plague pathogen Aphanomyces astaci, with negative results. The introduction pathway for both populations is most likely a release from private aquaria, as these sites are popular for recreation activities. Our findings substantiate previous predictions that conurbations are likely to be the primary areas for marbled crayfish introductions."
Recovery capacity of the edible halophyte Crithmum maritimum from temporary salinity in relation to nutrient accumulation and nitrogen metabolism,"Here, the reversibility effects of salinity on Crithmum maritimum L. (Apiaceae), a perennial local oilseed halophyte that was recently suggested as a cash crop for biosaline agriculture, were checked by monitoring a number of parameters in pre-stressed plants and then, replaced in normal conditions. Plants previously grown for 15 days on basic medium were treated for one month by increasing NaCl concentrations (0, 100, 200 and 300 mM), or for three weeks by 300 mM NaCl and then put back again for a week on basic culture medium without salinity (R). Results revealed that C. maritimum was able to tolerate 100 mM NaCl concentration in the culture medium following an efficient N assimilation in roots and osmotic adjustment in leaves and roots. However, from 200 mM NaCl treatment, a significant and progressive reduction in plant growth was observed, mainly due to salt ions-induced limitations of mineral nutrient acquisition and N-assimilating enzymes (NR and GS) in both organs rather than osmotic effects. Interestingly, a one week of 300 mM NaCl elimination allowed C. maritimum plants to achieve their normal growth status through a partial dilution of Na+ and Cl− effects on nutrients, osmotically compatible solutes, and activities of N-assimilating enzymes to levels similar to that obtained under 100 mM NaCl. Taken together, it was concluded that a temporary exposition of C. maritimum to salt stress is not necessary followed by significant depreciation in product yield and quality, which highlighted the reversibility effects of salinity on this plant species."
Reproductive strategy in rock-dwelling snail Cochlodina orthostoma (Gastropoda: Pulmonata: Clausiliidae),"To analyse the reproductive activity of the central-European clausiliid Cochlodina orthostoma we sampled monthly 30 adults from three sites comprising old stone walls of two abandoned castles and isolated limestone rocks. Out of the 395 dissected snails, 25.1% retained eggs. The number of eggs in the uterus ranged from 2 to 12. The highest percentages of gravid individuals were recorded in June–July, but reproductive intensity varied among populations. Almost half of the recorded eggs contained a shelled embryo. The largest embryonic shell featured approximately 1.3 whorls. The reproductive mode of the species was also studied in laboratory culture. Egg-laying was observed between May and November, the number of eggs laid on a single occasion ranged from 1 to 8, and the number of eggs produced per individual varied between 6 and 21 during the observation period. We found that eggs were laid in various developmental stages, accordingly, there were differences in egg sizes and the external incubation period varied between 6 and 15 days. Based on our results C. orthostoma should be regarded as brooding species with a short and flexible period of egg retention."
Tunable Slow Light in Graphene Metamaterial in a Broad Terahertz Range,"A graphene-based metamaterial with tunable electromagnetically induced transparency is numerically studied in this paper. The proposed structure consists of a graphene layer composed of H shape between two cut wires, by breaking symmetry can control EIT-like effects and by increasing the asymmetry in the structure has strong coupling between elements. It is important that the peak frequency of transmission window can be dynamically controlled over a broad frequency range by varying the chemical potential of graphene layer. The results show that high refractive index sensitivity and figure of merit can be achieved in asymmetrical structures which is good for sensing applications. We calculated the group delay and the results show we can control the group velocity by varying the S parameter in asymmetrical structure. The characteristics of our system indicate important potential applications in integrated optical circuits such as optical storage, ultrafast plasmonic switches, high performance filters, and slow-light devices."
Synergistic effects of fenbendazole and metronidazole against Giardia muris in Swiss mice naturally infected,"In this study were proposed different protocols for the treatment of mice naturally infected with Giardia muris. Male Swiss mice were divided into seven groups, with five animals each, in a blind, controlled, randomized by drawing lots and once-repeated experiment. Parasite detection and cure control were performed using the Faust method and search by trophozoites in the intestinal mucosa. Clinical parameters (weight, water and feed consumption, elimination of excreta, aspect of the fur and feces) were also evaluated. All animals were treated with metronidazole (M), fenbendazole (F), and probiotics (P), administered intragastrically, during 7 days. M1, FM1, and F1 groups were treated 1×/day; M3, FM3, and PM3 groups 3×/day; and ST (control group) received only water. After the 5th and 7th days of treatment, the animals in FM1/FM3 and PM3/M3 groups presented, respectively, negative results and remained negative in the following 10 days. Animals in F1 group consumed less water (p = 0.00010) compared with FM1/FM3/PM3. The animals in M1 group compared with FM3/M3, F1 compared with M3, and ST compared with FM1/FM3/M3/PM3 consumed a larger amount of feed (p = 0.00001). The animals in F1 group compared with FM3/M1/M3/PM3, FM1 compared with FM3, and ST compared with FM3/M1/M3/PM3 eliminated lower volume of excreta (p = 0.00001). The results show that the association between F and M potentiates the effects, indicating a synergistic action of these two drugs, and FM1 is the best protocol due to early negativity in the animals, lower concentrations of the drugs, lower risk of toxicity and stress, and less alterations in clinical parameters."
Pressure-sensitive adhesive composites with a hydrophobic form of graphene oxide for enhanced thermal conductivity,"Pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) composites containing oleylamine functionalized graphene oxide (OA-f-GO) fillers were prepared. The effects of the surface modification of graphene oxide (GO) on the morphology of the PSA composites and on its thermal and adhesive properties were investigated. In contrast to GO fillers, the OA-f-GO fillers were found to be uniformly dispersed in the PSA matrix without any agglomeration and voids. The hydrophobization of GO resulting from the oleylamine functionalization improved the compatibility of the GO sheets with the PSA matrix. The thermal conductivity of the OA-f-GO (5 wt%)/PSA composites at UV energy of 2,000 mJ/cm2 was 55%, 140%, and 300% greater than the thermal conductivities of the OA-f-GO (5 wt%)/PSA composites, GO (5 wt%)/PSA composites, and bare PSA at UV energy of 800 mJ/cm2, respectively. In addition, the higher peel strength of the OA-f-GO/PSA composites compared to that of the GO/PSA composites was explained by the better wetting of hydrophobic OA-f-GO fillers in the PSA matrix."
Deficient amygdala–prefrontal intrinsic connectivity after effortful emotion regulation in borderline personality disorder,"Emotion instability in borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been associated with an impaired fronto-limbic inhibitory network. However, functional connectivity (FC) underlying altered emotion regulation in BPD has yet to be established. Here, we used resting-state fMRI to investigate enduring effects of effortful emotion regulation on the amygdala intrinsic FC in BPD. In this multicenter study, resting-state fMRI was acquired before and after an emotion regulation task in 48 BPD patients and 39 non-patient comparison individuals. The bilateral amygdalae were used as a seed in the whole-brain FC analysis and two-way mixed ANOVA to test whether BPD patients exhibited weaker post-task increase in the amygdala intrinsic FC with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), compared to non-patients. Subsequently, we explored whether the results are common for personality disorders characterized by emotional problems, using additional data of 21 cluster-C personality disorder patients. In contrast to non-patients, BPD patients failed to show increased post-task amygdala resting-state FC with the medial, dorsolateral, ventrolateral PFC, and superior temporal gyrus, but surprisingly exhibited decreased FC with the posterior cingulate cortex and increased FC with the superior parietal lobule. In BPD patients, the emotion regulation task failed to increase resting-state amygdala FC with brain regions essential for effortful emotion regulation, which suggests: (a) altered cognitive control typically used to indirectly alleviate distress by reinterpreting the meaning of emotional stimuli; (b) impaired direct regulation of emotional responses, which might be common for personality disorders; (c) avoidance of self-related appraisals induced by social emotional stimuli."
Mr. Red in the American South: a response to Lisa Borgerding,"This review essay affirms the work Mr. Red does with his students to support their learning about evolution and how his approach agrees with the realities of teaching evolution in the American South. It then shows how focusing on understanding, but not necessarily belief, adds to Mr. Red’s apparent neutrality a complimentary pedagogical approach that legitimizes more strongly accepted science while at the same time attending to the deep conflict many rural students feel when they are asked to learn evolution."
General experiences + race + racism = Work lives of Black faculty in postsecondary science education,"Existent research indicates that postsecondary Black faculty members, who are sorely underrepresented in the academy especially in STEM fields, assume essential roles; chief among these roles is diversifying higher education. Their recruitment and retention become more challenging in light of research findings on work life for postsecondary faculty. Research has shown that postsecondary faculty members in general have become increasingly stressed and job satisfaction has declined with dissatisfaction with endeavors and work overload cited as major stressors. In addition to the stresses managed by higher education faculty at large, Black faculty must navigate diversity-related challenges. Illuminating and understanding their experiences can be instrumental in lessening stress and job dissatisfaction, outcomes that facilitate recruitment and retention. This study featured the experiences and perceptions of Black faculty in science education. This study, framed by critical race theory, examines two questions: What characterizes the work life of some Black faculty members who teach, research, and serve in science education? How are race and racism present in the experiences of these postsecondary Black faculty members? A phenomenological approach to the study situates the experiences of the Black participants as valid phenomena worthy of investigation, illuminates their experiences, and seeks to retain the authenticity of their voices."
Focal task specific dystonia: a review and update,"In this review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the etiology, risk factors and pathophysiology of focal task specific dystonia (FTSD), movement disorders characterized by abnormal motor activation during the performance of specific, repetitive actions. We focus on two common FTSD, musician’s dystonia and writer’s cramp. FTSD may pose a threat to the patient’s livelihood, and improved therapeutic treatments are needed."
Does hybrid LCA with a complete system boundary yield adequate results for product promotion?,"Hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) with a complete system boundary is recognized as an advanced approach widely applied in comparative analysis with the goal of product promotion. Here, I evaluate the theoretical foundation, or assumptions, of hybrid LCA in this application and discuss alternative models. The goal of this article is partly to call attention to the restrictive assumptions involved in the models used in LCA and to instigate further research and effort to improve these models."
Construction of mutation populations by gamma-ray and carbon beam irradiation in chili pepper (Capsicum annuum L.),"Mutagenesis using ionizing radiation has been widely used for the development of genetic and breeding resources with novel characteristics. Although mutation breeding using X- and gamma-rays has been attempted in peppers, information on the effectiveness of other ionizing radiation and a comparative analysis of mutagenic effects of different forms of radiation is limited. Therefore, we investigated and compared the biological effectiveness and mutagenesis efficiency of gamma-rays and a carbon beam (a heavy ion beam) in a chili pepper landrace of Korea, ‘Yuwol-cho’. The survival and shoot growth rate obtained by irradiation at serial doses showed that the LD50 was about 140 and 35 Gy, and the RD50 was about 80 and 32 Gy for gamma rays and carbon beams, respectively. The optimal doses for mutation breeding for these forms of radiation were estimated to be 80-100 and 15-20 Gy for gamma rays and carbon beams, respectively. We also developed M2 populations consisting of 1,836 lines by gamma-ray irradiation (100 Gy) and 154 lines by carbon beam irradiation (20 Gy). The frequency of dwarf or male sterile individuals showed that the mutagenic effect of the carbon beam was higher than that of gamma-rays. We identified individuals in each population with various developmental mutations through phenotypic analysis and categorized the mutations into four groups (mutations in plant architecture and development, leaf, flower, or fruits). This study provides basic information for mutation breeding using ionizing radiation and useful materials for the identification of genes related to the diverse characteristics in chili pepper."
"Development of serological procedures for sensitive, rapid detection of Cucumber mosaic virus in Lilium","Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) causes severe agricultural losses in Korea and has a very large host range. To produce virus-free plants, it is necessary to develop efficient, sensitive virus detection methods. In this study, we collected leaf samples from Lilium showing characteristic symptoms of CMV infection from Gang-won Province, Korea in 2011 and amplified the coat protein (CP) gene from CMV from the samples by RT-PCR. Three CMV isolates were found to belong to subgroup IA based on the nucleotide sequence of the CP gene. We cloned the complete CP gene into the pET21d(+) expression vector to generate recombinant coat proteins. After expressing His-tagged coat proteins in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) by IPTG induction, we purified the proteins using Ni-NTA agarose beads and used the purified CMV recombinant CP for antiserum production. The resulting polyclonal antisera specifically recognized CMV from infected lily samples, as determined by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ID-ELISA) and Western blotting assays. In addition, we developed an immunocapture reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (IC-RT-PCR) assay using the polyclonal antiserum to enable sensitive, reliable, cost-effective detection of CMV. This study demonstrates that three CMV isolates belong to subgroup IA, and that CMV-specific PAbs can be used to detect CMV in epidemiological studies."
"In vitro immature embryo germination and propagation of Vanda stangeana Rchb. f., an orchid endemic to India","The conservation of any endemic species requires modern biological tools. In this study, an efficient, viable in vitro protocol was established for the seed germination, protocorm multiplication and subsequent plantlet regeneration of Vanda stangeana, an orchid species endemic to Manipur, India. Of the six basal media tested for asymbiotic seed germination, half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium (½ MS) was found to be the most effective. Protocorms were further developed on ½ MS supplemented with different concentrations of α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and kinetin (KN), either singly or in combination. The highest protocorm multiplication was obtained on the medium supplemented with NAA (2.7 μM) and KN (2.3 μM). Vigorous plantlets were developed when cultured on ½ MS supplemented with banana homogenate (30 g·L-1). A functional root system was developed when the shoots were transferred to ½ MS supplemented with NAA (5.7 μM). Transplanted seedlings grew best on a potting mix containing brick chips and charcoal pieces (2:1).

Evaluation of Phytophthora root rot- and bacterial wilt-resistant inbred lines and their crosses for use as rootstocks in pepper (Capsicum annuum L.),"Breeding lines and their crosses with genic male sterile (GMS) and cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) lines, developed for use as rootstocks with resistance to Phytophthora root rot and bacterial wilt, were evaluated for their resistance against these diseases and for supporting the growth of scions. Five inbred lines of the Yanggang (YG) series of breeding lines and 10 crosses between these lines and the male sterile lines, the commercial rootstock Tantan, and the susceptible scion cultivar Gilsang were tested for resistance to infection by Ralstonia solanacearum and Phytophthora capsici at the seedling stage. YG4, YG5, GMS x YG5, and CMS x YG3 remained disease-free, whereas Gilsang succumbed to both diseases. The grafted plants, corresponding not-grated rootstocks, auto-grafted (Gilsang/Gilsang) and non-grafted Gilsang seedlings (controls) were inoculated with R. solanacearum, planted side-by-side in a greenhouse, and evaluated for incidence of bacterial wilt under hot greenhouse conditions during summer. Gilsang scions grafted to the rootstocks YG2, YG3, YG4, YG5, GMS x YG5, and CMS x YG6 remained healthy through the end of the experiment, without any symptoms of bacterial wilt, whereas Gilsang scions grafted to rootstocks CMS x YG2 and Tantan, as well as the auto-grafted and non-grafted Gilsang seedlings failed to survive the disease, with 100% death observed. The survival rate of the rootstocks to bacterial wilt was higher than that of the grafted plants, except for Tantan, in which all plants died. Thus, the resistant rootstocks developed and selected in this study were effective in the control of bacterial wilt under high temperature conditions. The rootstocks were found to have a minimal effect on the growth and fruit size of the scion."
Application of supplementary white and pulsed light-emitting diodes to lettuce grown in a plant factory with artificial lighting,"Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are currently undergoing rapid development as plant growth light sources in a plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL). However, little is known about the effects of supplementary light and pulsed LEDs on plant growth, bioactive compound productions, and energy efficiency in lettuce. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of supplementary white LEDs (study I) and pulsed LEDs (study II) on red leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. ‘Sunmang’). In study I, six LED sources were used to determine the effects of supplementary white LEDs (RGB 7:1:1, 7:1:2, RWB 7:1:2, 7:2:1, 8:1:1, 8:2:0 [based on chip number] on lettuce). Fluorescent lamps were used as the control. In study II, pulsed RWB 7:2:1 LED treatments (30, 10, 1 kHz with a 50 or 75% duty ratio) were applied to lettuce. In study I, the application of red and blue fractions improved plant growth characteristics and the accumulation of antioxidant phenolic compounds, respectively. In addition, the application of green light increased plant growth, including the fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots, as well as leaf area. However, the substitution of green LEDs with white LEDs induced approximately 3.4-times higher light and energy use efficiency. In study II, the growth characteristics and photosynthesis of lettuce were affected by various combinations of duty ratio and frequency. In particular, biomass under a 1 kHz 75% duty ratio of pulsed LEDs was not significantly different from that of the control (continuous LEDs). Moreover, no significant difference in leaf photosynthetic rate was observed between any pulsed LED treatment utilizing a 75% duty ratio versus continuous LEDs. However, some pulsed LED treatments may potentially improve light and energy use efficiency compared to continuous LEDs. These results suggest that the fraction of red, blue, and green wavelengths of LEDs is an important factor for plant growth and the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds in lettuce and that supplementary white LEDs (based on a combination of red and blue LEDs) might be more suitable as a commercial lighting source than green LEDs. In addition, the use of suitable pulses of LEDs might save energy while inducing plant growth similar to that under continuous LEDs. Our findings provide important basic information for designing optimal light sources for use in a PFAL."
"Drivers of symbiont diversity in freshwater snails: a comparative analysis of resource availability, community heterogeneity, and colonization opportunities","Decades of community ecology research have highlighted the importance of resource availability, habitat heterogeneity, and colonization opportunities in driving biodiversity. Less clear, however, is whether a similar suite of factors explains the diversity of symbionts. Here, we used a hierarchical dataset involving 12,712 freshwater snail hosts representing five species to test the relative importance of potential factors in driving symbiont richness. Specifically, we used model selection to assess the explanatory power of variables related to host species identity, resource availability (average body size, host density), ecological heterogeneity (richness of hosts and other taxa), and colonization opportunities (wetland size and amount of neighboring wetland area) on symbiont richness in 146 snail host populations in California, USA. We encountered a total of 23 taxa of symbionts, including both obligatory parasites such as digenetic trematodes as well as more commensal, mutualistic, or opportunistic groups such as aquatic insect larvae, annelids, and leeches. After validating richness estimates per host population using species accumulative curves, we detected positive effects on symbiont richness from host body size, total richness of the aquatic community, and colonization opportunities. Neither snail density nor the richness of snail species accounted for significant variation in symbiont diversity. Host species identity also affected symbiont richness, with higher gamma and average alpha diversity among more common host species with higher local abundances. These findings highlight the importance of multiple, concurrent factors in driving symbiont richness that extend beyond epidemiological measures of host abundance or host diversity alone."
Inflation expels runaways,"We argue that moduli stabilization generically restricts the evolution following transitions between weakly coupled de Sitter vacua and can induce a strong selection bias towards inflationary cosmologies. The energy density of domain walls between vacua typically destabilizes Kähler moduli and triggers a runaway towards large volume. This decompactification phase can collapse the new de Sitter region unless a minimum amount of inflation occurs after the transition. A stable vacuum transition is guaranteed only if the inflationary expansion generates overlapping past light cones for all observable modes originating from the reheating surface, which leads to an approximately flat and isotropic universe. High scale inflation is vastly favored. Our results point towards a framework for studying parameter fine-tuning and inflationary initial conditions in flux compactifications."
"On the strength of the U

f

t
 = (aT)−1 = 16, where a is the lattice spacing and T the temperature, at three fixed zero-temperature pion masses between 200 MeV and 540 MeV. In this range we find that the transition is consistent with a broad crossover. As a probe of the restoration of chiral symmetry, we study the static screening spectrum. We observe a degeneracy between the transverse isovector vector and axial-vector channels starting from the transition temperature. Particularly striking is the strong reduction of the splitting between isovector scalar and pseudoscalar screening masses around the chiral phase transition by at least a factor of three compared to its value at zero temperature. In fact, the splitting is consistent with zero within our uncertainties. This disfavours a chiral phase transition in the O(4) universality class."
Complex detection from PPI data using ensemble method,"Many algorithms have been proposed recently to detect protein complexes in protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks. Most proteins form complexes to accomplish biological functions such as transcription of DNA, translation of mRNA and cell growth. Since proteins perform their tasks by interacting with each other, determining these protein–protein interactions is an important task. Traditional clustering approaches for protein complex identification cannot deal with noisy and incomplete PPI data and dependent on information from a single source. Since the noise in the interaction datasets hampers the detection of accurate protein complexes, we propose an ensemble approach for protein complex detection that attempts to combine information from Gene Ontology at the time of complex detection. The PPI data network is taken as input by several baseline complex detection algorithms to generate protein complexes. The protein complexes are then subsequently combined by the proposed ensemble using a consensus building module for the purpose of identifying meaningful complexes. The protein complexes thus predicted by the ensemble are evaluated by comparing them to a set of gold standard protein complexes and their biological relevance established using a co-localization score."

Quasi-solid-state agar-based polymer electrolytes for dye-sensitized solar cell applications using imidazolium-based ionic liquid,"Agar as a natural polymer is used to prepare quasi-solid-state polymer electrolytes (QSPEs). Two different iodide salts namely sodium iodide (NaI) and potassium iodide (KI) are incorporated. To enhance the ionic conductivity of the QSPE system, 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (MPII) ionic liquid is added. The highest ionic conductivity of 1.48 × 10−3 S cm−1 was achieved after addition of 50 wt.% of KI and 3.0 g of MPII ionic liquid. QSPEs are studied for temperature-dependent ionic conductivity behavior. QSPEs are studied for structural properties using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The structural studies revealed that the complexation between agar polymer, iodide salts, and MPII ionic liquid has occurred. QSPEs are sandwiched between counter and working electrodes to fabricated DSSC and analyzed under sun simulator. The highest efficiency of 2.16% is achieved with incorporation of 3.0 g MPII ionic liquid."
Is bariatric surgery safe in the elderly population?,Bariatric surgery has proven to be the most effective treatment for morbid obesity in all age groups and is considered superior to medical treatment.

Sublethal effect assessment of a low-power and dual-frequency anti-cyanobacterial ultrasound device on the common carp (Cyprinus carpio): a field study,"The use of ultrasonication for cyanobacterial control in freshwater bodies has become increasingly popular during the last decades despite controversial efficiency on large scale application. Apart from that, little information is currently available regarding ultrasound toxicity potential towards non-target species. This work was designed to address this issue in the common carp using a low-power (7–9 W output) and dual-frequency (23 and 46 kHz) anti-cyanobacterial ultrasound device. Results showed that carps were unaffected by ultrasound exposure when exposed in floating cages in fish ponds over a 30-day period. The experiment duration was the main factor influencing all measured biological parameters in exposed and non-exposed organisms. Indeed, it was positively associated with an increase in fish condition factor. Cortisol level also tended to slightly increase over the number of days of experiment but its variation did not enable to sort out any ultrasound exposure-related stress. Moreover, an overall diminution along the experimental period of the expression level of a set of biomarkers could be reported, encompassing cellular antioxidant enzyme activities such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxydase (GPx), catalase and glutathione S-transferase (GST), and lactate dehydrogenase activity. Subtle changes in these biomarkers were dependent of the type of enzyme activity and especially of the origin of fish (i.e., sampled pond) regardless of the presence of ultrasound equipment, reflecting thereby fish adaptation to local environmental conditions in each pond. In conclusion, this study does not provide indication that ultrasonication in the aforementioned conditions affects the welfare and physiological homeostasis of carps."
Environmental risk assessment of pesticides: state of the art and prospective improvement from science,"Pesticide risk assessment in the European regulatory framework is mandatory performed for active substances (pesticides) and the plant protection products they are constituents of. The aim is to guarantee that safe use can be achieved for the intended use of the product. This paper provides a feedback on the regulatory environmental risk assessment performed for pesticide registration at the EU and member state levels. The different steps of pesticide registration are addressed considering both exposure and hazard. In this paper, we focus on the environmental fate and behaviour in surface water together with the aquatic ecotoxicity of the substances to illustrate pesticide regulatory risk assessment performed for aquatic organisms. Current methodologies are presented along with highlights on potential improvements. For instance, as regards exposure aspects, moving from field based to landscape risk assessments is promising. Regarding ecotoxicology, ecological models may be valuable tools when applied to chemical risk assessment. In addition, interest and further developments to better take into account mitigation measures in risk assessment and management are also presented."

"Development of serological procedures for sensitive, rapid detection of Cucumber mosaic virus in Lilium","Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) causes severe agricultural losses in Korea and has a very large host range. To produce virus-free plants, it is necessary to develop efficient, sensitive virus detection methods. In this study, we collected leaf samples from Lilium showing characteristic symptoms of CMV infection from Gang-won Province, Korea in 2011 and amplified the coat protein (CP) gene from CMV from the samples by RT-PCR. Three CMV isolates were found to belong to subgroup IA based on the nucleotide sequence of the CP gene. We cloned the complete CP gene into the pET21d(+) expression vector to generate recombinant coat proteins. After expressing His-tagged coat proteins in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) by IPTG induction, we purified the proteins using Ni-NTA agarose beads and used the purified CMV recombinant CP for antiserum production. The resulting polyclonal antisera specifically recognized CMV from infected lily samples, as determined by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ID-ELISA) and Western blotting assays. In addition, we developed an immunocapture reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (IC-RT-PCR) assay using the polyclonal antiserum to enable sensitive, reliable, cost-effective detection of CMV. This study demonstrates that three CMV isolates belong to subgroup IA, and that CMV-specific PAbs can be used to detect CMV in epidemiological studies."
Construction of mutation populations by gamma-ray and carbon beam irradiation in chili pepper (Capsicum annuum L.),"Mutagenesis using ionizing radiation has been widely used for the development of genetic and breeding resources with novel characteristics. Although mutation breeding using X- and gamma-rays has been attempted in peppers, information on the effectiveness of other ionizing radiation and a comparative analysis of mutagenic effects of different forms of radiation is limited. Therefore, we investigated and compared the biological effectiveness and mutagenesis efficiency of gamma-rays and a carbon beam (a heavy ion beam) in a chili pepper landrace of Korea, ‘Yuwol-cho’. The survival and shoot growth rate obtained by irradiation at serial doses showed that the LD50 was about 140 and 35 Gy, and the RD50 was about 80 and 32 Gy for gamma rays and carbon beams, respectively. The optimal doses for mutation breeding for these forms of radiation were estimated to be 80-100 and 15-20 Gy for gamma rays and carbon beams, respectively. We also developed M2 populations consisting of 1,836 lines by gamma-ray irradiation (100 Gy) and 154 lines by carbon beam irradiation (20 Gy). The frequency of dwarf or male sterile individuals showed that the mutagenic effect of the carbon beam was higher than that of gamma-rays. We identified individuals in each population with various developmental mutations through phenotypic analysis and categorized the mutations into four groups (mutations in plant architecture and development, leaf, flower, or fruits). This study provides basic information for mutation breeding using ionizing radiation and useful materials for the identification of genes related to the diverse characteristics in chili pepper."
"In vitro immature embryo germination and propagation of Vanda stangeana Rchb. f., an orchid endemic to India","The conservation of any endemic species requires modern biological tools. In this study, an efficient, viable in vitro protocol was established for the seed germination, protocorm multiplication and subsequent plantlet regeneration of Vanda stangeana, an orchid species endemic to Manipur, India. Of the six basal media tested for asymbiotic seed germination, half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium (½ MS) was found to be the most effective. Protocorms were further developed on ½ MS supplemented with different concentrations of α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and kinetin (KN), either singly or in combination. The highest protocorm multiplication was obtained on the medium supplemented with NAA (2.7 μM) and KN (2.3 μM). Vigorous plantlets were developed when cultured on ½ MS supplemented with banana homogenate (30 g·L-1). A functional root system was developed when the shoots were transferred to ½ MS supplemented with NAA (5.7 μM). Transplanted seedlings grew best on a potting mix containing brick chips and charcoal pieces (2:1). Acclimatized plants were introduced to an Arboretum under the management of the Forest Department, Government of Manipur, India. Thus, we have successfully developed a viable protocol for in vitro culture of Vanda stangeana."

Electrochemical oxidation of some catechol derivatives in the presence of some betadicetone derivatives: mechanistic and thermodynamic study,"Electrochemical oxidations of 4-methylcatechol (1), 4-tert-butylcatechol (5) and catechol (7) in the presence of different nucleophiles have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Experimental results have been obtained by means of cyclic voltammetry and controlled-potential coulometry. Also the theoretical results were calculated at DFT (B3LYP) level of theory and 6–311+G (p, d) basis set. The calculated results indicate that oxidation potential of catechols (1, 5, 7) and their substituted species are directly dependent on the ∆G

Signature of postglacial colonization on contemporary genetic structure and diversity of Quadrula quadrula (Bivalvia: Unionidae),"Contemporary species distributions and geographic patterns of genetic structure largely reflect pre-historic events, often with subsequent alterations from human influences. The geographic genetic structure of a relatively common and widespread unionid species, Quadrula quadrula, was investigated to reconstruct its postglacial history. Hypotheses regarding colonization routes of Q. quadrula into the Great Lakes basin after the most recent glacial retreat were tested. Samples were collected from Q. quadrula at sites spanning hypothesized glacial refugia and postglacial expansion routes in the Mississippi River drainage, including the Ohio and Missouri rivers, and the Great Lakes. Broad-scale phylogeography and population structure were assessed by sequencing a fragment of the mitochondrial CO1 gene and genotyping eight microsatellites. Results of analyses showed marked differences among the Great Lakes, Mississippi River, and Ohio River drainages, and suggested colonization of the Great Lakes basin from a Mississippian source. Populations showed patterns of isolation by distance: geographic and genetic distances were significantly correlated among Great Lakes populations based on colonization through the Chicago–Illinois outlet, but not when following the Wabash–Maumee outlet. All evidence indicates that postglacial colonization of the Great Lakes basin occurred almost exclusively through the Chicago–Illinois outlet, with subsequent expansion into the lower Great Lakes."

A multicenter experience of through-the-scope balloon-assisted enteroscopy in surgically altered gastrointestinal anatomy,Surgically altered gastrointestinal anatomy poses challenges for deep enteroscopy. Current overtube-assisted methods have long procedure times and utilize endoscopes with smaller working channels that preclude use of standard accessories. A through-the-scope balloon-assisted enteroscopy (TTS-BAE) device uses standard endoscopes with a large working channel to allow metallic and plastic stent insertion. We aim to determine the efficacy and safety of TTS-BAE in patients with altered surgical anatomy.
OR fire virtual training simulator: design and face validity,"The Virtual Electrosurgical Skill Trainer is a tool for training surgeons the safe operation of electrosurgery tools in both open and minimally invasive surgery. This training includes a dedicated team-training module that focuses on operating room (OR) fire prevention and response. The module was developed to allow trainees, practicing surgeons, anesthesiologist, and nurses to interact with a virtual OR environment, which includes anesthesia apparatus, electrosurgical equipment, a virtual patient, and a fire extinguisher. Wearing a head-mounted display, participants must correctly identify the “fire triangle” elements and then successfully contain an OR fire. Within these virtual reality scenarios, trainees learn to react appropriately to the simulated emergency. A study targeted at establishing the face validity of the virtual OR fire simulator was undertaken at the 2015 Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons conference."

Quasi-solid-state agar-based polymer electrolytes for dye-sensitized solar cell applications using imidazolium-based ionic liquid,"Agar as a natural polymer is used to prepare quasi-solid-state polymer electrolytes (QSPEs).

Quasi-Fredholm and Semi-B-Fredholm Linear Relations,Quasi-Fredholm and semi-B-Fredholm linear relations in Banach spaces are defined in terms of conditions on their ranges and null spaces. We analyze the behavior of the powers of such linear relations and prove that these classes of linear relations define a spectrum that satisfies the polynomial spectral mapping property. Our results are used to calculate the quasi-Fredholm and the semi-B-Fredholm spectra of some linear relations.

Synergistic effects of fenbendazole and metronidazole against Giardia muris in Swiss mice naturally infected,"In this study were proposed different protocols for the treatment of mice naturally infected with Giardia muris. Male Swiss mice were divided into seven groups, with five animals each, in a blind, controlled, randomized by drawing lots and once-repeated experiment. Parasite detection and cure control were performed using the Faust method and search by trophozoites in the intestinal mucosa. Clinical parameters (weight, water and feed consumption, elimination of excreta, aspect of the fur and feces) were also evaluated. All animals were treated with metronidazole (M), fenbendazole (F), and probiotics (P), administered intragastrically, during 7 days. M1, FM1, and F1 groups were treated 1×/day; M3, FM3, and PM3 groups 3×/day; and ST (control group) received only water. After the 5th and 7th days of treatment, the animals in FM1/FM3 and PM3/M3 groups presented, respectively, negative results and remained negative in the following 10 days. Animals in F1 group consumed less water (p = 0.00010) compared with FM1/FM3/PM3. The animals in M1 group compared with FM3/M3, F1 compared with M3, and ST compared with FM1/FM3/M3/PM3 consumed a larger amount of feed (p = 0.00001). The animals in F1 group compared with FM3/M1/M3/PM3, FM1 compared with FM3, and ST compared with FM3/M1/M3/PM3 eliminated lower volume of excreta (p = 0.00001). The results show that the association between F and M potentiates the effects, indicating a synergistic action of these two drugs, and FM1 is the best protocol due to early negativity in the animals, lower concentrations of the drugs, lower risk of toxicity and stress, and less alterations in clinical parameters."

The purpose of the stud was to evaluate serum adipokines and endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels in the patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) NYHA class III-IV and to determine its associations with bone mineral density (BMD). Pulmonary and hemodynamic parameters, BMD Z-scores at the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN), serum leptin, adiponectin, visfatin and endothelin-1 (ET-1), were evaluated in 32 patients with IPAH NYHA class III-IV and 30 healthy volunteers. Leptin, adiponectin and ET-1 were higher in the patients with IPAH than in healthy subjects. Visfatin level showed a tendency to increase compared to that of healthy subjects (p = 0.076). The univariate analysis revealed a positive correlation between BMD Z-scores at both sites and 6-min walk test, and inverse relation with pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP). Adiponectin and visfatin showed positive correlations with PVR (p = 0.009 and p = 0.006). Serum adiponectin, visfatin and leptin were inversely associated with Z-scores. After adjusting for BMI and FMI, such associations persisted between visfatin and adiponectin levels and Z-scores at both sites. ET-1 related to mPAP, cardiac index and PVR. Negative correlation was observed between ET-1 and FN BMD (p = 0.01). Positive correlations have revealed between ET-1 and adiponectin (p = 0.02), visfatin (p = 0.004) in IPAH patients. These results provide further evidence that adipokine and endothelial dysregulation may cause not only a decrease in BMD, but also an increase in hemodynamic disorders of IPAH."
The parameters governing the coefficient of dispersion of cubes in rotating cylinders,"Axial dispersion of cubic particles in horizontal, rotating cylinders was investigated using discrete element modelling simulations. We found that, similar to the behavior of spheres, the axial dispersion coefficient of cubes depends on (1) the rotational speed of the cylinder \({\omega }\), (2) the acceleration due to gravity g and (3) the particle size d, satisfying the relationship \({D}_\mathrm {ax}\propto {\omega }^{1-2{\lambda }}{g}^{{\lambda }}{d}^{2-{\lambda }}\) with \({\lambda }\approx 0.15\) (\({\lambda }\approx 0.1\) for beds of spheres) (Third et al. in Powder Technol 203:510–517, 2010). This observation suggested that, although particle shape influences significantly the rate of axial dispersion (cubes disperse almost twice as fast as spheres of equal volume), the parameters controlling the coefficient of dispersion are independent of particle shape."
Investigating the behavioral significance of color pattern in a cichlid fish: firemouths Thorichthys meeki respond differently to color-manipulated video and dummy conspecifics,"Red coloration is a conspicuous feature of many visual signals and can function to attract or deter its viewers. Among fishes, red is associated with specialized nuptial, territorial and aposematic (warning) displays. Both sexes of the firemouth cichlid fish Thorichthys meeki develop red ventral coloration at sexual maturity, along with temporally variable black (melanic) elements. Isolated adult firemouth cichlids sequentially presented paired dummy and paired video conspecifics, both with and without red ventral coloration. Subjects interacted more with red-containing stimuli, but with a significant interaction: dummy presentations revealed a strong, positive red bias that video presentations did not. In addition, the melanic color pattern displayed by subjects at the initiation of each trial had a significant effect on subject responsiveness. These results reveal the potential for between-subject differences and experimental design parameters to interact critically in the study of animal color patterns."
Leaning pagodas in China: laboratory test and analysis of subsidence under frequent earthquakes,"The inclination of ancient pagodas leads to a non-uniform stress distribution on the soil below. This non-uniform stress threatens the structural stability of the ancient pagodas, and the degree of damage depends on the soil properties. This paper researches the residual strain under the ancient pagodas in China to simulate the non-uniform stress state under frequent earthquake conditions using a dynamic triaxial test apparatus. The non-uniform stress state was expressed by the consolidation stress ratio. The frequent earthquakes were indicated by the dynamic stress ratio and cyclic interval vibration loading. To describe the foundations of the ancient pagodas in China, two types of soil, the mucky clay (Q4) and the paleo-clay (\({\text{Q}}_{3}^{\text{al}}\)), were tested. The relationship between the two different soils and the consolidation and dynamic stress ratios were determined by measuring the deformation and accumulated deformation. Additionally, mathematical models to estimate the residual strains of the soils were established and verified. The results indicate that the soil strain increment of mucky clay, which increases with the consolidation stress ratio and dynamic stress ratio, is an important parameter for evaluating the leaning pagodas’ stability in soft soil regions when subjected to frequent earthquake. The soil strain increment of paleo-clay, however, is inversely proportional to the consolidation stress ratio and no apparent relationship is found with the dynamic stress ratio. More research needs to be done on the subsidence of paleo-clay."
Nipple Reconstruction with Dorsal Skin Provides Better Projection than Reconstruction with Abdominal or Breast Skin with Cartilage Grafting,"Nipple projection of a modified C–V flap with or without costal cartilage was compared on abdominal, breast, and dorsal skin. A total of 81 patients and 85 sites were studied. The nipple was reconstructed secondarily using a modified C–V flap. Patients were classified by breast mound skin into five groups: dorsal skin without cartilage (group A, n = 18); abdominal skin without cartilage (group B, n = 6); abdominal skin with cartilage (group C, n = 26); breast skin without cartilage (group D, n = 20); and breast skin with cartilage (group E, n = 15). Complications and nipple projection were evaluated over a mean follow-up of 18.5 months; there were no significant differences among the five groups. Minor flap necrosis occurred in 10/18, 0/6, 4/26, 1/20, and 2/15 of groups A, B, C, D, and E, respectively; the percentage was higher in group A than in group D. The average projection maintenance rate (postoperative nipple projection to V flap width) was 76.5, 50.1, 56.1, 46.1, and 52.3% for groups A, B, C, D, and E, respectively; the value in group A was higher than in all other groups. Despite more minor necrosis, the nipple reconstructed with dorsal skin maintained better projection than the nipple reconstructed with abdominal skin or breast skin combined with a cartilage graft."
Omega (Ω) Advancement Flap: A Circular Flap Design for the Aesthetic Closure of Circular Skin Defect,"Most skin defects that require reconstruction with a local skin flap have a circular- or oval-shaped pattern. The majority of the skin flaps are planned in an angled shape. Therefore, it may be necessary to modify the shape of the defect or the distal flap border to minimize tissue distortion. We have designed a circular-shaped advancement flap to be compatible with the circular defect."
"Does Postoperative Erythropoietin Reduce Transfusions and Hemodynamic Instability Following Liposuction, Either Alone or Associated with Abdominoplasty or Mammaplasty? A Comparative, Prospective Study of 50 Consecutive Patients",Erythropoietin (EPO) is a hematopoietic growth factor and an alternative to avoid blood transfusion in high-blood-loss surgeries. We evaluate EPO efficacy to reduce clinically relevant anemia and dehydration in patients undergoing liposuction.
Objective Outcome Measurement After Upper Blepharoplasty: An Analysis of Different Operative Techniques,"Upper blepharoplasty is indicated in Asians for double-eyelid fold creation, periorbital rejuvenation, and functional visual field improvement. This article introduces a technical classification for blepharoplasty methods and investigates approaches to evaluate its outcomes."
Developmental Role of Phenylalanineammonia-Lyase (Pal) and Cinnamate 4-Hydroxylase (C4H) Genes During Adventitious Rooting of Juglans Regia L. Microshoots,"Phenylalanine-ammonia-lyase and cinnamate-4-hydroxylase play important role in the phenylpropanoid pathway, which produces many biologically important secondary metabolites participating in normal plant development. Flavonol quercetin is the main representant of these compounds that has been identified in numerous Juglans spp. In this survey, the developmental expression patterns of PAL and C4H genes during in vitro rooting of two walnut cultivars ‘Sunland’ and ‘Howard’ was examined by RT-PCR. To understand the potential role in rooting, the changing pattern of endogenous content of quercetin was also analyzed by HPLC. The ‘Sunland’ with better capacity to root had more quercetin content during the “inductive phase” of rooting than ‘Howard’. In each cultivar, the level of PAL transcripts showed the same behavior with the changing patterns of quercetin during root formation of microshoots. The positive correlation between the changes of quercetin and PAL-mRNA indicated that PAL gene may have an immediate effect on flavonoid pathway metabolites including quercetin. Although the behavioral change of C4H expression was similar in both cultivars during root formation (with significantly more level for ‘Howard’), it was not coincide with the changes of quercerin concentrations. Our results showed that C4H function is important for the normal development, but its transcriptional regulation does not correlate with quercetin as an efficient phenolic compound for walnut rhizogenesis."
Essential Oil Composition of Sweet Basil (Ocimum Basilicum  L.) in Symbiotic Relationship with Piriformospora Indica and Paclobutrazol Application Under Salt Stress,"Essential oil content and oil composition of paclobutrazol treated sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) plant inoculated with Piriformospora indica under salt stress were investigated by GC-MS. The results show a slight increase in essential oil content when basil plants subjected to moderate salinity stress (3 dS m–1 of NaCl). It decreased significantly with increasing salinity level to 9 dS m–1. The findings revealed that leaf area, above ground and leaf dry weights, essential oil content and yield were significantly affected by P. indica inoculation, however paclobutrazol application significantly influenced essential oil yield but not content. Fungal symbiosis as well as paclobutrazol application ameliorated the negative effects of salinity on dry matter and essential oil yield. The main constituents found in the volatile oil of O. basilicum in control treatment were Geranial (26.03%), Neral (24.88%) and Estragole (24.78%). The compounds concentrations showed some differences in P. indica and paclobutrazol treatments. The results demonstrate that micorrhiza-like fungi concomitantly increase essential oil production and biomass in sweet basil, a medicinal herb rich in commercially valuable essential oils."
Uv-B Radiation Increases Anthocyanin Levels in Cotyledons and Inhibits the Growth of Common Buckwheat Seedlings,"The impact of short-term UV-B treatment on the content of individual flavonoids and photosynthetic pigments in cotyledons and the growth of common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) seedlings was investigated. Seeds of four common buckwheat cultivars were germinated in darkness over a period of 4 days and acclimatized for 2 days under a 16/8 h light/dark photoperiod at 24/18 °C day/night, and exposure to 100–120 μmol ∙ m–2 ∙ s–1 of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Seedlings were divided into three batches, including two batches subjected to different doses of UV-B (5 W ∙ m–2 and 10 W ∙ m–2, one hour per day) for 5 days, and a control group exposed to PAR only. Exposure to UV-B increased anthocyanin levels in the cotyledons of all examined cultivars, it inhibited hypocotyl elongation, but did not affect the content of photosynthetic pigments. Flavone concentrations increased in cv. Red Corolla and Kora, remained constant in cv. Panda and decreased in cv. Hruszowska. Exposure to UV-B decreased rutin levels in cv. Hruszowska, but not in the remaining cultivars. Cultivars Hruszowska, Panda and Kora appeared to be less resistant to UV-B than Red Corolla. Higher resistance to UV-B radiation in Red Corolla can probably be attributed to its higher content of anthocyanins and rutin in comparison with the remaining cultivars."
The effect of working condition on math teacher effectiveness: value-added scores and student satisfaction in teaching,"The purpose of this study is to better understand how math teachers’ effectiveness as measured by value-added scores and student satisfaction with teaching is influenced by school’s working conditions. The data for the study were derived from 2009 to 2010 Teacher Working Condition Survey and Student Perception Survey in Measures of Effective Teaching Project. Using the structural equation modeling and other related methods, several models of teacher effectiveness were estimated. The findings indicate that among the examined working condition factors, support for instruction and for student conduct management have significant effects on teachers’ value-added scores in mathematics. Moreover, the student satisfaction with teaching seems to have a mediating effect on value-added scores. The findings of the study significantly contribute to a better understanding of the effects of working environment on math teachers’ effectiveness and how improvement in working conditions can enhance math teachers’ performance."
Silver nanoparticles and silver ions: Oxidative stress responses and toxicity in potato (Solanum tuberosum L) grown in vitro,"Under in vitro conditions, we examined the effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and silver (Ag) ions on potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) in terms of silver accumulation, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress responses, and antioxidative defense systems. At all concentrations (except at 2 mg•L-1), the amount of Ag in the shoots and roots of Ag ion-treated plantlets was significantly higher than in plantlets treated with AgNPs. In both treatments, total ROS and superoxide anions were increased at concentrations greater than 2 mg•L-1. Damage caused by oxidative stress, such as ion leakage and cell death, was significantly higher in plantlets treated with AgNPs than those treated with Ag ions. Significant increases in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase (GR),were found in both AgNP-treated, and Ag ion-treated plantlets compared to the control. However, in AgNP-treated plantlets, GR activity was significantly decreased at 20 mg•L-1. A significant reduction in glutathione (GSH), ascorbate (ASA), and the ratios of GSH to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and ASA to oxidized ascorbate (DHA)were observed in plantlets treated with both AgNPs and Ag ions at concentrations higher than 2 mg•L-1. Moreover, a greater decrease in GSH and ASA contents was seen in plantlets treated with AgNPs compared to those treated with Ag ions. The present study indicates that both AgNPs and Ag ion treatments impose oxidative stress on potato plantlets under in vitro conditions. Furthermore, based on plantlets’ responses to oxidative damage, the observed alteration in the activities of radical scavenging enzymes and the depletion of GSH and ASA, AgNPs seem to have higher toxicity than the equivalent mass of Ag ions."
Lupinifolin from Derris reticulata possesses bactericidal activity on Staphylococcus aureus by disrupting bacterial cell membrane,"In this study, lupinifolin, a prenylated flavonoid, was isolated from Derris reticulata stem, identified by NMR spectra and confirmed with mass spectrometry. Lupinifolin was freshly prepared by solubilizing in 0.1 N NaOH and immediately diluted in Müller–Hinton broth for antibacterial testing. The data showed that Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to lupinifolin than Gram-negative bacteria. Of four strains of Gram-positive bacteria tested, Staphylococcus aureus was the most susceptible. Using the two-fold microdilution method, it was found that lupinifolin possessed antimicrobial activity against S. aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of 8 and 16 µg/ml, respectively, which is less potent than ampicillin. However, from the time–effect relationship, it was shown that lupinifolin had faster onset than ampicillin. The faster onset of lupinifolin was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. To investigate the mechanism of action of lupinifolin, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed to observe the ultrastructure of S. aureus. The TEM images showed that lupinifolin ruptured the bacterial cell membrane and cell wall. Due to its fast onset, it is suggested that the action of lupinifolin is likely to be the direct disruption of the cell membrane. This hypothesis was substantiated by the data from flow cytometry using DiOC2 as an indicator. The result showed that the red/green ratio which indicated bacterial membrane integrity was significantly decreased, similar to the known protonophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone. It is concluded that lupinifolin inhibits the growth of S. aureus by damaging the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane."
High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I and NT-proBNP as predictors of incident dementia and Alzheimer’s disease: the FINRISK Study,"Cardiac troponin and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are known to associate with incident dementia. The purpose of our study was to examine whether high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-TnI) and NT-proBNP are associated with incident dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) independently of each other. Our study was a part of the national population-based health examination survey, FINRISK 1997, with a total sample of 7114 subjects, including 407 incident dementia cases and 319 AD cases during the follow-up time of 18 years. Using multivariate Cox regression analyses, we calculated the hazard ratios (HR) for hs-TnI and NT-proBNP. Analyses were adjusted for the previously known dementia/AD risk factors, including the apoE genotype. NT-proBNP was independently associated with incident dementia (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.17–1.49) and AD (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.13–1.5). Hs-TnI was also associated with incident dementia (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02–1.23), but not independent of NT-proBNP (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99–1.21). Hs-TnI was not associated with incident AD. The results remained similar in cause-specific Cox regression models and among subjects over 40 years of age. NT-proBNP and hs-TnI improved the reclassification of dementia risk in 10 years follow-up, and hs-TNI also in 18 years of follow-up. Neither hs-TnI nor NT-proBNP was able to outperform each other in risk reclassification of dementia. Both cardiovascular biomarkers, NT-proBNP and hs-TnI, were associated with incident dementia independently of traditional dementia risk factors including the apoE genotype. NT-proBNP was also associated with AD. Both markers offered a better dementia risk reclassification compared with traditional risk factors."
Removal of As(III) from Aqueous Solution Using Fe3O4 Nanoparticles: Process Modeling and Optimization Using Statistical Design,"In this study, Extran (biodegradable surfactant) was used for the preparation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles by microemulsion process to improve removal efficiency of As(III) from aqueous solution. Fe3O4 nanoparticles were characterized by XRD, FTIR, FESEM, TEM, HRTEM, and VSM instrumental techniques. The effect of different parameters such as adsorbent dose, initial As(III) concentration, and solution pH were studied by response surface methodology (RSM) based on Box-Behnken design (BBD). The optimized condition for adsorption of As(III) from aqueous solution was obtained as adsorbent dose of 0.70 mg/g, solution pH of 7.7, and initial As(III) concentration of 33.32 mg/L. In this optimum condition, about 90.5% of As(III) was removed from the aqueous solution. Isotherm studies have been done at optimal condition, and it was observed that the Langmuir isotherm models were fitted well with experimental data having a high correlation coefficient of 0.993. From the Langmuir isotherm data, the maximum adsorption capacity of Fe3O4 nanoparticles was found to be 7.18 mg/g at pH 7.7 in room temperature. This study revealed that Fe3O4 nanoparticles can be used as an efficient, eco-friendly, and effective material for the adsorptive removal of As(III) from aqueous system."
"Determination of temporal and spatial variability of groundwater irrigation quality using geostatistical techniques on the coastal aquifer of Çarşamba Plain, Turkey, from 1990 to 2012","The present study was conducted to investigate variations in groundwater quality parameters between 1990 and 2012, and to assess the suitability of groundwater for irrigation. Groundwater samples were taken in the summers of 1990 and 2012, and hydrochemical characteristics were investigated through Piper and USSL diagrams. The electrical conductivity (EC), sodium percentage (%Na), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), magnesium hazard (MR), potential salinity (PS), and Kelly’s ratios (KI) were used as the indicators for the water quality. Water quality parameters were assessed through geostatistical techniques and geographical information systems. Initially, semivariograms were determined for each water quality index, and spatial distribution maps were created for each sampling period through ordinary kriging techniques. Results revealed excessive increases in EC, Na, and Cl values with time. EC values of groundwater were over 1.25 dS/m in 4.64% of the study area in 1990. The area increased to 37.38% in the year 2012. With regard to the Kelly Index, there were not any problems in the study area in 1990, but problems were encountered over 5.75% of the study area in the year 2012. While the ratio of problematic sites with regard to RSC was 2.44% in 1990, the ratio increased to 12.13% in the year 2012. Similar increases were also observed in other water quality parameters except for MR. Higher deteriorations were observed in water quality parameters through the eastern sections of the study area. From 1990 to 2012, increased deteriorations were observed in water quality parameters, and excessive groundwater withdrawal and resultant seawater intrusion were considered as the basic reasons for such deteriorations. Therefore, groundwater withdrawals along the coastal lines should be performed in a controlled fashion, and water quality should continuously be monitored."
Quantificational effect of reforestation to soil erosion in subtropical monsoon regions with acid red soil by sediment fingerprinting,"Reforestation and afforestation have been implemented over large regions in China for decades, and this has significantly reduced dust storms, desertification and soil/water erosion in China. However, the quantificational evaluation of the reforestation program in China is still incomplete, especially in the southwest China, due to the limitation of survey data. In order to assess the effects of reforestation on soil erosion in southwest China, a subtropical monsoon region with acid red soil, a representative watershed (Dianchi, Yunnan, in southwest China), was selected to study the effect of reforestation on soil erosion over nearly five decades. The land surface soil samples and sedimentary core in this watershed were examined in 2012 to evaluate the soil erosion and sediment deposition during the period of deforestation and reforestation. The results from the multi-source indexes (nutrients, radionuclides, metallic and isotope elements) measurement from soil samples and analyses (composite fingerprinting, remote sensing and geographic information system) indicate that reforestation significantly reduced the presence of sand from surrounding basin via the sedimentary records. Natural forests had the greatest soil conservation capacity, followed by economic forests and farmland, according to a composite fingerprinting. The distribution of total phosphorus, total nitrogen (TN), total organic carbon (TOC) and isotope carbon (δ13CSOC) presents a high consistency to the results of the composite fingerprinting. The loss rate of TN and TOC in farmland is much greater than that in forest. Reforestation will thus increase the storage of TN and TOC in the long term, although this storage is lower than that in farmland during a short time due to the application of fertilizers. The logging of economic forests will significantly increase soil erosion in this region because of low grass coverage. Recommendations include limiting the period of logging in economic forests to periods outside the rainy season and intercropping other kinds of indigenous trees or grasses to reduce soil erosion."
"Vulnerability assessment of urban groundwater resources to nitrate: the case study of Mashhad, Iran","Groundwater vulnerability assessment of urban areas is a challenging task in the fast trend of urbanization around the globe. This study introduces a new approach for modifying well-known parameters of common vulnerability indexes to adjust them for urban areas. The approach is independent of a specific weighting system. The aquifer of Mashhad city, contaminated by domestic wastewater, is selected as a case in this study. In order to evaluate the aquifer vulnerability due to anthropogenic activities, at first, parameters of depth to groundwater, recharge, land use, and soil are modified based on their basic concepts and their influences on contamination attenuation. Then, the modified parameters are used simultaneously in several index methods to investigate the capability of the modified parameters to increase correlation coefficient of all employed index methods with the measured nitrate concentration. Accuracy of the modified methods is evaluated by Spearman nonparametric correlation. It is shown that considering the wastewater discharge into recharge parameter leads to an increase of 20% in correlation coefficient. Also, level difference technique shows that more than 70% of the vulnerable areas are predicted correctly in all utilized methods. The accurate prediction in all employed methods indicates that these modifications are independent of the type of index method. Moreover, sensitivity analysis reveals that the recharge and the land use are both the most significant parameters for evaluating the vulnerability."
Thermo-mechanical vibration of rotating axially functionally graded nonlocal Timoshenko beam,"The free vibration analysis of rotating axially functionally graded nanobeams under an in-plane nonlinear thermal loading is provided for the first time in this paper. The formulations are based on Timoshenko beam theory through Hamilton’s principle. The small-scale effect has been considered using the nonlocal Eringen’s elasticity theory. Then, the governing equations are solved by generalized differential quadrature method. It is supposed that the thermal distribution is considered as nonlinear, material properties are temperature dependent, and the power-law form is the basis of the variation of the material properties through the axial of beam. Free vibration frequencies obtained are cantilever type of boundary conditions. Presented numerical results are validated by comparing the obtained results with the published results in the literature. The influences of the nonlocal small-scale parameter, angular velocity, hub radius, FG index and also thermal effects on the frequencies of the FG nanobeams are investigated in detail."
Small boats as vectors of marine invasion: experimental test of velocity and desiccation as limits,"Secondary transport of introduced species can be important in dispersing potentially invasive species, and vectors of transport are often the fouled hulls of small fishing and recreational boats. Likelihood of transport depends on many factors, including resistance of the species to drag forces due to boat velocity and resistance to desiccation. To experimentally test the importance of drag on transport, we attached plates with a preexisting, 4 months old, assemblage of species, on a boat hull that was then subjected to one of three speeds (5, 15 and 20 knots) for 20 min. We experimentally tested desiccation tolerance with colonized plates that were exposed to the air for 3–132 h, after which they were examined for living organisms. A total of 35 taxa were identified, including introduced species, in southern Brazil: the barnacles Amphibalanus amphitrite, A. reticulatus and the octocoral Stragulum bicolor. In the drag experiment, all species survived transport. In the desiccation experiment, most species survived more than 6 h (fewer species much longer) of exposure to the air. Our results illustrate that a variety of taxa and growth forms can be transported over regional scales at speeds and travel conditions typical of small boats. They can also survive desiccation conditions typical of overland transportation of small boats. Thus, we recommend that additional management mechanisms must be put in place to reduce the probability of invasion due to secondary transport."
Platelet Inhibition in Shunted Infants on Aspirin at Short and Midterm Follow-Up,"There are few data to guide aspirin therapy to prevent shunt thrombosis in infants. We aimed to determine if aspirin administered at conventional dosing in shunted infants resulted in ≥50% arachidonic acid (AA) inhibition in short and midterm follow-up using thromboelastography with platelet mapping (TEG-PM) and to describe bleeding and thrombotic events during follow-up. We performed a prospective observational study of infants on aspirin following Norwood procedure, aortopulmonary shunt alone, or cavopulmonary shunt surgery. We obtained TEG-PM preoperatively, after the third dose of aspirin, at the first postoperative clinic visit, and 2–8 months after surgery. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects with ≥50% AA inhibition on aspirin. All bleeding and thrombotic events were collected. Of 24 infants analyzed, 13% had ≥50% AA inhibition at all designated time points after aspirin initiation; 38% had ≥50% AA inhibition after the third aspirin dose of aspirin, 60% at the first postoperative clinic visit, and 26% 2–8 months after surgery. Bleeding events occurred in eight subjects, and two had a thrombotic event. Bleeding events were associated with greater AA inhibition just prior to starting aspirin (p = 0.02) and after the third dose of aspirin (p = 0.04), and greater ADP inhibition before surgery (p = 0.03). The majority of infants failed to consistently have ≥50% AA inhibition when checked longitudinally postoperatively. Preoperative TEG-PM may be useful in identifying infants at higher risk of bleeding events on aspirin in the early postoperative period. Further research is needed to guide antiplatelet therapy in this population."
"EPR interpretation, magnetism and biological study of a Cu(II) dinuclear complex assisted by a schiff base precursor","A new Cu(II) dinuclear complex, Cu2L2 (1) was afforded employing the potentially pentatentate Schiff base precursor H2L, a refluxed product of o-vanillin and diethylenetriamine in methanol. Complex 1 was systematically characterized by FTIR, UV–Vis, emission and EPR spectrometry. The single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of 1 reveals that the copper atom exhibits a distorted square planar geometry, comprising two pairs of phenolato-O and imine-N donors from two different H2L ligands. The temperature dependent magnetic interpretation agrees with the existence of weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the bridging dinuclear Cu(II) ions. A considerable body of experimental evidence has been accumulated to elucidate the magneto-structural relationship in this dinuclear Cu(II) complex by DFT computation. Both the ligand and complex 1 exhibit anti-mycobacterial activity and considerable efficacy on M. tuberculosis H37Ra (ATCC 25177) and M. tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 25618) strains. The practical applicability of the ligand and complex 1 has been examined in living cells (African Monkey Vero Cells). The MTT assay proves the non-toxicity of the probe up to 100 mg mL−1."
Effects of enamel matrix derivative on non-surgical management of peri-implant mucositis: a double-blind randomized clinical trial,Peri-implant diseases have been recognized as being among the ever-increasing complications related to dental implants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the adjunctive use of enamel matrix derivative (EMD) to mechanical debridement (MD) in patients with these conditions in terms of clinical parameters and cytokine levels of peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF).
Application of a three-dimensional graft of autologous osteodifferentiated adipose stem cells in patients undergoing minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion: clinical proof of concept,The authors applied a scaffold-free osteogenic three-dimensional (3D) graft made of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) in patients undergoing minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MI-TLIF).
Hypomagnesemia and increased risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation in pediatric renal transplant recipients,New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a significant co-morbidity following kidney transplantation. Lower post-transplant serum magnesium levels have been found to be an independent risk factor for NODAT in adult kidney transplant recipients.
Multipliers of Dirichlet series and monomial series expansions of holomorphic functions in infinitely many variables,"Let \({\mathscr {H}}_\infty \) be the set of all ordinary Dirichlet series \(D=\sum _n a_n n^{-s}\) representing bounded holomorphic functions on the right half plane. A completely multiplicative sequence \((b_n)\) of complex numbers is said to be an \(\ell _1\)-multiplier for \({\mathscr {H}}_\infty \) whenever \(\sum _n |a_n b_n| < \infty \) for every \(D \in {\mathscr {H}}_\infty \). We study the problem of describing such sequences \((b_n)\) in terms of the asymptotic decay of the subsequence \((b_{p_j})\), where \(p_j\) denotes the jth prime number. Given a completely multiplicative sequence \(b=(b_n)\) we prove (among other results): b is an \(\ell _1\)-multiplier for \({\mathscr {H}}_\infty \) provided \(|b_{p_j}| < 1\) for all j and \(\overline{\lim }_n \frac{1}{\log n} \sum _{j=1}^n b_{p_j}^{*2} < 1\), and conversely, if b is an \(\ell _1\)-multiplier for \({\mathscr {H}}_\infty \), then \(|b_{p_j}| < 1\) for all j and \(\overline{\lim }_n \frac{1}{\log n} \sum _{j=1}^n b_{p_j}^{*2} \le 1\) (here \(b^*\) stands for the decreasing rearrangement of b). Following an ingenious idea of Harald Bohr it turns out that this problem is intimately related with the question of characterizing those sequences z in the infinite dimensional polydisk \({\mathbb {D}}^\infty \) (the open unit ball of \(\ell _\infty \)) for which every bounded and holomorphic function f on \({\mathbb {D}}^\infty \) has an absolutely convergent monomial series expansion \(\sum _{\alpha } \frac{\partial _\alpha f(0)}{\alpha !} z^\alpha \). Moreover, we study analogous problems in Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series and Hardy spaces of functions on the infinite dimensional polytorus \({\mathbb {T}}^\infty \)."
Relationships between outgoing longwave radiation and diabatic heating in reanalyses,"This study investigates relationships between daily variability in National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), as a proxy for deep convection, and the global diabatic heat budget derived from reanalysis data sets. Results are evaluated based on data from ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA-Interim), Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55) and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA2). The diabatic heating is separated into components linked to ‘physics’ (mainly latent heat fluxes), plus longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) radiative tendencies. Transient variability in deep convection is highly correlated with diabatic heating throughout the troposphere and stratosphere. Correlation patterns and composite analyses show that enhanced deep convection (lower OLR) is linked to amplified heating in the tropical troposphere and in the mid-latitude storm tracks, tied to latent heat release. Enhanced convection is also linked to radiative cooling in the lower stratosphere, due to weaker upwelling LW from lower altitudes. Enhanced transient deep convection increases LW and decreases SW radiation in the lower troposphere, with opposite effects in the mid to upper troposphere. The compensating effects in LW and SW radiation are largely linked to variations in cloud fraction and water content (vapor, liquid and ice). These radiative balances in reanalyses are in agreement with idealized calculations using a column radiative transfer model. The overall relationships between OLR and diabatic heating are robust among the different reanalyses, although there are differences in radiative tendencies in the tropics due to large differences of cloud water and ice content among the reanalyses. These calculations provide a simple statistical method to quantify variations in diabatic heating linked to transient deep convection in the climate system."
Recreational soccer training improves heart-rate variability indices and physical performance in untrained healthy adolescent,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of soccer training on short-term heart-rate variability, blood pressure, and physical fitness in untrained healthy adolescents. Twenty-two adolescent boys took part in this study: 11 boys were randomly assigned to participate in an 8-week soccer training and 11 boys served as a control group. Soccer exhibited significant increases in high-frequency power (difference 52.9%, P = 0.03, effect size: ES = 1.2), root mean squared of the standard deviation rMSSD (10.8%, P = 0.02, ES = 1), and a significant decrease in sympathetic activity LF (26.3%, P = 0.004, ES = 1.4). The control group showed an increase in rMSSD (9.4%, P = 0.05, ES = 1). The soccer group showed increases in estimated aerobic fitness (30.9%, P = 0.001, ES = 1.50) and 20-m sprint performance (4.1%, P = 0.004, ES = 0.8) with a trend to an improvement in horizontal jumping (3.8%, P = 0.15, ES = 0.8). In conclusion, soccer-based training improved measures of both physical fitness and autonomic function making soccer an effective training strategy for improving health-related fitness measures in untrained adolescents."
Increased morbidity and mortality in cardiac patients undergoing fundoplication,"Infants with congenital cardiac disease (CCD) often require gastrostomy tube placement (GT) and need antireflux procedures, such as fundoplications. Our purpose was to compare morbidity/mortality rates among infants with CCD undergoing GT, fundoplication, or both."
Development of a PCR-free DNA-based assay for the specific detection of Vibrio species in environmental samples by targeting the 16S rRNA,"A novel PCR-free DNA-based assay was developed for the detection of Vibrio spp. A sandwich hybridization format using an immobilized capture probe and a labeled signal probe was selected and combined with chemiluminescent method for the detection of the RNA target. In a first step, probes were validated using positive controls (PCs). A linearity was observed between 0.1 and 2.5 nM of PC, and detection limit was determined as 0.1 nM. In a second step, specificity was checked by using RNA extracted from a panel of 31 environmental bacterial strains. Detection limit of 5 ng μL−1 of total fragmented RNA was obtained, and the assay allowed a good discrimination between the 21 Vibrio and the 10 non-Vibrio strains tested. Finally, the DNA-based assay was successfully applied to analysis of spiked and natural environmental samples. Stability and analysis time of the DNA-based assay were also investigated to optimize working conditions. We demonstrated that microplates can be coated beforehand with capture probe and stored at 4 °C without any buffer in wells for at least 30 days. The use of the pre-made plates enables the assay to be completed in 2 h. The developed assay appeared as an interesting tool to determine the presence of bacteria in environmental samples."
The influence of maternal exposure history to virus and medicine during pregnancy on congenital heart defects of fetus,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect. It is due to dysfunction of the heart and great vessels during embryo development stage, or the channel was not closed after birth. This study focuses on investigating the influence of virus infection and medicine history during pregnancy on the incidence rate of CHD of fetus. We conducted a retrospective birth cohort study of infant born in the maternal and child health hospital of Fanyu district in Guangzhou. Five thousand three hundred eighty one cases with complete medical records, including mothers, fathers, and infants, were enrolled. The exposure history of mothers to virus and medicine from 6 months before pregnancy to prenatal examination was investigated, including mflu, mumps, measles, rubella, chickenpox, and hepatitis and antibiotics, tocolytic agent, anticonvulsants, antipyretic and analgesic, antitumor drug, folic acid supplement, and contraceptive. The relationship between virus infection and medicine history during pregnancy and CHD was analyzed. There was statistical difference between a normal group and a defected group in influenza infection and tocolytic agent and contraceptive pill. The exposure history to influenza and medicines, such as tocolytic agent and contraceptive pill, during pregnancy influenced the incidence rate of CHD of fetus."
Elemental content of mosses and lichens from Livingston Island (Antarctica) as determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA),"The total content of 8 major and 32 trace elements in four species of mosses and two of lichens as well as neighboring soil and rocks collected from different places of the Livingston Island Antarctica was determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis. The main goals of the project consisted of evidencing the possible trace of anthropogenic contamination as well as the influence of altitude on the distribution of considered elements. In the absence of a unanimously accepted descriptor, enrichment factor, geo-accumulation, and pollution load indices with respect to soil and rocks were used. The data, interpreted within the model of a reference plant, were compared with previous studies regarding the same organisms in similar geographic and climatological areas. The experimental results evidenced different capacity of mosses and lichens to retain the considered elements, but within experimental uncertainties, no traces of anthropogenic pollution were found. At the same time, it was found that the content of most of the elements decreased with the altitude."
Alkyl amine and vegetable oil mixture—a viable candidate for CO2 capture and utilization,"In this present work, the absorption of CO2 in alkyl amines and vegetable oil mixture has been evaluated. The results showed that the absorption is higher in alkyl amines and vegetable oil mixture compared with the aqueous alkyl amines. In addition to that, by employing the greener and non-toxic vegetable oil media, the CO2 gas has been captured as well as converted into value-added products, such as carbamates of ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, and triethylenetetramine. The carbamates have been isolated and characterized by Fourier transform infrared and 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic techniques. The formation of these products in precipitate form has not been observed in the case of aqueous medium. Among the various alkyl amine and vegetable oil combinations, triethylenetetramine in coconut oil medium showed the maximum CO2 capture capacity of 72%. The coconut oil used for the process has been recovered, recycled, and reused for 3 cycles. Thus, this novel scheme seems to be a better alternative to conquer the drawback of aqueous amine-based CO2 capture as well as for the capture and utilization of the CO2 gas to gain the value-added products."
Nano silver-embedded electrospun nanofiber of poly(4-chloro-3-methylphenyl methacrylate): use as water sanitizer,"Water contaminated with microorganisms causes numerous diseases and is a major concern for public health. In search of a simple material which can provide clean water free from pathogens, nanofibers of poly(4-chloro-3-methylphenyl methacrylate, abbreviated as CMPMA, and nano Ag-doped poly(CMPMA) composite nanofibers were used to decontaminate water from microorganisms such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provide the diameters of the Ag nanoparticles which are in the range 18–21 and 13–18 nm. The diameter of the poly(CMPMA) and nano Ag-doped poly(CMPMA) composite nanofiber is seen to vary between 400 and 700 nm with the change of the processing parameters. Optimum parameters for uniform nanofibers have been obtained. The morphology of the fibers is derived from scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The superiority of the nano Ag-doped poly(CMPMA) composite nanofiber was established."
Statistical binary patterns and post-competitive representation for pattern recognition,"During the last decade, sparse representations have been successfully applied to design high-performing classification algorithms such as the classical sparse representation based classification (SRC) algorithm. More recently, collaborative representation based classification (CRC) has emerged as a very powerful approach, especially for face recognition. CRC takes advantage of SRC through the notion of collaborative representation, relying on the observation that the collaborative property is more crucial for classification than the l
1-norm sparsity constraint on coding coefficients used in SRC. This paper follows the same general philosophy of CRC and its main novelty is the application of a virtual collaborative projection (VCP) routine designed to train images of every class against the other classes to improve fidelity before the projection of the query image. We combine this routine with a method of local feature extraction based on high-order statistical moments to further improve the representation. We demonstrate using extensive experiments of face recognition and classification that our approach performs very competitively with respect to state-of-the-art classification methods. For instance, using the AR face dataset, our method reaches 100% of accuracy for dimensionality 300."

Here, the relationship between lateral displacement of the mandible and scoliosis was analysed quantitatively."
Burst inflation test for measuring biomechanical properties of rat abdominal walls,Evaluation of potential grafts to improve upon current strategies for abdominal wall (AW) repair in small animal models typically involves mechanical testing using methods that currently are inadequate to assess physiologically relevant parameters. This study introduces burst inflation testing as a more relevant assessment of the mechanical integrity of the AW compared to traditional tensile testing.
Wind differentiates reproduction in the non-expansive Black Tern Chlidonias niger and the expansive White-winged Tern Chlidonias leucopterus,"Identifying the key factors governing the expansion of a species’ range is difficult because of the multiple interactions of environmental and biological factors. Among the biological factors are breeding parameters, which at the edge of a species’ range may indicate the traits involved in limiting species distribution. To evaluate whether the hatching success of two sympatric species of terns was dependent on weather parameters, a study was carried out in the valley of the River Bug in eastern Poland. During 2007–2010, nine colonies with 113 clutches of White-winged Tern (CHL, an expansive species, new to the region since 1997) and 92 clutches of Black Tern (CHN, a non-expansive species, nesting in stable numbers in this region for many years) were monitored. CHN arrived on average 9 days earlier than CHL. While CHN arrived in east-central Poland earlier and earlier during the 1998–2013 period, no such trend was recorded for CHL. The clutch initiation median in CHL was 8 days later than in CHN. The hatching success of CHL was statistically less than that of CHN (41.6 vs. 69.6%). A general discriminant analysis model showed that successful CHL clutches depended on the maximum daytime wind speed (strong winds can be disastrous for breeding terns), colony identity and clutch initiation date. In the case of CHN, none of these factors had a statistically significant influence on hatching success, although the clutch initiation date was very close to being significant. These results suggest that a species which nested in the same location for a long time in relation to ambient weather conditions has higher hatching success than the one which is in the process of expanding its distribution range."

Design of efficient power amplifier for low power transmitters,"This paper presents a fully integrated, low transmit-power and high-efficiency 2.4 GHz class-E power amplifier (PA) in TSMC 0.18 μm CMOS process for low-power transmitters such as wireless sensor networks (WSN). In this paper, a new output load has been proposed. Also, analytical design equations have been included to design an efficient low power circuit. This PA, employs the pad capacitance and bond-wire inductance of the output node, for satisfying class-E zero-voltage switching (ZVS) condition and matching the antenna’s 50 Ω resistance. By using bond-wire inductance instead of inductor in the output filter, smaller chip size and higher efficiency has been achieved compared to other works for low transmit-power applications. Also, the effectiveness of bulk-drive technique on faster switching and increasing efficiency have been evaluated. It has been proved that this technique leads to increase the efficiency of switching PAs. This PA delivers a range of output power from 2.7 to 7.2 dBm with a supply voltage range from 500 to 850 mV while achieving overall power efficiency range of 57.3–60.7%."
Microbiote et plantes (Partie 1) : introduction et application pratique aux maladies inflammatoires chroniques de l’intestin (MICI),"Le microbiote est un ensemble de microorganismes qui impactent la santé. Du fait de son action de fermentation des fibres et de son rôle dans le métabolisme, notamment celui des polyphénols, il est susceptible d’interférer favorablement dans une approche alternative ou complémentaire du traitement des MICI."
Expression of Talaromyces thermophilus lipase gene in Trichoderma reesei by homologous recombination at the cbh1 locus,"CBH1 (cellobiohydrolase) comprises the majority of secreted proteins by Trichoderma reesei. For expression of Talaromyces thermophilus lipase gene in T. reesei, a self-designed CBH1 promoter was applied to drive the lipase gene expression cassette which was bracketed by flanking sequences of cbh1 gene for homologous recombination. Protoplast and Agrobacterium-mediated plasmid transformations were performed and compared, resultantly, transformation mediated by Agrobacterium was overall proved to be more efficient. Stable integration of lipase gene into chromosomal DNA of T. reesei transformants was verified by PCR. After shaking flask fermentation, lipase activity of transformant reached 375 IU mL−1, whereas no cellobiohydrolase activity was detected. SDS-PAGE analysis further showed an obvious protein band about 39 kDa and no CBH1 band in fermentation broth, implying lipase gene was successfully extracellularly expressed in T. reesei via homologous recombination at cbh1 locus. This study herein would benefit genetic engineering of filamentous fungi and industrial application of thermo-alkaline lipase like in paper making and detergents addition."
Hepatobilio-pancreatic robotic surgery: initial experience from a single center institute,"The use of robotic surgery in the hepatobilio-pancreatic (HBP) field is still limited. Our aim is to present our early experience of robotic liver resection. A retrospective review of robotic pancreatic and liver resection was performed at Sanchinarro University hospital from October 2010 to April 2016. Since the beginning of the robotic program in our center, 22 hepatic procedures and 45 pancreatic robotic procedures have been performed. Of the 21 patients subjected to liver resection, 13 (65%) were for malignancy. There were two left hepatectomies, one right hepatectomy, one associated liver partition and portal vein ligation staged procedure (both steps by robotic approach), three bisegmentectomies and three segmentectomies, eight wedge resections, and three pericystectomies. The mean operating time was 282 min. The overall conversion rate and postoperative complication rate were 4.7 and 19%, respectively. The mean length of hospital stay was 13.4 days (range 4–64 days). Of the 45 patients subjected to pancreatic resection, 22 were male and 23 female. The average age of all patients was 62 years (range 31–82 years). The mean operating room (OR) time was 370 min (120–780 min). Among the procedures performed were 15 pancreatico-duodenectomies, 19 distal pancreatectomies, and 11 enucleations. All procedures in the HBP area were R0. Our early experience shows that robotic surgery is a safe and feasible procedure in the HBP area. The complication and mortality rates are comparable to those of open surgery, but with the advantages of minimally invasive surgery."
Degradation of ortho-toluidine from aqueous solution by the TiO2/O3 process,"In this work, the degradation and mineralization of ortho-toluidine (OT) that is one of the constituents of petrochemical wastewater was investigated by the TiO2/O3 process. The influence of some operational parameters such as concentration of pollutant (30–90 mg L−1), initial pH and amounts of TiO2 was investigated. A radical mechanism with the formation of an anion radical superoxide radical prior to hydroxyl radical is suggested for describing the interaction between ozone and TiO2. These results were not similar to the ozonation process alone, in which higher pH had a positive effect on the removal of OT because of the generation of hydroxyl radicals. In optimum pH for the ozonation and O3/TiO2 processes, the degradation efficiency of the OT was 89.5 and 96%, respectively, at 60 min of reaction. Furthermore, it was made clear that in catalytic ozonation, the degradation efficiency of the OT was higher at neutral pH conditions (pH = 7). The removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was increased from 47.5% (only ozonation) to 73% (O3/TiO2) after 90 min of reaction. The kinetics of degradation was pseudo-first order; the degradation and relative mineralization of the OT were calculated by HPLC and COD tests, respectively."
On the complete width and edge clique cover problems,"A complete graph is the graph in which every two vertices are adjacent. For a graph \(G=(V,E)\), the complete width of G is the minimum k such that there exist k independent sets \(\mathtt {N}_i\subseteq V\), \(1\le i\le k\), such that the graph \(G'\) obtained from G by adding some new edges between certain vertices inside the sets \(\mathtt {N}_i\), \(1\le i\le k\), is a complete graph. The complete width problem is to decide whether the complete width of a given graph is at most k or not. In this paper we study the complete width problem. We show that the complete width problem is NP-complete on \(3K_2\)-free bipartite graphs and polynomially solvable on \(2K_2\)-free bipartite graphs and on \((2K_2,C_4)\)-free graphs. As a by-product, we obtain the following new results: the edge clique cover problem is NP-complete on \(\overline{3K_2}\)-free co-bipartite graphs and polynomially solvable on \(C_4\)-free co-bipartite graphs and on \((2K_2, C_4)\)-free graphs. We also give a characterization for k-probe complete graphs which implies that the complete width problem admits a kernel of at most \(2^k\) vertices. This provides another proof for the known fact that the edge clique cover problem admits a kernel of at most \(2^k\) vertices. Finally we determine all graphs of small complete width \(k\le 3\)."
The effects of dosage and the routes of administrations of streptozotocin and alloxan on induction rate of typel diabetes mellitus and mortality rate in rats,"The approach and novelty of this scientific work was to formulate the appropriate Streptozotocin (STZ) and Alloxan dosage in different routes of administration to imply minimum mortality rate and high incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in the rat experiment model. Rats were randomly divided into STZ, Alloxan and control groups. 1-Alloxan group was divided into two subgroups: intraperitoneal (ip) subgroups which received a single dose of, 140, 120, 100 and 80 mg/kg; and the subcutaneous (sc) subgroups which received a single dose of, 120, 110, 100, 90, and 80 mg/kg. 2-STZ group was divided into four subgroups of ip route. The ip subgroup which received intraperitoneally a single dose of, 30, 35, 40 and 50 mg/kg. 3-The control group: This group received solo distilled water. The injection day was considered as the day zero. Blood glucose levels and mortality rate were recorded. Subsequently, 30 days after, the logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate the effect of the explanatory variables, the dose levels, and route approaches, on the probability of DM incidence, and mortality. According to the statistical logistic analysis for Alloxan, it is concluded that the minimum dosage needed to induce DM was 120 mg/kg by sc method (probability 0.712). In addition, the logistic analysis for STZ showed that the optimal dose-level for STZ was 40 mg/kg with ip with approximate induction of DM probability 0.764. Based on the data, male Wistar rats in which received a single dosage of Alloxan by sc injection at dose of 120 mg/kg showed the most desirable result of induction of type I DM; furthermore, those in which received STZ by ip injection at the dose of 40 mg/kg developed a persistent and optimal DM state characterized by high rate of DM induction and low- level of mortality."
Characterization the response of Korl:ICR mice to loperamide induced constipation,"Animal models of constipation induced with drugs and diet have been widely employed to investigate therapeutic effects and the action mechanism of drugs against this disease. ICR mice were selected to produce this disease model through oral administration of loperamide (Lop), even though SD rats are commonly utilized in studies of constipation. To compare the responses of ICR mice obtained from three different sources to constipation inducers, alterations in stool number, histopathological structure, mucin secretion and opioid-receptor downstream signaling pathway were measured in KorhlCR (Korea FDA source), A:ICR (USA source) and B:ICR (Japan source) injected with low and high concentrations of Lop (LoLop and HiLop). The number, weight and moisture content of stools decreased significantly in the Lop treated group of all ICR relative to the Vehicle treated group. Additionally, decreased mucosa layer thickness, muscle thickness, and mucin secretion were observed in the transverse colon of Lop treated ICR mice, while a similar number of goblet cells and crypt of lieberkuhn were detected in the same group. Furthermore, a similar change in the level of Ca expression and PKC phosphorylation was detected in the Lop treated group relative to the vehicle treated group, while some differences in the change pattern were observed in the B:ICR group. Therefore, these results of the present study provide strong additional evidence that KorhlCR, A:ICR and B:ICR derived from different sources have a similar overall response to constipation induced by Lop injection, although there were a few differences in the magnitude of their responses."
Anti-Helicobacter pylori activity of crude N-acetylneuraminic acid isolated from glycomacropeptide of whey,"Helicobacter pylori colonizes the gastric mucosa of about half of the world’s population, causing chronic gastritis and gastric cancer. An increasing emergence of antibiotic-resistant H. pylori arouses demand on alternative non-antibiotic-based therapies. In this study, we freshly prepared crude N-acetylneuraminic acid obtained from glycomacropeptide (G-NANA) of whey through a neuraminidase-mediated reaction and evaluated its antibacterial ability against H. pylori and H. felis. Overnight cultures of the H. pylori were diluted with fresh media and different concentrations (1-150 mg/mL) of crude G-NANA were added directly to the culture tube. Bacterial growth was evaluated by measuring the optical density of the culture medium and the number of viable bacteria was determined by a direct count of the colony forming units (CFU) on agar plates. For the in vivo study, mice were orally infected with 100 μL (5×108 cfu/mL) of H. felis four times at a day’s interval, accompanied by a daily administration of crude G-NANA or vehicle. A day after the last infection, the mice were daily administered the crude G-NANA (0, 75, and 300 mg/mL) for 10 days and euthanized. Their stomachs were collected and bacterial colonization was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Crude G-NANA inhibited H. pylori’s growth and reduced the number of viable bacteria in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, crude G-NANA inhibited bacterial colonization in the mice. These results showed that crude G-NANA has antibacterial activity against Helicobacter and demonstrated its therapeutic potential for the prevention of chronic gastritis and gastric carcinogenesis induced by Helicobacter infection in humans."
Fermented Pueraria Lobata extract ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and recovering intestinal barrier function,"Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder occurring in the gastrointestinal track. However, the efficacy of current therapeutic strategies has been limited and accompanied by side effects. In order to eliminate the limitations, herbal medicines have recently been developed for treatment of IBD. Peuraria Lobata (Peuraria L.) is one of the traditional herbal medicines that have anti-inflammatory effects. Bioavailability of Peuraria L., which is rich in isoflavones, is lower than that of their fermented forms. In this study, we generated fermented Peuraria L. extracts (fPue) and investigated the role of fPue in inflammation and intestinal barrier function in vitro and in vivo. As the mice or intestinal epithelial cells were treated with DSS/fPue, mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was reduced and the architecture and expression of tight junction proteins were recovered, compared to the DSS-treated group. In summary, fPue treatment resulted in amelioration of DSS-induced inflammation in the colon, and the disrupted intestinal barrier was recovered as the expression and architecture of tight junction proteins were retrieved. These results suggest that use of fPue could be a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of IBD."
Cardiopulmonary effects of thiopental versus propofol as an induction agent prior to isoflurane anesthesia in chair trained rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta),"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of thiopental versus propofol on cardiopulmonary functions, when used as an induction agent prior to isoflurane anesthesia in rhesus monkeys. Eight healthy rhesus monkeys weighing 3.72 to 5.7 kg, 4-5 years old, were used in the study. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental or propofol intravenous injection, and then maintained with isoflurane in oxygen for 45 minutes. Cardiopulmonary measurements were obtained before and 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after induction. The induction doses of thiopental and propofol were 19.41±0.54 and 9.33±1.02 mg/kg, respectively. In both groups, the values of heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, systolic blood pressure, mean blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pH, and lactate were decreased, while the values of partial pressure of carbon dioxide, partial pressure of oxygen, total carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, oxygen saturation, and base excess in the extracellular fluid were increased, as compared with baseline. Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in thiopental group compare to propofol group. Induction time was very short in both agents but not revealed a significant difference between both groups. However, recovery time was extremely faster in the propofol group. Our results demonstrated that propofol provides a minor suppression in systolic arterial blood pressure than thiopental sodium. In addition, propofol have a fast recovery effect from the anesthesia as well. Furthermore, it is suggested that thiopental sodium could also be used to induce anesthesia instead of propofol, despite slight more suppression of cardiopulmonary function compared to thiopental sodium."
Establishment of a mouse model of 70% lethal dose by total-body irradiation,"Whereas increasing concerns about radiation exposure to nuclear disasters or side effects of anticancer radiotherapy, relatively little research for radiation damages or remedy has been done. The purpose of this study was to establish level of LD70/30 (a lethal dose for 70% of mice within 30 days) by total-body γ irradiation (TBI) in a mouse model. For this purpose, at first, 8-week-old male ICR and C57BL/6N mice from A and B companies were received high dose (10, 11, 12 Gy) TBI. After irradiation, the body weight and survival rate were monitored for 30 days consecutively. In next experiment, 5-week-old male ICR and C57BL/6N mice from B company were received same dose irradiation. Results showed that survival rate and body weight change rate in inbred C57BL/6N mice were similar between A and B company. In ICR mice, however, survival rate and body weight change rate were completely different among the companies. Significant difference of survival rate both ICR and C57BL6N mice was not observed in between 5-week-old and 8-week-old groups receiving 10 or 12 Gy TBI. Our results indicate that the strain and age of mice, and even purchasing company (especially outbred), should be matched over experimental groups in TBI experiment. Based on our results, 8-week-old male ICR mice from B company subjected to 12 Gy of TBI showed LD70/30 and suitable as a mouse model for further development of new drug using the ideal total-body irradiation model."
Antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects of fermented red ginseng against high fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia in rats,"This study was performed to investigate the antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects of fermented red ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer; FRG) on high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups of seven: normal control, NC; high-fat diet control, HFC; high-fat diet— 0.5% FRG, HF-FRGL; and high-fat diet-1% FRG, HF-FRGH. All rats were fed a high-fat diet for eight weeks, except those in the NC group, while rats in the FRC treatment groups received drinking water containing 0.5% or 1% FRG. After eight weeks of treatment, levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) in the serum were measured. The concentration of the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA), and activity of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (CSH-Px) in rat liver were evaluated. Histological analysis of the liver was performed using hematoxylin and eosin. The high-fat diet markedly increased serum levels of ALT, AST, TC, TG, and LDL-C and hepatic MDA levels, while administration of FRC to the hyperlipidemic rats resulted in a significant decline in the levels of these parameters. Furthermore, the decline in the levels of serum HDL-C and hepatic SOD, CAT, and CSH-Px induced by the high-fat diet was attenuated by FRG treatment. In addition, histopathological analysis of liver sections suggested that FRG treatment also provided protection against liver damage. These results suggested that FRG improved lipid profiles, inhibited lipid peroxidation, and played a protective role against liver injury in hyperlipidemic rats."
Establishment of a surgically induced cryptorchidism canine recipient model for spermatogonial stem cell transplantation,"Transplantation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) in experimental animal models has been used to study germ line stem cell biology and to produce transgenic animals. The species-specific recipient model preparation is important for the characterization of SSCs and the production of offspring. Here, we investigated the effects of surgically induced cryptorchidism in dog as a new recipient model for spermatogonial stem cell transplantation. Artificially unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism was induced in ten mature male dogs by surgically returning the testis and epididymis to the abdominal cavity. The testes and epididymides were collected every week after the induction of artificial cryptorchidism (surgery) for one month. To determine the effect of surgical cryptorchidism, the seminiferous tubule diameter was measured and immunohistochemistry using PGP9.5 and GATA4 antibodies was analyzed. The diameters of the seminiferous tubules of abdominal testes were significantly reduced compared to those of the scrotal testes. Immunohistochemistry results showed that PGP9.5 positive undifferentiated spermatogonia were significantly reduced after surgical cryptorchidism induction, but there were no significant changes in GATA-4 positive sertoli cells. To evaluate the testis function recovery rate, orchiopexy was performed on two dogs after 30 days of bilateral cryptorchidism. In the orchiopexy group, SCP3 positive spermatocytes were detected, and spermatogenesis was recovered 8 weeks after orchiopexy. In this study, we provided optimum experimental conditions and time for surgical preparation of a recipient canine model for SSC transplantation. Additionally, our data will contribute to recipient preparation by using surgically induced cryptorchidism in non-rodent species."
"Sirtuin-2 inhibition affects hippocampal functions and sodium butyrate ameliorates the reduction in novel object memory, cell proliferation, and neuroblast differentiation","We investigated the effects of the sirtuin-2 (SIRT2) inhibitor AK-7 on novel object memory, cell proliferation, and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus. In addition, we also observed the relationships with sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, on the hippocampal functions. To investigate the effects of AK-7 on hippocampal functions, 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice were daily injected intraperitoneally with 20 mg/kg AK-7 alone or in combination with subcutaneous administration of 300 mg/kg sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, for 21 days. A novel object recognition test was conducted on days 20 (training) and 21 (testing) of treatment. Thereafter, the animals were sacrificed for immunohistochemistry for Ki67 (cell proliferation) and doublecortin (DCX, neuroblast differentiation). AK-7 administration significantly reduced the time spent exploring new objects, while treatment in combination with sodium butyrate significantly alleviated this reduction. Additionally, AK-7 administration significantly reduced the number of Ki67-positive cells and DCX-immunoreactive neuroblasts in the dentate gyrus, while the treatment in combination with sodium butyrate ameliorated these changes. This result suggests that the reduction of SIRT2 may be closely related to age-related phenotypes including novel object memory, as well as cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus. In addition, sodium butyrate reverses SIRT2-related age phenotypes."
Overexpression of N141I PS2 increases γ-secretase activity through up-regulation of Presenilin and Pen-2 in brain mitochondria of NSE/hPS2m transgenic mice,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is known to induce alterations of mitochondrial function such as elevation of oxidative stress and activation of apopotosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of human Presenilin 2 mutant (hPS2m) overexpression on the γ-secretase complex in the mitochondrial fraction. To achieve this, alterations of γ-secretase complex expression and activity were detected in the mitochondrial fraction derived from brains of NSE/hPS2m Tg mice and Non-Tg mice. Herein, the following were observed: i) overexpression of the hPS2m gene significantly up-regulated the deposition of Aβ-42 peptides in the hippocampus and cortex of brain, ii) overexpression of hPS2m protein induced alterations of γ-secretase components such as main component protein and activator protein but not stabilization-related proteins, iii) changes in γ-secretase components induced by overexpression of hPS2m protein up-regulated γ-secretase activity in the mitochondrial fraction, and iv) elevation of γ-secretase activity induced production of Aβ-42 peptides in the mitochondrial fraction. Based on these observations, these results indicate that alteration of γ-secretase activity in cells upon overexpression of hPS2m is tightly linked to mitochondrial dysfunction under the specific physiological and pathological conditions of AD."
Unconstrained face detection: a Deep learning and Machine learning combined approach,"In uncontrolled environment the faces present multiple challenges. The primary challenges are occlusion, pose and illumination variation. In such cases it becomes difficult to detect faces for further processing. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a bio-inspired network that learns the way human brain learns. CNN offers deep observation of features present in input image. This paper presents the combined approach to detect faces using deep features extracted by deep CNN and the classification by Cubic Support vector Machine. Area based approach is used for removal of distant faces and background pixels to reduce the processing time required per frame at detection stage."
Impact of red blood cell transfusion on acute coronary syndrome: a meta-analysis,"The impact of red blood cell transfusion on outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome is controversial. Pubmed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies of red blood cell transfusion and acute coronary syndrome that were published in any language, from January 1, 1966, to April 1, 2016. We analyzed 17 observational studies, of 2,525,550 subjects. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of studies assessing the association between blood transfusion and the risk for all-cause mortality and reinfarction. The search yielded 17 observational studies, of 2,525,550 subjects, during a study follow-up period, ranging from 30 days to 5 years. Red blood cell transfusion compared with no blood transfusion is associated with higher short- and long-term all-cause mortality as well as reinfarction rates (adjusted RR 2.23; 95% CI 1.47–3.39; HR 1.93; 95% CI 1.12–3.34; RR 2.61; 95% CI 2.17–3.14, respectively). In hemoglobin-stratified analyses, a graded association between red blood cell transfusion and mortality was observed, transfusion and risk of all-cause mortality was borderline significant at hemoglobin levels below 8.0 g/dL (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.25–1.06), and was associated with an increased risk of mortality at a hemoglobin above 10 g/dL (RR 3.34; 95% CI 2.25–4.97). Red blood cell transfusion was associated with an increased risk of short- and long-term mortality as well as myocardial reinfarction. However, transfusion appeared to have beneficial or neutral effects on mortality at hemoglobin levels below 8.0 g/dL, and harmful effects above 10 g/dL. A large definitive randomized controlled trial addressing this issue is urgently required."
Peptaibol Profiles of Iranian Trichoderma Isolates,"Five Iranian Trichoderma isolates from species T. viride, T. viridescens, T. asperellum, T. longibrachiatum and T. citrinoviride–selected from the Fungal Collection of the Bu Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Iran–were investigated for their peptaibol production. All examined isolates showed remarkable antibacterial activities during the screening of their extracts for peptaibol content with a Micrococcus luteus test culture. HPLC-ESI-IT MS was used for identification and elucidation of the amino acid sequences of peptaibols. The detected peptaibol compounds contain 20 or 18 amino acid residues and belong to the trichobrachin and trichotoxin groups of peptaibols, respectively. T. longibrachiatum and T. citrinoviride produced trichobrachins, while trichotoxins could be detected in T. viride, T. viridescens and T. asperellum. Out of 37 sequences detetermined, 26 proved to be new, yet undescribed compounds, while others were identified as previously reported trichotoxins (trichotoxin A-50s and T5D2) and trichobrachins (longibrachins AI, AII, AIII, BII and BIII). Compounds within the two groups of detected peptaibols differed from each other only by a single or just a few amino acid changes."
NADPH-Diaphorase Histochemistry Selectively Stains Peripheral and Central Sensory Structures of Lumbricid Earthworms,"By means of whole mount NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry the distribution pattern of primary sensory cells (PSC) and the pathway of their central processes in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) ganglia were investigated in the lumbricid earthworms, Eisenia fetida and Lumbricus terrestris. The distribution pattern of the stained structures seemed to be the same in both species investigated. Strong labelling occurred in sensory fibre branches of segmental nerves and in each of the sensory longitudinal axon bundles of VNC ganglia. Based on their anatomical location some NADPH-d positive central sensory cells were identified from among which the putative tactile receptors were characterized by constant, strong staining."
A novel forest state assessment methodology to support conservation and forest management planning,"A new forest state assessment methodology to complement existing conservation and forestry data has been developed. The aim is to provide tools for strategic planning including spatial distribution of conservation priorities. The method is point-based using a dense systematic sampling grid and provides more detailed information than vegetation maps or forest subcompartment descriptions, but requires less effort than forest inventories. Indicators include canopy composition and structure, deadwood, herbs, microhabitats, disturbances, shrubs and regeneration. The results can inform managers about the structural and compositional diversity of forest stands in the form of thematic maps and can provide the basis for analysis of habitat suitability for forest-dwelling organisms. A smartphone application has been developed to enable electronic data collection. PostGIS and Python scripts were used in the data flow. In this paper, we outline the development of the assessment protocol, and present the sampling design and the variables recorded. The main advantages of the survey methodology are also shown by case-studies based on data collected during the first field season in 2014. The protocol has been designed for low mountain forests in Hungary, but it can be modified to fit other forest types."
Environmental change over 28 years in a subtropical salt marsh: optimal classification and pictures from the exposition,"We examine monitoring data for 28 years of change in a sub-tropical salt marsh where the hydrology had been minimally modified for mosquito control. This extends the work previously published in 2002 for 14 years of data, analysed by Mike Dale (Dale and Dale 2002 Community Ecol. 3: 19–29). The Minimum Message Length method was used in an unsupervised classification to determine the optimum classes, based on the characteristics of the two dominant plant species: Sporobolus virginicus and Sarcocornia quinqueflora. A question at that time was whether the observed changes were only those of state (or condition) or if they were associated with a change in the underlying saltmarsh processes (dynamics). In the 28-year analysis we have been able to address this issue. The classes were generally similar to those in the 2002 analysis. However, class extinctions occurred over the 28 years and only four classes remained: three were stands of Sporobolus and the other was bare mud. The latter, with mangrove pneumatophores, represented the encroachment of Avicennia mangroves into salt marsh. We suggest that the class extinctions and the final loss of most of the plants represent a change in the processes operating in the marsh. The observed changes may be related to sea level and/or climate changes but future research would be needed to assess this"
Coleoptera assemblages of pine forests depends on the distance to the source of nitrogen pollution,"The paper analyzed the changes of beetle assemblages in the litter layer of eutrophic pine forests in the zone polluted by a nitrogen fertilizer plant Joint Stock Company “Achema” (Lithuania). We hypothesized that abundance, diversity and life traits of beetle assemblages depend on the distance from the pollution source. The samples of the litter layer were taken from pine stands at the distances of 3, 5, 10 and 20 km from the plant. The PCA and GLM analyses were used to reduce the number of variables to the main environmental gradient and assess the influence of environmental factors on beetle abundance, number of species, and life traits. The dependence of species number, abundance and the presence of forest and dendrophagous species on the distance from the plant was detected. A significant impact of organic carbon content, nitrogen emission and moss cover on other life traits of beetles was disclosed. The abundance of moss fraction in the litter layer was positively correlated with increasing distance from the plant. The ability to tolerate polluted sites by three species: Atheta fungi, Micrambe abietis and Brassicogethes aeneus, and intolerance of pollution by eight species: Bryaxis puncticollis, Quedius limbatus, Cyphon pubescens, Cephenium majus, Cyphon padi, Cyphon variabilis, Gabrius appendiculatus and Philonthus cognatus, were detected by IndVal analysis. The distribution of litter species was affected by the distance from the plant and by the richness of moss cover."
Effects of wilderness grazing on ground-breeding birds in Pannonian grasslands,"The acceleration of grassland loss on the global scale has been reported in many studies, which is often attributed to the combination of land use change and increased variability of climatic processes. Extensive steppe national parks serve as an ideal study site for grassland conservation, especially wilderness areas where the natural effects of grazing on wildlife can still be tracked. In our study we aim to investigate the effects of habitat structure, grazing type and intensity as well as climatic variables on species abundance, species richness and abundance of functional groups of ground-breeding bird species in the largest compact alkali grassland area of central Europe. We applied the information theoretic approach estimating the importance of ecological predictors according models of substantial support. The main result of our study shows that ground-breeding bird communities in steppe areas exhibit highly species-specific responses to the species of grazers, grazing intensity, habitat composition and climatic predictors. Across the most supported models, species-specific habitat composition values were the most supported predictors. Our findings show that although the response of ground-breeding birds to vegetation, grazing and climatic predictors is highly species-specific, consistent patterns of responsiveness to grazing and climatic patterns emerge, which calls for long-term studies on the combined effects of climatic variability and management of grazing systems."
Mitochondrial PKM2 regulates oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by stabilizing Bcl2,"Pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) catalyzes the last step of glycolysis and plays an important role in tumor cell proliferation. Recent studies have reported that PKM2 also regulates apoptosis. However, the mechanisms underlying such a role of PKM2 remain elusive. Here we show that PKM2 translocates to mitochondria under oxidative stress. In the mitochondria, PKM2 interacts with and phosphorylates Bcl2 at threonine (T) 69. This phosphorylation prevents the binding of Cul3-based E3 ligase to Bcl2 and subsequent degradation of Bcl2. A chaperone protein, HSP90α1, is required for this function of PKM2. HSP90α1's ATPase activity launches a conformational change of PKM2 and facilitates interaction between PKM2 and Bcl2. Replacement of wild-type Bcl2 with phosphorylation-deficient Bcl2 T69A mutant sensitizes glioma cells to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and impairs brain tumor formation in an orthotopic xenograft model. Notably, a peptide that is composed of the amino acid residues from 389 to 405 of PKM2, through which PKM2 binds to Bcl2, disrupts PKM2-Bcl2 interaction, promotes Bcl2 degradation and impairs brain tumor growth. In addition, levels of Bcl2 T69 phosphorylation, conformation-altered PKM2 and Bcl2 protein correlate with one another in specimens of human glioblastoma patients. Moreover, levels of Bcl2 T69 phosphorylation and conformation-altered PKM2 correlate with both grades and prognosis of glioma malignancy. Our findings uncover a novel mechanism through which mitochondrial PKM2 phosphorylates Bcl2 and inhibits apoptosis directly, highlight the essential role of PKM2 in ROS adaptation of cancer cells, and implicate HSP90-PKM2-Bcl2 axis as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in glioblastoma."
Comparative root and stem anatomy of six Clinopodium (Lamiaceae) taxa,"A group of Lamiaceae that has caused confusion over its generic boundaries are those species belonging to the complex surrounding the genera Satureja, Calamintha, Micromeria, Clinopodium and Acinos. In the current study, cross sections of root and stem of six Clinopodium taxa, previously treated as Acinos in Flora of Turkey, is studied for the first time and detailed descriptions and illustrations of root and stem are described and illustrated here. It is taxonomically interesting that the root and stems of these 6 taxa show similar histological characters except for a few differences, such as primary tissue structure in middle part of roots of C troodi subsp. grandiflorum, cell numbers, types and density of trichome and prominent projecting at the corners in stem cross-section. The root center of studied Clinopodium taxa has a narrow pith consisting of primery xylem cells and the pith rays are 1-2-layered. Vascular bundles in all taxa are well-developed in the corners of the stems."
Meteorite crater ponds as source of high zooplankton biodiversity,"Meteor crater ponds are extremely rare types of water body and consequently their environment, along with inhabiting fauna, are poorly recognised. We investigated the zooplankton community structure of three meteorite ponds. Their hydroperiod is usually the longest during the spring season, therefore the study-time covered the months between April and June. Within the craters we found 140 zooplankton species, which contributed to 20% of rotifer, 19% of cladoceran, 15% of copepod and 3% of ostracod Polish species. Our results showed a high diversity of zooplankton inhabiting these temporary ecosystems, even though we examined craters before the optimum of macrophyte development, which supports increase of invertebrate species richness. Only 43% of the species were common for all three ponds, although the meteorite craters were located very close to each other, possess the same catchment area and all were Ashless. The high specificity of each pond was underlined by a high number of distinctive species (containing almost 30% of the total taxonomic structure). Zooplankton mainly consisted of eurytopic and common species, with representatives of families Brachionidae, Daphnidae and Cyclopidae having the highest frequency. However, over 10% of all species (e.g., Lecane elsa and Tretocephala ambigua) were determined as rare in Poland. Therefore these meteorite ponds are of a high conservation value despite the close proximity of a large urban agglomeration."
Role of FIT2 in porcine intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation,"Fat-inducing transcript 2 (FIT2) plays an important role in the formation of intramuscular lipid droplets in skeletal muscle. However, its role in porcine intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation remains unclear. In the present study, a 789-bp fragment covering the complete coding region of porcine FIT2 (pFIT2) was obtained. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis indicated that pFIT2 mRNA was highly expressed in fat tissue. Overexpression of pFIT2 in porcine intramuscular preadipocytes led to an increase in lipid accumulation, which was detected by triglyceride content analysis. Overexpression of pFIT2 also significantly increased the protein expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα), but decreased the protein expression of β-catenin. We also found that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling specific activator LiCl attenuated the pFIT2-induced upregulation of PPARPPARγ and downregulation of β-catenin. These findings implied that FIT2 promotes porcine intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation by repressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling."
Factors Associated with Parental Adaptation to Children with an Undiagnosed Medical Condition,"Little is known about the adaptive process and experiences of parents raising a child with an undiagnosed medical condition. The present study aims to assess how uncertainty, hope, social support, and coping efficacy contributes to adaptation among parents of children with an undiagnosed medical condition. Sixty-two parents of child affected by an undiagnosed medical condition for at least two years completed an electronically self-administered survey. Descriptive analysis suggested parents in this population had significantly lower adaptation scores when compared to other parents of children with undiagnosed medical conditions, and parents of children with a diagnosed intellectual and/or physical disability. Similarly, parents in this population had significantly lower hope, perceived social support and coping efficacy when compared to parents of children with a diagnosed medical condition. Multiple linear regression was used to identify relationships between independent variables and domains of adaptation. Positive stress response was negatively associated with emotional support (B = −0.045, p ≤ 0.05), and positively associated with coping efficacy (B = 0.009, p ≤ 0.05). Adaptive self-esteem was negatively associated with uncertainty towards one’s social support (B = −0.248, p ≤ 0.05), and positively associated with coping efficacy (B = 0.007, p ≤ 0.05). Adaptive social integration was negatively associated with uncertainty towards one’s social support (B-0.273, p ≤ 0.05), and positively associated with uncertainty towards child’s health (B = 0.323, p ≤ 0.001), and affectionate support (B = 0.110, p ≤ 0.001). Finally, adaptive spiritual wellbeing was negatively associated with uncertainty towards one’s family (B = −0.221, p ≤ 0.05). Findings from this study have highlighted the areas where parents believed additional support was required, and provided insight into factors that contribute to parental adaptation."
Characterization the response of Korl:ICR mice to loperamide induced constipation,"Animal models of constipation induced with drugs and diet have been widely employed to investigate therapeutic effects and the action mechanism of drugs against this disease. ICR mice were selected to produce this disease model through oral administration of loperamide (Lop), even though SD rats are commonly utilized in studies of constipation. To compare the responses of ICR mice obtained from three different sources to constipation inducers, alterations in stool number, histopathological structure, mucin secretion and opioid-receptor downstream signaling pathway were measured in KorhlCR (Korea FDA source), A:ICR (USA source) and B:ICR (Japan source) injected with low and high concentrations of Lop (LoLop and HiLop). The number, weight and moisture content of stools decreased significantly in the Lop treated group of all ICR relative to the Vehicle treated group. Additionally, decreased mucosa layer thickness, muscle thickness, and mucin secretion were observed in the transverse colon of Lop treated ICR mice, while a similar number of goblet cells and crypt of lieberkuhn were detected in the same group. Furthermore, a similar change in the level of Ca expression and PKC phosphorylation was detected in the Lop treated group relative to the vehicle treated group, while some differences in the change pattern were observed in the B:ICR group. Therefore, these results of the present study provide strong additional evidence that KorhlCR, A:ICR and B:ICR derived from different sources have a similar overall response to constipation induced by Lop injection, although there were a few differences in the magnitude of their responses."
Cardiopulmonary effects of thiopental versus propofol as an induction agent prior to isoflurane anesthesia in chair trained rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta),"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of thiopental versus propofol on cardiopulmonary functions, when used as an induction agent prior to isoflurane anesthesia in rhesus monkeys. Eight healthy rhesus monkeys weighing 3.72 to 5.7 kg, 4-5 years old, were used in the study. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental or propofol intravenous injection, and then maintained with isoflurane in oxygen for 45 minutes. Cardiopulmonary measurements were obtained before and 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after induction. The induction doses of thiopental and propofol were 19.41±0.54 and 9.33±1.02 mg/kg, respectively. In both groups, the values of heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, systolic blood pressure, mean blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pH, and lactate were decreased, while the values of partial pressure of carbon dioxide, partial pressure of oxygen, total carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, oxygen saturation, and base excess in the extracellular fluid were increased, as compared with baseline. Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in thiopental group compare to propofol group. Induction time was very short in both agents but not revealed a significant difference between both groups. However, recovery time was extremely faster in the propofol group. Our results demonstrated that propofol provides a minor suppression in systolic arterial blood pressure than thiopental sodium. In addition, propofol have a fast recovery effect from the anesthesia as well. Furthermore, it is suggested that thiopental sodium could also be used to induce anesthesia instead of propofol, despite slight more suppression of cardiopulmonary function compared to thiopental sodium."
Anti-Helicobacter pylori activity of crude N-acetylneuraminic acid isolated from glycomacropeptide of whey,"Helicobacter pylori colonizes the gastric mucosa of about half of the world’s population, causing chronic gastritis and gastric cancer. An increasing emergence of antibiotic-resistant H. pylori arouses demand on alternative non-antibiotic-based therapies. In this study, we freshly prepared crude N-acetylneuraminic acid obtained from glycomacropeptide (G-NANA) of whey through a neuraminidase-mediated reaction and evaluated its antibacterial ability against H. pylori and H. felis. Overnight cultures of the H. pylori were diluted with fresh media and different concentrations (1-150 mg/mL) of crude G-NANA were added directly to the culture tube. Bacterial growth was evaluated by measuring the optical density of the culture medium and the number of viable bacteria was determined by a direct count of the colony forming units (CFU) on agar plates. For the in vivo study, mice were orally infected with 100 μL (5×108 cfu/mL) of H. felis four times at a day’s interval, accompanied by a daily administration of crude G-NANA or vehicle. A day after the last infection, the mice were daily administered the crude G-NANA (0, 75, and 300 mg/mL) for 10 days and euthanized. Their stomachs were collected and bacterial colonization was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Crude G-NANA inhibited H. pylori’s growth and reduced the number of viable bacteria in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, crude G-NANA inhibited bacterial colonization in the mice. These results showed that crude G-NANA has antibacterial activity against Helicobacter and demonstrated its therapeutic potential for the prevention of chronic gastritis and gastric carcinogenesis induced by Helicobacter infection in humans."
The effects of dosage and the routes of administrations of streptozotocin and alloxan on induction rate of typel diabetes mellitus and mortality rate in rats,"The approach and novelty of this scientific work was to formulate the appropriate Streptozotocin (STZ) and Alloxan dosage in different routes of administration to imply minimum mortality rate and high incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in the rat experiment model. Rats were randomly divided into STZ, Alloxan and control groups. 1-Alloxan group was divided into two subgroups: intraperitoneal (ip) subgroups which received a single dose of, 140, 120, 100 and 80 mg/kg; and the subcutaneous (sc) subgroups which received a single dose of, 120, 110, 100, 90, and 80 mg/kg. 2-STZ group was divided into four subgroups of ip route. The ip subgroup which received intraperitoneally a single dose of, 30, 35, 40 and 50 mg/kg. 3-The control group: This group received solo distilled water. The injection day was considered as the day zero. Blood glucose levels and mortality rate were recorded. Subsequently, 30 days after, the logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate the effect of the explanatory variables, the dose levels, and route approaches, on the probability of DM incidence, and mortality. According to the statistical logistic analysis for Alloxan, it is concluded that the minimum dosage needed to induce DM was 120 mg/kg by sc method (probability 0.712). In addition, the logistic analysis for STZ showed that the optimal dose-level for STZ was 40 mg/kg with ip with approximate induction of DM probability 0.764. Based on the data, male Wistar rats in which received a single dosage of Alloxan by sc injection at dose of 120 mg/kg showed the most desirable result of induction of type I DM; furthermore, those in which received STZ by ip injection at the dose of 40 mg/kg developed a persistent and optimal DM state characterized by high rate of DM induction and low- level of mortality."
Establishment of a mouse model of 70% lethal dose by total-body irradiation,"Whereas increasing concerns about radiation exposure to nuclear disasters or side effects of anticancer radiotherapy, relatively little research for radiation damages or remedy has been done. The purpose of this study was to establish level of LD70/30 (a lethal dose for 70% of mice within 30 days) by total-body γ irradiation (TBI) in a mouse model. For this purpose, at first, 8-week-old male ICR and C57BL/6N mice from A and B companies were received high dose (10, 11, 12 Gy) TBI. After irradiation, the body weight and survival rate were monitored for 30 days consecutively. In next experiment, 5-week-old male ICR and C57BL/6N mice from B company were received same dose irradiation. Results showed that survival rate and body weight change rate in inbred C57BL/6N mice were similar between A and B company. In ICR mice, however, survival rate and body weight change rate were completely different among the companies. Significant difference of survival rate both ICR and C57BL6N mice was not observed in between 5-week-old and 8-week-old groups receiving 10 or 12 Gy TBI. Our results indicate that the strain and age of mice, and even purchasing company (especially outbred), should be matched over experimental groups in TBI experiment. Based on our results, 8-week-old male ICR mice from B company subjected to 12 Gy of TBI showed LD70/30 and suitable as a mouse model for further development of new drug using the ideal total-body irradiation model."
Antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects of fermented red ginseng against high fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia in rats,"This study was performed to investigate the antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects of fermented red ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer; FRG) on high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups of seven: normal control, NC; high-fat diet control, HFC; high-fat diet— 0.5% FRG, HF-FRGL; and high-fat diet-1% FRG, HF-FRGH. All rats were fed a high-fat diet for eight weeks, except those in the NC group, while rats in the FRC treatment groups received drinking water containing 0.5% or 1% FRG. After eight weeks of treatment, levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) in the serum were measured. The concentration of the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA), and activity of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (CSH-Px) in rat liver were evaluated. Histological analysis of the liver was performed using hematoxylin and eosin. The high-fat diet markedly increased serum levels of ALT, AST, TC, TG, and LDL-C and hepatic MDA levels, while administration of FRC to the hyperlipidemic rats resulted in a significant decline in the levels of these parameters. Furthermore, the decline in the levels of serum HDL-C and hepatic SOD, CAT, and CSH-Px induced by the high-fat diet was attenuated by FRG treatment. In addition, histopathological analysis of liver sections suggested that FRG treatment also provided protection against liver damage. These results suggested that FRG improved lipid profiles, inhibited lipid peroxidation, and played a protective role against liver injury in hyperlipidemic rats."
Multipliers of Dirichlet series and monomial series expansions of holomorphic functions in infinitely many variables,"Let \({\mathscr {H}}_\infty \) be the set of all ordinary Dirichlet series \(D=\sum _n a_n n^{-s}\) representing bounded holomorphic functions on the right half plane. A completely multiplicative sequence \((b_n)\) of complex numbers is said to be an \(\ell _1\)-multiplier for \({\mathscr {H}}_\infty \) whenever \(\sum _n |a_n b_n| < \infty \) for every \(D \in {\mathscr {H}}_\infty \). We study the problem of describing such sequences \((b_n)\) in terms of the asymptotic decay of the subsequence \((b_{p_j})\), where \(p_j\) denotes the jth prime number. Given a completely multiplicative sequence \(b=(b_n)\) we prove (among other results): b is an \(\ell _1\)-multiplier for \({\mathscr {H}}_\infty \) provided \(|b_{p_j}| < 1\) for all j and \(\overline{\lim }_n \frac{1}{\log n} \sum _{j=1}^n b_{p_j}^{*2} < 1\), and conversely, if b is an \(\ell _1\)-multiplier for \({\mathscr {H}}_\infty \), then \(|b_{p_j}| < 1\) for all j and \(\overline{\lim }_n \frac{1}{\log n} \sum _{j=1}^n b_{p_j}^{*2} \le 1\) (here \(b^*\) stands for the decreasing rearrangement of b). Following an ingenious idea of Harald Bohr it turns out that this problem is intimately related with the question of characterizing those sequences z in the infinite dimensional polydisk \({\mathbb {D}}^\infty \) (the open unit ball of \(\ell _\infty \)) for which every bounded and holomorphic function f on \({\mathbb {D}}^\infty \) has an absolutely convergent monomial series expansion \(\sum _{\alpha } \frac{\partial _\alpha f(0)}{\alpha !} z^\alpha \). Moreover, we study analogous problems in Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series and Hardy spaces of functions on the infinite dimensional polytorus \({\mathbb {T}}^\infty \)."
Investigation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) biosynthesis from mixed culture enriched by valerate-dominant hydrolysate,"The production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) with a high fraction of 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) and 3-hydroxy-2-methylvalerate (3H2MV) from mixed culture enriched by valerate-dominant hydrolysate was evaluated in this study. After long-term enrichment, the culture showed strong ability to synthesize 3HV and 3H2MV, even with acetate-dominant substrate. The ultilization of single or mixed iso-/n-valerate by the enriched culture showed that the mixture of iso-valerate and n-valerate was more efficient substrate than any single in terms of balancing microbial growth and PHAs synthesis. Besides, through comparing the kinetics and stoichiometry of the tests supplying valerate and propionate, the enriched culture with equivalent valerate and propionate (1:1 molar ratio) exhibited superior PHAs production performances to pure valerate or propionate, attaining more than 70 mol% of 3HVand 3H2MV. The above findings reveal that valerate-dominant hydrolysate is a kind of suitable substrate to enrich PHAs producing culture with great capability to synthesize 3HV and 3H2MV monomers, thus improving product properties than pure poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB); also 3HV and 3H2MV production behaviors can be regulated by the type of odd-carbon VFAs in the substrate."
Alternative new mesenchymal stem cell source exerts tumor tropism through ALCAM and N-cadherin via regulation of microRNA-192 and -218,"Gliomas are the most common type of malignant primary brain tumors. Some treatments of gliomas exist, but they are rarely curative. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are emerging as potential modes of targeted cancer therapy owing to their capacity for homing toward tumor sites. It has been proposed that MSCs derived from various sources, such as bone marrow, adipose tissue and umbilical cord blood, can be used as cell-based therapy for brain tumors. Here, MSCs obtained from the synovial fluid of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis patients were investigated as therapeutic candidates. Specifically, we compared migratory and adhesive abilities, as well as expression levels of related genes and microRNA in bone marrow derived-MSCs (BMMSCs), adipose derived-MSCs (ADMSCs), and synovial fluid derived-MSCs (SFMSCs) after treatment with conditioned medium from gliomas. Migration and adhesion of SFMSCs increased through upregulation of the activated lymphocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) and N-cadherin by microRNA-192 and -218 downregulation, similar to BMMSCs and ADMSCs. Migratory capacities of all types of MSCs were evaluated in vivo, and SFMSCs migrated intensively toward gliomas. These results suggest that SFMSCs have potential for use in cell-based antitumor therapies."
Changes in plasma CXCL4 levels are associated with improvements in lung function in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy for systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease,Increased circulatory levels of the chemokine CXCL4 have been associated with the presence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in an observational study of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between baseline CXCL4 level and extent of ILD in the context of a randomized controlled trial and to determine whether changes in CXCL4 levels in response to immunosuppression are associated with future progression of SSc-ILD.
Formulation and Optimization of Multiparticulate Drug Delivery System Approach for High Drug Loading,"The aim of the present work was to develop and optimize multiparticulate formulation viz. pellets of naproxen by employing QbD and risk assessment approach. Mixture design with extreme vertices was applied to the formulation with high loading of drug (about 90%) and extrusion-spheronization as a process for manufacturing pellets. Independent variables chosen were level of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC)—X
1, polyvinylpyrrolidone K-90 (PVP K-90)—X
2, croscarmellose sodium (CCS)—X
3, and polacrilin potassium (PP)—X
4. Dependent variables considered were disintegration time (DT)—Y
1, sphericity—Y
2, and percent drug release—Y
3. The formulation was optimized based on the batches generated by MiniTab 17 software. The batch with maximum composite desirability (0.98) proved to be optimum. From the evaluation of design batches, it was observed that, even in low variation, the excipients affect the pelletization property of the blend and also the final drug release. In conclusion, pellets with high drug loading can be effectively manufactured and optimized systematically using QbD approach."
Mitochondrial PKM2 regulates oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by stabilizing Bcl2,"Pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) catalyzes the last step of glycolysis and plays an important role in tumor cell proliferation. Recent studies have reported that PKM2 also regulates apoptosis. However, the mechanisms underlying such a role of PKM2 remain elusive. Here we show that PKM2 translocates to mitochondria under oxidative stress. In the mitochondria, PKM2 interacts with and phosphorylates Bcl2 at threonine (T) 69. This phosphorylation prevents the binding of Cul3-based E3 ligase to Bcl2 and subsequent degradation of Bcl2. A chaperone protein, HSP90α1, is required for this function of PKM2. HSP90α1's ATPase activity launches a conformational change of PKM2 and facilitates interaction between PKM2 and Bcl2. Replacement of wild-type Bcl2 with phosphorylation-deficient Bcl2 T69A mutant sensitizes glioma cells to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and impairs brain tumor formation in an orthotopic xenograft model. Notably, a peptide that is composed of the amino acid residues from 389 to 405 of PKM2, through which PKM2 binds to Bcl2, disrupts PKM2-Bcl2 interaction, promotes Bcl2 degradation and impairs brain tumor growth. In addition, levels of Bcl2 T69 phosphorylation, conformation-altered PKM2 and Bcl2 protein correlate with one another in specimens of human glioblastoma patients. Moreover, levels of Bcl2 T69 phosphorylation and conformation-altered PKM2 correlate with both grades and prognosis of glioma malignancy. Our findings uncover a novel mechanism through which mitochondrial PKM2 phosphorylates Bcl2 and inhibits apoptosis directly, highlight the essential role of PKM2 in ROS adaptation of cancer cells, and implicate HSP90-PKM2-Bcl2 axis as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in glioblastoma."
"LES validation of urban flow, part II: eddy statistics and flow structures","Time-dependent three-dimensional numerical simulations such as large-eddy simulation (LES) play an important role in fundamental research and practical applications in meteorology and wind engineering. Whether these simulations provide a sufficiently accurate picture of the time-dependent structure of the flow, however, is often not determined in enough detail. We propose an application-specific validation procedure for LES that focuses on the time dependent nature of mechanically induced shear-layer turbulence to derive information about strengths and limitations of the model. The validation procedure is tested for LES of turbulent flow in a complex city, for which reference data from wind-tunnel experiments are available. An initial comparison of mean flow statistics and frequency distributions was presented in part I. Part II focuses on comparing eddy statistics and flow structures. Analyses of integral time scales and auto-spectral energy densities show that the tested LES reproduces the temporal characteristics of energy-dominant and flux-carrying eddies accurately. Quadrant analysis of the vertical turbulent momentum flux reveals strong similarities between instantaneous ejection-sweep patterns in the LES and the laboratory flow, also showing comparable occurrence statistics of rare but strong flux events. A further comparison of wavelet-coefficient frequency distributions and associated high-order statistics reveals a strong agreement of location-dependent intermittency patterns induced by resolved eddies in the energy-production range. The validation concept enables wide-ranging conclusions to be drawn about the skill of turbulence-resolving simulations than the traditional approach of comparing only mean flow and turbulence statistics. Based on the accuracy levels determined, it can be stated that the tested LES is sufficiently accurate for its purpose of generating realistic urban wind fields that can be used to drive simpler dispersion models."
Nutrient phytoavailability in a mine soil amended with technosol and biochar and vegetated with Brassica juncea,"Mine soils usually have low nutrient contents and poor fertility conditions which limit the establishment of vegetation and the application of phytomanagement reclamation technologies. Organic materials have been used as soil amendments to reclaim mine soils, as they can provide organic matter and nutrients."
Variability of word discrimination scores in clinical practice and consequences on their sensitivity to hearing loss,"Speech perception scores are widely used to assess patient’s functional hearing, yet most linguistic material used in these audiometric tests dates to before the availability of large computerized linguistic databases. In an ENT clinic population of 120 patients with median hearing loss of 43-dB HL, we quantified the variability and the sensitivity of speech perception scores to hearing loss, measured using disyllabic word lists, as a function of both the number of ten-word lists and type of scoring used (word, syllables or phonemes). The mean word recognition scores varied significantly across lists from 54 to 68%. The median of the variability of the word recognition score ranged from 30% for one ten-word list down to 20% for three ten-word lists. Syllabic and phonemic scores showed much less variability with standard deviations decreasing by 1.15 with the use of syllabic scores and by 1.45 with phonemic scores. The sensitivity of each list to hearing loss and distortions varied significantly. There was an increase in the minimum effect size that could be seen for syllabic scores compared to word scores, with no significant further improvement with phonemic scores. The use of at least two ten-word lists, quoted in syllables rather than in whole words, contributed to a large decrease in variability and an increase in sensitivity to hearing loss. However, those results emphasize the need of using updated linguistic material for clinical speech score assessments."
Single-session transcranial direct current stimulation induces enduring enhancement of visual processing speed in patients with major depression,"Attentional deficits are considered key cognitive symptoms in major depressive disorder (MDD) arising from abnormal activation patterns within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) alertness networks. Altering these activity patterns with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) might thus ameliorate alertness-dependent cognitive deficits in MDD patients. In a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study, we investigated the effect of a single session of anodal tDCS (2 mA) applied to the left dlPFC on different parameters of visual attention based on Bundesen’s theory of visual attention (Psychol Rev 97(4):523–547, 1990) in a group of 20 patients with MDD and a control group of 20 healthy participants. The parametric attention assessment took place before, immediately after and 24 h after tDCS intervention. It revealed a selective impairment in visual processing speed as a primary functional deficit in MDD at baseline assessment. Furthermore, a significant stimulation condition × time point interaction showed that verum tDCS over the left dlPFC resulted in a processing speed enhancement 24 h post-stimulation in MDD patients. In healthy control participants, we did not find similar tDCS-induced effects. Our results suggest that even a single session of tDCS over the dlPFC can induce enduring neurocognitive benefits that indicate an amelioration of cortical under-arousal in MDD patients in a time frame beyond that of immediate, excitability increases that are directly induced by the current."
"Seasonal variations and source profile of n-alkanes in particulate matter (PM10) at a heavy traffic site, Delhi","Delhi is one of the most polluted cities in the world. The generation of aerosols in the lower atmosphere of the city is mainly due to a large amount of natural dust advection and sizable anthropogenic activities. The compositions of organic compounds in aerosols are highly variable in this region and need to be investigated thoroughly. Twenty-four-hour sampling to assess concentrations of n-alkanes (ng/m3) in PM10 was carried out during January 2015 to June 2015 at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW) Campus, Delhi, India. The total average concentration of n-alkanes, 243.7 ± 5.5 ng/m3, along with the diagnostic tools has been calculated. The values of CPI1, CPI2, and CPI3 for the whole range of n-alkanes series, petrogenic n-alkanes, and biogenic n-alkanes were 1.00, 1.02, and 1.04, respectively, and C
max were at C25 and C27. Diagnostic indices and curves indicated that the dominant inputs of n-alkanes are from petrogenic emissions, with lower contribution from biogenic emissions. Significant seasonal variations were observed in average concentrations of n-alkanes, which is comparatively higher in winter (187.4 ± 4.3 ng/m3) than during the summer season (56.3 ± 1.1 ng/m3)."
Semiparametric Bayesian inference for mean-covariance regression models,"In this paper, we propose a Bayesian semiparametric mean-covariance regression model with known covariance structures. A mixture model is used to describe the potential non-normal distribution of the regression errors. Moreover, an empirical likelihood adjusted mixture of Dirichlet process model is constructed to produce distributions with given mean and variance constraints. We illustrate through simulation studies that the proposed method provides better estimations in some non-normal cases. We also demonstrate the implementation of our method by analyzing the data set from a sleep deprivation study."
Patient-reported outcomes in Asia: evaluation of the properties of the Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease (RAID) score in multiethnic Asian patients with rheumatoid arthritis,"Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as the Europe-developed Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease (RAID) are important to assess patients’ quality of life. Their interpretation may be culture-dependent. To evaluate the potential utility of RAID in multiethnic Asian rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Cross-sectional study of English-speaking RA patients in a Singapore tertiary center. Validity of RAID (scored between 0 and 10 with higher score indicating worse status) was assessed by Spearman’s correlation with patient global assessment (PGA), DAS28 and short form 12 (SF-12). Consistency was assessed by Cronbach’s alpha and test-retest reliability by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) 7 days after (n = 20). Feasibility was assessed by % of missing data. Eighty-two patients were analyzed: median age 53 years (Q1:Q3 44.7; 60.7), disease duration 4.2 years (1.4; 8.8), 66 (81%) women and 54 (66%) Chinese. Although RA was moderately active (median DAS28, 3.2 (2.5; 4.3)), RAID score was very low (median, 1.9 (0.6; 3.7)) with 44 (53.7%) patients having RAID score between 0 and 2. RAID was strongly correlated with PGA (r = 0.75), and moderately with other outcomes (DAS28 r = 0.46, SF12 physical r = −0.45 and SF12 mental r = −0.52, p < 0.0001 for all). Consistency was high (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.91). Test-retest reliability was excellent; ICC = 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.74–0.90). Feasibility was good with only 2 patients with missing data. Despite considerable floor effects, the RAID appeared to be a valid and practical PRO to assess the impact of RA in Asia. Multiethnic Asian patients may underestimate the impact of their disease compared to European patients."
Uncertainties in estimating the roughness coefficient of rock fracture surfaces,"Joint roughness has a critical role in the deformation behavior of discontinuous rock masses. Several subjective (visual comparison) and quantitative (statistical and fractal) approaches have been proposed for estimating rock joint roughness coefficient (JRC). Using a large collection of 223 published joint profiles, this study investigates variability of the JRC estimates by these approaches. Among the profile parameters, maximum height (R
z), ultimate slope (λ), and fractal dimension (D
h–L, determined using the hypotenuse leg method) show a lower sensitivity to the sampling interval than the root mean square of the first deviation (Z
2), profile elongation index (δ), fractal dimension (D
c, determined using the compass-walking method), and standard deviation of the angle i (σ

i
). Accordingly, this study proposes two separate sets of equations for quantitatively estimating JRC. The performances of these equations are examined by performing direct shear tests on 23 rock joint samples. The subjective approach is found to underestimate JRC by less than two units because it ignores (1) the main trend of the compared profile and (2) the limited scope of the standard profiles. Following these results, the visual comparison chart is updated by explicitly adding a scale bar for the y-axes of the standard profiles. Several basic rules for visual comparisons are also proposed."
"Serum level of DNase1l3 in patients with dermatomyositis/polymyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, and its association with disease activity","DNase1l3 is an endonuclease to degrade the chromatin of apoptotic or necrotic cells. Serum DNase1l3 may fulfill the function of clearance of chromatin released into the circulation by dying cells, which can trigger autoimmune responses. To date, it remains unclear whether serum DNase1l3 level associates with the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Sixty-eight patients with dermatomyositis/polymyositis (DM/PM, n = 30), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n = 20) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 18), as well as 26 healthy blood donors were enrolled in the present study. Serum levels of DNase1l3 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. DNASE1L3 activity in serum was estimated by the capability of serum to digest nucleosomal DNA. Clinical, biochemical, serological and other markers of disease activity (CRP, ESR, C3, C4, anti-Jo-1 and anti-dsDNA, etc.) were measured by standard laboratory procedure. We found a decrease in DNase1l3 level in the DM/PM and SLE patients, resulting in the reduction in serum activity to digest nucleosome DNA. In contrast, the level and activity of DNase1l3 remained unchanged in the RA patients. The DNase1l3 level was relatively lower in the DM/PM patients with anti-Jo-1 antibody and interstitial lung disease, and in the SLE patients with SLE disease activity index higher than 6, renal involvement and anti-dsDNA antibody. DNase1l3 level negatively correlated with CRP and IgG in the PM/DM patients and correlated with ESR in the SLE patients. We found a significant reduction in serum DNase1l3 level in DM/PM and SLE, which may associate with clinic features and disease activity."
"Large-area, flexible polymer solar cell based on silver nanowires as transparent electrode by roll-to-roll printing","Conventional organic solar cell’s (OSC) architectures, including rigid transparent substrate (Glass), conductive electrode (Indium tin oxide, ITO) and small working areas, are widely utilized in organic photovoltaic fields. However, such a structure as well as conventional spin-coating method obviously restrict their industrial application. In this article, we report the deposition of silver nanowires (AgNWs) on the flexible substrate by slot-die printing. The obtained AgNWs films exhibited a high transmittance and a low resistance, and were further used as the transparent conductive electrode of OSCs. A typical conjugated polymer, poly[(2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)phenylene)-alt-(5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole)] (PPDT2FBT), was used as the active material to fabricate large-area (7 cm2 solar cells by a slot-die coating process. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) could reach 1.87% initially and further increased to 3.04% by thermal annealing. Compared to the performance of reference cell on ITO substrate, the result indicated that the AgNWs could be developed as an alternative substitute of conductive electrode to fabricate the large-area flexible OSCs by roll-to-roll printing."
AIE-active polymers for explosive detection,"Super-sensitive and ultra-selective detection of explosives plays a crucial role in anti-terrorism operations, homeland security, civilian safety and environment protection. Among the developed fluorescent probes, the polymers with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics have drawn much attention due to their bright emission in the aggregate and solid states. However, no review has summarized the development of AIE-active polymers for explosive detection. Herein, we reviewed the recent progress on using AIE-active polymers to detect explosives with super-amplification quenching effect. Moreover, the challenges and opportunities in this area were also briefly discussed."
Progress in fluorene-based wide-bandgap steric semiconductors,"Molecular bulks are favorable for the thermal and morphological stability in organic wide-bandgap semiconducting polymers with potential applications in both information and energy electronics. In this review, we present our progress in the design of fluorene-based bulky semiconductors with a fractal four-element pattern. Firstly, we established one-pot methods to spirofluorenes, especially spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX) serving as the next-generation spiro-based semiconductors. Secondly, we observed the supramolecular forces at the bulky groups and discovered the supramolecular steric hindrance (SSH) effect on polymorphisms, nanocrystals as well as device performance. Thus, a synergistically molecular attractor-repulsor theory (SMART) was proposed for the control of nanocrystal morphology, thin film phase and morphology. Thirdly, the third possible type of defects has been identified to generate green band (g-band) emission in wide-bandgap semiconductors by the introduction of molecular strain design of cyclofluorene. Finally, the first bulky polydiarylfluorene with highly crystalline and β conformation was achieved by an attractor-repulsor design of tadpole-shape monomer, which offered an effective platform to fabricate stable wide-bandgap semiconducting devices. All the discoveries offer the solid basis to break through bottlenecks of organic/polymer wide-bandgap semiconductors by the improvements of overall performances."
"An AEE-active polymer containing tetraphenylethene and 9,10-distyrylanthracene moieties with remarkable mechanochromism","A polymer (poly(9,10-anthracenevinylene-alt-4,4'-(9,9-bis(4-(4'-(1,2,2'-triphenylvinyl)phenoxy)butyl)-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl) dibenzaldehyde), P1 was successfully synthesized through the Wittig-Horner reaction by employing fluorene and 9,10-distyrylanthracene moieties as building blocks for backbone and tetraphenylethenes as pendant groups. Photophysical and thermal properties of the resulting polymeric emitter were fully characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). While P1 emits an orange-light centered at 567 nm in dilute tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution, the solid powder of the polymer exhibits strong yellow emission peaked at 541 nm. It is also found that the as-synthesized polymer shows unique property of aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE). In addition, P1 possesses high thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (T
d,5% of 430 °C and high morphological stability with a glass transition temperature (T
g of 171 °C. Under the stimulus of mechanical force, the emission of P1 can be changed from yellow to red (Δλ
max = 61 nm), showing a remarkable mechanochromism. The results from XRD analysis suggest that such mechanochromic phenomenonof P1 is probably caused by the destruction of crystalline structure, which leads to the conformational planarization of the distyrylanthracene moieties forming by the polymerization and the increase of molecular conjugation of the backbone."
Western strategy for EGJ carcinoma,"In this paper, the epidemiological and clinicobiological behavior of esophagogastric junction (EGJ) adenocarcinoma in the West is compared and contrasted to that in the East, and an overview is provided of current therapeutic strategies employed for this type of tumor in Western countries. It is well known that multimodal treatment is the therapeutic standard in locally advanced EGJ adenocarcinoma, but whether neoadjuvant/perioperative chemotherapy (CT) or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the optimal approach is still debated. Neoadjuvant CRT improves local control in locally advanced Siewert type I and II tumors, so it should be considered the treatment of choice. In the subset of these patients with microscopic systemic disease at diagnosis, more intensive exclusive chemotherapy protocols could be of benefit. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify these patients before planning the treatment. For Siewert type III tumors, perioperative chemotherapy is the standard. While there is general agreement on the optimal surgical approach for Siewert types I and III (a two-field Ivor Lewis operation and a total gastrectomy with distal esophagectomy, respectively), no standard surgical treatment has been defined for Siewert type II tumors. When data from Western series on proximal and circumferential resection margins and on nodal spread in Siewert type II tumors are taken into account, the optimal surgical approach appears to be Ivor Lewis esophagectomy. Whether the extent of esophageal invasion can correctly predict nodal involvement in middle–upper mediastinal stations as a means to restrict indications for transthoracic esophagectomy requires further investigation in the West."
Hyaluronic acid binding protein 1 overexpression is an indicator for disease-free survival in cervical cancer,"Hyaluronic acid binding protein 1 (HABP1) is reported to overexpress in various cancer tissues and may therefore contribute to oncogenesis. However, the status of HABP1 expression in cervical cancer (CC) remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of HABP1 and its relationship with clinical characteristics in patients with CC."
Does geographical location matter for managerial compensation design?,"This paper examines the role of firm location in relation to managers’ compensation structure. We find that managers in remotely located firms have compensation packages with lower pay-for-performance (and pay-for-risk) sensitivity, which suggests that managers in rural areas can exert more influence on their pay and receive a compensation package that is more favorable to them. However, this impact of geographical location on managers’ pay is mitigated by the presence of institutional investors. Last, we find that managers in rural firms take lower risks than their peers in urban firms. Overall, our evidence is in support of managerial entrenchment in rural firms."
Green and efficient dry gel conversion synthesis of SAPO-34 catalyst with plate-like morphology,"SAPO-34 catalyst with plate-like morphology was designed and synthesized for the first time, by the dry gel conversion method using cheap triethylamine as a structure-directing agent assisted with seed suspension containing nanosheet-like SAPO-34 seed. The latter played an important role in formation of SAPO-34 (CHA-type) with plate-like morphology. In addition, the yield of the product in the synthesis system containing seed suspension reached 97%, 15% higher than that obtained in the corresponding synthesis system without the seed suspension. Meanwhile, the plate-like SAPO-34 catalysts synthesized by this method exhibited higher selectivity to light olefins and longer lifetime in methanol-to-olefins (MTO) reaction than the traditional cubic SAPO-34 catalyst. This work provides a new technical route for green and efficient synthesis of SAPO-34 catalysts with improved MTO performance."
Changing edaphic conditions and exploitation of an expanded phenological niche allows for increased exotic (introduced) plant species dominance,Global change agents are creating novel climatic and edaphic conditions that may favor introduced species. We attempted to identify mechanisms and impacts of Bromus tectorum invasion in the Colorado Front Range mixed-grass prairie under changing conditions.
Experimental study on Y-shaped bridge under 3-dimentional earthquake ground motions,"Based on similar theory and multi-dimensional seismic design theory, a Y-shaped bridge model with the scale ratio of 1:20 was made to conduct the seismic simulation shaking table test in this paper. Failure mode and dynamic responses of Y-shaped bridge under different seismic wave spectrum, different peak accelerations and different seismic excitation directions were studied. The experimental results show that, the piers mostly exhibit bending failure mode and the vertical ground motion has a great influence on the development of cracks in girders. Dynamic responses of the Y-shaped bridge are different and presented different laws when three different seismic waves were applied. Seismic wave is input along the direction of the branch straight girder, which is the most unfavorable earthquake input direction when calculating the peak acceleration at the top of piers. Multi-dimension seismic excitation should be considered when calculating the width of the expansion joint between adjacent girders. The horizontal bidirectional seismic excitation can satisfy the design requirements of strain response at the bottom of pier. The model structure would cause vertical vibration during its horizontal seismic excitation, and vertical seismic excitation exerts more significant influence on the vertical vibration of branch straight girder."
The Importance of Geosites and Heritage Stones in Cities—a Review,"Geology, as a scientific discipline, is often viewed as most applicable in high mountains or in deserts or coastal areas—or more generally in ‘natural areas’ where rock exposures are most conspicuous—and, therefore, not to be experienced by most visitors and tourists. In contrast, most geoscientists are convinced that geology can be practised on an everyday basis, as it is part of our daily life as a facet of the natural environment that humans have used for 100 s of thousands of years. Even in places where the natural world seems far from its original condition, one can still experience geology. This consideration is of increasing importance, as today, more than half the world’s population lives in towns and cities. In this context, we can still present geology to an interested public through establishing leisure walks, either guiding or using leaflets, easily carried booklets and even web ‘apps’. The style chosen aims to be accessible to a broader public, but crucially, in an urban context, there should always be an aim to demonstrate the relationship between geology and society, as well as architecture and history. Indeed, the realisation of many participants in such activities that building stones can belong to, and provide evidence of, both a natural and a built heritage can be a revelation."
Examining the Value of a Scaffolded Critique Framework to Promote Argumentative and Explanatory Writings Within an Argument-Based Inquiry Approach,"This study investigated the value of using a scaffolded critique framework to promote two different types of writing—argumentative writing and explanatory writing—with different purposes within an argument-based inquiry approach known as the Science Writing Heuristic (SWH) approach. A quasi-experimental design with sixth and seventh grade students taught by two teachers was used. A total of 170 students participated in the study, with 87 in the control group (four classes) and 83 in the treatment group (four classes). All students used the SWH templates as an argumentative writing to guide their written work and completed these templates during the SWH investigations of each unit. After completing the SWH investigations, both groups of students were asked to complete the summary writing task as an explanatory writing at the end of each unit. All students’ writing samples were scored using analytical frameworks developed for the study. The results indicated that the treatment group performed significantly better on the explanatory writing task than the control group. In addition, the results of the partial correlation suggested that there is a very strong significantly positive relationship between the argumentative writing and the explanatory writing."
A green approach for synthesis of naphthoquinone-fused oxazine derivatives in water under ultrasonic irradiation,"An efficient and eco-friendly procedure has been developed for synthesis of naphthoquinone-fused oxazine derivatives via one-pot pseudo four-component reaction of 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, aromatic amine and formaldehyde in water under ultrasound irradiation. This protocol has the advantages of being catalyst-free, with short reaction times and high yields, and being environmentally benign with an easy work-up."
Proteomic characterization of the outer membrane vesicle of the halophilic marine bacterium Novosphingobium pentaromativorans US6-1,"Novosphingobium pentaromativorans US6-1 is a Gram-negative halophilic marine bacterium able to utilize several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene. In this study, using transmission electron microscopy, we confirmed that N. pentaromativorans US6-1 produces outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). N. pentaromativorans OMVs (hereafter OMVNovo) are spherical in shape, and the average diameter of OMVNovo is 25–70 nm. Proteomic analysis revealed that outer membrane proteins and periplasmic proteins of N. pentaromativorans are the major protein components of OMVNovo. Comparative proteomic analysis with the membrane-associated protein fraction and correlation analysis demonstrated that the outer membrane proteins of OMVNovo originated from the membrane- associated protein fraction. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to characterize OMV purified from halophilic marine bacteria."
Performance of nested multiplex PCR assay targeting MTP40 and IS6110 gene sequences for the diagnosis of tubercular lymphadenitis,"The conventional methods for diagnosis of tubercular lymphadenitis (TBLN) such as - fine needle aspiration cytology, Ziehl-Neelsen staining and culture have limitations of low sensitivity and/or specificity. So, it becomes essential to develop a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for an early diagnosis of TBLN. Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate nested multiplex polymerase chain reaction (nMPCR) targeting MTP40 and IS6110 gene sequences of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, respectively in 48 successive patients of TBLN and 20 random patients with non-tubercular lymph node lesions. Out of the 48 cases of TBLN, 14 (29.2%) were found to be positive by Ziehl-Neelsen staining, 15 (31.2%) were positive by culture and 43 (89.6%) cases were positive after first round of PCR while 48 (100%) cases were positive by nMPCR assay. The sensitivity and specificity of nMPCR was found to be 100% for the diagnosis of TBLN. The results thus obtained indicate that nMPCR assay is a highly sensitive and specific tool for the diagnosis of TBLN."
Epidemiological relationships of Campylobacter jejuni strains isolated from humans and chickens in South Korea,"Thirty-nine human isolates of Campylobacter jejuni obtained from a national university hospital during 2007–2010 and 38 chicken isolates of C. jejuni were collected from poultry farms during 2009–2010 in South Korea were used in this study. Campylobacter genomic species and virulence-associated genes were identified by PCR. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed to compare their genetic relationships. All isolates were highly resistant to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline. Of all isolates tested, over 94% contained seven virulence associated genes (flaA, cadF, racR, dnaJ, cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC). All isolates were classified into 39 types by PFGE clustering with 90% similarity. Some chicken isolates were incorporated into some PFGE types of human isolates. MLST analysis for the 39 human isolates and 38 chicken isolates resulted in 14 and 23 sequence types (STs), respectively, of which 10 STs were new. STs overlapped in both chicken and human isolates included ST-21, ST-48, ST-50, ST-51, and ST-354, of which ST-21 was the predominant ST in both human and chicken isolates. Through combined analysis of PFGE types and STs, three chicken isolates were clonally related to the three human isolates associated with food poisoning (VII-ST-48, XXII-ST-354, and XXVIII-ST-51). They were derived from geographically same or distinct districts. Remarkably, clonal spread of food poisoning pathogens between animals and humans was confirmed by population genetic analysis. Consequently, contamination of campylobacters with quinolone resistance and potential virulence genes in poultry production and consumption may increase the risk of infections in humans."
Characterizing evolving behavior of context vectors for context based clustering,"Characterizing evolving behavior of document vectors helps in identifying similarity between text documents. As document vectors contain terms and their importances in documents, discovering association and disassociation between terms is very important. This paper introduces characterization of evolving behavior of document vectors to identify similar and dissimilar segments in document vectors. This approach is particularly suitable where document vectors contain similar patterns of term occurrences but the patterns could be away from each other with regard to distance. The main objective of this paper is to capture evolving structure of context vector, document vector of contextually related terms, for discovering similarity between them. Context vector reduces the size of document vector from 6 to 12.57%. Evaluation is done by clustering the documents using Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean with standard datasets. This results in formation of clusters with better entropy and purity. Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon U test demonstrates statistically significant quality enhancement."

Energy Use Efficiency of Conventional versus Conservation Management Practices for Irrigated Potato Production in Southern Alberta,"A 12-yr. (2000–2011) study was conducted in Alberta, Canada to compare the energy use efficiency (EUE) of conventional (CONV) and conservation (CONS) potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) management practices. Potato was grown in 3- to 6-yr. rotations which included dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), soft wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), and timothy (Phleum pratense L.). CONS included compost application, reduced tillage, cover crops, and solid-seeded bean. Findings suggested that potato in 5-yr. CONS produced the highest EUE compared to the other CONS or CONV rotations. CONS can be used as a means of reducing the reliance on non-renewable energy inputs and improving overall EUE of potato production when less than 21% of the N content of compost applied was counted toward energy input use of potato production. At more than 21%, potato in the 4-yr. CONV became more favorable compared to potato in other rotations."
Chloropicrin Soil Fumigation Reduces Spongospora subterranea Soil Inoculum Levels but Does Not Control Powdery Scab Disease on Roots and Tubers of Potato,"The effect of chloropicrin fumigation on the soil populations of Spongospora subterranea and the development of powdery scab, formation of root galls and tuber yield was investigated in seven field trials conducted in Minnesota and North Dakota. Sixteen potato cultivars, with different levels of susceptibility to disease on roots and tubers, were planted in plots treated with chloropicrin at rates ranging from zero to 201.8 kg a.i. ha−1. The amount of S. subterranea DNA in soil was determined using qPCR. Bioassays were conducted to further assess the effect of chloropicrin fumigation on root colonization by S. subterranea in two potato cultivars with contrasting disease susceptibility. In the field, chloropicrin applied at rates between 70.1 to 201.8 kg a.i. ha−1 significantly decreased S. subterranea initial inoculum in soil but increased the amount of disease observed on roots and tubers of susceptible cultivars. The effect of increasing disease was confirmed in controlled conditions experiments. Although the amount of S. subterranea DNA in roots of bioassay plants increased with increasing chloropicrin rates, it remained similar among potato cultivars. Chloropicrin fumigation significantly increased tuber yield which in cultivars such as Shepody and Umatilla Russet were associated with the amount root galls (r = 0.30; P < 0.03). Results of these studies contradict earlier reports on the use of chloropicrin fumigation for the control of powdery scab. Factors other than inoculum level, such as environmental conditions that affect inoculum efficiency and host susceptibility, may be significant contributors to the development of powdery scab and root gall formation."
"Lamoka, a Variety with Excellent Chip Color Out of Cold Storage and Resistance to the Golden Cyst Nematode","Lamoka is a white-skinned, white-fleshed potato variety notable for excellent chip color from cold storage, good yield and specific gravity, and resistance to both common scab and race Ro1 of the golden cyst nematode (Globodera rostochiensis). It was selected from a cross made at Cornell University in 1998 between NY120 and NY115. The tubers are round-oblong and slightly flattened, with shallow eyes and relatively smooth skin. Chip color out of cold storage is better than ‘Snowden’. Marketable yield averaged 90% of Snowden across 95 trials in New York, Pennsylvania and Maine, while specific gravity averaged 0.003 less than Snowden. Lamoka was released by the New York Agricultural Experiment Station in 2011."
Unusual bifid crista galli in a patient with cleft lip and palate,"One of the most common craniofacial malformations observed in newborn babies is cleft lip and palate (CLP). This syndrome presents with some anatomic variations. The aim of this study was to understand an anatomic variation of the crista galli that had not been reported previously in patients with CLP. A 17-year-old boy with CLP was referred to an orthodontic clinic for cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging before treatment. Axial and coronal sections and three-dimensional images showed that the crista galli had bifid heads that were attached to each other. Incomplete ossification had resulted in a bifid crista galli and the appearance of a suture in the anterior coronal section of the CBCT images. This anatomic variation could allow penetration of the anterior fossa during endoscopic surgery, which could be dangerous for the patient."
Altered precipitation seasonality impacts the dominant fungal but rare bacterial taxa in subtropical forest soils,"How soil microbial communities respond to precipitation seasonality change remains poorly understood, particularly for warm-humid forest ecosystems experiencing clear dry-wet cycles. We conducted a field precipitation manipulation experiment in a subtropical forest to explore the impacts of reducing dry-season rainfall but increasing wet-season rainfall on soil microbial community composition and enzyme activities. A 67% reduction of throughfall during the dry season decreased soil water content (SWC) by 17–24% (P < 0.05), while the addition of water during the wet season had limited impacts on SWC. The seasonal precipitation redistribution had no significant effect on the microbial biomass and enzyme activities, as well as on the community composition measured with phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). However, the amplicon sequencing revealed differentiated impacts on bacterial and fungal communities. The dry-season throughfall reduction increased the relative abundance of rare bacterial phyla (Gemmatimonadetes, Armatimonadetes, and Baoacteriodetes) that together accounted for only 1.5% of the total bacterial abundance by 15.8, 40, and 24% (P < 0.05), respectively. This treatment also altered the relative abundance of the two dominant fungal phyla (Basidiomycota and Ascomycota) that together accounted for 72.4% of the total fungal abundance. It increased the relative abundance of Basidiomycota by 27.4% while reduced that of Ascomycota by 32.6% (P < 0.05). Our results indicate that changes in precipitation seasonality can affect soil microbial community composition at lower taxon levels. The lack of community-level responses may be ascribed to the compositional adjustment among taxonomic groups and the confounding effects of other soil physicochemical variables such as temperature and substrate availability."
Effect of sodium dodecyl sulfate and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide catanionic surfactant on the enzymatic hydrolysis of Avicel and corn stover,"Nonionic surfactants could effectively improve the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of lignocellulose, while small molecule anionic and cationic surfactants usually inhibited the enzymatic hydrolysis. The results showed that the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) could improve the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of Avicel at the concentration range of 0.1–1 mM, but it did inhibit enzymatic hydrolysis at higher concentration. Cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was used to regulate the surface charge of SDS; thereby catanionic surfactant SDS-CTAB was formed. The effect of SDS-CTAB catanionic surfactant with varied molar ratios on the enzymatic hydrolysis of pure cellulose and corn stover at various enzymatic hydrolysis environments was investigated. SDS-CTAB could increase the enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stover at high solid loading from 33.3 to 42.4%. Using SDS-CTAB could reduce about 58% of the cellulase dosage to achieve 80% of the enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stover. SDS-CTAB catanionic surfactant could regulate the surface charge of cellulase in the hydrolyzate and reduce the non-productive adsorption of cellulase on the lignin, thereby improving the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of lignocellulose."
Cu2O nanoparticle-functionalized cellulose-based aerogel as high-performance visible-light photocatalyst,"Cu2O nanoparticle (NP)-functionalized cellulose-based aerogel (Cu2O/CBA) with three-dimensional (3D) macroporous structure and abundant active sites was successfully prepared for visible-light photocatalysis via in situ deposition of Cu2O NPs on cellulose-based aerogel (CBA). Octahedral Cu2O NPs were formed and anchored onto the surface and inner wall of the cellulose matrix, which acted as a microreactor to prevent aggregation and protect the catalytic character of the Cu2O NPs. The photocatalytic performance of the Cu2O/CBA composite catalysts was evaluated using degradation of methylene blue (MB) as model pollutant. The effects of catalyst dosage, initial MB concentration, and solution pH on MB photodegradation were investigated. Use of 3D macroporous CBA improved the MB adsorption capacity and extended the absorption of visible-light irradiation. In particular, in situ deposition of Cu2O in the cellulose matrix enhanced separation of photogenerated electrons and holes via surface-adsorbed molecular oxygen, and consequently the catalytic activity. The photodegradation rate of MB by Cu2O/CBA composite catalyst reached 95.79%, much higher than the value of 73.59% for pure Cu2O. The photodegradation process on the Cu2O/CBA composite catalysts followed an apparent pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The Cu2O/CBA composite catalyst was easily recycled and reused, with 80% MB degradation rate retained even after six cycles of irradiation for 30 min each. Such Cu2O/CBA composite catalysts can be applied for wastewater treatment utilizing solar radiation."
"Synthesis and evaluation of an efficient, durable, and environmentally friendly flame retardant for cotton","An efficient and durable formaldehyde-free flame retardant consisting of an ammonium salt of pentaerythritol tetraphosphoric acid (APTTP) was prepared by a solventless synthesis and characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. The flame retardancy of the treated cotton fabric was enhanced, as assessed by limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical flammability, and cone calorimetry measurements. The collected results demonstrated that cotton fabrics treated with APTTP exhibited high flame retardancy and excellent durability. Cotton fabric treated with a 140 g/L APTTP solution showed a LOI of 43.8%, and this value reduced to 26.9% after 50 laundering cycles. No after-flame and after-glow phenomena were presented during vertical flammability tests for all cotton fabrics treated with different concentrations of APTTP. Cone calorimetry results revealed a significant reduction in the intensity of the heat release rate and total heat release peaks. X-ray diffraction revealed that the crystalline particles of cotton fibers treated with APTTP were slightly affected compared with those of control sample. FT-IR spectroscopy results revealed that APTTP was grafted on the cotton fibers. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the surface of the treated cotton fibers remained smooth, while thermogravimetric analysis confirmed that the treated cotton fibers easily decomposed to form char. It was proposed that the flame retardant mechanism of APTTP occurred in the condensation phase."
A comparative study of spatial interpolation methods for determining fishery resources density in the Yellow Sea,"Spatial interpolation is a common tool used in the study of fishery ecology, especially for the construction of ecosystem models. To develop an appropriate interpolation method of determining fishery resources density in the Yellow Sea, we tested four frequently used methods, including inverse distance weighted interpolation (IDW), global polynomial interpolation (GPI), local polynomial interpolation (LPI) and ordinary kriging (OK). A cross-validation diagnostic was used to analyze the efficacy of interpolation, and a visual examination was conducted to evaluate the spatial performance of the different methods. The results showed that the original data were not normally distributed. A log transformation was then used to make the data fit a normal distribution. During four survey periods, an exponential model was shown to be the best semivariogram model in August and October 2014, while data from January and May 2015 exhibited the pure nugget effect. Using a paired-samples t test, no significant differences (P>0.05) between predicted and observed data were found in all four of the interpolation methods during the four survey periods. Results of the cross-validation diagnostic demonstrated that OK performed the best in August 2014, while IDW performed better during the other three survey periods. The GPI and LPI methods had relatively poor interpolation results compared to IDW and OK. With respect to the spatial distribution, OK was balanced and was not as disconnected as IDW nor as overly smooth as GPI and LPI, although OK still produced a few “bull’s-eye” patterns in some areas. However, the degree of autocorrelation sometimes limits the application of OK. Thus, OK is highly recommended if data are spatially autocorrelated. With respect to feasibility and accuracy, we recommend IDW to be used as a routine interpolation method. IDW is more accurate than GPI and LPI and has a combination of desirable properties, such as easy accessibility and rapid processing."
Long duplication of 18S ribosomal DNA in Cynoglossus lineolatus (Pleuronectiformes: Cynoglossidae): novel molecular evidence for unequal crossing over model,"Although 18S rDNA sequence is extremely conservative, the polymorphism still has been found in few species. In the present study, three types (Type A, B and C) of 18S rDNA sequence coexisted in Cynoglossus lineolatus genome, suggesting a non-concerted evolution process, rather than a strictly concerted evolution fashion. Based on the differences of sequence variation, GC content, secondary structure and minimum free energy, Types A and B were speculated as the potential pseudogenes. Additionally, a fascinating finding was a 189-bp duplication of 18S rDNA in Type A sequence. To our knowledge, this is the first report on such a long duplication in teleostean ribosomal DNA. Compared with several theories accounting for the formation of tandem repeats, the unequal crossing over model was thought to be the most likely mechanism to generate the 189-bp duplication of 18S rDNA. These results not only provide a novel molecular evidence for the unequal crossing over model, but also benefit for the further study on 18S rDNA in fishes."
SST diurnal warming in the China seas and northwestern Pacific Ocean using MTSAT satellite observations,"Hourly sea surface temperature (SST) observations from the geostationary satellite are increasingly used in studies of the diurnal warming of the surface oceans. The aim of this study is to derive the spatial and temporal distribution of diurnal warming in the China seas and northwestern Pacific Ocean from Multi-functional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) SST. The MTSAT SST is validated against drifting buoy measurements firstly. It shows mean biases is about–0.2°C and standard deviation is about 0.6°C comparable to other satellite SST accuracy. The results show that the tropics, mid-latitudes controlled by subtropical high and marginal seas are frequently affected by large diurnal warming. The Kuroshio and its extension regions are smaller compared with the surrounding regions. A clear seasonal signal, peaking at spring and summer can be seen from the long time series of diurnal warming in the domain in average. It may due to large insolation and low wind speed in spring and summer, while the winter being the opposite. Surface wind speed modulates the amplitude of the diurnal cycle by influencing the surface heat flux and by determining the momentum flux. For the shallow marginal seas, such as the East China Sea, turbidity would be another important factor promoting diurnal warming. It suggests the need for the diurnal variation to be considered in SST measurement, air-sea flux estimation and multiple sensors SST blending."
Succession of causative species during spring blooms in the East China Sea: coupled biophysical numerical modeling,"In the East China Sea (ECS), the succession of causative species responsible for blooms is a recurrent phenomenon during the spring, which changes from diatoms to dinoflagellates. Observations from space and in situ cruises captured this pattern of succession during spring of 2005. In this study, we coupled two biological models, which were developed previously for Skeletonema costatum and Prorocentrum donghaiense, into a circulation model tailored for the ECS. The coupled biophysical model was used to hindcast the blooms and to test the hypothesis proposed in earlier studies that phosphate (PO4
3–) is the first-order decider of the succession. The coupled model successfully reproduced the hydrodynamics (as described in a companion paper by Sun et al.①, the spatiotemporal distribution of the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration, and the species succession reasonably well. By analyzing the effects of different factors on the surface Chl a distribution, we confirmed that the offshore boundaries of the blooms were confined by PO4
3–. In addition, we suggest that surface wind fields may modulate the horizontal distribution of blooms. Thus, during the dispersal of blooms, surface winds coupled with PO4
3– may control the succession of blooms in the ECS. The proposed coupled model provides a benchmark to facilitate future improvements by including more size classes for organisms, multiple nutrient schemes, and additional processes."
Simulations of dissolved oxygen concentration in CMIP5 Earth system models,"The climatologies of dissolved oxygen concentration in the ocean simulated by nine Earth system models (ESMs) from the historical emission driven experiment of CMIP5 (Phase 5 of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project) are quantitatively evaluated by comparing the simulated oxygen to the WOA09 observation based on common statistical metrics. At the sea surface, distribution of dissolved oxygen is well simulated by all nine ESMs due to well-simulated sea surface temperature (SST), with both globally-averaged error and root mean square error (RMSE) close to zero, and both correlation coefficients and normalized standard deviation close to 1. However, the model performance differs from each other at the intermediate depth and deep ocean where important water masses exist. At the depth of 500 to 1 000 m where the oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) exist, all ESMs show a maximum of globally-averaged error and RMSE, and a minimum of the spatial correlation coefficient. In the ocean interior, the reason for model biases is complicated, and both the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) and the particulate organic carbon flux contribute to the biases of dissolved oxygen distribution. Analysis results show the physical bias contributes more. Simulation bias of important water masses such as North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) indicated by distributions of MOCs greatly affects the distributions of oxygen in north Atlantic, Southern Ocean and north Pacific, respectively. Although the model simulations of oxygen differ greatly from each other in the ocean interior, the multi-model mean shows a better agreement with the observation."
Habitat suitability of Scapharca subcrenata (Lischke) in the shallow water of the Xiaoheishan Island,"The habitat suitability index (HSI) model was used to identify potential sites for sustainable restoration of ark shell, Scapharca subcrenata (Lischke), in the shallow water of Xiaoheishan Island, using a geographic information system framework. The seven input variables of the HSI model were sediment composition, water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, water depth, pH, and ammonia. A non-linear suitability function for each variable factor was used to transform the value into a normalized quality index ranging from 0 (nonsuitability) to 1 (best suitability). In present study, the analysis of habitat suitability was conducted for four seasons respectively. The majority of the study area has a high HSI value (>0.6) year round, which implies a strong suitability for restoration, with the optimal habitat located on the eastern side of the island. Correspondence analysis indicated that water temperature was the main factor causing seasonal variation, while sediment composition and water depth were the two major reasons for the differences in sites. The results of this work could provide support for restoration decision making through identification of potential sites for sustainable establishment of S. subcrenata."
Low-Power High-Linearity Switching Procedure for Charge-Redistribution SAR ADC,"An energy-efficient capacitive switching scheme in successive approximation register (SAR) analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) is proposed for biomedical applications. With novel sequence initialization and by reducing the up-switching steps during the A/D conversion, the average switching energy of this proposed procedure is reduced by over 98.7% compared with the conventional architecture after taking the parasitic capacitance into consideration. The number of capacitors in the proposed capacitor array is just 1/4 of that in the conventional switching scheme. Moreover, behavioral simulation performed in MATLAB for the 10-bit SAR ADC shows that the linearity performance of this proposed switching scheme is much better than that of previous architectures."

Global Existence and Asymptotic Behavior of Cylindrically Symmetric Solutions for the 3D Infrarelativistic Model with Radiation,"In this paper, we establish the global existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behavior of cylindrically symmetric solutions for the 3D infrarelativistic model with radiation in \(H^i\times (H^i)^3\times H^i\times H^{i+1}\;(i=1,2,4)\). The key point is that the smallness of initial data is not needed."
Verifiable Quantum Encryption and its Practical Applications,"In this paper, we present a novel verifiable quantum encryption scheme, in which a sender encrypts a classical plaintext into a quantum ciphertext, such that only a specified receiver can decrypt the ciphertext and further get the plaintext. This scheme can not only ensure the unconditional security of the plaintext, but can also verify the validness of the plaintext. In addition, we consider its practical applications with key reuse and further present a practical application protocol for secure two-party quantum scalar product."
Microstructure and Corrosion Behavior of Laser Melted 304L SS Weldment in Nitric Acid Medium,"The manuscript presents the effect of laser surface melting on the corrosion property of 304L SS weldment in nitric acid medium. 304L SS weldment was prepared by gas tungsten arc welding process and subsequently laser surface melted using Nd:YAG laser. The microstructure and corrosion resistance of laser surface melted 304L SS weldment was evaluated and compared with that of 304L SS as-weldment and 304L SS base. Microstructural evaluation was carried out using optical and scanning electron microscopes attached with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Corrosion investigations were carried out in 4 and 8 M nitric acid by potentiodynamic polarization technique. From the results, it was found that laser surface melting of the weldment led to chemical and microstructural homogeneities, accompanied by a substantial decrease in delta ferrite content, that enhanced the corrosion resistance of the weldment in 4 and 8 M nitric acid. However, the enhancement in the corrosion resistance was not substantial. The presence of small amount of delta ferrite (2-4 wt.%) in the laser surface melted specimens was found to be detrimental in nitric acid. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies were carried out to investigate the composition of the passive film."
"Selective laser melting of ultra-high-strength TRIP steel: processing, microstructure, and properties","This paper presents results about the influence of the selective laser melting (SLM) process parameters on a FeCr4Mo1V1W8C1 (wt%) alloy regarding microstructure and mechanical behavior. Tailored parameter variation studies were performed to obtain crack-free and highly dense SLM parts. The microstructure was studied using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Auger electron spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Additionally, the mechanical properties were investigated by compression and tensile tests. The obtained microstructure is composed of complex nanoscale carbides, retained austenite, and martensite. Caused by the fast directional cooling during SLM, a completely dendritic solidification aligned in building direction occurs. Non-equilibrium segregation leads to an orderly phase arrangement of complex carbides at the boundary of the dendrites surrounded by retained austenite and martensite in the center of the dendrites. A strong work hardening behavior was observed, based on an austenite-to-martensite phase transformation (TRIP effect). This effect accounts for the outstanding mechanical properties such as compression strength of 6000 MPa, a 0.2% tensile yield strength of 560 MPa, and an ultimate tensile strength of over 1000 MPa. These findings reveal that SLM is advantageous for the processing of ultra-high-strength FeCrMoVWC tool steel."
"Influence of annealing atmosphere on the electrical and spectral properties of Gd0.8Ca0.2BaCo2O5+δ
 ceramic","For practical applications, the stability of perovskite-like oxides in various environments should be evaluated. In this work, samples of Gd0.8Ca0.2BaCo2O5+δ
 (GCBC2)were annealed in different atmospheres and at different temperatures, and changes in their spectral reflective properties, infrared radiative properties, and electrical conductivity properties under solar irradiation were investigated using thermogravimetric analyses, reflection spectra measurements, electrical conductivity measurements, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results of the study show that oxygen non-stoichiometry is dependent on the temperature and atmosphere used during the annealing process. In an oxygen atmosphere, an increase in oxygen non-stoichiometry was observed up to temperatures of 500 °C, and then a decrease at 800 °C. In a nitrogen atmosphere, oxygen stoichiometry always decreased at temperature above 400 °C. Although an increase in oxygen content had no effect on the ceramic’s electrical and optical properties, a decrease in oxygen content affected its properties significantly. Therefore, because GCBC2 has a typical insulator–metal transition under solar irradiation below 500 °C, and a low infrared emissivity in oxidized atmospheres, it can be used as a solar thermal conversion material, or for spacecraft thermal control devices in an oxidized environment."
Evaluation of morphology and photoluminescent properties of PbMoO4 crystals by ultrasonic amplitude,Lead molybdate (PbMoO4) crystals were synthesized by the facile sonochemical method at 20 kHz frequency with a variable ultrasonic amplitude and synthesis time. These crystals were structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Field emission scanning electron microscopy images were employed to observe the evolution of the crystal growth process. XRD patterns indicate that these crystals have a scheelite-type tetragonal structure. The growth mechanism of PbMoO4 crystal was proposed to explain the development stages starting with precipitates formed by particles with disordered growth to form dendritic structures. The effect of the amplitude processing applied was rather significant for the size range of the particles produced. The optical properties were analyzed by ultraviolet–Visible (UV–Vis) absorption spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The spectrum shows that the sample has a typical green emission. The origin of the PL emission spectrum of the metal molybdates might be ascribed to the charge-transfer transitions within [MoO4] clusters.
Manganese dioxide–carbon nanotube composite electrodes with high active mass loading for electrochemical supercapacitors,"MnO2–multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites were prepared for application in supercapacitor electrodes and devices. Good dispersion and mixing of the individual components were achieved using conceptually new strategies, allowing for significant improvement in the electrochemical charge storage properties. Composite C1 was prepared using chelating polyaromatic sulfasalazine molecules, which adsorbed on the individual components, allowed for their good dispersion and improved mixing by creating links between the components. Composite C2 utilized a Schiff base linkage mechanism for improved mixing between MnO2 and MWCNT. New electrochemical strategies allowed for high capacitance and good capacitance retention at high charge–discharge rates at high active mass loading, which was 30 mg cm−2. Composites C1 and C2 showed capacitances of 4.5 and 4.4 F cm−2, respectively, at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. However, composite C2 showed a higher capacitance retention at high scan rates, which was found to be 66% at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The asymmetric devices, prepared using composite C2 as positive electrodes and activated carbon–carbon black negative electrodes, showed promising performance in a voltage window of 1.6 V."
Facile synthesis of Co–WO3/functionalized carbon nanotube nanocomposites for supercapacitor applications,"Co–WO3/functionalized carbon nanotube (f-CNT) nanocomposites have been prepared by solution growth technique. The physico-chemical characterization of the prepared nanocomposites was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy techniques. The XRD analysis revealed the formation of orthorhombic phase of the prepared nanopowder. The SEM images showed the porous structured morphologies. The electrochemical behavior of the undoped and doped/f-CNT modified electrodes was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge techniques. The specific capacitance of 60.14 F/g was achieved for the Co–WO3/f-CNT nanocomposites."
Light-weight epoxy/nickel coated carbon fibers conductive foams for electromagnetic interference shielding,"A light-weight and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding conductive epoxy resin (EP) composite foam was firstly fabricated by loading nickel coated carbon fibers (NCCFs). The foamed EP/NCCFs composites with a uniform foam cell containing various NCCFs contents (0–5.03 vol%) have been fabricated via chemical foaming. The foams exhibit densities of as low as 0.45 g cm− 3. Owning to the high aspect ratio of carbon fibers and selective distribution of NCCFs in the foam structure, NCCFs could easily connect with each other and construct the conductive network in polymer matrix. As a result, the composite foams exhibit an EMI shielding effectiveness of ~33 dB and a corresponding specific EMI shielding effectiveness of as high as 77.4 dB cm3 g− 1 in the microwave frequency range of 8.2–12.4 GHz. Such composite foam would be considered as a promising lightweight and EMI shielding material in aerospace and electronics."
Exploring p type conductivity in ZnO thin films by In–N codoping for homo-junction devices,N monodoped and In–N codoped p type ZnO thin films were deposited on glass substrates by spray pyrolysis technique. XRD analysis revealed the monophasic polycrystalline characteristic and EDX spectra confirmed the better incorporation of N in ZnO matrix with In–N codoping. N monodoped film showed higher resistivity and hence cannot be useful as transparent conductor. In–N codoped films showed higher hole concentration and better mobility and are stable also. Further increase in In concentration resulted in decrease in mobility and hence resistivity increased. The optical characterization confirmed the films’ suitability as transparent conductor in various device applications. In–N codoping enhanced the optical energy gap due to Burstein–Moss effect and increase in band gap with increase in In concentration is attributed to the deterioration in crystallinity. The photoluminescence spectral analysis justified the efficacy of In in substituting N at oxygen sites as acceptors. The I–V characteristics of a diode structure fabricated with In–N codoped ZnO as p type layer and Al doped ZnO as n type layer showed the rectifying nature and confirmed the p type conductivity of In–N codoped ZnO thin film.
Van der Waals Universality in Homonuclear Atom-Dimer Elastic Collisions,"The universal aspects of atom-dimer elastic collisions are investigated within the framework of Faddeev equations. The two-body interactions between the neutral atoms are approximated by the separable potential approach. Our analysis considers a pure van der Waals potential tail as well as soft-core van der Waals interactions permitting us in this manner to address the universally general features of atom-dimer resonant spectra. In particular, we show that the atom-dimer resonances are solely associated with the excited Efimov states. Furthermore, the positions of the corresponding resonances for a soft-core potentials with more than 5 bound states are in good agreement with the corresponding results from an infinitely deep pure van der Waals tail potential."
Analytic Matrix Elements and Gradients with Shifted Correlated Gaussians,Matrix elements between shifted correlated Gaussians of various potentials with several form-factors are shown to be analytic. Their gradients with respect to the non-linear parameters of the Gaussians are also analytic. Analytic matrix elements are of importance for the correlated Gaussian method in quantum few-body physics.
Performance results of HESP physical model,"As a continuation to the published work on model based calibration technique with HESP(Hanle Echelle Spectrograph) as a case study, in this paper we present the performance results of the technique. We also describe how the open parameters were chosen in the model for optimization, the glass data accuracy and handling the discrepancies. It is observed through simulations that the discrepancies in glass data can be identified but not quantifiable. So having an accurate glass data is important which is possible to obtain from the glass manufacturers. The model’s performance in various aspects is presented using the ThAr calibration frames from HESP during its pre-shipment tests. Accuracy of model predictions and its wave length calibration comparison with conventional empirical fitting, the behaviour of open parameters in optimization, model’s ability to track instrumental drifts in the spectrum and the double fibres performance were discussed. It is observed that the optimized model is able to predict to a high accuracy the drifts in the spectrum from environmental fluctuations. It is also observed that the pattern in the spectral drifts across the 2D spectrum which vary from image to image is predictable with the optimized model. We will also discuss the possible science cases where the model can contribute."
Coefficient estimates for some general subclasses of analytic and bi-univalent functions,"In the present investigation, we consider two new general subclasses \(\mathcal {H}_{\Sigma }(\tau , \mu , \lambda , \gamma ; \alpha )\) and \(\mathcal {H}_{\Sigma }(\tau , \mu , \lambda , \gamma ; \beta )\) of the class \(\Sigma \) consisting of analytic and bi-univalent functions in the open unit disk \(\mathbb {U}\). For functions belonging to the two classes introduced here, we find estimates on the Taylor–Maclaurin coeffcients \(|a_{2}|\) and \(|a_{3}|\). Several connections to some of the earlier known results are also pointed out."
Inclusion properties for a class of analytic functions defined by a second-order differential inequality,"For \(\beta <1\), and \(\alpha \ge \gamma \ge 0,\) let \(\mathcal {W}_{\beta }(\alpha ,\gamma )\) consist of normalized analytic functions f in the unit disk satisfying"
Digestive system formation during the metamorphosis and definitive organogenesis in Apostichopus japonicus,"We studied the ultrastructure of the digestive system in late doliolaria, pentactula, and 1-month-old juvenile of the holothurian Apostichopus japonicus. In late doliolaria and pentactula, the digestive system is divided into three segments: pharynx, gut, and cloaca. Pharynx and the posterior part of cloaca are lined by cuticular epithelium and apparently of ectodermal origin. The anterior part of cloaca and the entire gut is not differentiated histologically and is lined by a single type of digestive cells, vesicular enterocytes I. These cells are characterized by large secretory granules, containing an acidic substance, found in cytoplasm. As the anterior part of the cloaca is lined by cells typical of the endodermal segment of digestive tube (vesicular enterocytes I), we suggest this part to be of endodermal origin and probably formed from the larval stomach. In 1-month-old juveniles, the structure of the digestive system grows more complicated. In addition to vesicular enterocytes I, three more types of enterocytes appear in luminal epithelium. The specific distribution of the four types of digestive cells divides the intestine into three parts, each probably performing its own function. All enterocytes develop long microvilli, which indicate the intensification of the extracellular digestion processes and an increased absorption of dissolved nutrients."
Experiments and Numerical Simulations of Pressure Effects in Apartment Fires,"The fire induced pressure and its influence on ventilation flows within a compartment have not been studied in detail previously. In this research work, we have investigated the development of gas pressure and the resulting flows in compartment fires first experimentally, by burning a series of heptane pool and polyurethane mattress fires inside a real, 58.6 m\(^2\) by 2.57 m high, apartment and then by carrying out numerical simulations of the experiments with the FDS code. The experiments were conducted with three different ventilation duct configurations to simulate three different airtightness conditions. The peak heat release rates were less than 1 MW and the burning times were about 180 s. The experimental results indicate that the gas pressure in relatively closed apartment can become high enough to revert the flows of the ventilation system, prevent escape through inwards-opening doors, and even break some structures. The peak gas temperatures under the ceiling of the burn room were about 300°C. The pool fires remained well-ventilated. The pressure ranges encountered in the experiments were between 100 Pa to 1650 Pa and the pressure occured within 50 s of ignition. We also report the FDS validation for this type of simulations and discuss the process of modelling the ventilation system and leakages."
Complex Copper Nanostructures for Fluid Sensing—a Comparative Study of the Performance of Helical and Columnar Thin Films,"This communication is pivoted to the sensing of fluids by the use of nanoengineered thin films comprised of copper nano-helixes as well as copper nano-rods, in order to study the comparison of the performance of thin films having different morphological features. For this purpose, human blood samples having different concentrations of haemoglobin are taken into account as measurands. The sensing configuration exploits the use of nanostructured metallic thin films grown over glass substrate with the void regions filled up with measurands, and the features of absorption spectra are monitored. Two different wavelengths are used along with two different values of helix pitch angle as well as slanting angle of nano-rods, and the focus is put on the effect due to these parameters on the sensing characteristics. It is observed that in the case of nano-helix structured films, pitch angle affects spectral characteristics obtained due to the generation of plasmonic waves at the interface of two partnering mediums. Upon comparing the obtained results with those corresponding to thin films comprised of slanted copper nano-rods (having different angles of inclination), it has been found that the nano-helix embedded films provide better appreciable results than those exhibited by the columnar thin films, thereby making the former kind of nanostructured mediums more useful in sensing-related applications."
Stoichiometry of animal manure and implications for nutrient cycling and agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa,"A number of studies have recommended application of large quantities of manure alone or in combination with inorganic fertilizer in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, yield responses of cereals such as maize are very modest even at manure application rates exceeding 10 t ha−1 year−1. We conducted a meta-analysis of data from 64 studies across 14 countries in SSA in order to explore variability in nutrient concentrations, stoichiometry and maize yield responses to animal manure. We observed novel instances of stoichiometry and correlations between organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) concentrations, and elemental ratios in manure. In 27% of the manure samples the C:N ratio was greater than 25 indicating that N will be potentially unavailable to crops due to net immobilization. In over 94% of the manure samples, the N:P and C:P ratios were <15 and <200 indicating net P mineralization. Therefore, decomposition rates and crop responses are likely to be N-limited rather than P-limited in the majority of the manure applied. Our analyses also demonstrate that manure application rates and N and P concentrations are less important than C:N and N:P ratios in determining maize yield response to manure. Therefore, emphasis in the future should not be on increasing manure application rates but on approaches that ensure favourable C:N and N:P ratios. Our findings also suggest the need for feeding animals with high quality diet to get better quality manure, higher crop yields and improve household food security in SSA."
Distinctive Effects of Horizontal At-Rest Pressure on Conventional Limit Pressure Results,"Pressuremeter testing plays an important role in the design of foundations, where several parameters can be deduced from a single test result. Conventional and theoretical limit pressures can be interpreted from pressuremeter tests and are considered key to bearing capacity calculations and shallow foundation designs. Limit pressure can be evaluated using different methods, all of which show discrepancies in values obtained from the same tests. Horizontal at-rest earth pressure can similarly be deduced from different methods of analysis, which also show distinctive differences in results for the same tests. This research explored the important finding that the values of the conventional limit pressure experience considerable discrepancies when using different values of the horizontal at-rest pressure. Values calculated for conventional limit pressure showed considerable increases when increasing the value of the horizontal at-rest pressure, but there was no effect on the theoretical limit pressure."
Method to Reduce Bump at Bridge Approach of Open Expressway Using Horizontal Drilling Replacement,"The physical and mechanical properties of bubble mixed light-weight soil (BMLS) were studied through laboratory penetration test, soak test and unconfined compressive strength test, and a method to treat vehicle bump at bridge approach of open expressway was put forward based on the condition, in which the BMLS was used to replace parts of road embankment by horizontally drilling holes on both sides of the embankment. Analyses show that the water absorption of BMLS can reach 25% maximally and its initial unit-weight cannot be restored after drying; after using BMLS horizontal drilling replacement, the surface subsidence and sedimentation rate gradually approach zero; and finally, satisfactory treatment performance for vehicle bump at bridge approach of open expressway has been obtained."
"Soil Deformations During Casing Jacking and Extraction of Expanded-Shoe Piles, Using Model Tests","A small-scale 1-g transparent soil model was employed to investigate soil deformations caused by casing-assisted pile jacking of plastic tube cast-in-place concrete piles. The transparent soil was made of fused quartz and a refractive index matched blended oil. Models were sliced with a laser light sheet and digital images were employed to record jacking and extraction of the casing, allowing the use of digital image correlation to derive the generated displacement fields, non-intrusively. The effects of the shoe shape as well as use of a casing to jack the pile were investigated. It was found that under unconfined conditions, soil response to jacking is significantly affected by the pile shoe shape, with displacements adjacent to a conical shoe markedly smaller compared to a flat shoe. Moreover, casing extraction results in recovery of some of the soil deformation that takes place during pile jacking."
"Black-collared Hawk Busarellus nigricollis in French Guiana: distribution, population size and breeding biology","The Black-collared Hawk Busarellus nigricollis is widespread from southern Mexico throughout Central America and east of the Andes in South America. Although rather common in most of its distribution range, little is known about its breeding biology as nests are often built in inaccessible areas. The discovery in 2013 of four nests of this hawk in the coastal region of French Guiana, where it is found near brackish or fresh water in semi-open to open country, allowed us to increase our knowledge of its breeding behavior. The population is estimated at c. 200 pairs. Aerial displays of a breeding pair cover a large area around the nest tree. The nest is a large structure of sticks with a shallow cup lined with finer branches and a layer of twigs with leaves. It is mostly built at a height between 15 and 35 m, in the crown of an isolated tree or in a tree crown emerging above the surrounding vegetation. A single egg per nest is laid in French Guiana. The fledgling period for one nest was 55 days. Both male and female incubate and feed the nestling, although the female’s share in both activities is more important. During the entire nesting period male and female add fresh twigs with leaves and to a lesser extent, fine dead branches to the nest."
Waterbirds in a floodplain: influence of spatial and environmental factors through time,"Wetlands are rapidly being lost and fragmented around the world, making it imperative to seek an understanding of the drivers of their diversity. Among aquatic assemblages, birds constitute a conspicuous group that provides many ecosystem services. Here, we use a metacommunity approach to understand the influence of spatial (distance among patches) and environmental factors (local characteristics) in wading bird (Pelecaniformes and Ciconiiformes) assemblages in a river-floodplain system through time. We tested the hypothesis that, due to the small scale of our study, spatial factors have no determinant role in waterbird assemblages, and, due to the annual occurrence of flood pulses, the importance of environmental factors varies through time, according to the hydrological cycle. We tested this hypothesis using Partial Redundancy Analysis (pRDA). We used abundance data for the birds in 20 lagoons, sampled quarterly during two years. The spatial factors did not explain variation in community structure in any sampled month, whereas environmental factors explained variation in the assemblages only in two months. Due to high waterbird mobility, the non-significance of the spatial factor is expected among lagoons in the same floodplain. Environmental factors are important in determining the community structure only in two sampled months, evidencing that their importance varies through time in the floodplain, partially agreeing with our hypothesis. The non-conformity between the influence of environmental factors on assemblages and the hydrological cycle may be due to human impacts caused by the operation of upstream reservoirs, which alter the natural flood events, and caused a long drought period previous to this study. A multiscale approach is fundamental to the understanding on how anthropogenic impacts on wetlands affect waterbird assemblages. Thus, this study contributes to the understanding of how seasonality, environmental conditions of lakes, and a local spatial scale act in structuring waterbird assemblages."
"Small territory sizes and high densities of insectivorous birds in an Atlantic Forest secondary fragment, Brazil","Demographic parameters of birds are essential to understand their ecology and delineate conservation and management plans. This becomes especially important in highly altered biomes such as the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, since the few remaining fragments bear mostly secondary forests where demographic parameters might differ from old-growth forests. Few studies about territory sizes and density have been conducted for entire bird communities or groups of species in the Neotropical region, with a bias towards Central America and the Amazon. In this work we determined territories of Atlantic Forest birds in order to assess their size and density. We conducted spot-mapping in a rectangular 40-ha plot within a 384-ha of secondary semideciduous forest fragment in Viçosa region, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. We identified 260 territories of 30 species of insectivorous birds. Mean territory size of all species was 2.4 ha, ranging from 0.5 to 7.5 ha. The mean density for all species was 21.7 pairs/100 ha, ranging from 2.5 to 72.5 pairs. The sizes of the territories of many Atlantic Forest birds were by far smaller, and the density higher, than those of conspecific or congeneric species from Amazonian or Central American forests. These geographical differences in territory size and density can be explained by at least two non-exclusive hypotheses: 1) higher primary and secondary productivity in advanced successional secondary forest fragments and; 2) density compensation, given the loss of other competitor species."
CDKN2A-p53 mediated antitumor effect of Lupeol in head and neck cancer,"The tumor suppressor protein p53 is known to control cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Lupeol is a phytochemical that has been found to induce apoptosis in different cancer types through the extrinsic pathway. As yet, however, its role in the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway in head and neck cancer has not been investigated. Here, we aimed at understanding the mechanism underlying the antitumor effect of Lupeol in head and neck cancer."
The Relationship between Hope and Life Satisfaction among Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence: the Enhancing Effect of Self Efficacy,"Among a sample of survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) residing in an emergency shelter, this study (N = 115) examined the relationship between hope, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction. Specifically, the study sought to explore if hope independently accounted for unique variance in life satisfaction over self-efficacy. First, a principal components analysis (PCA) was performed to evaluate if the 3 theorized components were present in the sample. Results of the PCA indicated hope, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction indeed loaded as distinct components. Second, to further evaluate the distinctiveness of hope and self-efficacy, both were modeled sequentially to evaluate each’s relationship with life satisfaction. Results indicated that hope was associated with robust variance in life satisfaction over self-efficacy. The overall results are consistent with hope being a unique variable important to psychological wellbeing among a sample of IPV survivors. The results may suggest a need for additional research into hope based interventions with IPV survivors that target increases in hope as a therapeutic outcome."
Investigation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) biosynthesis from mixed culture enriched by valerate-dominant hydrolysate,"The production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) with a high fraction of 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) and 3-hydroxy-2-methylvalerate (3H2MV) from mixed culture enriched by valerate-dominant hydrolysate was evaluated in this study. After long-term enrichment, the culture showed strong ability to synthesize 3HV and 3H2MV, even with acetate-dominant substrate. The ultilization of single or mixed iso-/n-valerate by the enriched culture showed that the mixture of iso-valerate and n-valerate was more efficient substrate than any single in terms of balancing microbial growth and PHAs synthesis. Besides, through comparing the kinetics and stoichiometry of the tests supplying valerate and propionate, the enriched culture with equivalent valerate and propionate (1:1 molar ratio) exhibited superior PHAs production performances to pure valerate or propionate, attaining more than 70 mol% of 3HVand 3H2MV. The above findings reveal that valerate-dominant hydrolysate is a kind of suitable substrate to enrich PHAs producing culture with great capability to synthesize 3HV and 3H2MV monomers, thus improving product properties than pure poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB); also 3HV and 3H2MV production behaviors can be regulated by the type of odd-carbon VFAs in the substrate."
Synthesis and Characterization of Novel Surfactants Based on 2-Hydroxy-4-(methylthio)butanoic Acid: 2. Non-ionic Surfactants,"This manuscript describes the study of a novel sulfoxide-based surfactant class, namely the partially oxidized 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio) butyrate esters. The acid group was reacted with a primary alkyl alcohol or alkyl amine to form esters or amides, respectively, and the sulfide was partially oxidized to the sulfoxide. These sulfoxide surfactants behave as non-ionic surfactants in response to electrolytes, and have very good water solubility with high cloud temperatures. Surface tensions at the critical micelle concentration as low as 30 mN/m were measured. These surfactants were synergistic with anionic surfactants in the mixed micelle and adsorbed surface monolayer. They exhibited fast surface tension decay, good wetting and foaming performance, and performed equally well as a nonyl-phenol ethoxylate surfactant in an enzyme-containing laundry formulation."
Factors Associated with Parental Adaptation to Children with an Undiagnosed Medical Condition,"Little is known about the adaptive process and experiences of parents raising a child with an undiagnosed medical condition. The present study aims to assess how uncertainty, hope, social support, and coping efficacy contributes to adaptation among parents of children with an undiagnosed medical condition. Sixty-two parents of child affected by an undiagnosed medical condition for at least two years completed an electronically self-administered survey. Descriptive analysis suggested parents in this population had significantly lower adaptation scores when compared to other parents of children with undiagnosed medical conditions, and parents of children with a diagnosed intellectual and/or physical disability. Similarly, parents in this population had significantly lower hope, perceived social support and coping efficacy when compared to parents of children with a diagnosed medical condition. Multiple linear regression was used to identify relationships between independent variables and domains of adaptation. Positive stress response was negatively associated with emotional support (B = −0.045, p ≤ 0.05), and positively associated with coping efficacy (B = 0.009, p ≤ 0.05). Adaptive self-esteem was negatively associated with uncertainty towards one’s social support (B = −0.248, p ≤ 0.05), and positively associated with coping efficacy (B = 0.007, p ≤ 0.05). Adaptive social integration was negatively associated with uncertainty towards one’s social support (B-0.273, p ≤ 0.05), and positively associated with uncertainty towards child’s health (B = 0.323, p ≤ 0.001), and affectionate support (B = 0.110, p ≤ 0.001). Finally, adaptive spiritual wellbeing was negatively associated with uncertainty towards one’s family (B = −0.221, p ≤ 0.05). Findings from this study have highlighted the areas where parents believed additional support was required, and provided insight into factors that contribute to parental adaptation."
"Offending Behavior, Drug Use, and Mental Health Among Foreign-Born versus U.S. Born Latino Criminal Justice Clients","Little is known about the offending behavior and recidivism factors of Latinos by nativity (U.S. born, foreign-born). The present study focused on Latinos in community corrections (n = 201) in Miami, Florida, and examined differences in criminal activity, drug use, and mental health by nativity. Data were collected utilizing convenience sampling between June 2014 and December 2015. The research question was: what are the offending, drug use, and mental health histories of Latinos involved in community corrections? Participants were mostly male (n = 120; 59.7%), White (n = 105; 52.2%), and Cuban (n = 97; 48.3%). U.S. born community corrections clients (n = 141) were more likely to report more lifetime and recent criminal activity; and more likely to report lifetime and recent drug use behavior than foreign-born Latinos (n = 60). No differences were found in recent mental health. Correctional healthcare should tailor services such as substance abuse treatment differently toward U.S. born and foreign-born Latinos."
Optimization of the Functional Characteristics of Cleaning Products Through Experimental Design,"To optimize a benchmark commercial dishwashing formulation, this paper presents a fractional factorial design procedure coupled with a mixture design in order to obtain a formulation with better properties and cost, as well as to provide an example of quick formula optimization that may also be useful for other cleaning and personal hygiene sectors. First, a fractional factorial design was performed to determine the significant effects for each response variable: viscosity, performance, foaming, and Krafft temperature. Then, a mixture design was used to determine the compositions that feature the best results for each property of interest. The determined compositions that meet the requirements with 90–95% confidence showed that improvements in the compositions can be adopted. It was possible to estimate compositions based on commercial formulations that meet the same cost per kilogram of product but with gains in detergency, foaming, and viscosity volume."
Effects of Drought Stress on Oil Characteristics of Carthamus Species,"Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) is one of the oldest domesticated crops, mainly grown as oilseed in the arid and semi arid regions of the world. Cross-ability of Carthamus species has made wild safflower species a suitable source for transferring drought tolerant genes to cultivated species. This study was conducted to investigate seed yield per plant, oil content and fatty acid composition of some Carthamus species and to identify the effects of drought stress on these measured traits. In this regard, 27 genotypes from C. tinctorius, C. palaestinus, C. oxyacanthus, C. lanatus and C. glaucus were planted in the field under normal and drought-stress conditions for two years. Results showed that some studied species differed in oil content, seed yield per plant and fatty acid profiles. As an example, the highest seed oil content (32%) was found in genotype number 22 from C. palaestinus, and the lowest (18%) was obtained for the genotype number 11 from C. lanatus. For all the species, oil content was not affected by moisture stress and did not change over different environments. Similar and stable responses of various Carthamus species for fatty acid composition indicated that hybridization between these species for genetic improvement of drought tolerance may have no adverse effects on oil quality. Considerable diversity within species for all measured traits, similarity in fatty acid profiles and almost the same pattern of changes under drought stress showed that the wild species especially the crossable ones, are good candidates to be used in breeding of cultivated safflower."
CAD-based measurement planning strategy of complex surface for five axes on machine verification,"Dimensional inspection of engineering components comprising free-form surfaces demands accurate measurement of a large number of discrete points, such that the actual shape may be fully characterized. This paper presents an on-machine verification (OMV) measurement planning strategy for CAD-based measurement of such components on five-axis machines. The main shortcoming of the conventional methodology with coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) has been identified to do with relation to repetitive position error. However, by employing the CAD model and on-machine platform, the proposed methodology maximizes the measurement accuracy, and such problem does not exist. The steps are as follow: adaptive sampling strategy is used to obtain effective measured points, probe path optimization, verification, post-processing, and measurement. The OMV process of surface on “S”-shaped test piece is implemented, and the obtained deviation is compared with another set of data measured on a coordinate measurement machine."
"X-Ray Induced and Thermostimulated Luminescence of New Fluorine Containing Compounds (Potential Luminophores, Scintillators and Dosimeters)","X-ray induced luminescence spectra in optical range of wave-lengths (200–700 nm) and thermoluminescence curves for fluoride, fluorosulphate, fluorophosphate and fluorooxalate compounds of the titanium subgroup elements with alkali metals and ammonium have been obtained. Influence of annealing and repeated X-raying on luminescence (XRL) spectra of a number of compounds has been examined. Alloy additives influence on fluorine compounds XRL spectra has been examined. Most of compounds being under study may be used as X-ray luminophores, scintillators and dosimeters. The highest intensity of luminescence was achieved for such compounds as K2ZrF6, Cs2ZrF6, Rb2ZrF6 (especially for doped K2ZrF6), K2HfF6 and CsZr2(PO4)3. Radiation drifting to long-wave range for a number of fluorophosphatezirconates in comparison with fluorides may be a positive moment in making luminophores on their base."
Construction of action for heterotic string field theory including the Ramond sector,"Extending the formulation for open superstring field theory given in arXiv:1508.00366, we attempt to construct a complete action for heterotic string field theory. The action is non-polynomial in the Ramond string field Ψ, and we construct it order by order in Ψ. Using a dual formulation in which the role of η and Q is exchanged, the action is explicitly obtained at the quadratic and quartic order in Ψ with the gauge transformations."
Emergent gravity on covariant quantum spaces in the IKKT model,"We study perturbations of 4-dimensional fuzzy spheres as backgrounds in the IKKT or IIB matrix model. Gauge fields and metric fluctuations are identified among the excitation modes with lowest spin, supplemented by a tower of higher-spin fields. They arise from an internal structure which can be viewed as a twisted bundle over S
4, leading to a covariant noncommutative geometry. The linearized 4-dimensional Einstein equations are obtained from the classical matrix model action under certain conditions, modified by an IR cutoff. Some one-loop contributions to the effective action are computed using the formalism of string states."
Production and characteristics of the recombinant extracellular bifunctional endoglucanase of the polyextremophilic bacterium Bacillus halodurans and its applicability in saccharifying agro-residues,"The recombinant alkalistable and moderately thermostable bifunctional endoglucanase gene (BhCell-Xyl) of polyextremophilic bacterium Bacillus halodurans TSLV1 has been expressed in Pichia pastoris under constitutive GAP as well as inducible AOX promoters. A higher titre of recombinant BhCell-Xyl was attained after induction (4.8 U mL−1) as compared to that of the constitutive production (2.1 U mL−1). The recombinant P. pastoris strains integrated two copies of BhCell-Xyl under AOX and GAP promoters. The pure recombinant BhCell-Xyl is a glycoprotein of 66 kDa, which is optimally active at 60 °C and pH 6.0 and 8.0. Glycosylated BhCell-Xyl exhibits higher thermostability than that of the native enzyme. The analysis of amino acids of BhCell-Xyl revealed that multiple factors are responsible for its thermostability. Kinetics and in silico analysis of the enzyme suggested that BhCell-Xyl has one active site for both endocellulase and endoxylanase activities. The BhCell-Xyl possesses a carbohydrate binding domain and saccharifies lignocellulosic agro-residues to xylo-oligosaccharides and cello-oligosaccharides, suggesting its potential application in generating fermentable sugars from renewable agro-residues for biofuel and fine chemical industries."
Balancing friends and foes: Explaining advocacy styles at global diplomatic conferences,"The growing attempts by non-state interests to influence global policy processes has attracted much scholarly interest in recent years. One important question thereby is what characterizes and explains the interactions of non-state advocates with policymakers. In order to clarify this matter, we analyse the advocacy strategies of non-state actors, more precisely whether and why they address opponents instead of more like-minded policymakers. For this purpose, we analyse evidence collected through 228 interviews with advocates who attended the WTO Ministerial Conferences (Geneva 2012) and the United Nations Climate Conferences (Durban 2011; Doha 2012). Our results show that transnational advocates predominantly target like-minded policymakers and that their activities are much less focused on their opponents. Variation in advocacy towards opponents or like-minded policymakers is explained by the alignment of non-state actors with policymakers, the salience of topics on the political agenda, group characteristics, and whether or not advocates hail from democratic countries."
Prevention of internal hernias and pelvic adhesions following laparoscopic left-sided colorectal resection: the role of fibrin sealant,"Laparoscopy has increasingly become the standard of care for patients who undergo colorectal surgery for both benign and malignant diseases. This growing experience has also resulted in more reports of postoperative complications from the minimally invasive approach to primary colorectal resection. Small bowel obstruction from internal hernias and pre-sacral adhesions is an uncommon but not negligible complication. However, there is little literature specific to this topic with recommendations for different methods to prevent it. We report our original technique of closing the mesenteric defect and covering the pre-sacral fascia by using fibrin sealant to prevent this complication."
Incidence of abdominal wall metastases following percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement in patients with head and neck cancer,"Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes are an effective modality for enteral nutrition in patients with head and neck cancer; however, there have been documented case reports of “seeding” of the abdominal wall by the theoretic risk of dragging the tube along the tumor during PEG placement. The objective of this study is to determine the incidence and contributing risk factors leading to metastasis to the abdominal wall following PEG placement in patients with head and neck cancer."
Respiratory dynamics and dead space to tidal volume ratio of volume-controlled versus pressure-controlled ventilation during prolonged gynecological laparoscopic surgery,"Laparoscopic operations have become longer and more complex and applied to a broader patient population in the last decades. Prolonged gynecological laparoscopic surgeries require prolonged pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg position, which can influence respiratory dynamics and other measurements of pulmonary function. We investigated the differences between volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) and pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) and tried to determine the more efficient ventilation mode during prolonged pneumoperitoneum in gynecological laparoscopy."
Effects of laparoscopic myotomy on the esophageal motility pattern of esophageal achalasia as measured by high-resolution manometry,"Esophageal achalasia can be classified on the grounds of three distinct manometric patterns that correlate well with final outcome after laparoscopic Heller-Dor myotomy (LHM). No analytical data are available, however, on the postoperative picture and its possible correlation with final outcome. The aims of this study were: (a) to investigate whether manometric patterns change after LHM for achalasia; (b) to ascertain whether postoperative patterns and/or changes can predict final outcome; and (c) to test the hypothesis that the three known patterns represent different stages in the evolution of the disease."
Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus conventional four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) might maximize the advantages of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) by reducing postoperative pain and improving cosmesis. However, the safety and feasibility of SILC has not yet been established. This study assesses safety, patient reported outcome measures and feasibility of SILC versus conventional LC."
"Ecological divergence of Chaetopteryx rugulosa species complex (Insecta, Trichoptera) linked to climatic niche diversification","Climate is often considered to be an important, but indirect driver of speciation. Indeed, environmental factors may contribute to the formation of biodiversity, but to date this crucial relationship remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate the possible role of climate, geological factors, and biogeographical processes in the formation of a freshwater insect species group, the Chaetopteryx rugulosa species complex (Trichoptera) in the Western Balkans. We used multi-locus DNA sequence data to establish a dated phylogenetic hypothesis for the group. The comparison of the dated phylogeny with the geological history of the Western Balkans shows that lineage formation coincided with major past Earth surface and climatic events in the region. By reconstructing present-day habitat conditions (climate, bedrock geology), we show that the lineages of C. rugulosa species complex have distinct climatic but not bedrock geological niches. Without exception, all splits associated with Pliocene/Pleistocene transition led to independent, parallel split into ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ sister lineages. This indicates a non-random diversification on the C. rugulosa species complex associated with late Pliocene climate in the region. We interpreted the results as the diversification of the species complex were mainly driven by ecological diversification linked to past climate change, along with geographical isolation."
Radiofrequency energy delivery to the lower esophageal sphincter improves gastroesophageal reflux patient-reported outcomes in failed laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication cohort,"Patients with uncontrollable gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) often undergo laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF); however, long-term there are often recurring symptoms and need for continuous medication use. Refractory LNF patients may receive radiofrequency energy delivery to the lower esophageal sphincter (Stretta) to ameliorate symptoms and medication requirements. The aim was to assess and compare long-term patient-reported outcomes of Stretta in refractory patients with and without previous LNF."
Polypoid lesions of the gallbladder: analysis of 1204 patients with long-term follow-up,"Polypoid lesions of the gallbladder (PLG) are common, and most are benign. Few lesions are found to be malignant, but are not preoperatively distinguished as such using common imaging modalities. Therefore, we compared characteristics of benign and malignant PLGs in depth."
"Theoretical study on steric effects, electronic properties, preorganization and solvent effect in host–guest chemistry of hexaprotonated form of an azacyclophane and halide anions","A theoretical study on the selectivity of hexaprotonated form of preorganized azacyclophane C3-trenphen (H6
L
6+) for halide anions in the gas phase and solution is reported. The calculated formation and interaction energies show the following trend: [F⊂H6
L]5+ > [Cl⊂H6
L]5+ > [Br⊂H6
L]5+ > [I⊂H6
L]5+. Our calculations in both the gas phase and solution, in agreement with the experimental observations, show that the H6
L
6+ host has the largest selectivity for fluoride anion. Indeed, the stronger host–guest interaction in [F⊂H6
L]5+ complex effectively compensates the unfavourable strain energy of the host and desolvation energy of fluoride anion. Furthermore, herein, the solvent effect does not change the observed trend for gas-phase formation energies. In continuation, in order to find the origin of longer X−···aromatic ring (X−···cntr) distance than X−···bridgehead nitrogen (X−···Napical) in the present complexes, the X−···C6H6 and X−···NH3 systems were simulated, respectively. The calculated interaction energies for two latter systems in different X−···C6H6 and X−···NH3 distances clearly showed that the repulsion force between X− and nitrogen atom is larger than that between X− and aromatic ring. Thus, only when there are the strong N–H···X− interactions in top of the cage, the Napical···X− distance is considerably smaller than cntr···X− one."
A coupled BEM-FEM method for finite strain magneto-elastic boundary-value problems,"The first objective of this contribution is the formulation of nonlinear problems in magneto-elasticity involving finite geometry of the surrounding free space. More specifically for the magnetic part of the problem, the surrounding free space is described by means of a boundary integral equation for which boundary elements are used that are appropriately coupled with the finite element discretization used inside the material. The second objective is to develop a numerical strategy to solve the strongly coupled magneto-mechanics problem at hand. Herein we provide a staggered scheme consisting of a magnetostatic resolution employing the above coupled BEM-FEM procedure at fixed deformation, followed by a mechanical resolution at fixed magnetic fields. This decoupled method renders the whole solution strategy very appealing since, among others, the first BEM-FEM resolution is linear for some prototype models, and the remaining mechanical resolution is analogous to nowadays classical nonlinear elastostatic problems in the finite strain range. Some nonlinear boundary-value problems are simulated to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework."
Body dissatisfaction in adolescents with eating disorders,"This study aims to analyze and compare the level of body dissatisfaction (BD) in different eating disorders (ED) subtypes. Also, the relationship between BD and certain aesthetic body shape model influence and psychological variables was analyzed."
"Place Matters in Non-Traditional Migration Areas: Exploring Barriers to Healthcare for Latino Immigrants by Region, Neighborhood, and Community Health Center","This paper identifies differences in adult Latino immigrant barriers to healthcare in the Cincinnati area in Hamilton County, OH, on three levels: by region, by neighborhood, and by community health center. Secondary data analysis was performed on 439 surveys. Respondents were aggregated by the geographic regions and neighborhoods where they live and by two community health centers where they receive care. Outcome measures included pragmatic and skill barrier indices adapted from the Barriers to Care Questionnaire (BCQ); the pragmatics index consists logistical barriers, including transportation and cost; the skills index is made up of items related to navigating the healthcare system, including communicating with physicians and completing paperwork. The results indicate that immigrant Latinos living in western Cincinnati and northern Hamilton County face significantly higher pragmatic barriers to care, while Latino immigrants going to a community health center in western Cincinnati have significantly fewer pragmatic and skill barriers than immigrants utilizing a nearby community health center. Because healthcare options for undocumented immigrants do not improve with the Affordable Care Act, community health centers will continue to serve as their primary source of care. This is particularly true in non-traditional migration areas, where immigrants tend to be isolated and lack resources. Efforts to improve access to healthcare for immigrant Latinos require place-based approaches that allow for targeted resources to improve care in these locations. This study helps to fill that need by identifying variation in barriers to care on multiple levels and offering strategies to alleviate these barriers."
Socioeconomic and Racial Disparities: a Case-Control Study of Patients Receiving Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Stenosis,"We sought to quantify socioeconomic disparities in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) at an urban, tertiary referral center."
Deism and Daoism in Washington Irving’s “Rip Van Winkle”,"Critics have noticed the Daoist gist of the 1872 Chinese version of “Rip Van Winkle” by Washington Irving. The present study discovers that Irving’s tale itself is wealthy with deist and Daoist messages. From three aspects, including Irving’s access to deism and Daoism, deist and Daoist ideas exemplified through a contrast between nature and humans, and deist and Daoist ways of thinking embodied in the hero, this paper demonstrates how the philosophical ideas are redefined through the text and the hero to function as ways of examining the new nation and articulating the self."
The organism as reality or as fiction: Buffon and beyond,"In this paper, we reflect on the connection between the notions of organism and organisation, with a specific interest in how this bears upon the issue of the reality of the organism (or in contrast the status of these notions as constructs, whether heuristic or otherwise scientifically useful). We do this by presenting the case of Buffon, who developed complex views about the relation between the notions of “organised” and “organic” matter. We argue that, contrary to what some interpreters have suggested, these notions are not orthogonal in his thought. Also, we argue that Buffon has a view in which organisation is not just ubiquitous, but basic and fundamental in nature, and hence also fully natural. We suggest that he can hold this view because of his anti-mathematicism. Buffon’s case is interesting, in our view, because he can regard organisation, and organisms, as perfectly natural, and can admit their reality without invoking problematic supernaturalist views, and because he allows organisation and the organismal to come in kinds and degrees. Thus, his view tries to do justice to two cautionary notes for the debate on the reality of the organism: the need for a commitment to a broadly naturalist perspective, and the need to acknowledge the interesting features of organisms through which we make sense of them."
Optimal air-conditioning load control in distribution network with intermittent renewables,"The coordinated operation of controllable loads, such as air-conditioning load, and distributed generation sources in a smart grid environment has drawn significant attention in recent years. To improve the wind power utilization level in the distribution network and minimize the total system operation costs, this paper proposes a MILP (mixed integer linear programming) based approach to schedule the interruptible air-conditioning loads. In order to mitigate the uncertainties of the stochastic variables including wind power generation, ambient temperature change, and electricity retail price, the rolling horizon optimization (RHO) strategy is employed to continuously update the real-time information and proceed the control window. Moreover, to ensure the thermal comfort of customers, a novel two-parameter thermal model is introduced to calculate the indoor temperature variation more precisely. Simulations on a five node radial distribution network validate the efficiency of the proposed method."
Residential end-uses disaggregation and demand response evaluation using integral transforms,"Demand response is a basic tool used to develop modern power systems and electricity markets. Residential and commercial segments account for 40%–50% of the overall electricity demand. These segments need to overcome major obstacles before they can be included in a demand response portfolio. The objective of this paper is to tackle some of the technical barriers and explain how the potential of enabling technology (smart meters) can be harnessed, to evaluate the potential of customers for demand response (end-uses and their behaviors) and, moreover, to validate customers’ effective response to market prices or system events by means of non-intrusive methods. A tool based on the Hilbert transform is improved herein to identify and characterize the most suitable loads for the aforesaid purpose, whereby important characteristics such as cycling frequency, power level and pulse width are identified. The proposed methodology allows the filtering of aggregated load according to the amplitudes of elemental loads, independently of the frequency of their behaviors that could be altered by internal or external inputs such as weather or demand response. In this way, the assessment and verification of customer response can be improved by solving the problem of load aggregation with the help of integral transforms."
Congestion management with demand response considering uncertainties of distributed generation outputs and market prices,"In recent years, much attention has been devoted to the development and applications of smart grid technologies, with special emphasis on flexible resources such as distributed generations (DGs), energy storages, active loads, and electric vehicles (EVs). Demand response (DR) is expected to be an effective means for accommodating the integration of renewable energy generations and mitigating their power output fluctuations. Despite their potential contributions to power system secure and economic operation, uncoordinated operations of these flexible resources may result in unexpected congestions in the distribution system concerned. In addition, the behaviors and impacts of flexible resources are normally highly uncertain and complex in deregulated electricity market environments. In this context, this paper aims to propose a DR based congestion management strategy for smart distribution systems. The general framework and procedures for distribution congestion management is first presented. A bi-level optimization model for the day-ahead congestion management based on the proposed framework is established. Subsequently, the robust optimization approach is introduced to alleviate negative impacts introduced by the uncertainties of DG power outputs and market prices. The economic efficiency and robustness of the proposed congestion management strategy is demonstrated by an actual 0.4 kV distribution system in Denmark."
Discordance of Somatic Mutations Between Asian and Caucasian Patient Populations with Gastric Cancer,"Differences in response to cancer treatments have been observed among racially and ethnically diverse gastric cancer (GC) patient populations. In the era of targeted therapy, mutation profiling of cancer is a crucial aspect of making therapeutic decisions. Mapping driver gene mutations for the GC patient population as a whole has significant potential to advance precision therapy."
Understanding low temperature oxidation activity of nanoarray-based monolithic catalysts: from performance observation to structural and chemical insights,"Monolithic catalysts have been widely used in automotive, chemical, and energy relevant industries. Nanoarray-based monolithic catalysts have been developed, demonstrating high catalyst utilization efficiency and good thermal/mechanical robustness. Compared with the conventional washcoat-based monolithic catalysts, they have shown advances in precise and optimum microstructure control and feasibility in correlating materials structure with properties. Recently, the nanoarray-based monolithic catalysts have been studied for low temperature oxidation of automotive engine exhaust and exhibited interesting and promising catalytic activities. This review focuses on discussing the key structural parameters of nanoarray catalyst that affect the catalytic performance from the following aspects: (1) geometric shape and crystal planes, (2) guest atom doping and defects, (3) array size and size-assisted active species loading, and (4) the synergy effect of metal oxide in composite nanoarrays. Prior to the discussion, an overview of the current status of synthesis and development of the nanoarray-based monolithic catalysts is introduced. The performance of these materials in low temperature simulated engine exhaust oxidation is also demonstrated. We hope this review will elucidate the science and chemistry behind the good oxidation performance of the nanoarray-based monolithic catalysts and serve as a timely and useful research guide for rational design and further improvement of the nanoarray-based monolithic catalysts for automobile emission control."
MicroRNA-15b silencing inhibits IL-1β-induced extracellular matrix degradation by targeting SMAD3 in human nucleus pulposus cells,To determine the role of microRNA-15b (miR-15b) in interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β)-induced extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation in the nucleus pulposus (NP).
Quantitative Viscosity Mapping Using Fluorescence Lifetime Measurements,"Lubricant viscosity is a key driver in both the tribological performance and energy efficiency of a lubricated contact. Elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubrication produces very high pressures and shear rates, conditions hard to replicate using conventional rheometry. In situ rheological measurements within a typical contact are therefore important to investigate how a fluid behaves under such conditions. Molecular rotors provide such an opportunity to extract the local viscosity of a fluid under EHD lubrication. The validity of such an application is shown by comparing local viscosity measurements obtained using molecular rotors and fluorescence lifetime measurements, in a model EHD lubricant, with reference measurements using conventional rheometry techniques. The appropriateness of standard methods used in tribology for high-pressure rheometry (combining friction and film thickness measurements) has been verified when the flow of EHD lubricant is homogeneous and linear. A simple procedure for calibrating the fluorescence lifetime of molecular rotors at elevated pressure for viscosity measurements is proposed."
Structural Analyses of Halide Alkali Lead Borate Glasses,"Glasses with the chemical formula 39PbO-1NaI- (60-X) Na2B4O7 – X CaO mol % (X = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 mol %). were prepared by the usual melt quenching technique. The density and the molar volume were determined. Ultrasonic velocities (longitudinal and shear) were measured in these glasses at room temperature. The elastic moduli, such as Young’s modulus (Y) or Bulk modulus (K) were determined and elastic properties were calculated in terms of the Makishima–Mackenzie model. The thermal stability criterion ?T was determined by using differential thermal analysis (DTA) with heating rate10 °C/min."
"Role of Silica Nanoparticles on Structural, Optical and Morphological Properties of Poly(Vinyl Chloride-co-Vinyl Acetate-co-2- Hydroxypropyl Acrylate) Copolymer","Pure silica nanoparticles (SNPs) have been successfully obtained by thermal treatment of rice husk through a sol-gel surfactant free technique. Different concentrations of SNPs were embedded within the poly(vinyl chloride-co-vinyl acetate-co-2-hydroxypropyl acrylate) (PVVH) copolymer matrix via a solvent casting method. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) confirmed the amorphous nature for PVVH combined with an increase in the amorphous regions after addition of SNPs. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis.) spectroscopy revealed the induced changes in chemical structure and optical parameters (i.e. optical energy gap E

g
, refractive index n) for PVVH/SNPs composites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to study the surface morphology and homogeneity of the prepared samples."
Identification of a previously undetected metabolic defect in the Complex II Caenorhabditis elegans mev-1 mutant strain using respiratory control analysis,"Hypometabolism may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ageing and ageing-related diseases. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans offers the opportunity to study “living mitochondria” in a small (~1 mm) animal replete with a highly stereotypical, yet complex, anatomy and physiology. Basal oxygen consumption rate is often employed as a proxy for energy metabolism in this context. This parameter is traditionally measured using single-chamber Clark electrodes without the addition of metabolic modulators. Recently, multi-well oxygen electrodes, facilitating addition of metabolic modulators and hence study of respiratory control during different mitochondrial respiration states, have been developed. However, only limited official protocols exist for C. elegans, and key limitations of these techniques are therefore unclear. Following modification and testing of some of the existing protocols, we used these methods to explore mitochondrial bioenergetics in live nematodes of an electron transfer chain Complex II mutant strain, mev-1, and identified a previously undetected metabolic defect. We find that mev-1 mutants cannot respond adequately to increased energy demands, suggesting that oxidative phosphorylation is more severely impaired in these animals than has previously been appreciated."
Different transcriptional profiling between senescent and non-senescent human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) by Omeprazole and Lansoprazole treatment,"Recent evidence suggests that high dose and/or long term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in older patients, but mechanisms underlying these detrimental effects are not known. Taking into account that the senescent endothelial cells have been implicated in the genesis or promotion of age-related cardiovascular disease, we hypothesized an active role of PPIs in senescent cells. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in gene expression occurring in senescent and non-senescent human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) following Omeprazole (OPZ) or Lansoprazole (LPZ) treatment. Here, we show that atherogenic response is among the most regulated processes in PPI-treated HCAECs. PPIs induced down-regulation of anti-atherogenic chemokines (CXCL11, CXCL12 and CX3CL1) in senescent but not in non-senescent cells, while the same chemokines were up-regulated in untreated senescent cells. These findings support the hypothesis that up-regulated anti-atherogenic chemokines may represent a defensive mechanism against atherosclerosis during cellular senescence, and suggest that PPIs could activate pro-atherogenic pathways by changing the secretory phenotype of senescent HCAECs. Moreover, the genes coding for fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) and piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 (PIEZO2) were modulated by PPIs treatment with respect to untreated cells. In conclusions, our results show that long-term and high dose use of PPI could change the secretory phenotype of senescent cells, suggesting one of the potential mechanisms by which use of PPI can increase adverse outcomes in older subjects."
Model predictive control under timing constraints induced by controller area networks,"When multiple model predictive controllers are implemented on a shared controller area network (CAN), their performance may degrade due to the variable timing and delays among messages. The priority based real-time scheduling of messages on the CAN introduces complex timing of events, especially when the types and number of messages change at runtime. This paper introduces a novel hybrid timing model to make runtime predictions on the timing of the messages for a finite time window. Controllers can be designed using the optimization algorithms for model predictive control by considering the timing as optimization constraints. This timing model allows multiple controllers to share a CAN without significant degradation in the controller performance. The timing model also provides a convenient way to check the schedulability of messages on the CAN at runtime. Simulation results demonstrate that the timing model is accurate and computationally efficient to meet the needs of real-time implementation. Simulation results also demonstrate that model predictive controllers designed when considering the timing constraints have superior performance than the controllers designed without considering the timing constraints."
Efficacy and safety of autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in elderly patients with multiple myeloma: a retrospective national multi-site cohort study,"We aimed to test the efficacy and toxicity of autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) in Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients aged ≥65 years compared to patients aged 60–64. Two hundred twenty consecutive patients (age ≥65, n = 87) with MM aged 60 and above, who underwent HCT as part of an upfront MM treatment, at four Israeli centers between 2000 and 2014 were included. A melphalan dose of 200 mg/m2 was more frequent in the 60–64 age group vs. the ≥65 age group (77 vs. 57%, p = 0.002). There were no differences between groups in median day of neutrophil engraftment, incidence of infections, grades 3–4 mucositis, cardiovascular events, or non-relapse mortality at 100 days post HCT (4.7, vs. 5%, p = 0.9). A similar rate of improvement in response level was observed (36, vs. 35%, p = 0.87). At 3 years post HCT progression-free survival (PFS) was higher in the 60–64 age group (42 vs. 29%, p = 0.04); however, it was no longer so after adjustment for disease status prior to HCT (p = 0.49). In a Multivariate analysis, melphalan doses and age did not predict PFS. There was no difference in overall survival (OS) between age groups (p = 0.2). We conclude that toxicity profile, response, PFS, and OS of HCT in aged ≥65 patients with myeloma is similar to patients aged 60–64."
Use of droplet digital PCR for quantitative and automatic analysis of the HER2 status in breast cancer patients,"Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) has been used to yield an absolute measure of nucleic acid concentrations. Recently, a new method referred to as droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has gained attention as a more precise and less subjective assay to quantify DNA amplification. We demonstrated the usefulness of ddPCR to determine HER2 gene amplification of breast cancer."
The carbon dioxide evasion cycle of an intermittent first-order stream: contrasting water–air and soil–air exchange,"Ephemeral streams and wetlands are characterized by complex cycles of submersion and emersion, which influence the greenhouse gas flux rates. In this study we quantify the spatiotemporal variability in CO2 and CH4 concentrations and fluxes of an intermittent first-order stream over three consecutive wet and dry cycles spanning 56 days, to assess how hydrologic phase transitions influence greenhouse gas evasion. Water column excess CO2 ranged from −11 to 1600 μM, and excess CH4 from 1 to 15 μM. After accounting for temporal changes in the ratio of wet versus dry streambed hydraulic radius, total CO2–C fluxes ranged from 12 to 156 mmol m−2 day−1, with an integrated daily mean of 61 ± 25 mmol m−2 day−1. Soil–air evasion rates were approximately equal to those of water–air evasion. Rainfall increased background water–air CO2–C fluxes by up to 780% due to an increase in gas transfer velocity in the otherwise still waters. CH4–C fluxes increased 19-fold over the duration of the initial, longer wet-cycle from 0.1 to 1.9 mmol m−2 day−1. Temporal shifts in water depth and site-specific ephemerality were key drivers of carbon dynamics in the upper Jamison Creek watercourse. Based on these findings, we hypothesise that the cyclic periodicity of fluxes of biogenic gases from frequently intermittent streams (wet and dry cycles ranging from days to weeks) and seasonally ephemeral watercourses (dry for months at a time) are likely to differ, and therefore these differences should be considered when integrating transient systems into regional carbon budgets and models of global change."
The Ethics of Predatory Journals,"Predatory journals operate as vanity presses, typically charging large submission or publication fees and requiring little peer review. The consequences of such journals are wide reaching, affecting the integrity of the legitimate journals they attempt to imitate, the reputations of the departments, colleges, and universities of their contributors, the actions of accreditation bodies, the reputations of their authors, and perhaps even the generosity of academic benefactors. Using a stakeholder analysis, our study of predatory journals suggests that most stakeholders gain little in the short run from such publishing and only the editors or owners of these journals benefit in the long run. We also discuss counter-measures that academic and administrative faculty can employ to thwart predatory publishing."
"Combined “post-infiltration, subsequent photochemical cross-linking” and “cross-linking and selective etching” strategies to fabricate nanoporous layer-by-layer assembled multilayers","This study reports a new method combining a “post-infiltration, subsequent photochemical cross-linking” strategy and a “cross-linking and selective etching” approach to fabricate porous multilayers incorporating weak polyelectrolytes poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), polyethyleneimine (PEI), and poly(sodium-p-styrenesulfonate) (PSS). The multilayer film is fabricated by layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of a blend of PAH and PEI in alternation with PSS to construct a composite multilayer film as a precursor. Then, 4,4′-diazido-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid disodium (DAS) is infiltrated into the multilayer films, and subsequent photochemical cross-linking is applied under UV irradiation. By taking advantage of the differences between PAH/PSS and PEI/PSS, the multilayer films are immersed into a basic solution to selectively dissolve PEI. UV-visible spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and cyclic voltammogram characterization results prove formation of nanoporous structures in the LbL assembled multilayer films. This novel way to fabricate porous films is anticipated to have potential applications in polymer and interface science."
"A thermo-sensitive OEGMA-based polymer: synthesis, characterization and interactions with surfactants in aqueous solutions with and without salt","The interactions between poly(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl methacrylate90-co-oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate10) (P(MEO2MA90-co-OEGMA10)) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or dodecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (DTAB) in aqueous solutions with and without salt are explored. The influence rule of surfactant on thermo-sensitive behavior of polymer and the corresponding mechanism is revealed. The results have suggested that both surfactants have moderate interactions with P(MEO2MA90-co-OEGMA10), which result in the formation of P(MEO2MA90-co-OEGMA10)/surfactant complexes. Meanwhile, the self-aggregation of polymer chains is hindered causing the lower critical solution temperatures (LCSTs) increase due to the electrostatic repulsion and “locking water” effect caused by surfactant head groups. Tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (Bu4NBr) and tetra-n-propylammonium bromide (Pr4NBr) can associate with SDS and form mixed micelles. Interestingly, the formed mixed micelles apt to attach on the polymer chain and the polymer-bound necklace-like structure forms in the ternary polymer/salt/surfactant system. The structure of the complexes formed in the ternary system is confirmed by 2D NOESY NMR and the interaction mode is proposed. The relations between LCST of different systems and surfactant concentrations are also established quantitatively."
"Hepatic Encephalopathy Is Associated with Persistent Learning Impairments Despite Adequate Medical Treatment: A Multicenter, International Study",Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is considered reversible regarding mental status but may not be cognitively in single-center studies.
Optimisation of enzymatic production of sulforaphane in broccoli sprouts and their total antioxidant activity at different growth and storage days,"Sulforaphane, a type of isothiocyanate hydrolysed from glucosinolate, is a powerful anticancer compound naturally found in food especially in broccoli sprouts. Despite the function of sulforaphane has been extensively studied in recent years, little attention has been given to methods that can maximize the production of this compound in broccoli sprouts. The present study optimised the enzymolysis conditions for sulforaphane production in broccoli sprouts using response surface methodology. The maximum sulforaphane production (246.95 μg/g DW) was achieved using a solid–liquid ratio of 1:30, hydrolysis time of 1.5 h, ascorbic acid content of 3.95 mg/g DW sample, and temperature of 65 °C. The highest sulforaphane content in broccoli sprouts were 233.80 μg/g DW in 5-day-old sprouts and 1555.95 μg/g DW at day 4 of storage. The highest antioxidant activities were 37.22 U/min/g DW in 3-day-old sprouts and 35.08 U/min/g DW on 4th day of storage."
Enhancing quality characteristics of salami sausages formulated with whole buckwheat flour during storage,"This study was performed to investigate the quality characteristics of salami sausages added with different levels of whole buckwheat flour (BWF) during storage. Samples included the control (Con), addition of 1% BWF (T1), 3% BWF (T2), and 5% BWF (T3). Water activity (aw) and pH decreased with increased level of BWF. Salami sausage samples containing 5% BWF demonstrated significantly lower 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values than the control. Changes in TBA values between day 0 and 21 for T2 and T3 were less than that for control. Total plate count (TPC) of all groups significantly decreased, whereas lactic acid bacteria significantly increased after 21 days. TPC of samples added with BWF was significantly lower during storage. Inclusion of BWF seemed to be an effective means of retarding lipid oxidation and enhancing storability of salami sausages."
Skin penetration-inducing gelatin methacryloyl nanogels for transdermal macromolecule delivery,"In this study, the suitability of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) nanogels for transdermal delivery of macromolecules was demonstrated. The synthesis of GelMA nanogels (GNs) and fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) loaded GelMA nanogels (FGNs) were implemented when confined in water-in-oil nanoemulsion droplets via the photopolymerization of the methacryloyl substituents to create crosslinked nanogels. Both GNs and FGNs existed as fine particles in aqueous condition (pH 7.4) for 7 days. No distinct aggregation of nanogel particles were observed. In the MTT assay, high percentage of cell viability indicated that GNs did not exhibit any growth inhibitory effect or significant cytotoxicity. The skin penetration study results showed that FGNs permeated across the epidermis and into the dermis of a porcine model when compared to the FITC-BSA dissolved in PBS. Possible penetration routes of FITC-BSA through the stratum corneum (SC) were illustrated by visualizing the SC structure with fluorescent signals of FITC-BSA. The penetration mechanism of FGNs across the SC layer was successfully demonstrated by explaining three penetration routes (intercellular, follicular, and transcellular route). The results suggest that GNs have a potential as a transdermal delivery carrier for hydrophilic macromolecules."
Probabilistic clustering via Pareto solutions and significance tests,"The present paper proposes a new strategy for probabilistic (often called model-based) clustering. It is well known that local maxima of mixture likelihoods can be used to partition an underlying data set. However, local maxima are rarely unique. Therefore, it remains to select the reasonable solutions, and in particular the desired one. Credible partitions are usually recognized by separation (and cohesion) of their clusters. We use here the p values provided by the classical tests of Wilks, Hotelling, and Behrens–Fisher to single out those solutions that are well separated by location. It has been shown that reasonable solutions to a clustering problem are related to Pareto points in a plot of scale balance vs. model fit of all local maxima. We briefly review this theory and propose as solutions all well-fitting Pareto points in the set of local maxima separated by location in the above sense. We also design a new iterative, parameter-free cutting plane algorithm for the multivariate Behrens–Fisher problem."
Establishment and characterization of Caspian horse fibroblast cell bank in Iran,"Caspian horse, a rare horse breed found in 1965 by Louise Firouz in northern Iran, is a small horse which is reported to be in danger of extinction in its original homeland. There seems to be a great need to prevent extinction of this valuable horse. In this study, 51 fibroblast cell lines from Caspian horse ear marginal tissue were successfully established by sampling 60 horses using primary explant technique. Cells were authenticated and growth curve was plotted. According to results obtained, population doubling time (PDT) was calculated 23 ± 0.5 h for all cell lines. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (multiplex PCR) revealed that cell lines had no cross-contamination with other species. Bacteria, fungi, and mycoplasma contamination were checked using standard methods such as PCR, direct culture, and Hoechst staining. In addition to providing a valuable source for genomic, postgenomic, and somatic cloning researches, the established cell lines would preserve Caspian horse genetic resources. It will also create an accessible database for researchers."
EEG rhythm/channel selection for fuzzy rule-based alertness state characterization,"The aim of the paper is to automatically select the optimal EEG rhythm/channel combinations capable of classifying human alertness states. Four alertness states were considered, namely ‘engaged’, ‘calm’, ‘drowsy’ and ‘asleep’. The features used in the automatic selection are the energies associated with the conventional rhythms, \(\delta , \theta , \alpha , \beta\) and \(\gamma\), extracted from overlapping windows of the different EEG channels. The selection process consists of two stages. In the first stage, the optimal brain regions, represented by sets of EEG channels, are selected using a simple search technique based on support vector machine (SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM) and LDA classifiers. In the second stage, a fuzzy rule-based alertness classification system (FRBACS) is used to identify, from the previously selected EEG channels, the optimal features and their supports. The IF–THEN rules used in FRBACS are constructed using a novel differential evolution-based search algorithm particularly designed for this task. Each alertness state is represented by a set of IF–THEN rules whose antecedent parts contain EEG rhythm/channel combination. The selected spatio-frequency features were found to be good indicators of the different alertness states, as judged by the classification performance of the FRBACS that was found to be comparable to those of the SVM, ELM and LDA classifiers. Moreover, the proposed classification system has the advantage of revealing simple and easy to interpret decision rules associated with each of the alertness states."
An efficient local search for partial vertex cover problem,"In this paper, an efficient local search framework, namely GRASP-PVC, is proposed to solve the minimum partial vertex cover problem. In order to speed up the convergence, a novel least-cost vertex selecting strategy is applied into GRASP-PVC. As far as we know, no heuristic algorithms have ever been reported to solve this momentous problem and we compare GRASP-PVC with a commercial integer programming solver CPLEX as well as a 2-approximation algorithm on two standard benchmark libraries called DIMACS and BHOSLIB. Experimental results evince that GRASP-PVC finds much better partial vertex covers than CPLEX and the approximation algorithm on most instances. Additional experimental results also confirm the validity of the least-cost vertex selecting strategy."
Negotiating with the future: incorporating imaginary future generations into negotiations,"People to be born in the future have no direct influence on current affairs. Given the disconnect between people who are currently living and those who will inherit the planet left for them, individuals who are currently alive tend to be more oriented toward the present, posing a fundamental problem related to sustainability. In this study, we propose a new framework for reconciling the disconnect between the present and the future whereby some individuals in the current generation serve as an imaginary future generation that negotiates with individuals in the real-world present. Through a laboratory-controlled intergenerational sustainability dilemma game (ISDG), we show how the presence of negotiators for a future generation increases the benefits of future generations. More specifically, we found that when faced with members of an imaginary future generation, 60% of participants selected an option that promoted sustainability. In contrast, when the imaginary future generation was not salient, only 28% of participants chose the sustainable option."
Local-scale spatial structure and community composition of orchid mycorrhizal fungi in semi-natural grasslands,"Orchid mycorrhizal (OrM) fungi play a crucial role in the ontogeny of orchids, yet little is known about how the structure of OrM fungal communities varies with space and environmental factors. Previous studies suggest that within orchid patches, the distance to adult orchids may affect the abundance of OrM fungi. Many orchid species grow in species-rich temperate semi-natural grasslands, the persistence of which depends on moderate physical disturbances, such as grazing and mowing. The aim of this study was to test whether the diversity, structure and composition of OrM fungal community are influenced by the orchid patches and management intensity in semi-natural grasslands. We detected putative OrM fungi from 0 to 32 m away from the patches of host orchid species (Orchis militaris and Platanthera chlorantha) in 21 semi-natural calcareous grasslands using pyrosequencing. In addition, we assessed different ecological conditions in semi-natural grasslands but primarily focused on the effect of grazing intensity on OrM fungal communities in soil. We found that investigated orchid species were mostly associated with Ceratobasidiaceae and Tulasnellaceae and, to a lesser extent, with Sebacinales. Of all the examined factors, the intensity of grazing explained the largest proportion of variation in OrM fungal as well as total fungal community composition in soil. Spatial analyses showed limited evidence for spatial clustering of OrM fungi and their dependence on host orchids. Our results indicate that habitat management can shape OrM fungal communities, and the spatial distribution of these fungi appears to be weakly structured outside the orchid patches."
Investigating the Underlying Factors of Corruption in the Public Construction Sector: Evidence from China,"Over recent years, the issue of corruption in the public construction sector has attracted increasing attention from both practitioners and researchers worldwide. However, limited efforts are available for investigating the underlying factors of corruption in this sector. Thus, this study attempted to bridge this knowledge gap by exploring the underlying factors of corruption in the public construction sector of China. To achieve this goal, a total of 14 structured interviews were first carried out, and a questionnaire survey was then administered to 188 professionals in China. Two iterations of multivariate analysis approaches, namely, stepwise multiple regression analysis and partial least squares structural equation modeling were successively utilized to analyze the collected data. In addition, a case study was also conducted to triangulate the findings obtained from the statistical analysis. The results generated from these three research methods achieve the same conclusion: the most influential underlying factor leading to corruption was immorality, followed by opacity, unfairness, procedural violation, and contractual violation. This study has contributed to the body of knowledge by exploring the properties of corruption in the public construction sector. The findings from this study are also valuable to the construction authorities as they can assist in developing more effective anti-corruption strategies."
Multi-view kernel completion,"In this paper, we introduce the first method that (1) can complete kernel matrices with completely missing rows and columns as opposed to individual missing kernel values, with help of information from other incomplete kernel matrices. Moreover, (2) the method does not require any of the kernels to be complete a priori, and (3) can tackle non-linear kernels. The kernel completion is done by finding, from the set of available incomplete kernels, an appropriate set of related kernels for each missing entry. These aspects are necessary in practical applications such as integrating legacy data sets, learning under sensor failures and learning when measurements are costly for some of the views. The proposed approach predicts missing rows by modelling both within-view and between-view relationships among kernel values. For within-view learning, we propose a new kernel approximation that generalizes and improves Nyström approximation. We show, both on simulated data and real case studies, that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques in the settings where they are available, and extends applicability to new settings."
Confidence curves: an alternative to null hypothesis significance testing for the comparison of classifiers,"Null hypothesis significance testing is routinely used for comparing the performance of machine learning algorithms. Here, we provide a detailed account of the major underrated problems that this common practice entails. For example, omnibus tests, such as the widely used Friedman test, are not appropriate for the comparison of multiple classifiers over diverse data sets. In contrast to the view that significance tests are essential to a sound and objective interpretation of classification results, our study suggests that no such tests are needed. Instead, greater emphasis should be placed on the magnitude of the performance difference and the investigator’s informed judgment. As an effective tool for this purpose, we propose confidence curves, which depict nested confidence intervals at all levels for the performance difference. These curves enable us to assess the compatibility of an infinite number of null hypotheses with the experimental results. We benchmarked several classifiers on multiple data sets and analyzed the results with both significance tests and confidence curves. Our conclusion is that confidence curves effectively summarize the key information needed for a meaningful interpretation of classification results while avoiding the intrinsic pitfalls of significance tests."
Personal ties in university-industry linkages: a case-study from Argentina,"Many previous studies have advanced in identifying different modes of interactions between public research organizations (PROs) and industry and in assessing their associated benefits. However, few studies have adopted a social network perspective to analyze the relation between the characteristics of social ties and actors and specific aspects of PROs-industry interactions. Based on case-study evidence of linkages formed by researchers from a medium-sized Argentinian university, we include the strength of tie as one of the driving factors in the selection of PROs-industry channels. Following Granovetter (Am J Sociol, 1360–1380, 1973) we assess the concept of strength of tie as a linear combination of friendship, trustworthiness, reciprocity of knowledge exchange, and frequency of interaction. Using econometric techniques we find that stronger ties motivate the selection of longer-term bi-directional modes of interactions which, in turn, create knowledge benefits for PROs. In contrast, weaker ties are good enough for service provision, which creates financial benefits for PROs. These findings bring to the fore the need to conceptualize PROs-industry collaborations holistically, including the relational, social and historical nature of these processes side by side with technical and legal processes."
Identity Processes and Intrinsic and Extrinsic Goal Pursuits: Directionality of Effects in College Students,"Identity research has mainly focused on the degree to which adolescents and emerging adults engage in exploration and commitment to identity goals and strivings. Somewhat lacking from this research tradition is an explicit focus on the content of the identity goals that individuals deem important and pursue. The present manuscript describes two longitudinal studies sampling college students in which we examine how exploration and commitment processes relate to intrinsic and extrinsic goal pursuits as defined in Self-Determination Theory. Study 1 was a two-wave longitudinal study spanning 6 months (N = 370; 77.4% women; mean age 18.24 years); Study 2 was a three-wave longitudinal study spanning 6 months (N = 458 students; 84.9% women; mean age 18.25 years). Using cross-lagged path analyses, hypotheses were supported to various degrees of convergence between studies, pointing to the extent of which results were replicated across our two independent longitudinal samples. Whereas an intrinsic goal orientation positively predicted commitment making (Study 1) and identification with commitment over time (Studies 1 and 2), an extrinsic goal orientation positively predicted ruminative exploration over time, which led to decreases in intrinsic orientation over time (Study 2). Further, an intrinsic goal orientation negatively predicted ruminative exploration over time (Study 1). The findings in for pro-active exploration processes were inconsistent across both studies, being prospectively related to both intrinsic (Study 2) and extrinsic goal orientations (Study 1). Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed."
Surface effect on dynamic stability of microcantilevers on an elastic foundation under a subtangential follower force,"For micro/nano structures, surface elasticity, surface stress and surface mass strongly affect mechanical behaviors of 1D beam-columns. This article studies dynamic stability of microcantilevers on an elastic foundation or embedded in an elastic matrix when subjected to a subtangential follower force, where the surface effects are taken into account. An exact characteristic equation is derived for clamped–free end supports. For differential tangency coefficients, the force–frequency interaction diagram is displayed and the influences of surface elasticity modulus, residual surface tension, surface mass and the elastic foundation are analyzed for conservative and non-conservative compressive forces. When the tangency coefficient vanishes, a cantilever column subjected to a conservative tip force is reduced, and conventional Euler buckling for a compressive axial load is recovered. When the tangency coefficient does not vanish, a generalized Beck’s column with the surface effects is tackled. When the tangency coefficient exceeds certain critical value, flutter instability take places. For a fixed frequency, the critical divergency and flutter loads as a function of the tangency coefficient are given for various surface influences from residual surface tension, surface elasticity, surface mass and the stiffness of the elastic foundation. The boundary map of stability, divergence and flutter domain is shown."
Alternative new mesenchymal stem cell source exerts tumor tropism through ALCAM and N-cadherin via regulation of microRNA-192 and -218,"Gliomas are the most common type of malignant primary brain tumors. Some treatments of gliomas exist, but they are rarely curative. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are emerging as potential modes of targeted cancer therapy owing to their capacity for homing toward tumor sites. It has been proposed that MSCs derived from various sources, such as bone marrow, adipose tissue and umbilical cord blood, can be used as cell-based therapy for brain tumors. Here, MSCs obtained from the synovial fluid of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis patients were investigated as therapeutic candidates. Specifically, we compared migratory and adhesive abilities, as well as expression levels of related genes and microRNA in bone marrow derived-MSCs (BMMSCs), adipose derived-MSCs (ADMSCs), and synovial fluid derived-MSCs (SFMSCs) after treatment with conditioned medium from gliomas. Migration and adhesion of SFMSCs increased through upregulation of the activated lymphocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) and N-cadherin by microRNA-192 and -218 downregulation, similar to BMMSCs and ADMSCs. Migratory capacities of all types of MSCs were evaluated in vivo, and SFMSCs migrated intensively toward gliomas. These results suggest that SFMSCs have potential for use in cell-based antitumor therapies."
"Shear heating by translational brittle reverse faulting along a single, sharp and straight fault plane","Shear heating by reverse faulting on a sharp straight fault plane is modelled. Increase in temperature (T

i
) of faulted hangingwall and footwall blocks by frictional/shear heating for planar rough reverse faults is proportional to the coefficient of friction (μ), density and thickness of the hangingwall block (ρ). T

i
 increases as movement progresses with time. Thermal conductivity (K

i
) and thermal diffusivity (\(k_{\mathrm {i}}^{\prime }\)) of faulted blocks govern T

i
 but they do not bear simple relation. T

i
 is significant only near the fault plane. If the lithology is dry and faulting brings adjacent hangingwall and footwall blocks of the same lithology in contact, those blocks undergo the same rate of increase in shear heating per unit area per unit time."
Loss or Mislocalization of Aquaporin-4 Affects Diffusion Properties and Intermediary Metabolism in Gray Matter of Mice,"The first aim of this study was to determine how complete or perivascular loss of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels affects membrane permeability for water in the mouse brain grey matter in the steady state. Time-dependent diffusion magnetic resonance imaging was performed on global Aqp4 knock out (KO) and α-syntrophin (α-syn) KO mice, in the latter perivascular AQP4 are mislocalized, but still functioning. Control animals were corresponding wild type (WT) mice. By combining in vivo diffusion measurements with the effective medium theory and previously measured extra-cellular volume fractions, the effects of membrane permeability and extracellular volume fraction were uncoupled for Aqp4 and α-syn KO. The second aim was to assess the effect of α-syn KO on cortical intermediary metabolism combining in vivo [1-13C]glucose and [1,2-13C]acetate injection with ex vivo 13C MR spectroscopy. Aqp4 KO increased the effective diffusion coefficient at long diffusion times by 5%, and a 14% decrease in membrane water permeability was estimated for Aqp4 KO compared with WT mice. α-syn KO did not affect the measured diffusion parameters. In the metabolic analyses, significantly lower amounts of [4-13C]glutamate and [4-13C]glutamine, and percent enrichment in [4-13C]glutamate were detected in the α-syn KO mice. [1,2-13C]acetate metabolism was unaffected in α-syn KO, but the contribution of astrocyte derived metabolites to GABA synthesis was significantly increased. Taken together, α-syn KO mice appeared to have decreased neuronal glucose metabolism, partly compensated for by utilization of astrocyte derived metabolites."
Quantity and electricity consumption of plug load equipment on a university campus,"The percent of energy consumed by plug load equipment in commercial buildings is on the rise. Research conducted in the past has included surveying plug load equipment, measuring plug load electricity consumption and equipment operating patterns, and studying plug load reduction solutions in office buildings, but plug load energy use across other building types is poorly understood. A university campus, which houses many building types, presents a unique opportunity to understand plug load profiles across building types. In this study, an equipment inventory was performed in 220 buildings on Stanford University’s campus, totaling 8,901,911 ft2 of building space and encompassing lab buildings, office buildings, recreation facilities, public space, and service buildings. Within these buildings, 110,529 pieces of plug load equipment were recorded. Energy consumption estimates were developed from published values and used to evaluate the aggregate plug load energy consumption of this equipment by equipment type and by building type. In total, it is estimated that the plug loads from these buildings consume nearly 50 million kWh per year and comprise 32% of the electricity consumption of the buildings surveyed. This data can be used to better target energy conservation efforts throughout multiple sectors."
Do the Rich Save More in Japan? Evidence Based on two Micro Data Sets for the 2000s,"Using two household surveys, this paper investigates whether the saving rates of richer households are higher than those of poorer households in Japan. We construct a number of proxies for lifetime wealth, including those original to this study, and find marginally positive correlations between saving rates and lifetime wealth for working age households. We further find that the relationship between saving rates and lifetime wealth differs depending on the life stage of individual households. Older households with higher lifetime wealth appear to be dissaving to some extent, which is more or less consistent with the lifecycle model of consumption."
Price and Quantity Competition in a Differentiated Duopoly With Network Compatibility Effects,"We consider the efficiency of price and quantity competition in a network products market, where we observe product compatibility with network externalities (hereafter, network compatibility effects). In particular, if network compatibility effects between firms are sufficiently asymmetric, the Cournot equilibrium is more efficient than the Bertrand equilibrium in terms of larger consumer, producer and total surpluses. Then, we consider an endogenous choice of the strategic variables, price and quantity. If the degree of network compatibility effects of the rival firm is larger (smaller) than the degree of product substitutability, then choosing prices (quantities) is a dominant strategy for the firm. Thus, if the network compatibility effects of both firms are larger (smaller), the Bertrand (Cournot) equilibrium arises. Furthermore, if the network compatibility effects between the firms are sufficiently asymmetric, the firm with a larger (smaller) network compatibility effect than a certain level of product substitutability chooses quantities (prices). In this case, the Cournot–Bertrand equilibrium arises, which is less (more) efficient than the Cournot equilibrium in terms of consumer (producer) surplus."
Dynamics of a multiplier–accelerator model with nonlinear investment function,"In this paper, we show how a rich variety of dynamics may arise in a simple multiplier–accelerator model when a nonlinearity is introduced in the investment function. A specific sigmoidal functional form is used to model investments with respect to the variation in national income, in order to bound the level of investments. In fact, due to obvious material constraints, business strategies cannot sustain infinite investments. With the aid of analytical and numerical tools, we investigate the stability conditions, bifurcations, as well as periodic and chaotic dynamics for different specifications of the model that may include or not an endogenous government expenditure. We obtain some comparative statics results that shed light on the stabilizing or destabilizing role of the various parameters in the model. Globally, we study multistability phenomena, i.e., the coexistence of different kinds of attractors with a rich and complex dynamic structure."
"Addiction and the Concept of Disorder, Part 2: Is every Mental Disorder a Brain Disorder?","In this two-part analysis, I analyze Marc Lewis’s arguments against the brain-disease view of substance addiction and for a developmental-learning approach that demedicalizes addiction. I focus especially on the question of whether addiction is a medical disorder. In Part 1, I argued that, even if one accepts Lewis’s critique of the brain evidence presented for the brain-disease view, his arguments fail to establish that addiction is not a disorder. Relying on my harmful dysfunction analysis of disorder, I defended the view that addiction is a medical disorder and a brain disorder. In Part 2, I consider some broader philosophical issues raised by Lewis’s arguments: (1) I consider a larger puzzle, at the heart of the neo-Kraepelinian program in contemporary psychiatry, that is raised by Lewis’s argument that addiction is not a disorder because the brain displays no damage but only normal learning: must all mental disorders be brain disorders, or can mental disorders occur in normal brains? I argue that mental disorders can occur in normal brains. (2) I critique Lewis’s response to the evolutionary “novel environment” approach to explaining why addiction is a disorder. (3) Lewis agrees with brain-disease proponents that interpreting addiction as brain disorder relieves addicts of moral censure, but I argue that moral defect and brain disease are not exclusive. (4) Finally, I consider Lewis’s “developmental-learning” account of addiction that encourages positive and empowering narrativizing of addiction, but I argue that the developmental-learning view is vacuous due to use of an overly broad notion of “development.”"
The crowd as a cameraman: on-stage display of crowdsourced mobile video at large-scale events,"Recording videos with smartphones at large-scale events such as concerts and festivals is very common nowadays. These videos register the atmosphere of the event as it is experienced by the crowd and offer a perspective that is hard to capture by the professional cameras installed throughout the venue. In this article, we present a framework to collect videos from smartphones in the public and blend these into a mosaic that can be readily mixed with professional camera footage and shown on displays during the event. The video upload is prioritized by matching requests of the event director with video metadata, while taking into account the available wireless network capacity. The proposed framework’s main novelty is its scalability, supporting the real-time transmission, processing and display of videos recorded by hundreds of simultaneous users in ultra-dense Wi-Fi environments, as well as its proven integration in commercial production environments. The framework has been extensively validated in a controlled lab setting with up to 1 000 clients as well as in a field trial where 1 183 videos were collected from 135 participants recruited from an audience of 8 050 people. 90 % of those videos were uploaded within 6.8 minutes."
Semi-supervised minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection for audio classification,"It is still a changing problem of choosing the most relevant ones from multiple features for their specific machine learning tasks. However, feature selection provides an effective solution to it, which aims to choose the most relevant and least redundant features for data analysis. In this paper, we present a feature selection algorithm termed as semi-supervised minimum redundancy maximum relevance. The relevance is measured by a semi-supervised filter score named constraint compensated Laplacian score, which takes advantage of the local geometrical structures of unlabeled data and constraint information from labeled data. The redundancy is measured by a semi-supervised Gaussian mixture model-based Bhattacharyya distance. The optimal feature subset is selected by maximizing feature relevance and minimizing feature redundancy simultaneously. We apply our algorithm in audio classification task and compare it with other known feature selection methods. Experimental results further prove that our algorithm can lead to promising improvements."
Jongeren verleiden uit de criminaliteit te blijven,Zomer 2016 – Zaanstad is in de greep van vloggende jongeren. Ze domineren de straat door intimiderend gedrag. Politie en politiek weten zich geen raad hoe ze deze jongeren in het gareel kunnen houden. Wat kunnen jeugdprofessionals doen om jongeren te verleiden tot ander gedrag? En hoe zien jongeren dit zelf? Dat onderzoekt Maike Kooijmans in haar proefschrift ‘Talent van de straat’ (2016).
Pijnlijke hallux na een trap bij voetbal,Een 21-jarige man meldt zich met persisterende belastingsafhankelijke pijnklachten van de linker hallux zes maanden na een voetbaltrauma. Bij lichamelijk onderzoek is er een normale functie in het metatarsofalangeale gewricht (MTP) en een palpabele drukpijnlijke afwijking aan de plantairmediale zijde van het MTP-1.
Een zwelling van de thorax,"Een 19-jarige gezonde kickbokser bezoekt de polikliniek Orthopedie met een palpabele afwijking links ventraal op de thorax. Deze asymmetrie van de thoraxwand viel pas ongeveer vijf maanden geleden op, na gewenste gewichtsreductie."
Color-singlet production at NNLO in MCFM,"We present the implementation of several color-singlet final-state processes at Next-to-Next-to Leading Order (NNLO) accuracy in QCD to the publicly available parton-level Monte Carlo program MCFM. Specifically we discuss the processes \(pp\rightarrow H\), \(pp\rightarrow Z\), \(pp\rightarrow W\), \(pp\rightarrow HZ\), \(pp\rightarrow HW\) and \(pp\rightarrow \gamma \gamma \). Decays of the unstable bosons are fully included, resulting in a flexible fully differential Monte Carlo code. The NNLO corrections have been calculated using the non-local N-jettiness subtraction approach. Special attention is given to the numerical aspects of running MCFM for these processes at this order. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties due to the power corrections induced by the N-jettiness regularization scheme and the evaluation time needed to run the hybrid openMP/MPI version of MCFM at NNLO on multi-processor systems."
"Contributions to the floristic and vegetation knowledge of Espinhaço Septentrional, Bahia, Brazil","The Espinhaço range is a mountain chain that extends from the municipality of Ouro Preto in Minas Gerais to the Chapada Diamantina region in Bahia, eastern Brazil. The Serra Geral of Licínio de Almeida (SGLA) is located in the Espinhaço Septentrional in southwestern Bahia, and its biodiversity is still poorly known. In order to contribute to a better understanding of floristic diversity and the vegetation of SGLA, we have compiled a checklist of its flowering plants and characterized the phyto-physiognomy of the different plant formations. A total of 811 species in 410 genera and 97 families are recorded in our study. Based on floristic composition and ecological parameters, we recognize five plant formations as follows: (1) deciduous forest, (2) semi-deciduous forest, (3) “Cerrado” s.str., (4) rocky fields (“Campos Rupestres”), and (5) rocky Caatinga (“Caatinga Rupestre”). Our results indicate that the SGLA is a transitional area between the “Cerrado” and “Caatinga” domains and constitutes an ecological corridor that links the northern and southern portions of the Espinhaço Range supported by 24 new occurrences recorded for the state of Bahia."
Construction of a molecular clone of ovine enzootic nasal tumor virus,"Enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV-1) is an ovine betaretrovirus that has been linked to enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma (ENA), a contagious tumor of the ethmoid turbinates of sheep. Transmission experiments performed using virus isolated from cell free nasal tumor homogenates suggest that ENTV-1 is the causative agent of ENA; however, this etiological relationship has not been conclusively proven due to the fact that the virus cannot be propagated in vitro nor is there an infectious molecular clone of the virus."
"Phase III evaluation of the insecticidal efficacy and durability of a deltamethrin-treated polypropylene long-lasting net LifeNet®, in comparison with long-lasting nets made from polyester and polyethylene: study protocol","Universal coverage of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LNs) made from polyester or polyethylene fibres has been adopted as the standard of care to control malaria among at-risk populations. To obtain a WHO recommendation, LNs must undergo prospective monitoring of insecticidal efficacy against mosquito vectors over 3 years of household use. The retention of bioefficacy and physical durability of a LN is influenced by net usage practices, textile polymer material and insecticide treatment technology. Fabric durability is the critical factor which determines the interval required between LN replacement campaigns. To investigate factors known to affect LN durability and bioefficacy, we describe a three-arm WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) Phase III evaluation of a LN made uniquely from polypropylene (LifeNet®, Bayer CropScience) compared to standard LNs made from polyester and polyethylene, all treated with deltamethrin, over 3 years of use."
Effect of chlorhexidine pretreatment on bacterial contamination at rhinoplasty field,This study investigated on bacterial contamination of the rhinoplasty field. The effect of preoperative chlorhexidine treatment on decreasing bacterial contamination in the rhinoplasty field is examined.
The choice between a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor- and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimen for initiation of antiretroviral treatment – results from an observational study in Germany,This study aims at identifying predictors of the treatment decision of German physicians with regard to a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) -based initial treatment regimen.
Grafted c-kit+/SSEA1− eye-wall progenitor cells delay retinal degeneration in mice by regulating neural plasticity and forming new graft-to-host synapses,"Despite diverse pathogenesis, the common pathological change observed in age-related macular degeneration and in most hereditary retinal degeneration (RD) diseases is photoreceptor loss. Photoreceptor replacement by cell transplantation may be a feasible treatment for RD. The major obstacles to clinical translation of stem cell-based cell therapy in RD remain the difficulty of obtaining sufficient quantities of appropriate and safe donor cells and the poor integration of grafted stem cell-derived photoreceptors into the remaining retinal circuitry."
The Fu–Yau equation with negative slope parameter,"The Fu–Yau equation is an equation introduced by Fu and Yau as a generalization to arbitrary dimensions of an ansatz for the Strominger system. As in the Strominger system, it depends on a slope parameter \(\alpha ^{\prime }\). The equation was solved in dimension 2 by Fu and Yau in two successive papers for \(\alpha ^{\prime }>0\), and for \(\alpha ^{\prime }<0\). In the present paper, we solve the Fu–Yau equation in arbitrary dimension for \(\alpha ^{\prime }<0\). To our knowledge, these are the first non-trivial solutions of the Fu–Yau equation in any dimension strictly greater than 2."
Anemonefish personalities influence the strength of mutualistic interactions with host sea anemones,"The anemone–anemonefish mutualism is one of the most iconic marine mutualisms. For decades, anemonefishes have been known to protect anemones from predators, while anemones provide safe havens for anemonefishes. More recently, it has been suggested that the number of anemonefish influences the survival, growth, and asexual reproduction of anemones. Here, we build on those findings, investigating the effect of four variables (fish number, fish biomass, fish shyness, and anemone colony area), on anemone growth and asexual reproduction. The interaction between Amphiprion percula and Entacmaea quadricolor was used as a tractable system in a controlled aquarium setting. Fish and anemones were monitored in 60 tanks for 18 months, and we recorded all variables at 6-month intervals. We performed single-measure analyses and found that fish shyness, defined as the time spent in the vicinity of the anemone, significantly predicts anemone growth over the entire experiment. Further, we performed repeated-measure analyses and found that both fish shyness and initial anemone colony area significantly predict anemone growth per time period. These data suggest that behavioral variation among individual fish may be an important driver of anemone growth. More generally, this study highlights the importance of behavioral traits in mediating the strength of interspecific interactions such as mutualisms and suggests that such effects should be accounted for when investigating the dynamics of interacting populations."
Comparative phototaxis of calanoid and harpacticoid copepods,"A comparative taxonomic approach was used to examine copepod phototaxis. The sign of phototaxis, spectral responses, and intensity thresholds were examined for two species each from the orders Calanoida and Harpacticoida. Parvocalanus crassirostris is a typical calanoid, living in the water column, while P. pelagicus (Calanoida) is unusual in having a benthic association. Tisbe biminiensis is a typical harpacticoid, living on the benthos, while Euterpina acutifrons (Harpacticoida) is atypical, living in the water column. This is the first empirical study to include harpacticoid phototaxis. Tisbe and Pseudodiaptomous displayed negative phototaxis, and the sign of phototaxis for all species is likely to help them persist in their respective habitats. We suspect that the sign of phototaxis is either flexible or a prerequisite before changing habitats. Spectral sensitivity, however, is more complex and, we hypothesize, may be partially constrained by ancestry rather than fully adapted for the modern/current habitat. Pseudodiaptomous pelagicus, benthic calanoid, had a peak spectral response similar to other calanoids. E. acutifrons, pelagic harpacticoid, had a peak spectral response similar to light-adapted T. biminiensis. E. acutifrons exhibited positive or negative photoresponses dependent upon spectrum, a dual strategy unobserved in other copepods but potentially effective for maintaining vertical position. We suggest a Constrained Sensitivity Hypothesis where ancestral habitat may influence the extent and nature of modern responses."
Bluespine unicornfish (Naso unicornis) are both natural control agents and mobile vectors for invasive algae in a Hawaiian Marine Reserve,"It has been hypothesized that protecting herbivorous fishes within Marine Reserves (MRs) will help these areas to resist algal overgrowth of corals. However, we lack empirical studies demonstrating the validity of key assumptions underpinning this concept, including that herbivorous fishes (1) are permanently resident within MR boundaries, (2) routinely consume the invasive algae of concern at significant levels and (3) are not significant mobile vectors for propagules of the invasive algae. A 46-year-old MR (Hawaii Marine Laboratory Refuge, 21°27′35″N, 157°48′15″W) in waters off Oahu provided a natural setting to examine these factors with the herbivorous bluespine unicornfish (Naso unicornis) and the invasive rhodophyte, Gracilaria salicornia. We acoustically tracked five unicornfish to quantify their residency and habitat use within the MR, conducted field and laboratory observations to confirm N. unicornis consume G. salicornia, and tested the viability of G. salicornia fragments recovered from unicornfish feces. Unicornfish were resident within the MR where they spent most time in reef crest habitat with occasional, brief forays into reef flat habitat. We confirmed unicornfish consume G. salicornia and found a significant positive correlation between algal canopy height and distance from the reef crest, presumably because grazing intensity is lower in less frequently utilized reef flat habitat. We demonstrated that unicornfish egest viable fragments of G. salicornia that resume vegetative growth after several weeks. We conclude that N. unicornis may act as both a natural control agent and a mobile vector for invasive alien algae."
Impact of the snow cover scheme on snow distribution and energy budget modeling over the Tibetan Plateau,"This paper presents the impact of two snow cover schemes (NY07 and SL12) in the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) on the snow distribution and surface energy budget over the Tibetan Plateau. The simulated snow cover fraction (SCF), snow depth, and snow cover days were evaluated against in situ snow depth observations and a satellite-based snow cover product and snow depth dataset. The results show that the SL12 scheme, which considers snow accumulation and snowmelt processes separately, has a higher overall accuracy (81.8%) than the NY07 (75.8%). The newer scheme performs better in the prediction of overall accuracy compared with the NY07; however, SL12 yields a 15.1% underestimation rate while NY07 overestimated the SCF with a 15.2% overestimation rate. Both two schemes capture the distribution of the maximum snow depth well but show large positive biases in the average value through all periods (3.37, 3.15, and 1.48 cm for NY07; 3.91, 3.52, and 1.17 cm for SL12) and overestimate snow cover days compared with the satellite-based product and in situ observations. Higher altitudes show larger root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) in the simulations of snow depth and snow cover days during the snow-free period. Moreover, the surface energy flux estimations from the SL12 scheme are generally superior to the simulation from NY07 when evaluated against ground-based observations, in particular for net radiation and sensible heat flux. This study has great implications for further improvement of the subgrid-scale snow variations over the Tibetan Plateau."
Spread of volunteer and feral maize plants in Central Europe: recent data from Austria,"The occurrence of volunteer maize plants in subsequent crops as well as of feral maize plants in non-agricultural areas is an essential issue in risk assessments of genetically modified (GM) maize, with regard to possible contamination of natural habitats with GM material and as contribution to the total adventitious GM content of the non-GM final product. The appearance of feral maize plants has been confirmed for non-agricultural habitats in European areas with Mediterranean climate such as Spain. However, the existence of maize volunteers and feral maize outside cultivation under Central European continental climatic conditions is considered to be extremely unlikely in those winter-cold areas. Here, field observations during 5 years (2007, 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2015) in Austria are presented that confirm the occurrence of volunteer and feral maize under Central European climatic conditions. Most of these plants produced fertile inflorescences with viable pollen and fully developed cobs. Maize kernels may reach the soil by disintegration of cobs due to disease, using crushed maize cobs for game-feeding, left overs in manure dispersed during fertilisation or from transporting and handling of crushed cobs. The evidence of volunteer and feral maize in four Federal States in Austria (Burgenland, Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Styria) emphasises the necessity to consider these hitherto under-emphasised factors in an ecological risk assessment (ERA) of GM maize as a possible source for transgenes in non-agricultural habitats, because these plants could act as bridge for the spread of GM material into semi-natural habitats. In accordance with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which states that in principle maize has the potential to survive as a volunteer or feral plant also in regions with cold winters, the investigation of the frequency of their occurrence under Central European conditions should be part of future monitoring programmes in order to assess their potential for permitting transgene spread."
Application of Focused Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction for the Quantification of Persistent Organic Pollutions in Liver Tissue of Giant Toad (Rhinella marina),"A simple and rapid focused ultrasound extraction method was developed for the determination of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in liver tissue obtained of giant toad (Rhinella marina) using a gas chromatography coupled to a mass detector with electron impact ionization. The performed method for POPs, was validated in fortified matrix, showing linearity from the LOQ up to 100 ng/mL; LODs and LOQs for each compound were between 1.7 and 4.8 and 3.5–7.5 ng/mL, respectively. Recovery rates were among 79%–116% for POPs determined. Finally, the method was applied in liver samples of giant toads found in a malarial area in Mexico. The sensitivity of the proposed method was good enough to ensure reliable determination of target analytes at concentration levels commonly found in this kind of samples."
Young adult cancer survivors’ follow-up care expectations of oncologists and primary care physicians,"Young adult cancer survivors face unique challenges associated with their illness. While both oncologists and primary care physicians (PCPs) may be involved in the follow-up care of these cancer survivors, we hypothesized that there is a lack of clarity regarding each physician’s roles and responsibilities."
Sharp regularity estimates for second order fully nonlinear parabolic equations,We prove sharp regularity estimates for viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear parabolic equations of the form
Measurement and Study of Electromagnetic Emission Generated by Tensile Fracture of Polymers and Carbon Fibres,"Electromagnetic emission (EME) signals generated by tensile fracture of four different types of polymers and three different carbon fibre types are presented and discussed. A suitable set-up for the detection of the electric field component of EME generated by fracture of solids is proposed. Basic theoretical considerations are made about the coupling between these field components and the capacitive sensors used to directly measure the short ranged and low frequency (kHz–MHz) electric fields emitted by the generation of free surface charges and their spatial movement as dictated by the vibrational motion of the crack walls. Special focus is put on solids with low conductivity, where the influences of the material on the emitted fields is small and the detected electric signals almost solely depend on the source dynamics and the sensor characteristics. Analysis of the influence of the acquisition circuit is presented. The discussion of the electric signals emitted by tensile fracture of carbon fibres and polymer specimens comprises the influences of the material properties on the signals as well as correlations between the signals and the crack dynamics, including the crack propagation velocities."
Mathematical Journey of Yakov Sinai,
Patient acceptability and experiences of therapeutic switching of proton pump inhibitors within the National Preferred Drugs initiative in Ireland,A ‘Preferred Drugs’ initiative was introduced into Ireland in 2013. This identified a single recommended drug to be prescribed to patients requiring treatment from a particular class of drugs.
The development of the SGI-16: a shortened sensory gating deficit and distractibility questionnaire for adults with ADHD,"The Sensory Gating Inventory (SGI) is a questionnaire composed of 36 items designed to investigate abnormal perception related to the inability to control sensitivity to sensory stimuli frequently reported in adult with ADHD. This questionnaire can be considered too lengthy to be taken by people with ADHD, and a shortened version is needed. One hundred and sixty-three adults with ADHD responded to the SGI-36. An item reduction process took into account both the results of statistical analyses and the expertise of a steering committee. Construct validity, reliability, and external validity were tested for a short version (16 items). The structure of the SGI-16 was confirmed by principal components factor analysis. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranged from 0.78 to 0.89. The SGI-16 dimension scores were highly correlated with their respective SGI-36 dimension scores. The SGI-16 seems to be both appropriate and useful for use in clinical practice to investigate perceptual abnormalities in adults with ADHD."
Progressieve uitval van de nervus ulnaris na een trauma,"Het cubitaletunnelsyndroom is na het carpaletunnelsyndroom de meest voorkomende compressieneuropathie van de bovenste extremiteit. Het syndroom wordt voornamelijk veroorzaakt door aanhoudende rek van of druk op de n. ulnaris, waardoor sensomotorische uitval ontstaat. Wanneer conservatieve therapie onvoldoende resultaat sorteert, is endoscopische decompressie de aangewezen behandeling. Met deze minimaal invasieve procedure kan de n. ulnaris over een langer traject worden vrijgelegd, wat bij ongeveer 60-80% van de patiënten tot goede resultaten leidt."
Een fractuur van het ravenbekuitsteeksel: conservatief of operatief?,"Het processus coracoideus, ook wel het ravenbekuitsteeksel genoemd, is een haakvormige structuur, die onderdeel uitmaakt van de scapula. Fracturen van het proc. coracoideus zijn zeldzaam en worden door verschillende traumamechanismen veroorzaakt. Deze fracturen kunnen op conventionele röntgenopnamen gemist worden vanwege overprojectie. Het missen van de fractuur heeft op termijn niet altijd nadelige functionele consequenties. Echter, bij aanhoudende klachten of een dubbele onderbreking van het superior shoulder suspensory complex (SSSC) kunnen een open repositie en interne fixatie van de fractuur nodig zijn. Een tijdige diagnose is daarom van belang."
Percutane schroeffixatie voor osteoporotische sacrumfracturen bij oudere patiënten,"Een sacrumfractuur na een laagenergetisch trauma met een voorste bekkenringfractuur dat wordt gemist, kan zeer moeizame mobilisatie tot gevolg hebben of mobilisatie onmogelijk maken. In dit artikel beschrijven wij onze ervaringen met percutane sacro-iliacale schroeffixatie bij twee oudere patiënten met (gemiste) osteoporotische sacrumfracturen. Wij concluderen dat een ogenschijnlijk ‘geïsoleerde’ voorste bekkenringfractuur ook bij oudere patiënten nauwgezette analyse verdient naar een eventuele begeleidende achterste bekkenringfractuur, vooral bij pijn ter plaatse van het sacrum of laag in de onderrug. Bij aanwezigheid van een sacrumfractuur zou bij zorgvuldig geselecteerde patiënten tijdige percutane SI-schroeffixatie overwogen moeten worden om vroege mobilisatie te bevorderen."

"Primary vegetation succession and the serpentine syndrome: the proglacial area of the Verra Grande glacier, North-Western Italian Alps","Initial stages of pedogenesis are particularly slow on serpentinite. This implies a slow accumulation of available nutrients and leaching of phytotoxic elements. Thus, a particularly slow plant primary succession should be observed on serpentinitic proglacial areas. The observation of soil-vegetation relationships in such environments should give important information on the development of the “serpentine syndrome”."
The global dynamical complexity of the human brain network,"How much information do large brain networks integrate as a whole over the sum of their parts? Can the dynamical complexity of such networks be globally quantified in an information-theoretic way and be meaningfully coupled to brain function? Recently, measures of dynamical complexity such as integrated information have been proposed. However, problems related to the normalization and Bell number of partitions associated to these measures make these approaches computationally infeasible for large-scale brain networks. Our goal in this work is to address this problem. Our formulation of network integrated information is based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the multivariate distribution on the set of network states versus the corresponding factorized distribution over its parts. We find that implementing the maximum information partition optimizes computations. These methods are well-suited for large networks with linear stochastic dynamics. We compute the integrated information for both, the system’s attractor states, as well as non-stationary dynamical states of the network. We then apply this formalism to brain networks to compute the integrated information for the human brain’s connectome. Compared to a randomly re-wired network, we find that the specific topology of the brain generates greater information complexity."
The incredible complexity of RNA splicing,"Alternative splice isoforms are common and important and have been shown to impact many human diseases. A new study by Nellore et al. offers a comprehensive study of splice junctions in humans by re-analyzing over 21,500 public human RNA sequencing datasets."
Human splicing diversity and the extent of unannotated splice junctions across human RNA-seq samples on the Sequence Read Archive,"Gene annotations, such as those in GENCODE, are derived primarily from alignments of spliced cDNA sequences and protein sequences. The impact of RNA-seq data on annotation has been confined to major projects like ENCODE and Illumina Body Map 2.0."
Comparison of a teratogenic transcriptome-based predictive test based on human embryonic versus inducible pluripotent stem cells,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) partially recapitulate early embryonic three germ layer development, allowing testing of potential teratogenic hazards. Because use of hESCs is ethically debated, we investigated the potential for human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to replace hESCs in such tests."
LL-37 boosts immunosuppressive function of placenta-derived mesenchymal stromal cells,"Although promising for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) treatment, MSC therapy still faces important challenges. For instance, increasing MSC migratory capacity as well as potentializing immune response suppression are of interest. For GvHD management, preventing opportunistic infections is also a valuable strategy, since immunocompromised patients are easy targets for infections. LL-37 is a host defense peptide (HDP) that has been deeply investigated due to its immunomodulatory function. In this scenario, the combination of MSC and LL-37 may result in a robust combination to be clinically used."
"SORL1 gene, plasma biomarkers, and the risk of Alzheimer’s disease for the Han Chinese population in Taiwan","The sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) gene, regulating the trafficking and recycling of amyloid precursor protein, has been related to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between SORL1 polymorphisms, plasma concentrations of amyloid-beta (Aβ) isoforms, and AD and MCI susceptibility for a Han Chinese population in Taiwan."
Adenosine triphosphate assay of Bactrocera dorsalis (Diptera: Tephritidae) eggs treated with low or high temperatures,"A bioluminescent adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay using a luciferin-luciferase reagent was conducted as a viability test for Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae) eggs treated with low or high temperatures to evaluate the potential into use for quarantine operations. ATP concentrations in B. dorsalis eggs treated with different temperatures, including freezing, cold treatment, and rapid and slow heating, simulating a hot water immersion treatment and vapor heat treatment, respectively, were measured. Mean ATP concentrations in untreated eggs decreased as egg age increased. For freezing and rapid heating, the mean ATP concentrations in treated eggs significantly decreased 24 h after the treatments, and the maximum ATP concentrations were lower than the minimum ones for untreated eggs. Most ATP concentrations in the cold treatment group exceeded the minimum ones in untreated eggs. Mean ATP concentrations in eggs treated with slow heating decreased less than those in eggs treated with rapid heating. There is potential to use ATP assays in plant quarantine operations for the rapid determination of the viability of fruit fly eggs treated with hot water immersion, although more validation research is first required. Verification tests should be performed by applying ATP assays during quarantine, by using flies and host fruit subjected to different temperature treatments."
Relaxation oscillations induced by an order gap between exciting frequency and natural frequency,"The main purpose of the paper is to display the relaxation oscillations, known as the bursting phenomena, for the coupled oscillators with periodic excitation with an order gap between the exciting frequency and the natural frequency. For the case when the exciting frequency is much smaller than the natural frequency, different types of bursting oscillations such as fold/fold, Hopf/Hopf bursting oscillations can be observed. By regarding the whole exciting term as a slow-varying parameter on the fact that the exciting term changes on a much smaller time scale, bifurcations sets of the generalized autonomous system is derived, which divide the parameter space into several regions associated with different types of dynamical behaviors. Two cases with typical bifurcation patterns are focused on as examples to explore the dynamical evolution with the variation of the amplitude of the external excitation. Bursting oscillations which alternate between quiescent states (QSs) and repetitive spiking states (SPs) can be obtained, the mechanism of which is presented by introducing the transformed phase portraits overlapping with the bifurcation diagrams of the generalized autonomous system. It is found that not only the forms of QSs and SPs, but also the bifurcations at the transition points between QSs and SPs, may influence the structures of bursting attractors. Furthermore, the amplitudes and the frequencies related to SPs may depend on the bifurcation patterns from the quiescent sates."
The ultrastructure of escape organs: setose arms and cross-striated muscles in Hexarthra mira (Rotifera: Gnesiotrocha: Flosculariaceae),"Rotifers are common prey of predatory zooplankton and have evolved a suite of defensive and escape strategies to avoid being consumed. Species of the genus Hexarthra are extraordinary in bearing six highly setose, arm-like appendages that function in saltational jumps through the water column to escape predation. To date, there are no observations on the structure of these escape organs despite their exceptionality within Rotifera. Here, we apply transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to study the ultrastructure of the arm-like appendages, their setae, and their muscle supply. TEM reveals that the arms are hollow extensions of the trunk integument with a similar ultrastructure. The integument is entirely syncytial. The syncytium is bordered apically by a double-layered plasma membrane beneath which is a layered cytoplasm: The top layer is a thin and fibrous intracytoplasmic lamina and the bottom layer is an electron lucent region containing cellular organelles bounded by a basal plasma membrane and thin basal lamina. Arm spines are hollow evaginations of the integument with no special ultrastructure. The arms terminate in primary setae that give rise to secondary setae, all of which possess an ultrastructure similar to the arms. There are two types of primary setae: unarticulated setae that are direct extensions of the arm integument, and articulated setae that fit into a ball-and-socket-type joint in the arm. Neither type is innervated nor supplied with muscles. The skeletal muscles in the trunk and arms are all cross-striated with distinct sarcomeres. All muscles are richly supplied with glycogen granules and mitochondria. A complex sarcotubular system supplies the myofibrils and is proximal to dense regions of glycogen, suggesting a glycolytic pathway for fast ATP production and the rapid release and reuptake of Ca2+ for muscle contraction."
Magneto-optical Studies of Noble Metal-Magnetic Dielectric Systems,"The extraordinary optical transmission and Faraday effects of the bilayer heterostructure consisting of a metallic film perforated with subwavelength hole arrays and a uniform dielectric film magnetized perpendicular to its plane were systematically studied by three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method. Results of the calculation found that for the magneto-plasmonic crystals under polarized incident light with transverse magnetic mode, the resonant transmittance reached 36.9%, the Faraday rotation acquired 1.216°, and the ellipticity got a positive value of 0.840. The value of Faraday rotation and ellipticity is respectively 15.2 and 93.3 times enhancement of the 0.08° and −0.009 of the bare BIG film at the wavelength. In the transverse electric mode, the Faraday effects of the systems also had a large enhancement in contrast to the bare magnetic film. The magneto-optical effects of the systems could be manipulated by polarization mode of incident light, geometry of perforated subwavelength hole arrays, and thickness of metallic and magnetic films. Evolution of the magneto-optical properties on the structural parameters was also analyzed. Possible mechanisms underlying the extraordinary phenomena were profoundly discussed. All these results indicated that the systems could find potential applications in magneto-optical devices such as data storages, sensors, and telecommunications."
High-Efficiency All-Dielectric Metasurfaces for Broadband Polarization Conversion,"We have presented two polarization convertors based on amorphous silicon metasurfaces. Results show that the cross-polarized transmission of the first polarization convertor is over 90% with over 95% polarization conversion efficiency across the 300-nm bandwidth and maintains high-efficiency performance with big incident angles in this bandwidth. To steer cross-polarized light with an angle according to the generalized Snell’s law, we have created another polarization convertor by choosing several resonators with different geometries in one supercell, achieving full 2π phase control, guiding the co-polarized and cross-polarized transmitted light spatially separated efficiently with broadband operation."
"Leaf photosynthetic rate, growth, and morphology of lettuce under different fractions of red, blue, and green light from light-emitting diodes (LEDs)","Current LED-based artificial lights for crop cultivation consist of red and blue lights because these spectra effectively promote leaf photosynthesis. However, the absence of green light could be disadvantageous for crop production, as green light plays an important role in plant development. The objective of this study was to investigate whether adding green light to different proportions of red and blue light would affect the leaf photosynthetic rate, growth, and morphology of lettuce plants. Plants were transplanted and grown hydroponically for 25 days under different combinations of red, blue (0, 10, 20, and 30%), and green (0 and 10%) light at 150 ± 15 μmol•m-2•s-1 of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). The leaf photosynthetic rate was highest under 80% red and 20% blue light and decreased significantly with the addition of green light and the absence of blue light. As the fraction of blue light increased, leaf size and plant growth decreased significantly. However, while the addition of green light considerably reduced the leaf photosynthetic rate, it did not reduce plant growth. In the absence of blue light, the plants showed symptoms of the shade avoidance response, which possibly enhanced their growth by improving their light interception. Therefore, the addition of 10% (15 μmol•m-2•s-1) green light did not have a positive effect on the growth of lettuce. Further study using higher intensities of green light is required to investigate the effects of green light on plant growth."
NaCl treatment improves reactive oxygen metabolism and antioxidant capacity in broccoli sprouts,"We investigated membrane lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, antioxidant component content, and antioxidant enzyme activity to understand how NaCl regulates the growth of broccoli sprouts. NaCl treatment significantly increased ROS and malondialdehyde content, and electrolyte permeability in broccoli sprouts. Ascorbic acid and anthocyanin content also increased, simultaneously and significantly. During germination, treatments with 40 mM and 80 mM NaCl significantly promoted broccoli sprouts growth, likely because of ability to enhance antioxidant activity, thus alleviating the effect of stress."
"Optimal levels of N, P, and K for the cultivation of single-stemmed roses in a closed hydroponic system","It is necessary to identify the optimum levels of mineral nutrients for the commercial production of single-stemmed roses in a closed hydroponic system to avoid the accumulation of undesirable ions in the root zone and to improve shoot growth and flower quality. We determined the optimal concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K) in a nutrient solution by analyzing the amount of mineral nutrients absorbed by the plant, plant growth, and photosynthesis characteristics. Rose plants (Rosa hybrid L. cv. Red Velvet) were subjected to different concentrations of macronutrients, including N (0, 10, 50, 100, 150, or 200 mg·L-1), P (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, or 100 mg·L-1), and K (0, 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, or 250 mg·L-1). The uptake of nitrate-N (NO3
-) was inhibited by high P levels, and the NO3-N concentration in the nutrient solution was significantly higher in the 100 mg·L-1 P treatment than in the other P treatments, indicating reduced NO3
- uptake by the plants. The concentration of phosphate (PO4
-) decreased considerably in all N and K treatments during the entire growth period. To ensure a sufficient supply of P for single-stemmed roses, it is necessary to increase the PO4
- concentration in the nutrient solution. Increasing the K+ level significantly increased the concentrations of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) in the nutrient solution. This may be the result of low Ca and Mg absorption from plants over the growth period. Although there was an increase in the fresh weight and stem length with higher levels of N [NO3
- and ammonium (NH4
+)], PO4
-, and K+, growth did not significantly increase at levels higher than 150 mg·L-1 N, 40 mg·L-1 P, and 200 mg·L-1 K treatments. The photosynthetic rates (P
n) increased rapidly as the concentration in the nutrient solution increased to 100 mg·L-1 N, 40 mg·L-1 P, and 150 mg·L-1 K, followed by a reduction as the ion concentrations increased to the maximum ranges. A distinct reduction of the P
n was observed in the plants supplied with nutrient levels above 150 mg·L-1 N, 80 mg·L-1 P, and 200 mg·L-1 K. Considering the nutrient-water absorption patterns, growth, and photosynthesis characteristics of single-stemmed roses, the mineral nutrient levels of 100–150 mg·L-1 N, 30-50 mg·L-1 P, and 100–150 mg·L-1 K were found to be optimal for the production of single-stemmed roses in a closed hydroponic system."
Individual-level behavioral responses of immature green turtles to snorkeler disturbance,"Despite many positive benefits of ecotourism, increased human encounters with wildlife may have detrimental effects on wild animals. As charismatic megafauna, nesting and foraging sea turtles are increasingly the focus of ecotourism activities. The purpose of our study was to quantify the behavioral responses of immature green turtles (Chelonia mydas) to disturbance by snorkelers, and to investigate whether turtles have individual-level responses to snorkeler disturbance. Using a standardized disturbance stimulus in the field, we recorded turtle behaviors pre- and post-disturbance by snorkelers. Ninety percent of turtles disturbed by snorkeler (n = 192) initiated their flights at distances of ≤3 m. Using principal component analysis, we identified two distinct turtle personality types, ‘bold’ and ‘timid’, based upon 145 encounters of 19 individually identified turtles and five disturbance response variables. There was significant intra-individual repeatability in behavioral responses to disturbance, but bolder turtles had more behavioral plasticity and less consistent responses than more timid individuals. Bolder individuals with reduced evasion responses might be at a higher risk of shark predation, while more timid turtles might have greater energetic consequences due to non-lethal predator effects and repeated snorkeler disturbance. Over the longer term, a turtle population with a mix of bold and timid individuals may promote more resilient populations. We recommend that snorkelers maintain >3 m distance from immature green turtles when snorkeling, and that ecotourism activities be temporally and spatially stratified. Further, turtle watching guidelines need to be communicated to both tour operators and independent snorkelers to reduce the disturbance of turtles."
The Public’s Stance on Prisoner Reentry: Policy Support and Personal Acceptance,"Prior research has established the public recognizes the obstacles former prisoners’ face upon release from prison, and they support various offender reentry services. Still, we do not have a solid understanding of what affects public opinion on prisoner reentry nor is it clear that support for policies also extends to individuals’ willingness to engage with ex-offenders on a personal level. Drawing on a random sample of South Carolina residents, the current study examines the extent to which citizens’ belief in offenders’ redeemability influences their support for reentry initiatives at a policy and personal level. The results of this study show support for several types of reentry services, reveal that policy-level opinions and personal-level acceptance depend on the type of services, and demonstrate that belief in the redeemability of offenders is an important predictor of the degree to which the public embraces reentry programming."
Early and Late Pathomechanisms in Alzheimer’s Disease: From Zinc to Amyloid-β Neurotoxicity,"There are several systemic and intracerebral pathologic conditions, which limit provision and utilization of energy precursor metabolites in neuronal cells. Energy deficits cause excessive depolarization of neuronal cells triggering glutamate-zinc evoked excitotoxic cascade. The intracellular zinc excess hits several intraneuronal targets yielding collapse of energy balance and impairment functional and structural impairments cholinergic neurons. Disturbances in metabolism of acetyl-CoA, which is a direct precursor for energy, acetylcholine, N-acetyl-l-aspartate and acetylated proteins synthesis, play an important role in these pathomechanisms. Disruption of brain homeostasis activates slow accumulation of amyloid-β
1−42
, which extra and intracellular oligomeric deposits disrupt diverse transporting and signaling processes in all membrane structures of the cell. Both neurotoxic signals may combine aggravating detrimental effects on neuronal cell. Different neuroglial and neuronal cell types may display differential susceptibility to similar pathogenic insults depending on specific features of their energy and functional parameters. This review, basing on findings gained from cellular and animal models of Alzheimer’s disease, discusses putative energy/acetyl-CoA dependent mechanism in early and late stages of neurodegeneration."

Waiting time of bulk arrival unreliable queue with balking and Bernoulli feedback using maximum entropy principle,"This article deals with an MX/G/1 unreliable queueing system with Bernoulli feedback and discouraging behavior of the units arriving at the service system. The maximum entropy principle is used to study the queueing indices of the system. The flow of the units is in batches with varying arrival rates and depends on the joining probabilities of the units in different system states. The server renders the essential as well as optional service on demand to the units that join the system. The server may break down while rendering any stage of the service. In order to recover the failed server, multiphase repair is required. The entropy function is constructed in terms of several known constraints and the maximum entropy principle is used to obtain the approximate waiting time. We perform a comparative study of the exact waiting time obtained by the supplementary variable technique and the approximate waiting time derived by using maximum entropy principle by taking the numerical illustration. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out to validate the analytical results."
Assessing the developing knowledge-base of product counterfeiting: a content analysis of four decades of research,"Considering the steady and rapid growth of product counterfeiting and the damage it causes to society, it is important for criminology and criminal justice scholars to assist criminal justice officials, industry practitioners, and law makers in understanding the product counterfeiting problem and developing strategies to combat it. However, for researchers to be effective in their advisory role they must first establish what is known about product counterfeiting. As a first step in this process, we investigated relevant published research through a content analysis of 47 articles discussing product counterfeiting published in criminal justice and criminology journals through 2014. We analyzed various characteristics about the articles themselves, their authors, the journals they appeared in, and the nature and extent of their focus on product counterfeiting. We conclude this study with an evaluation of the state of product counterfeiting research and recommendations for future research."
Design of fractional-order variants of complex LMS and NLMS algorithms for adaptive channel equalization,"Equalization filtering is an effective technique applied to minimize the inter-symbol interference (ISI) in multipath fading channels; the problem gets worse for higher-order constellations which are required for high data rates in today’s communication systems. The least mean square (LMS) filter is a computationally efficient and easily implementable algorithm but suffers from slow convergence; highly complex filters are required to nullify the effects of ISI. In this paper, we develop complex modified fractional-order (FO) nonlinear variants of the LMS and the NLMS algorithms and apply in adaptive channel equalization, in both feed-forward and decision feedback configurations. In addition to the standard first-order derivative, the update in the modified LMS also depends on the FO derivative of the mean square error, the final update is formed using a combination of conventional update term and a nonlinear term obtained through Riemann–Liouville fractional derivative. The step size of the FNLMS scheme in fractional part is not only a function of the input energy but also the FO. The differintegral operator working as differentiator helps improve the convergence rate because the algorithm becomes nonlinear; the fractional algorithms provide more parameters to control the rate of convergence and have simple implementation with almost similar complexity. The performances of the schemes are validated through extensive simulation results for block fading channels (frequency flat and selective) to evaluate the symbol error rate for higher-order quadrature amplitude modulation schemes, mean square error and combined channel and equalizer responses to show the improved inverse modeling of the channel. Simulation experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the traditional counterparts."
Numerical simulation of GaAs-based mid-infrared one-phonon resonance quantum cascade laser,"Non-equilibrium Green’s function method is used to analyze electronic transport in a mid-infrared quantum cascade laser on microscopic level. Basing on the excellent agreement found between calculated and experimental data, the conclusions are derived that the carrier distribution in the lower laser subband is non-thermal, and the carriers are extracted from active region both in cold and hot state. An estimate \(\tau _{3}=0.66\) ps for upper lifetime at 77 K was found which considerably differs from the value 1.4 ps evaluated from the form factors."
Relative Income Position and Happiness: Are Cabinet Supporters Different from Others in Japan?,"During the period of 2001–2006, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) adopted a market-oriented policy under the Koizumi cabinet. Using data covering the Koizumi and first Abe cabinets, the present paper attempts to examine whether the effects of relative income differ between supporters and non-supporters of the Koizumi cabinet. Key findings are as follows: within the Koizumi cabinet period, a relatively low-income position is negatively related to happiness for non-LDP supporters but not for LDP supporters. However, under the period of the first Abe cabinet, the difference in the effect of relative income for LDP supporters and others disappears. These results imply that an expectation of market outcomes leads to a difference in the effect of relative income position on happiness levels."
Bayesian Estimation of Entry Games with Multiple Players and Multiple Equilibria,"Entry game models are often used to study the nature of firms’ profits and the nature of competition among firms in empirical studies. However, when there are multiple players in an oligopoly market, the resulting multiple equilibria have made it difficult in previous studies to estimate the payoff functions of players in complete information, static and discrete games without using unreasonable assumptions. To overcome this difficulty, the present paper proposes a practical estimation method for an entry game with three players using a Bayesian approach. Some mild assumptions are imposed on the payoff function, and the average competitive effect is used to capture the entry effect of the number of firms."
Seasonal nutrient retranslocation in reforested Pinus halepensis Mill. stands in Southeast Spain,"Retranslocation, resorption and relocation of nutrients are important adaptive mechanisms developed by plants to acquire the amount of the nutrients required for growth. They are usual mechanisms in deciduous and conifer trees that occur in Mediterranean regions where drought periods are usual. Soil factors, environmental characteristics and species factors are key drivers of nutrient retranslocation in conifers but is not well understood how soil fertility or intraspecific competition influences the process. We studied retranslocation in Pinus halepensis Mill. stands showing different site quality (differences in climate and intraspecific competition) occurring in Southeast Spain. We monitored reforested mature Aleppo pine forests in stands with differences in site quality, climate and intraspecific competition. Stands were characterised, the content of nutrients of soil and green samples (twigs and pine needles) were recorded, and seasonal nutrient retranslocation was obtained. Site characteristics were related to growth rate and nutrient content of foliage and soil. We evaluated whether the retranslocation of nutrients from older to younger foliage was related to the current-year growth rate and to the nutritional status of the plant as influenced by intraspecific competition. Foliar macronutrient concentrations and the amount of retranslocated macronutrients were seasonal, with differences related to site quality and tree density. As a general trend, nutrient concentrations increased after drought (autumn) and decreased during the growth period (spring). However, some micronutrients (mainly Na and Fe) decreased during both periods. The retranslocation pattern in Aleppo pine reinforced the hypothesis that pine adaptations to drought- and fire-prone habitats are linked to the resilience of these forest types. We developed scientific knowledge to assist decision making in adaptive forest management; e.g. fertilizer recommendations or reforestation programmes."
Recommended Vs. Reported Working Conditions & Current Satisfaction Levels among Migrant Caregivers in Israel,"Living and working conditions of 111 migrant live-in homecare workers caring for older care recipients in Israel were assessed using structured face-to-face interviews. Questions pertained to the categories of living conditions, food-related arrangements, and work conditions and benefits; the most important, most satisfactory, and least satisfactory items in these categories; as well as ratings of satisfaction in these areas. Problematic areas included resting days, hours worked per day, and ability to leave during the day. Mean satisfaction ratings were high (between a large to a very large extent) and were similar with respect to living conditions, food-related arrangements, and work conditions and benefits. Reported satisfaction with salary was significantly lower (between a moderate to a large extent). Items associated with reported satisfaction levels revealed the importance of comfort and control. The data indicate that discrepancies remain between recommended and actual working conditions for migrant live-in homecare workers in Israel."
Association between microfibrillar-associated protein 4 (MFAP4) and micro- and macrovascular complications in long-term type 1 diabetes mellitus,To evaluate microfibrillar-associated protein 4 (MFAP4) as a marker of micro- and macrovascular complications in patients with type 1 diabetes.
An Investigation of Factors that Influence Acceptability of Parent Training,"Parent training is an effective intervention for parents of children with a variety of childhood disorders, including conduct problems, and parents often view behavioral parent training as acceptable. Explanations and rationales for parent training are commonly provided at the beginning of treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine whether changing the description of a behavioral parenting intervention influenced parents’ acceptability ratings and whether mothers and fathers differed in their ratings. There were 78 participants (39 mother–father dyads) in this study. Participants viewed one of two descriptions of parent training that focused on either addressing deficits in parenting skills or enhancing existing parenting skills. Parents’ acceptability of the treatment descriptions was evaluated using the Treatment Evaluation Inventory—Short Form. Participants also completed the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory and The Parental Locus of Control Scale. A multiple linear regression and a mixed factorial ANOVA were used to analyze the data. There was not a significant interaction between parent gender and parent training description type. There was also not a significant difference in the acceptability of the two parent training descriptions. However, mothers rated both treatment descriptions as more acceptable than did fathers. Results indicated that parental locus of control significantly predicted acceptability of the parent training descriptions. The results of the current study suggested that treatment acceptability was not influenced by the way that the interventions were described. Future research should focus on how to increase acceptability of parent training for fathers and parents with an external locus of control."
Nonlinearity in Simple and Complex Cells in Early Biological Visual Systems,"The nonlinear model put forward in Mahmoodi (J Math Imaging Vis 54(2):138–161, 2016) for early visual systems is investigated in detail in this paper to explain some nonlinear behaviours of complex and some simple cells. Nonlinear cells are modelled as systems with linear–nonlinear structures where the linear sub-unit is constructed by the layers proposed in Mahmoodi 
(2016) and nonlinear sub-units are the results of an axon (modelled as a transmission line) carrying a series of spikes. In this paper, the nonlinear sub-systems of complex cells are investigated in more detail to show the mechanism by which nonlinear neurons work. Here the nonlinear systems modelling nonlinear sub-units of complex cells are represented by their first- and second-order responses. Our analytical as well as numerical results show good agreements with biological recordings reported in the literature."
Trimer and Tetramer Bound States in Heteronuclear Systems,"The Efimov effect in heteronuclear cold atomic systems is experimentally more easily accessible than the Efimov effect for identical atoms, because of the potentially smaller scaling factor. We focus on the case of two or three heavy identical bosons and another atom. The former case was recently observed in a mixture of \(^{133}\hbox {Cs}\) and \(^6\hbox {Li}\) atoms. We employ the Gaussian Expansion Method as developed by Hiyama, Kino et al. (Prog Part Nucl Phys 51:223–307, 2003). This is a variational method that uses Gaussians that are distributed geometrically over a chosen range. Supplemental calculations are performed using the Skorniakov–Ter- Martirosian equation. Blume et al. (Phys Rev Lett 113:213201, 2014) previously investigated the scaling properties of heteronuclear systems in the unitary limit and at the three-body breakup threshold. We have completed this picture by calculating the behaviour on the positive scattering length side of the Efimov plot, focussing on the dimer threshold."
Development and validation of a new patient experience tool in patients with serious illness,Patients with serious chronic illnesses face increasingly complex care and are at risk of poor experience due to a fragmented health system. Most current patient experience tools are not designed to address the unique care aspects of this population and the few that exist are delivered too late in the disease trajectory and are not administered longitudinally which makes them less useful across settings.
"Interstellar isomeric species: Energy, stability and abundance relationship","Accurate enthalpies of formation are reported for known and potential interstellar isomeric species using high-level ab initio quantum-chemical calculations. A total of 130 molecules comprising of 31 isomeric groups and 24 cyanide/isocyanide pairs with molecules ranging from 3 to 12 atoms have been considered. The results show an interesting relationship between energy, stability and abundance (ESA) existing among these molecules. Among the isomeric species, isomers with lower enthalpies of formation are more easily observed in the interstellar medium compared to their counterparts with higher enthalpies of formation. Available data in the literature confirm the high abundance of the most stable isomer over other isomers in the different groups considered. Potential for interstellar hydrogen bonding accounts for the few exceptions observed. Thus, in general, it suffices to say that the interstellar abundances of related species could be linked to their stabilities if other factors do not dominate. The immediate consequences of this relationship in addressing some of the whys and wherefores among interstellar molecules and in predicting some possible candidates for future astronomical observations are discussed."
Comparison of Dexamethasone–Dimenhydrinate and Dexamethasone–Ondansetron in Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting in Postoperative Patients,"Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting is one of the most common problems after implementation of general anesthesia. The incidence can reach 80% in high-risk patients, depending on the type of surgery. In our study, we aimed to compare dexamethasone–dimenhydrinate and dexamethasone–ondansetron combinations in prevention of nausea and vomiting in postoperative patients."
Orthogonal solubility in fully conjugated donor-acceptor block copolymers: Compatibilizers for polymer/fullerene bulk-heterojunction solar cells,"Donor-acceptor (D-A) type fully conjugated block copolymer systems have been rarely reported due to the challenges in synthetic approaches to prepare well-defined low-polydispersity products. In this work, fully conjugated block copolymers are synthesized in a one-pot reaction through Stille coupling polycondensation, by utilizing the end-functional polymer copolymerization method. End-functional P3HT are copolymerized with AA (2,7-dibromo-9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole) and BB (4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, TBT) type monomers, respectively. The orthogonal solubility between the very soluble P3HT donor and the insoluble PCDTBT acceptor block improves the purity of block copolymers as well as distinct nano-scale phase-separation compared with other reports on miscibility of donor and acceptor polymer block. Further purification via preparative GPC is carried out to remove the excess of unreacted P3HT and free PCDTBT as well as to achieve low polydispersity of block copolymers. The chemical structure of the P3HT-b-PCDTBT block copolymers are verified via
1H-NMR, and further confirmed by FTIR spectra. The block copolymer shows broad absorption and moderate optical band gap of 1.8 eV. Furthermore, the fully conjugated block copolymer films exhibit significant fine structures, much smoother film morphology compared to P3HT/PCDTBT polymer blends. By adding a small amount of block copolymer P3HT-b-PCDTBT as a compatibilizer into the bulk-heterojunction of P3HT:PC61BM blends, polymer solar cells with an 8% increase of short circuit current (J
sc and 10% increase of power conversion efficiency (PCE) are achieved owing to the improvement of the active-layer film morphology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on donor-acceptor type fully conjugated block copolymer as an effective ternary additive in polymer: fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells."
Rylene diimide and dithienocyanovinylene copolymers for polymer solar cells,"Two polymers containing (E-2,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)acrylonitrile (CNTVT) as a donor unit, perylene diimide (PDI) or naphthalene diimide (NDI) as an acceptor unit, are synthesized by the Stille coupling copolymerization, and used as the electron acceptors in the solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs). Both polymers exhibit broad absorption in the region of 300–850 nm. The LUMO energy levels of the resulted polymers are ca.–3.93 eV and the HOMO energy levels are–5.97 and–5.83 eV. In the binary blend OSCs with PTB7-Th as a donor, PDI polymer yields the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 1.74%, while NDI polymer yields PCE of up to 3.80%."
High-performance fullerene-free polymer solar cells with solution-processed conjugated polymers as anode interfacial layer,"A series of conjugated polymers based on PFS derivatives with π-conjugated 5-(9H-fluoren-2-yl)-2,2′-bithiophene (fluorene-alt-bithiophene) backbones, namely PFS-3C, PFS-4C and PFS-6C, were synthesized for their use as the anode interfacial layers (AILs) in the efficient fullerene-free polymer solar cells (PSCs). Alkyl sulfonate pendants with different lengths of alkyl side chains were introduced in the three polymers in order to investigate the effect of the alkyl chain length on the anode modification. The obtained three polymers exhibited similar absorption bands and energy levels, indicating that changing the length of the alkyl side chains did not affect the optoelectronic properties of the conjugated polymers. Based on the PBDB-T:ITIC active layer, we fabricated the fullerene-free PSCs using the three polymers as the AILs. The superior performance of the fullerene-free PSC device was achieved when PFS-4C was used as the AIL, showing a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.54%. The high performance of the PFS-4C-modified device could be ascribed to the high transmittance, suitable work-function (WF) and smooth surface of PFS-4C. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE obtained in the PFS-4C-modified device is among the highest PCE values in the fullerene-free PSCs at present. These results demonstrate that the PFS derivatives are promising candidates in serving as the AIL materials for high-performance fullerene-free PSCs."
"Microwave-assisted one-pot three-component polymerization of alkynes, aldehydes and amines toward amino-functionalized optoelectronic polymers","We present a microwave-assisted one-pot polymerization with three-components of alkynes, aldehydes and amines for the synthesis of new amino-functionalized optoelectronic polymers. The polymerization of diynes (1a−1c, dialdehydes (2a and 2b and dibenzylamine catalyzed by InCl3 was carried out smoothly within 1 h under microwave radiation, yielding four soluble polymers with high molecular weights. The resulting polymers P1 and P2 could be easily dissolved in alcohol and thus utilized as the cathode interlayer for polymer solar cells (PSCs). Compared with the control device, the PSCs with P1 and P2 as the cathode interlayer and PTB7-Th:PC71BM as the photoactive layer exhibited significantly higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 9.49% and 9.16%, respectively. These results suggest that this polycoupling reaction is an efficient approach to construct three-component polymers for the practical applications."
All-polymer solar cells with perylenediimide polymer acceptors,"Four polymers based on perylenediimide co-polymerized with thiophene, bithiophene, selenophone and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene were investigated as the acceptor materials in all-polymer solar cells. Two different donor polymers, poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene)-2-carboxylate-2,6-diyl] (PTB7-Th) and poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3‴-di(2-dodecyltetradecyl)-2,2′;5′,2″;5″,2‴-quaterthiophen-5,5‴-diyl)] (PffBT4T-2DT), with suitably complementary absorption spectra and energy levels were applied and examined. Among all different donor-acceptor pairs studied here, the combination of PTB7-Th:poly[N,N′-bis(1-hexylheptyl)-3,4,9,10-perylenediimide-1,6/1,7-diyl-alt-2,5-thiophene] (PDI-Th) exhibited the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.13%, with open-circuit voltage (Voc) = 0.79 V, short-circuit current density (J
sc = 12.35 mA·cm−2 and fill-factor (FF) = 0.52. The polymer of PDI-Th acceptor used here had a regio-irregular backbone, conveniently prepared from a mixture of 1,6- and 1,7-dibromo-PDI. It is also noteworthy that neither additive nor post-treatment is required for obtaining such a cell performance."
Biased partitions and judicious k-partitions of graphs,"Let G = (V,E) be a graph with m edges. For reals p ∈ [0, 1] and q = 1− p, let m

This is sharp for complete graphs up to the error term \(o\left( {\sqrt m } \right)\). For an integer k ≥ 2, let f

The fourth power mean of the general 2-dimensional Kloostermann sums mod p,"The main purpose of this paper is using the analytic methods and the properties of Gauss sums to study the computational problem of one kind fourth power mean of the general 2-dimensional Kloostermann sums mod p, and give an exact computational formula for it."
Nonuniformly Weighted Schwarz Smoothers for Spectral Element Multigrid,"A hybrid Schwarz/multigrid method for spectral element solvers to the Poisson equation in \(\mathbb {R}^2\) is presented. It extends the additive Schwarz method studied by Lottes and Fischer (J Sci Comput 24:45–78, 2005) by introducing nonuniform weight distributions based on the smoothed sign function. Using a V-cycle with only one pre-smoothing, the new method attains logarithmic convergence rates in the range from 1.2 to 1.9, which corresponds to residual reductions of almost two orders of magnitude. Compared to the original method, it reduces the iteration count by a factor of 1.5–3, leading to runtime savings of about 50%. In numerical experiments the method proved robust with respect to the mesh size and polynomial orders up to 32. Used as a preconditioner for the (inexact) CG method it is also suited for anisotropic meshes and easily extended to diffusion problems with variable coefficients."
A heuristic-based population synthesis method for micro-simulation in transportation,"Population synthesis is extensively required by a number of micro-simulation models in transportation. A heuristic-based population synthesis method called Pop-H was proposed to overcome the following two limitations that received less attention. The first limitation is that one target marginal distribution can be well met by various sets of household weights that can be used to generate different sets of population and thus it is a problem that which set of household weights is the real one. Secondly, the population synthesis is commonly viewed as an optimization problem, and minimizing the Mean Absolute Percentage Error of control variables is generally used as the objective function. The Standard Deviation of control variables is also crucial in some cases, which, however receives scant attention. In response to these two limitations, the heuristic-based population synthesis method works in the following way: the Pop-H algorithm starts with the initial set of household weights derived from a sample data and calculates the final set of household weights by iteratively adjusting the initial set in a defined way with the objective function taking into account both Mean Absolute Percentage Error and Standard Deviation of control variables. Finally, the medium-sized city of Baoding, China was used as the case study. The sensitivity test was firstly done to examine four key parameters of the Pop-H algorithm, and then the algorithm was applied to create the population for the whole city."
Biosynthesis and uptake of glycine betaine as cold-stress response to low temperature in fish pathogen Vibrio anguillarum,"Fish pathogen Vibrio anguillarum, a mesophile bacterium, is usually found in estuarine and marine coastal ecosystems worldwide that pose a constant stress to local organism by its fluctuation in salinity as well as notable temperature change. Though V. anguillarum is able to proliferate while maintain its pathogenicity under low temperature (5–18°C), so far, coldadaption molecular mechanism of the bacteria is unknown. In this study, V. anguillarum was found possessing a putative glycine betaine synthesis system, which is encoded by betABI and synthesizes glycine betaine from its precursor choline. Furthermore, significant up-regulation of the bet gene at the transcriptional level was noted in log phase in response to cold-stress. Moreover, the accumulation of betaine glycine was only found appearing at low growth temperatures, suggesting that response regulation of both synthesis system and transporter system are cold-dependent. Furthermore, in-frame deletion mutation in the two putative ABC transporters and three putative BCCT family transporters associated with glycine betaine uptake could not block cellular accumulation of betaine glycine in V. anguillarum under coldstress, suggesting the redundant feature in V. anguillarum betaine transporter system. These findings confirmed that glycine betaine serves as an effective cold stress protectant and highlighted an underappreciated facet of the acclimatization of V. anguillarum to cold environments."
Identification of essential genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa for its growth in airway mucus,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been identified as an important causative agent of airway infection, mainly in cystic fibrosis. This disease is characterized by defective mucociliary clearance induced in part by mucus hyper-production. Mucin is a major component of airway mucus and is heavily O-glycosylated, with a protein backbone. Airway infection is known to be established with bacterial adhesion to mucin. However, the genes involved in mucin degradation or utilization remain elusive. In this study, we sought to provide a genetic basis of P. aeruginosa airway growth by identifying those genes. First, using RNASeq analyses, we compared genome-wide expression profiles of PAO1, a prototype P. aeruginosa laboratory strain, grown in M9-mucin (M9M) and M9-glucose (M9G) media. Additionally, a PAO1 transposon (Tn) insertion mutants library was screened for mutants defective in growth in M9M medium. One mutant with a Tn insertion in the xcpU gene (PA3100) was determined to exhibit faulty growth in M9M medium. This gene contributes to the type II secretion system, suggesting that P. aeruginosa uses this secretion system to produce a number of proteins to break down and assimilate the mucin molecule. Furthermore, we screened the PAO1 genome for genes with protease activity. Of 13 mutants, one with mutation in PA3247 gene exhibited defective growth in M9M, suggesting that the PA3247-encoded protease plays a role in mucin utilization. Further mechanistic dissection of this particular process will reveal new drug targets, the inhibition of which could control recalcitrant P. aeruginosa infections."
RraAS1 inhibits the ribonucleolytic activity of RNase ES by interacting with its catalytic domain in Streptomyces coelicolor,"RraA is a protein inhibitor of RNase E, which degrades and processes numerous RNAs in Escherichia coli. Streptomyces coelicolor also contains homologs of RNase E and RraA, RNase ES and RraAS1/RraAS2, respectively. Here, we report that, unlike other RraA homologs, RraAS1 directly interacts with the catalytic domain of RNase ES to exert its inhibitory effect. We further show that rraAS1 gene deletion in S. coelicolor results in a higher growth rate and increased production of actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin, compared with the wild-type strain, suggesting that RraAS1-mediated regulation of RNase ES activity contributes to modulating the cellular physiology of S. coelicolor."
Functional characterization of the cutI gene for the transcription of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase genes in Mycobacterium sp. strain JC1 DSM 3803,"Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CO-DH) in Mycobacterium sp. strain JC1 is a key enzyme for the carboxydotrophic growth, when carbon monoxide (CO) is supplied as a sole source of carbon and energy. This enzyme is also known to act as nitric oxide dehydrogenase (NO-DH) for the detoxification of NO. Several accessory genes such as cutD, cutE, cutF, cutG, cutH, and cutI, are clustered together with two copies of the CO-DH structural genes (cutB1C1A1 and cutB2C2A2) in Mycobacterium sp. strain JC1 and are well conserved in carboxydotrophic mycobacteria. Transcription of the CO-DH structural and accessory genes was demonstrated to be increased significantly by acidified sodium nitrate as a source of NO. A cutI deletion (ΔcutI) mutant of Mycobacterium sp. strain JC1 was generated to identity the function of CutI. Lithoautotrophic growth of the ΔcutI mutant was severely affected in mineral medium supplemented with CO, while the mutant grew normally with glucose. Western blotting, CO-DH activity staining, and CO-DH-specific enzyme assay revealed a significant decrease in the cellular level of CO-DH in the ΔcutI mutant. Northern blot analysis and promoter assay showed that expression of the cutB1 and cutB2 genes was significantly reduced at the transcriptional level in the ΔcutI mutant, compared to that of the wildtype strain. The ΔcutI mutant was much more susceptible to NO than was the wild type."
"Effects of diet type, developmental stage, and gut compartment in the gut bacterial communities of two Cerambycidae species (Coleoptera)","The gut bacterial community of wood-feeding beetles has been examined for its role on plant digestion and biocontrol method development. Monochamus alternatus and Psacothea hilaris, both belonging to the subfamily Lamiinae, are woodfeeding beetles found in eastern Asia and Europe and generally considered as destructive pests for pine and mulberry trees, respectively. However, limited reports exist on the gut bacterial communities in these species. Here, we characterized gut bacterial community compositions in larva and imago of each insect species reared with host tree logs and artificial diets as food sources. High-throughput 454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed 225 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on a 97% sequences similarity cutoff from 138,279 sequence reads, the majority of which were derived from Proteobacteria (48.2%), Firmicutes (45.5%), and Actinobacteria (5.2%). The OTU network analysis revealed 7 modules with densely connected OTUs in specific gut samples, in which the distributions of Lactococcus-, Kluyvera-, Serratia-, and Enterococcus-related OTUs were distinct between diet types or developmental stages of the host insects. The gut bacterial communities were separated on a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) plot and by c-means fuzzy clustering analysis, according to diet type. The results from this study suggest that diet was the main determinant for gut bacterial community composition in the two beetles."
Kicking down the ladder: adding cleavable features to genetically encoded photocrosslinkers,
PCDD/F contamination on surface soil in the vicinity of a hazardous waste incinerator: is it possible a different trend?,"This study is the first to investigate the contamination of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) on surface soils in the vicinity of the first hazardous waste incinerator of Turkey. In the study, 24 soil samples were taken from a 1625-m-radius circle whose center is the stack of the incinerator. This process was repeated 1 year later. Since the acquired average PCDD/F concentrations of the two sampling campaigns (0.05 and 0.02 ng WHO-toxic equivalent (TEQ)/kg) were meaningfully low compared to the related literatures, a new sampling campaign was carried out to control this inconsistency, but this time in a foreign laboratory (0.56 ng WHO-TEQ/kg). In the same period, eight gas samples were taken from the stack under different operational conditions of the facility. According to the evaluations of the findings, the geographical-meteorological data of the study area and the specific operational conditions of the facility corroborate the concentrations of the first and the second soil samplings rather than the third one. The major underlying reason for the inconsistency of the soil concentrations may be the fact that the data analysis procedures used by the laboratories are different. The author suggests a hypothesis which argues that the soils in the vicinity of a hazardous waste incinerator may have significantly lower concentration levels than in related literatures."
Damage modelling of epoxy material under uniaxial tension based on micromechanics and experimental analysis,"Epoxy is a widely used thermosetting polymer in various engineering fields to develop composites. Studying its damage and fracture behaviour under various loading conditions is highly important. In this work, a micromechanics-based damage model is developed for understanding the damage initiation and growth in epoxy. To support this damage model, tests are performed for obtaining mechanical properties and to study the damage behaviour of epoxy. Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) resin with triethylenetetramine (TETA) hardener in 10:1 ratio are mixed and cured to make the epoxy. To give a physical meaning to damage, the model quantifies the damage as volume fraction of a spherical void in a unit representative volume element (RVE) of epoxy material. Degraded effective properties are computed for damaged RVE using standard mechanics-based micromechanical approach. A second-degree polynomial is established for effective stiffness with damage at any loading instance. This functional form of degraded stiffness in terms of damage is used in constitutive relations. A strain energy- based approach is used to compute thermodynamic forces, a state variable used for the evolution of damage. A damage evolution model is proposed with two material-specific parameters which are determined using experimental tests. The model is implemented by user material subroutine (UMAT) in commercial finite element software, Abaqus/Standard. The proposed model accurately captures the tensile behaviour of the epoxy material and gives capability to simulate an epoxy material’s damage behaviour from its initiation till failure or macrolevel rupture under uniaxial tensile loading. The developed model predicts the behaviour of the material in agreement with experimental results."
Development of an instructional design model for flipped learning in higher education,"In response to pedagogical challenges in higher education, blended learning has become a prevalent practice in colleges and universities. Flipped learning (FL) represents a newly emerging form of blended learning, where students individually watch online lectures prior to class and then engage in classroom learning activities interacting with peers and instructors. Although the conceptual framework of FL may be intuitively appealing, its design and implementation involve considerable intricacy. The purpose of this study was to develop a FL design model for higher education that could systematically guide instructors or designers in creating an appropriate blend of individualized online lectures and collaborative face-to-face learning activities. Using an established method for model development research, a theoretically constructed initial model was iteratively improved and underwent internal and external validation through model usability tests, expert review, and field evaluation. The implementation of an algebra class in a Korean university designed by the final model resulted in significant increases in the maturity of mathematical views, quality of reflections, and satisfactions of students. Features of the model are discussed, along with theoretical and practical implications and suggestions for further research."
"Knowledge, beliefs and pedagogy: how the nature of science should inform the aims of science education (and not just when teaching evolution)","Lisa Borgerding’s work highlights how students can understand evolution without necessarily committing to it, and how learners may come to see it as one available way of thinking amongst others. This is presented as something that should be considered a successful outcome when teaching about material that many students may find incompatible with their personal worldviews. These findings derive from work exploring a cause célèbre of the science education community—the teaching of natural selection in cultural contexts where learners feel they have strong reasons for rejecting evolutionary ideas. Accepting that students may understand but not commit to scientific ideas that are (from some cultural perspectives) controversial may easily be considered as a form of compromise position when teaching canonical science prescribed in curriculum but resisted by learners. Yet if we take scholarship on the nature of science seriously, and wish to reflect the nature of scientific knowledge in science teaching, then the aim of science education should always be to facilitate understanding of, yet to avoid belief in, the ideas taught in science lessons. The philosophy of science suggests that scientific knowledge needs to be understood as theoretical in nature, as conjectural and provisional; and the history of science warns of the risks of strongly committing to any particular conceptualisation as a final account of some feature of nature. Research into student thinking and learning in science suggests that learning science is often a matter of coming to understand a new viable way of thinking about a topic to complement established ways of thinking. Science teaching should then seek to have students appreciate scientific ideas as viable ways of making sense of the currently available empirical evidence, but should not be about persuading students of the truth of any particular scientific account."
Cathodic titania nanotube arrays as anode material for lithium-ion batteries,"The titanium dioxide nanotube arrays (TNAs) have been synthesized at cathode and anode via standard electrochemical method for their subsequent use as anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The TNAs fabricated at cathode have higher Ti3+ in comparison to TNAs at anode, which was confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectrometry. Moreover, the lattice parameters of cathodic TNAs are estimated via Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction, which also conform to Ti3+ doping and insertion of protons (H+). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy hints an increment in the electronic conductivity of TNAs fabricated at cathode. As a result, high reversible areal–specific capacity (~385.5 µAh cm−2 at 100 µA cm−2) with excellent rate capability is acquired by utilizing TNAs fabricated at cathode as anode material in LIBs."

Defeating the Warrior: genetic architecture of triticale resistance against a novel aggressive yellow rust race,"Genome-wide association mapping of resistance against the novel, aggressive ‘Warrior’ race of yellow rust in triticale revealed a genetic architecture with some medium-effect QTL and a quantitative component, which in combination confer high levels of resistance on both leaves and ears."
In Situ Synthesis and Characterization of Fe-Based Metallic Glass Coatings by Electrospark Deposition Technique,Crystalline FeWMoCrBC electrode materials were prepared by conventional powder metallurgy. Metallic glass (MG) coatings were produced by electrospark deposition onto AISI 1035 steel in argon atmosphere. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy verified the amorphous structure of the as-deposited coatings. The coatings have a thickness of about 40 microns and a uniform structure. The results of dry sliding wear tests against high-speed steel demonstrated that Fe-based MG coatings had a lower friction coefficient and more than twice the wear resistance for 20 km sliding distance with respect to AISI 1035 steel. High-temperature oxidation treatment of the metal glass coatings at 1073 K in air for 12 h revealed that the oxidation resistance of the best coating was 36 times higher than that for bare AISI 1035 steel. These findings are expected to broaden the applications of electrospark Fe-based MG as highly protective and anticorrosive coatings for mild steel.
Roles of context in acquisition of human instrumental learning: Implications for the understanding of the mechanisms underlying context-switch effects,"Four experiments in human instrumental learning explored the associations involving the context that develop after three trials of training on simple discriminations. Experiments 1 and 4 found a deleterious effect of switching the learning context that cannot be explained by the context-outcome binary associations commonly used to explain context-switch effects after short training in human predictive learning and in animal Pavlovian conditioning. Evidence for context-outcome (Experiment 2), context-discriminative stimulus (Experiment 3), and context-instrumental response (Experiment 4) binary associations was found within the same training paradigm, suggesting that contexts became associated with all the elements of the situation, regardless of whether those associations played a role in a specific context-switch effect detected on performance."
Photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange using biologically enhanced tin oxide nanoparticles under UV-irradiation,"Tin oxide nanoparticles (size = 14 nm) have been prepared using DNA, a biological molecule, by co-precipitation method. The SnO2 catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron spectroscopy, fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and UV–Vis spectroscopy. The photocatalytic properties of SnO2 nanoparticles were investigated via methyl orange as a model organic compound under UV light irradiation. The study proves SnO2 as an efficient catalyst in removing organic pollutants in water."
"Femtosecond-laser fabrication of micron and sub-micron sized S-shaped constrictions on high T
c superconducting YBa2Cu3O7−x thin films: ablation and lithography issues","We demonstrate the fabrication of micron and sub-micron sized constrictions on high \({T}_{c}\) superconducting YBa2Cu3O7−x (YBCO) thin films using the femtosecond laser. The lithography process was optimized by programming the movement of the translation stage during etching with G-code (a control systems programming language), controlling the power incident on the sample to a certain degree and by bringing the laser ablation spots close to one another without clipping the constriction. S-shaped constrictions of micron and sub-micron size (smallest being ~858 nm) have been fabricated to be used as the constriction type Josephson junctions. The constrictions made have a variable width, with the width measured at the narrowest point."
Malaria infected erythrocyte classification based on a hybrid classifier using microscopic images of thin blood smear,"This paper aims to develop the computer assisted malaria infected erythrocyte classification based on a hybrid classifier. The major issues are feature extraction, optimal feature selection and erythrocytes classification. 54 dimensional features formed by the combination of the proposed features and the existing features have been used to define the feature set. The features such as prediction error, co-occurrence of linear binary pattern, chrominance channel histogram, R-G color channel difference histogram are the newly proposed features in our system. For feature selection, the different techniques have been explored to obtain the optimal feature set. Further, the performance of the different individual classifiers (SVM, k-NN and Naive Bayes) and hybrid classifier, obtained by combining the individual classifiers, is evaluated using the optimal feature set. Using the proposed optimal feature set and hybrid model, better performances (i.e. sensitivity 95.86%, accuracy 98.5%, F-score 93.82%) have been achieved on the collected clinical database. Based on the experimental results it may be concluded that hybrid classifier provides satisfactory results with an improvement in sensitivity (1.09%, 12.04%, 0%), accuracy (0.12%, 1.15%, 1.27%) and F-score (0.7%, 5.77%, 4.61%) as compared to the individual classifiers i.e. SVM, k-NN and Naive Bayes respectively."
"Design, synthesis, in silico and biological evaluation of novel 2-(4-(4-substituted piperazin-1-yl)benzylidene)hydrazine carboxamides","A series of novel 2-(4-(4-substituted piperazin-1-yl)benzylidene)hydrazinecarboxamide derivatives has been successfully designed and synthesized to evaluate their potential as carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors. The inhibitory potential of synthesized compounds against human CAI and CAII was evaluated. Compounds 3a–n exhibited \(\hbox {IC}_{50}\) values between \(1.89{-}415.1\,\upmu \hbox {M}\) against CAI and \(0.62{-}66.9\,\upmu \hbox {M}\) against CAII. Compound 3g was the most active inhibitor, with an \(\hbox {IC}_{50}\) value of \(0.62\,\upmu \hbox {M}\) against CAII. Molecular docking studies of compound 3g with CAII showed this compound fits nicely in the active site of CAII and it interacts with the zinc ion (\(\hbox {Zn}^{2+}\)) along with three histidine residues in the active site. Molecular dynamics simulation studies of compound 3g complexed with CAII also showed essential interactions which were maintained up to 40 ns of simulation. In vivo sub-acute toxicity study using 3g (300 mg/kg) was found non-toxic in adult Wistar rats."
Effect of the method and impregnation time on the surface acidity of zirconia modified with boron,"In this paper, the synthesis and characterization of boron-modified zirconia is reported. The zirconium hydroxide obtained by sol-gel was modified with boric acid, in order to increase the surface acidity of the zirconia. For this purpose, two impregnation methods were used: conventional and ultrasonic, and the impregnation time was set at 1 or 4 h. The synthesized materials were characterized by thermal analyses, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, nitrogen physisorption, and scanning electron microscopy. The boron incorporation delayed the crystallization of solids, which were mainly amorphous but with tendency toward the formation of the tetragonal phase. The modified materials were micro-mesoporous and their specific area was improved, while the pure zirconia showed a lower nitrogen adsorption. Units BO3 and BO4 were identified, confirming the boron presence. In general, the solids showed spherical particles; however, the ultrasonic treatment originated elongated particles. In addition, the acidic properties were evaluated by potentiometric titration and ethanol decomposition. The maximum acid strength of the zirconia increased from −28 mV to over 200 mV; consequently, all the boron-modified materials showed strong and very strong acid sites. The influence on the catalytic activity, due to the method and impregnation time, was clearly observed in the ethanol decomposition. The most active catalysts were those obtained by the ultrasonic method and the best was that impregnated during 1 h."
Encounter Probability Aware Task Assignment in Mobile Crowdsensing,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become essential parts in various smart city projects. However, the application-specific WSN deployment is constrained by its high cost, low flexibility and hard management. To address these limitations, a complementary promising solution, known as mobile crowdsensing, is proposed. Mobile crowdsensing leverages the surge of mobile devices as well as the sensors attached to them to opportunistically and cooperatively conduct sensing tasks. Thanks to the crowdness and mobility of mobile devices, mobile crowdsensing is able to enlarge the sensing scale and granularity. Existing mobile crowdsensing techniques are usually centralized methods and rely on infrastructure communications. Witnessing the development of Device-to-Device (D2D) communications, it is ideal to explore such abilities such that the sensing tasks can be conducted in a distributed manner as well as an infrastructureless way. Via D2D, all participated nodes can directly assign tasks to encountered nodes. In this paper, aided by the encounter relationship among mobile nodes, we study the time minimization task assignment problem in mobile crowdsensing. Specially, we propose offline and online algorithms based on historic encounter information and real-time assigned task execution time, respectively. Real-world trace based experiments validate the efficiency of our proposal."
Real-Time Head Pose Estimation Framework for Mobile Devices,"The head pose estimation technique predicts the rotation of the human head by analyzing a person’s face in a digital image. The head pose estimation framework uses two processes for the estimation. The first step is the detection of the face and facial features using a Haar-like feature detector. Methods proposed in previous studies generally provided a low overall detection ratio of each facial feature. Therefore, the pre-processing step for storing the facial features as a template could be time consuming. We propose a calibration method that finds one eye feature that cannot be found on the front part of the face. The method was evaluated by conducting an experiment to measure the detection accuracy of the face and facial features. The second process is used for the template-matching algorithm while the facial features are being tracked. As the experiment proceeded, we measured the time required to execute the estimation on an Android device. The head pose estimation procedure uses the coordinates of facial features. The algorithms used in the proposed systems show that the detection and tracking processes require approximately 230 ms and 20 ms, respectively. In addition, the calibration method proved to be effective in terms of decreasing the detection failure rate by approximately 8 %. Thus, this result confirms the effectiveness of our method on mobile devices."
HPIP promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells through PI3K/AKT pathway activation,"Hematopoietic PBX interacting protein (HPIP), a scaffold protein, is known to regulate the proliferation, migration and invasion in different cancer cell types. The aim of this study was to assess the role of HPIP in ovarian cancer cell migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and to unravel the mechanism by which it regulates these processes."
Year-round presence of Slaty Thrush (Turdus nigriceps nigriceps) in mountains of central Argentina,"The migration patterns of passerine species in the Neotropical region present several gaps of knowledge. The migratory behavior of the Slaty Thrush (Turdus nigriceps nigriceps) has been well characterized in their central and northern distribution along eastern slopes of the Andes from Argentina to Ecuador. The Slaty Thrush was historically considered a migrant breeder in the southern extreme of their distribution. In the present study, we show new evidence of the resident status of this species in its southernmost distribution on western slopes of Sierras Grandes and Sierras de Comechingones in Córdoba Province, Argentina. There, the Slaty Thrush has a year-round presence only at sites invaded by fleshy-fruited alien plants. The main invasive plants form dense patches of vegetation and offer an abundant fruit supply that is highly consumed by this bird species during autumn-winter, when there are no native fruits available. We suggest that the Slaty Thrush was a migrant species in past decades, but the recent invasion by fleshy-fruited species could explain its actual year-round presence by providing fruit in a period of the year of food shortage and new suitable habitats."
Comparison of the response using ICR mice derived from three different sources to ethanol/hydrochloric acid-induced gastric injury,"Animal models for gastric ulcers produced by physical, pharmacological and surgical methods have been widely employed to evaluate therapeutic drugs and investigate the mechanism of action of this disease. ICR mice were selected to produce this model, even though several mice and rats have been widely used in studies of gastric ulcers. To compare the responses of ICR mice obtained from three different sources to gastric ulcer inducers, alterations in gastric injury, histopathological structure, and inflammation were measured in Korl:ICR (Korea NIFDS source), A:ICR (USA source) and B:ICR (Japan source) treated with three concentrations of ethanol (EtOH) (50, 70, and 90%) in 150 mM hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution. Firstly, the stomach lesion index gradually increased as the EtOH concentration increased in three ICR groups. Moreover, a significant increase in the level of mucosal injury, edema and the number of inflammatory cells was similarly detected in the EtOH/HCl treated group compared with the vehicle treated group in three ICR groups. Furthermore, the number of infiltrated mast cells and IL-1β expression were very similar in the ICR group derived from three different sources, although some differences in IL- 1β expression were detected. Especially, the level of IL-1β mRNA in 50 and 90EtOH/HCl treated group was higher in Korl:ICR and A:ICR than B:ICR. Overall, the results of this study suggest that Korl:ICR, A:ICR and B:ICR derived from different sources have an overall similar response to gastric ulcer induced by EtOH/HCl administration, although there were some differences in the magnitude of their responses."
Beneficial effect of diosgenin as a stimulator of NGF on the brain with neuronal damage induced by Aβ-42 accumulation and neurotoxicant injection,"To investigate the beneficial effects of diosgenin (DC) on the multiple types of brain damage induced by Aβ-42 peptides and neurotoxicants, alterations in the specific aspects of brain functions were measured in trimethyltin (TMT)-injected transgenic 2576 (TG) mice that had been pretreated with DC for 21 days. Multiple types of damage were successfully induced by Aß-42 accumulation and TMT injection into the brains of TG mice. However, DC treatment significantly reduced the number of Aß-stained plaques and dead cells in the granule cells layer of the dentate gyrus. Significant suppression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and Bax/Bcl-2 expression was also observed in the DC treated TG mice (TG+DG group) when compared with those of the vehicle (VC) treated TG mice (TG+VC group). Additionally, the concentration of nerve growth factor (NGF) was dramatically enhanced in TG+DG group, although it was lower in the TG+VC group than the non-transgenic (nTG) group. Furthermore, the decreased phosphorylation of downstream members in the TrkA high affinity receptor signaling pathway in the TG+VC group was significantly recovered in the TG+DG group. A similar pattern was observed in p75NTR expression and JNK phosphorylation in the NGF low affinity receptor signaling pathway. Moreover, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was enhanced in the TG+DG group, while the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of lipid peroxidation, was lower in the TG+DG group than the TG+VC group. These results suggest that DC could exert a wide range of beneficial activities for multiple types of brain damage through stimulation of NGF biosynthesis."
Postnatal changes in glucose transporter 3 expression in the dentate gyrus of the C57BL/6 mouse model,"In this study, we observed the ontogenetic changes in glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) immunoreactivity, a major neuronal GLUT, in the dentate gyrus of mouse brains at various ages: postnatal day (P) 1, 7, 14, 28, and 56. At P1, cresyl violet staining showed abundant neurons in the dentate gyrus, whereas the granule cell layer was ill-defined. At P7, the granule cell layer was observed, and cresyl violet-positive cells were dispersed throughout the polymorphic layer. At P14, the granule cell layer was well-defined, and cresyl violet positive cells were detected abundantly in the polymorphic layer. At P28 and P56, cresyl violet-positive cells were observed in the granule cell layer, as well as in the polymorphic layer. At P1, GLUT3 immunoreactivity was detected in the dentate gyrus. At P7, GLUT3 immunoreactive cells were scattered in the polymorphic and molecular layer. However, at P14, GLUT3 immunoreactivity was observed in the polymorphic layer as well as subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. At P28, GLUT3 immunoreactivity was detected in the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus. At P56, GLUT3 immunoreactivity was observed predominantly in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. GLUT3 immunoreactive cells were mainly colocalized with doublecortin, which is a marker for differentiated neuroblasts, in the polymorphic layer and subgranular zone of dentate gyrus at P14 and P56. These results suggest that the expression of GLUT3 is closely associated with postnatal development of the dentate gyrus and adult neurogenesis."
Antimicrobial activity of essential oil of Eucalyptus globulus against fish pathogenic bacteria,"The antibacterial activities of the essential oil of Eucalyptus globulus (EOEG) was determined against 7 fish pathogenic bacteria (Edwardsiella tarda, Streptococcus iniae, S. parauberis, Lactococcus garviae, Vibrio harveyi, V. ichthyoenteri and Photobacterium damselae) obtained from farmed olive flounder. The inhibitory activity was evaluated by three methods: Disc diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). According to the disc diffusion test, as the concentration of EOEG (5-40 u.g) rises, the inhibitory zone increases in size. Compared with amoxicillin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol, EOEG showed similar antibacterial activity. The MIC of EOEG ranged from 7.8 to 125 mg/mL and MBC values ranged from 62 to 250 mg/mL. These results show that EOEG has antimicrobial activity against all seven bacteria, but there was no marked difference between each genus. From these results, it is suggested that EOEG can be used as an antimicrobial agent against fish bacterial diseases in the fish industry."
Anti-atherosclerotic effects of perilla oil in rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet,"Anti-atherosclerosis effects of perilla oil were investigated, in comparison with lovastatin, in rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet (HCD). Hypercholesterolemia was induced in rabbits by feeding the HCD containing 0.5% cholesterol and 1% corn oil, and perilla oil (0.1 or 0.3%) was added to the diet containing 0.5% cholesterol for 10 weeks. HCD greatly increased blood total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins, and caused thick atheromatous plaques, covering 74% of the aortic wall. Hyper-cholesterolemia also induced lipid accumulation in the liver and kidneys, leading to lipid peroxidation. Perilla oil not only attenuated hypercholesterolemia and atheroma formation, but also reduced fat accumulation and lipid peroxidation in hepatic and renal tissues. The results indicate that perilla oil prevents atherosclerosis and fatty liver by controlling lipid metabolism, and that it could be the first choice oil to improve diet-induced metabolic syndrome."
Multilocus sequence typing analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from pet Chinese stripe-necked turtles (Ocadia sinensis),"Our research sought to characterize the phylogeny of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from pet Chinese stripe-necked turtles (Ocadia sinensis) to better understand its evolutionary relation to other isolates and increase understanding of a potential zoonotic pathogen transmitted through direct contact with pet turtles. Thirty-one Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were obtained from both immature and adult turtles sold in pet shops in Korea. To characterize the phylogenic position of Chinese stripe-necked turtle-borne P. aeruginosa relative to other strains, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was performed due to the accessibility and breadth of MLST databases. Seven housekeeping genes (acsA, aroE, guaA, mutL, nuoD, ppsA, and trpE) were sequenced and the results were compared with data from the MLST database. The genes were further used for phylogenetic analysis of P. aeruginosa using concatenated gene fragments. Both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees were generated. Eleven distinct sequence types were present within the isolates among which seven were new. Expanding an unrooted phylogenetic tree to include P. aeruginosa MLST sequences isolated from various other geographic locations and sources revealed a divergent cluster containing the majority of isolates obtained from turtles. This suggests that P. aeruginosa strains particularly well-adapted for inhabiting turtles occupy a distinct phylogenetic position."
Therapeutic effect of ethyl acetate extract from Asparagus cochinchinensis on phthalic anhydride-induced skin inflammation,"Asparagus cochinchinensis has been used to treat various diseases including fever, cough, kidney disease, breast cancer, inflammatory disease and brain disease, while IL-4 cytokine has been considered as key regulator on the skin homeostasis and the predisposition toward allergic skin inflammation. However, few studies have investigated its effects and IL-4 correlation on skin inflammation to date. To quantitatively evaluate the suppressive effects of ethyl acetate extracts of A. cochinchinensis (EaEAC) on phthalic anhydride (PA)-induced skin inflammation and investigate the role of IL-4 during their action mechanism, alterations in general phenotype biomarkers and luciferase-derived signals were measured in IL-4/Luc/CNS-1 transgenic (Tg) mice with PA-induced skin inflammation after treatment with EaEAC for 2 weeks. Key phenotype markers including lymph node weight, immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentration, epidermis thickness and number of infiltrated mast cells were significantly decreased in the PA+EaEAC treated group compared with the PA+Vehicle treated group. In addition, expression of IL-1ß and TNF-a was also decreased in the PA+EaEAC cotreated group, compared to PA+Vehicle treated group. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the luciferase signal derived from IL-4 promoter was detected in the abdominal region, submandibular lymph node and mesenteric lymph node of the PA+EaEAC treated group, compared to PA+Vehicle treated group. Taken together, these results suggest that EaEAC treatment could successfully improve PA-induced skin inflammation of IL-4/Luc/CNS-1 Tg mice, and that IL-4 cytokine plays a key role in the therapeutic process of EaEAC."
Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging features of compressive cervical myelopathy with traumatic intervertebral disc herniation in cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis),"Intervertebral disc herniation (IVDH) with nucleus pulposus extrusion, traumatic or not, is a devastating clinical condition accompanied by neurological problems. Here we report a cynomolgus macaque suffering from acute and progressive neurological dysfunction by a blunt trauma due to neck collar, an animal handling device. Tetraplegia, urinary incontinence, decreased proprioception, and imperception of pain were shown on physical and neurological examinations. MRI sagittal T2 weighted sequences revealed an extensive protrusion of disc material between C2 and C3 cervical vertebra, and this protrusion resulted in central stenosis of the spinal cord. Histopathologic findings showed a large number of inflammatory cells infiltrated at sites of spinal cord injury (SCI). This case is the first report of compressive cervical SCI caused by IVDH associated with blunt trauma."
Modeling and analysis of cutting force in vibration-assisted broaching (VAB),"This paper aims to present a predicted force model of vibration-assisted broaching (VAB). Based on the geometric features and kinetic characteristics of broach, the model focuses on three important points: (i) the cutting force of single tooth, (ii) the number of teeth in contact with the workpiece, and (iii) the influence of simple harmonic motion (SHM). Firstly, according to the empirical approach (EA) and the shear angle (SA) theory, two kinds of single-tooth model of broaching are built. Secondly, considering the length of cutting edge and the number of cutting tooth, two multi-tooth models based on the single-tooth models are presented. Then, with the influence of broach motion, the models of VAB force are finally established. Verification experiments are conducted for the developed force model and show that the calculated results of SA model are more agreeing well with the experimental values when vibration frequency increased. In addition, the VAB model is helpful in the application of vibration broaching."
Formation characteristics of the chip and damage equivalent stress of the cutting tool in high-speed intermittent cutting,"For the purpose of revealing the formation characteristics of the chip and analyzing damage equivalent stress of the cutting tool in high-speed intermittent cutting, cutting tests, and finite element simulation were performed in the present work. Characteristics of chip morphologies acquired in cutting tests were analyzed and compared for different cutting conditions. The effects of cutting parameters on force, temperature, and stress on the shear plane were investigated. On the basis of the concept of damage equivalent stress, the initial damage of the cutting tool and the tool stress were integrated and the influences of cutting parameters on damage equivalent stress were studied. The correlations between damage equivalent stress of the cutting tool and chip formation were analyzed. Analysis results indicated that there existed strong correlations between the evolution of damage equivalent stress of the cutting tool and the chip formation process. Relatively low damage equivalent stress and relatively long tool life appeared at the same time when small values of cutting speed and feed rate were used."
Process and loading path design for hydraulic compound forming of rectangular tubes,"Tubes with various cross-sectional shapes are widely used in automotive and bicycle manufacture for lightweight considerations. This study proposes a compound forming process for hydroforming a rectangular cross-sectional tube of aluminum alloys AA6061-O. The compound forming process is divided into crushing, hydroforming, and calibration. The finite element simulation software DEFORM was used to analyze the plastic deformation pattern of the tube during the compound forming processes and determine feasible loading paths that can generate a uniform thickness distribution, a lower internal pressure, and a smaller clamping force. The effects of varied internal pressures on the product shapes, thickness distributions, and forming loads are discussed. A self-designed hydroforming test machine with an internal pressure capacity of 30 MPa and axial feeding force of 40 tons was used to conduct hydroforming experiments. The experimental results of the product thickness distributions and dimensions were compared with simulation results, and the validity of the FE modeling is confirmed. Sound products with the required shape and dimensions can be obtained using the proposed hydraulic compound forming process with a low internal pressure of 8 MPa."
A comparative study of GMAW- and DE-GMAW-based additive manufacturing techniques: thermal behavior of the deposition process for thin-walled parts,"The surface temperature of the thin-walled parts deposited by gas metal arc welding (GMAW)- and double-electrode gas meal arc welding (DE-GMAW)-based additive manufacturing (AM) techniques was captured through the infrared thermography technique. The dimensions of the molten pool in the deposition process including length, depth, and width were reduced in different degrees by the bypass arc during the DE-GMAW-based AM. The volume of the molten pool can decrease by about 30% in DE-GMAW under the same deposition rate. The volume of the high-temperature metal for the deposited parts during DE-GMAW-based AM was smaller than that during GMAW-based AM when depositing the high layer. The mean temperature of the deposited parts after the cooling process in DE-GMAW-based AM was lower under the same condition. The bypass arc in DE-GMAW-based AM is conducive to the reduction of the heat accumulation in the deposited thin-walled parts without a corresponding decrease in the deposition rate."
Investigation on feasibility and process of PEI sheet by viscous warm pressure forming,"A viscous warm pressure forming method is proposed to reduce the cost in small batch for complex shape thin-walled parts of polyetherimide (PEI), which is based on the mechanical properties of PEI and combines with the advantages of viscous pressure forming method. The tensile test of PEI sheet, warm property experiment of viscous medium, and viscous warm pressure bulging experiment of PEI sheet were carried out to preliminary investigate the forming feasibility, deformation law, and forming quality. The results show that a PEI sheet is strongly sensitive to forming temperature and loading speed. From 20 to 150 °C, with the increasing of temperature and decreasing of loading speed, the formability is enhanced gradually. Furthermore, the formability of PEI sheet is greater in biaxial stress state than that in uniaxial stress state. The forming quality, surface finish, and light transmittance are not influenced by the deformation of PEI sheet. Meanwhile, different from the wall thickness distribution of sheet metal bulging specimen, the maximum wall thickness reduction rate of PEI sheet presents the regional distribution which locates at the center of the bulging specimen, and with the increasing of temperature and deformation, the area of regional distribution increases."
Research on adaptive non-uniform rational B-spline real-time interpolation technology based on acceleration constraints,"In order to solve the problems of low machining precision and efficiency in machining complicated parametric curves in traditional computer numeric control systems, non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) real-time interpolation was studied. Considering the problem of feed speed fluctuation in a traditional NURBS interpolation method, the adaptive correction interpolation algorithm that is proposed corrects the calculational accuracy of the next interpolation point parameter value, and the correction time is mutated adaptively according to the length of the interpolation precision and interpolation cycle. This approach is based on the premise that the interpolation cycle will improve the correction accuracy as much as possible, thereby minimizing the interpolation feed speed fluctuation. To mitigate the problem of a large number of calculations and high calculational complexity in feed speed planning of NURBS real-time interpolation, we use a velocity planning algorithm based on a feed speed pretreatment curve; thus, the interpolation feed velocity planning tasks are completed on a non-real-time cycle, the maximum acceleration and jerk requirements of the machine tool are fully considered, and each interpolation point is planned during the speed planning period, which avoids the use of a complex planning algorithm and obtains a smoother velocity curve. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed approach were verified by simulation."
The global dynamical complexity of the human brain network,"How much information do large brain networks integrate as a whole over the sum of their parts? Can the dynamical complexity of such networks be globally quantified in an information-theoretic way and be meaningfully coupled to brain function? Recently, measures of dynamical complexity such as integrated information have been proposed. However, problems related to the normalization and Bell number of partitions associated to these measures make these approaches computationally infeasible for large-scale brain networks. Our goal in this work is to address this problem. Our formulation of network integrated information is based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the multivariate distribution on the set of network states versus the corresponding factorized distribution over its parts. We find that implementing the maximum information partition optimizes computations. These methods are well-suited for large networks with linear stochastic dynamics. We compute the integrated information for both, the system’s attractor states, as well as non-stationary dynamical states of the network. We then apply this formalism to brain networks to compute the integrated information for the human brain’s connectome. Compared to a randomly re-wired network, we find that the specific topology of the brain generates greater information complexity."
Demyelination patterns in a mathematical model of multiple sclerosis,"In this paper we derive a reaction-diffusion-chemotaxis model for the dynamics of multiple sclerosis. We focus on the early inflammatory phase of the disease characterized by activated local microglia, with the recruitment of a systemically activated immune response, and by oligodendrocyte apoptosis. The model consists of three equations describing the evolution of macrophages, cytokine and apoptotic oligodendrocytes. The main driving mechanism is the chemotactic motion of macrophages in response to a chemical gradient provided by the cytokines. Our model generalizes the system proposed by Calvez and Khonsari (Math Comput Model 47(7–8):726–742, 2008) and Khonsari and Calvez (PLos ONE 2(1):e150, 2007) to describe Baló’s sclerosis, a rare and aggressive form of multiple sclerosis. We use a combination of analytical and numerical approaches to show the formation of different demyelinating patterns. In particular, a Turing instability analysis demonstrates the existence of a threshold value for the chemotactic coefficient above which stationary structures develop. In the case of subcritical transition to the patterned state, the numerical investigations performed on a 1-dimensional domain show the existence, far from the bifurcation, of complex spatio-temporal dynamics coexisting with the Turing pattern. On a 2-dimensional domain the proposed model supports the emergence of different demyelination patterns: localized areas of apoptotic oligodendrocytes, which closely fit existing MRI findings on the active MS lesion during acute relapses; concentric rings, typical of Baló’s sclerosis; small clusters of activated microglia in absence of oligodendrocytes apoptosis, observed in the pathology of preactive lesions."
Hydroelastic interaction between water waves and thin elastic plate floating on three-layer fluid,"The wave-induced hydroelastic responses of a thin elastic plate floating on a three-layer fluid, under the assumption of linear potential flow, are investigated for two-dimensional cases. The effect of the lateral stretching or compressive stress is taken into account for plates of either semi-infinite or finite length. An explicit expression for the dispersion relation of the flexural-gravity wave in a three-layer fluid is analytically deduced. The equations for the velocity potential and the wave elevations are solved with the method of matched eigenfunction expansions. To simplify the calculation on the unknown expansion coefficients, a new inner product with orthogonality is proposed for the three-layer fluid, in which the vertical eigenfunctions in the open-water region are involved. The accuracy of the numerical results is checked with an energy conservation equation, representing the energy flux relation among three incident wave modes and the elastic plate. The effects of the lateral stresses on the hydroelastic responses are discussed in detail."
Global solution for quantum Zakharov equations,The initial value problem for the quantum Zakharov equation in three dimensions is studied. The existence and uniqueness of a global smooth solution are proven with coupled a priori estimates and the Galerkin method.
Astigmatism transfer phenomena in the optical parametric amplification process,"We numerically and experimentally investigate the astigmatism transfer phenomena in femtosecond optical parametric amplification (OPA). We model the OPA process based on the coupled second-order three-wave nonlinear propagation equations. The numerical and experimental results support that the input pump pulse astigmatism can be transferred into the idler pulse but not the signal pulse, and the idler pulse astigmatism originating from spatial walk-off is less than the idler pulse astigmatism received from the pump. Thus, we can provide a clear understanding of astigmatism transfer mechanisms in the OPA process, and make better use of broadband tunable OPA sources."
Transient Thermal Behavior of Ash During Fluidized Bed Combustion of Poultry Litter,"When manure is introduced in a hot fluidized bed for gasification or combustion, its inorganic compounds will undergo chemical transformations upon heating. The phosphorus containing salts, which are mostly hydrogen and dihydrogen phosphates or alkali and alkaline earth metals, melt at low temperatures (200–300 °C), before they decompose. In their liquid state, these compounds may drive the formation of ash coatings on bed particles of silica sand, and irreversibly agglomerate multiple particles if they are locally present in high amounts. The recent first time observation of the latter phenomenon led to a new interpretation of an earlier concept, melt induced agglomeration. Decomposition of the aforementioned (di)hydrogen phosphates and reaction of the fresh coatings with silica bed material drives the fluidized bed towards chemical equilibrium upon the ash’s increasing temperature, in which K2Si4O9 is formed aside from Ca3(PO4)2 and CaSiO3. In this situation of (near) chemical equilibrium, a melt is formed if the amount of K2Si4O9 is high and the amount of CaSiO3 is low. Low CaSiO3 may result from a low calcium concentration in the fuel, or by a high phosphorus concentration, since Ca3(PO4)2 is the more stable form. The particle’s silicate melt is concentrated at the interior of the coating, due to the abundance of silica at this location, and any Ca3(PO4)2 makes up the exterior of the coating. If enough silicate melt can find a way through the solid exterior of the coating, entrained particles may deposit onto an inclined refractory wall above the fluidized bed. We support particle deposition as the initiating deposition step, as opposed to gaseous condensation, primarily because of the aluminum and potassium silicate chemistry involved. After deposition, SEM-EDX analysis of a deposit’s cross section revealed a chemical anchoring by chemical reaction between K2Si4O9 and the alumina rich refractory material, creating a strong solid bond of for instance potassium feldspar, which has a high melting point. Deposits can therefore grow larger before they break loose and cause bed disturbances, thus damaging the refractory wall. The comprehensive theory on transient thermal ash transformations, presented in this paper, will allow to adept the design of future thermal energy applications for manure by selecting appropriate additives and refractory bed and/or wall materials."
Molybdenum disulfide grafted titania nanotube arrays as high capacity retention anode material for lithium ion batteries,"Titania nanotube arrays (TNAs) were grown by anodic oxidation method, and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) grafted TNAs have been synthesized via one-step hydrothermal process. The MoS2 grafted TNAs (MoS2/TNAs) when employed as an anode material in lithium ion battery, exhibited excellent areal specific capacity (~430 µAh cm−2) at current density of 50 µA cm−2, which is 33% higher as compared to the pure anatase TNAs and 55% higher as compared to MoS2. Moreover, the capacity loss per cycle of MoS2/TNAs (~0.21%) was significantly lower than anatase TNAs (~1.47%), suggesting an increase of capacity retention."
Bacterial community profile of contaminated soils in a typical antimony mining site,"The soils around the world’s largest antimony mine have been contaminated by high concentrations of Sb and As, which might influence microbial diversity in the surrounding soils. The ecological effects of bioavailable Sb and As on the composition and diversity of microbial community in soils remain unknown. In this study, the relative abundance, taxonomic diversity and composition of bacterial community in soils from a typical Sb mine area, and the relationship between the bacterial community and bioavailable concentrations as well as environmental factors have been investigated comprehensively using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT). The results indicated that Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Cyanobacteria were the dominant bacterial populations at phylum level in all soil samples, accounting for more than 80% of the bacteria sequenced. The abundance and diversity of bacterial community vary along a metal contamination gradient. Redundancy discriminate analysis (RDA) revealed that 74.74% of bacterial community variation in the contaminated soils was explained by six environmental factors (pH, SbDGT, AsDGT, potential ecological risk index (RI), TC, TN), among which pH, SbDGT, and AsDGT were dominant factors influencing the composition and diversity of bacteria. This study contributes to our understanding of microbial diversity in a local ecosystem and introduces the option of studying bioavailable Sb and As using DGT."
Estimation of students’ exposure to metal concentrations from river-dust episodes during 1994–2012,"Two elementary schools (Shiuguang and Fongrong) from Yulin County in Taiwan, near a main area of potential exposure to Aeolian river-dust, were selected to collect outdoor and indoor PM10 aerosols and to measure five metals in PM10 (As, Ni, Cr, Cd, and Mn). Significant relationships (p < 0.01) were found between outdoor PM10 concentrations at Lunbei’s air quality monitoring station and the two elementary schools. The outdoor PM10 concentrations at the monitoring station and the schools’ indoor PM10 concentrations also showed significant correlations. This study also established a relationship between the outdoor and indoor concentrations of PM10 and metals in the schools. Estimations were made regarding students’ 8 h of exposure to metal concentrations from river-dust episodes during 1994–2012, based on correlation equations that were shown to be statistically significant."
Carbon and water footprints of irrigated corn and non-irrigated wheat in Northeast Spain,"Irrigation increases yields and allows several crops to be produced in regions where it would be naturally impossible due to limited rainfall. However, irrigation can cause several negative environmental impacts, and it is important to understand these in depth for the correct application of mitigation measures. The life cycle assessment methodology was applied herein to compare the main irrigated and non-irrigated crops in Northeast Spain (corn and wheat, respectively), identifying those processes with greater contribution to environmental impacts (carbon and water footprint categories) and providing scientifically-sound information to facilitate government decisions. Due to concerns about climate change and water availability, the methods selected for evaluation of environmental impacts were IPCC 2013 GWP (carbon footprint) and water scarcity indicator (water footprint). The area studied, a 7.38-km2 basin, was monitored for 12 years, including the period before, during, and after the implementation of irrigation. The functional unit, to which all material and energy flows were associated with, was the cultivation of 1 ha, throughout 1 year. The overall carbon footprint for irrigated corn was higher, but when considering the higher productivity achieved with irrigation, the emissions per kilogram of corn decrease and finally favor this irrigated crop. When considering the water footprint, the volumes of irrigation water applied were so high that productivity could not compensate for the negative impacts associated with water use in the case of corn. Nevertheless, consideration of productivities and gross incomes brings the results closer. Fertilizer use (carbon footprint) and irrigation water (water footprint) were the main contributors to the negative impacts detected."
Understanding interactions in the adsorption of gaseous organic compounds to indoor materials,"We studied adsorption of organic compounds to a wide range of indoor materials, including plastics, gypsum board, carpet, and many others, under various relative humidity conditions by applying a conceptual model of the free energy of interfacial interactions of both van der Waals and Lewis acid-base (e-donor/acceptor) types. Data used for the analyses were partitioning coefficients of adsorbates between surface and gas phase obtained from three sources: our sorption experiments and two other published studies. Target organic compounds included apolars, monopolars, and bipolars. We established correlations of partitioning coefficients of adsorbates for a considered surface with the corresponding hexadecane/air partitioning coefficients of the adsorbates which are used as representative of a van der Waals descriptor instead of vapor pressure. The logarithmic adsorption coefficients of the apolars and weak bases, e.g., aliphatics and aromatics, to indoor materials linearly correlates well with the logarithmic hexadecane/air partitioning coefficients regardless of the surface polarity. The surface polarity in terms of e-donor/acceptor interactions becomes important for adsorption of the strong bases and bipolars, e.g., amines, phenols, and alcohols, to unpainted gypsum board. Under dry or humid conditions, the adsorption to flat plastic materials still linearly correlates well with the van der Waals interactions of the adsorbates, but no correlations were observed for the adsorption to fleecy or plush materials, e.g., carpet. Adsorption of highly bipolar compounds, e.g., phenol and isopropanol, is strongly affected by humidity, attributed to Lewis acid-base interactions with modified surfaces."
Empirical validation for effectiveness of fault prediction technique based on cost analysis framework,"Prediction of the faulty or non-faulty modules in a software is an important task in software development life cycle and often carried out by validating them through certain empirical techniques. A good number of techniques have been proposed by different authors to develop fault prediction models and determine best suitable techniques for fault prediction based on certain performance criteria. However it appears that there is a scope to extend the research by giving emphasis on feasibility analysis of fault prediction techniques. In this paper, a cost evaluation framework has been proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of developed fault prediction models. Statistical methods such as linear regression, logistic regression, polynomial regression, Naive Bayes and support vector machine have been applied to develop a classifier in order to predict as to whether any module is a faulty or non-faulty one for an embedded software system. The proposed approach has been applied on five different public domain software system chosen from NASA database consisting of different number of faulty models. The performance of the predicted models are evaluated using different performance evaluation parameters. From cost-based analysis, experimental results reveal that our fault prediction model is best suitable for projects with faulty modules less than a certain threshold value depending on cost and fault identification efficiency of different testing phases. The results also show that the model developed using logistic regression technique obtained promising results in terms of performance and cost when compared with other applied techniques."
Cerebrospinal fluid microglia and neurodegenerative markers in twins concordant and discordant for psychotic disorders,"Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are debilitating psychiatric disorders with partially shared symptomatology including psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment. Aberrant levels of microglia and neurodegenerative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers have previously been found in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We aimed to analyze familial and environmental influences on these CSF markers and their relation to psychiatric symptoms and cognitive ability. CSF was collected from 17 complete twin pairs, nine monozygotic and eight dizygotic, and from one twin sibling. Two pairs were concordant for schizophrenia, and 11 pairs discordant for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder, and four pairs were not affected by psychotic disorders. Markers of microglia activation [monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), chitinase 3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), and soluble cluster of differentiation 14 (sCD14)], markers of β-amyloid metabolism (AβX-38, AβX-40, AβX-42 and Aβ1-42), soluble amyloid precursor proteins (sAPP-α and sAPP-β), total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (P-tau), and CSF/serum albumin ratio were measured in CSF using immunoassays. Heritability of the CSF markers was estimated, and associations to psychiatric and cognitive measurements were analyzed. Heritability estimates of the microglia markers were moderate, whereas several neurodegenerative markers showed high heritability. In contrast, AβX-42, Aβ1-42, P-tau and CSF/serum albumin ratio were influenced by dominant genetic variation. Higher sCD14 levels were found in twins with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder compared to their not affected co-twins, and higher sCD14-levels were associated with psychotic symptoms. The study provides support for a significant role of sCD14 in psychotic disorders and a possible role of microglia activation in psychosis."
New bounds of permutation codes under Hamming metric and Kendall’s \(\tau \)-metric,"Permutation codes are widely studied objects due to their numerous applications in various areas, such as power line communications, block ciphers, and the rank modulation scheme for flash memories. Several kinds of metrics are considered for permutation codes according to their specific applications. This paper concerns some improvements on the bounds of permutation codes under Hamming metric and Kendall’s \(\tau \)-metric respectively, using mainly a graph coloring approach. Specifically, under Hamming metric, we improve the Gilbert–Varshamov bound asymptotically by a factor n, when the minimum Hamming distance d is fixed and the code length n goes to infinity. Under Kendall’s \(\tau \)-metric, we narrow the gap between the known lower bounds and upper bounds. Besides, we also obtain some sporadic results under Kendall’s \(\tau \)-metric for small parameters."
Mapping prefer-opposite to prefer-one de Bruijn sequences,"We present a mapping of the binary prefer-opposite de Bruijn sequence of order n onto the binary prefer-one de Bruijn sequence of order \(n-1\). The mapping is based on the differentiation operator \(D(\langle {b_1,\ldots ,b_l}\rangle ) = \langle b_2-b_1, b_3-b_2,\ldots , b_{l}-b_{l-1} \rangle \) where bit subtraction is modulo two. We show that if we take the prefer-opposite sequence \(\langle {b_1,b_2,\ldots ,b_{2^n}}\rangle \), apply D to get the sequence \(\langle {\hat{b}_1, \ldots , \hat{b}_{2^n-1}}\rangle \) and drop all the bits \(\hat{b}_i\) such that \(\langle {\hat{b}_i,\ldots ,\hat{b}_{i+n-1}}\rangle \) is a substring of \(\langle {\hat{b}_1,\ldots ,\hat{b}_{i+n-2}}\rangle \), we get the prefer-one de Bruijn sequence of order \(n-1\)."
The Feasibility of a Web Intervention for Military and Veteran Spouses Concerned About Their Partner’s Alcohol Misuse,"Concerned partners (CPs) of military service members and veterans with alcohol misuse face significant help-seeking barriers. We adapted the Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) intervention into a 4-session web-based intervention (WBI) called Partners Connect. The program aims to help the CP increase their own well-being, teach the CP how to manage his/her behavior (e.g., communication) toward their partner, and identify ways the CP can help their partner reduce drinking and seek treatment. We recruited CPs through social media, and then tested the feasibility and acceptance of the WBI by conducting qualitative interviews and post-WBI session surveys after their WBI sessions. CPs (n = 12) spontaneously reported improvements in communication and more effective management of their partner’s drinking due to skills learned. They discussed how the online approach can help overcome barriers to seeking in-person help. This WBI fills an important gap in clinical services for military and veteran CPs and CPs in the general population who may not otherwise seek in-person counseling."
Spontaneous bilayer phase separations of spin-coated polymer blend thin films: A neutron reflectivity study,"This study investigates the spontaneous formation of phase-separated bilayer structures of polymer blend thin films upon spin coating. Neutron reflectivity is used to measure the bilayer structure of deuterated polystyrene (dPS) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) blend thin films with various molecular weights (M

w
). The results indicate that the binary polymer blend forms a well-defined phase-separated bilayer structure of a dPS-rich layer on top of a PMMA rich layer with clear interfaces between the layers. The interfacial width is in reasonable agreement with the results of self-consistent field theory modified to account for capillary waves. The blend with higher M

w
 exhibits broader interfaces than the theoretical predictions, probably due to the reduced mobility of mixed polymers in the solvent during spin coating. Formation of thin blend films with parallel phase separation can provide a viable route to potential applications of the active layer in bilayer heterojunction devices for polymer photovoltaic applications."
An approach to improve the electrochemical performance of LiMn2O4 at high temperature,"In order to overcome the severe capacity decay of LiMn2O4 at high temperature, TiN is used as an active materials additive in this paper. The XRD and XPS test results indicate that the TiN can effectively prevent Mn from dissolving in electrolyte; galvanostatic charge-discharge test shows that LiMn2O4 electrode with TiN exhibits remarkably improved capacity retention at high temperature with capacity of 105.1 mAh g−1 at 1 C in the first cycle at 55 °C and the capacity maintains 88.9% retention after 150 cycles. And the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy result demonstrates TiN’s effectiveness in easing the increase of charge-transfer resistance during cycling. Therefore, we can conclude that TiN, as an addictive, made obvious contribution to the greatly improved electrochemical cycling performance of LiMn2O4."
Stochastic modelling of seasonal and yearly rainfalls with low-frequency variability,"Stochastic rainfall models are important for many hydrological applications due to their appealing ability to simulate synthetic series that resemble the statistical characteristics of the observed series for a location of interest. However, an important limitation of stochastic rainfall models is their inability to preserve the low-frequency variability of rainfall. Accordingly, this study presents a simple yet efficient stochastic rainfall model for a tropical area that attempts to incorporate seasonal and inter-annual variabilities in simulations. The performance of the proposed stochastic rainfall model, the tropical climate rainfall generator (TCRG), was compared with a stochastic multivariable weather generator (MV-WG) in various aspects. Both models were applied on 17 rainfall stations at the Kelantan River Basin, Malaysia, with tropical climate. The validations were carried out on seasonal (monsoon and inter-monsoon) and annual basis. The third-order Markov chain of the TCRG was found to perform better in simulating the rainfall occurrence and preserving the low-frequency variability of the wet spells. The log-normal distribution of the TCRG was consistently better in modelling the rainfall amounts. Both models tend to underestimate the skewness and kurtosis coefficient of the rainfall. The spectral correction approach adopted in the TCRG successfully preserved the seasonal and inter-annual variabilities of rainfall amounts, whereas the MV-WG tends to underestimate the variability bias of rainfall amounts. Overall, the TCRG performed reasonably well in the Kelantan River Basin, as it can represent the key statistics of rainfall occurrence and amounts successfully, as well as the low-frequency variability."
Interval type-2 fuzzy logic for dynamic parameter adaptation in the bat algorithm,"We describe in this paper a proposed enhancement of the bat algorithm (BA) using interval type-2 fuzzy logic for dynamically adapting the BA parameters. The BA is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the behavior of micro bats that use the echolocation feature for hunting their prey, and this algorithm has been recently applied to different optimization problems obtaining good results. We propose a new method for dynamic parameter adaptation in the BA using interval type-2 fuzzy logic, where an especially design fuzzy system is responsible for determining the optimal values for the parameters of the algorithm. Simulations results on a set of benchmark mathematical functions with the interval type-2 fuzzy bat algorithm outperform the traditional bat algorithm and a type-1 fuzzy variant of BA. The proposed integration of the type-2 fuzzy system into the BA has the goal of improving the performance of BA for the future applicability of the algorithm in more complex optimization problems where higher levels of uncertainty need to be handled, like in the optimization of fuzzy controllers."
Leadership development in a professional medical society using 360-degree survey feedback to assess emotional intelligence,The current research evaluated the potential utility of a 360-degree survey feedback program for measuring leadership quality in potential committee leaders of a professional medical association (PMA). Emotional intelligence as measured by the extent to which self-other agreement existed in the 360-degree survey ratings was explored as a key predictor of leadership quality in the potential leaders.
The effect of component separation technique on quality of life (QOL) and surgical outcomes in complex open ventral hernia repair (OVHR),"Outcomes following OVHR may be affected by type of component separation. In this study, outcomes including QOL of patients undergoing OVHR were evaluated based on the utilization of transversus abdominis release (TAR), posterior rectus sheath release (PRSR) alone or in combination with external oblique release (EOR + PRSR)."
A novel procedure for introducing large sheet-type surgical material with a self-expanding origami structure using a slim trocar (chevron pleats procedure),"Large sheet-type surgical materials (e.g., absorbable hemostat, adhesion barrier membranes, and flat surgical mesh) are difficult to introduce into a corporeal cavity using a 5-mm trocar; however, laparoscopic surgeries that use mainly 5-mm trocars are increasing. Furthermore, it is necessary not only to introduce but also to secure the applied surgical material and expand it from the original surgical site. To address these challenges, we developed a novel procedure for introducing such surgical materials into a corporeal cavity using a 5-mm trocar and a self-expanding origami structure, called the “chevron pleats procedure (CPP)”."
Five hundred consecutive laparoscopic common bile duct explorations: 5-year experience at a single institution,Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) has gained wide popularity in the treatment of choledocholithiasis. Bile leakage remains a major cause of postoperative morbidity. The aim of this study was to report 5-year results of 500 LCBDEs and identify risk factors associated with bile leakage.
Totally laparoscopic or robot-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy versus open surgery for periampullary neoplasms: separate systematic reviews and meta-analyses,To compare perioperative and oncologic outcomes of pure (totally) laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (TLPD) or robot-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy (RAPD) with those of conventional open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD).
Similarity examination of truncated virial equation of state correspondence to linear isothermal regularity (LIR) by applying square-well (SW) potential,"Linear isotherm regularity works very well for fluids at high densities, and it has been shown that it is compatible with the EOSs based on statistical–mechanical theory. On the other hand, at low densities, the first few terms of virial EOS have the most contribution to express the deviations from ideal behavior. For finding similarities between dense and dilute states, experimental p–v–T data of 14 fluids (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, H2, O2, N2, CO, NH3, CH3OH, CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and C3H8) are examined. Comparing the thermal dependencies of the attraction and repulsion terms (A and B) of the LIR with the second and third virial coefficients (B
2 and B
3) in liquid and supercritical regions (0.7 < T
r < 3.0) shows a remarkable similarity. Square-well potential is applied to examination and comparison of theoretical results with experimental results. It is shown that in liquid and supercritical regions, (1) the short-range potential governs among particles in dense fluids, and the long-range interactions become important in the less dense fluid, (2) similar to Boyle temperature, T
B, in dilute state, there is a temperature as T′B (in dense fluids) that the attractive forces and the repulsive forces acting on the dense-fluid particles balance out; thus, probably there is a maximum σ (molecular diameter) at nearly 2T
c (T′B), and (3) in the liquid and supercritical regions (0.7 < T
r < 3.0), in the first-order approximation, there are no significant interactions higher than triple interactions in dense-fluid particles."
Hands-on 2.0: improving transfer of training via the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) Acquisition of Data for Outcomes and Procedure Transfer (ADOPT) program,"Practicing surgeons commonly learn new procedures and techniques by attending a “hands-on” course, though trainings are often ineffective at promoting subsequent procedure adoption in practice. We describe implementation of a new program with the SAGES All Things Hernia Hands-On Course, Acquisition of Data for Outcomes and Procedure Transfer (ADOPT), which employs standardized, proven teaching techniques, and 1-year mentorship. Attendee confidence and procedure adoption are compared between standard and ADOPT programs."
QTL mapping of resistance to the Cucumber mosaic virus P1 strain in pepper using a genotyping-by-sequencing analysis,"Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), a member of the Cucumovirus genus in the family Bromoviridae, is a frequently occurring virus in pepper worldwide. A broad host range, which includes many weed species and a large number of insects, means it is difficult to control CMV in the field. CMV resistance has been reported in Capsicum spp. In Korea, the C. annuum ‘Bukang’ cultivar is resistant to the CMVFNY and CMVKorean strains; however, a new strain (CMVP1) is able to infect the resistant cultivars. Therefore, it is necessary to pursue CMVP1 resistance in pepper breeding. In this study, we surveyed the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to CMVP1 using a single-seed-descent (SSD) F3 segregating population derived from a cross between a resistant line, ‘A1’, and a susceptible line, ‘2602.’ A total of 174 plants were evaluated for resistance to CMVP1 at 30 days after mechanical inoculation, with phenotypes confirmed by reverse transcription PCR. The number of resistant and susceptible plants was 88 and 86, respectively. Of these, 96 individuals including 48 resistant lines and 48 susceptible lines were used for a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) analysis. Approximately 19,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes were obtained. Using the SNP data, a pepper genetic linkage map consisting of 906 SNP markers was constructed. The map showed 12 linkage groups with a total linkage distance of 1,272.9 cM. QTL analysis using a composite interval mapping (CIM) method revealed that two QTLs, cmvP1-5.1 and cmvP1-10.1, located on chromosomes 5 and 10, respectively, had R
2 (coefficient of determination) values of 17.81% and 22.78%. This information will be helpful for developing SNP markers linked to CMVP1-resistant QTLs and for developing new CMVP1-resistant pepper cultivars."
Factors supporting cardiomyopathy screening among at-risk adult survivors of pediatric malignancies,"Anthracyclines and chest irradiation place adult survivors of childhood cancer at risk of cardiomyopathy; many survivors do not obtain the recommended screening. Based on our recent clinical trial, the addition of telephone counseling to a printed survivorship care plan more than doubled survivors’ risk-based screening. Here, we sought to measure the impact of specific factors targeted in the intervention for their impact on survivors’ screening participation."
Synthesis of an organo-ruthenium aminoquinoline-trioxane hybrid and evaluation of its activity against Plasmodium falciparum and its toxicity toward normal mammalian cells,"A new hybrid compound 5 containing a ruthenocene, a 4-aminoquinoline, and a 1,2,4-trioxane within a single molecular structure has been synthesized and evaluated for antimalarial potential. In order to ascertain the role of each component of hybrid 5, its antimalarial activity has been measured against chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-sensitive strains of Plasmodium falciparum in comparison with those of chloroquine, artemisinin, a ruthenocene-trioxane compound 9 not containing an aminoquinoline, the precursor trioxane ketone 4, and a trioxane dimer 10. Hybrid 5 displays high antimalarial activity, in the mid to low nanomolar IC50 range, and low cytotoxicity toward healthy mammalian cells, which translates into good selectivity indexes. The potency of 5 is consistently higher than those of chloroquine, the parent metal-free trioxane, and compound 9, the structural intermediate featuring a ruthenocene moiety bound to the trioxane but lacking the aminoquinoline. These results validate our hypothesis that it is the combination of the aminoquinoline, the ruthenocenyl moiety, and the trioxane in a single molecule that provides the enhanced antiplasmodial activity, and highlight the concept of hybrid compounds as a strategy that deserves further attention."
"Verbal labels increase the salience of novel objects for preschoolers with typical development and Williams syndrome, but not in autism","Early research has documented that young children show an increased interest toward objects that are verbally labeled by an adult, compared to objects that are presented without a label. It is unclear whether the same phenomenon occurs in neurodevelopmental disorders affecting social development, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Williams syndrome (WS)."
Logarithmic Arithmetic for Low-Power Adaptive Control Systems,"To reduce the power dissipation in adaptive control systems, we propose replacing the exact arithmetic hardware units with approximate ones. As a case study, an adaptive control system for object tracking based on the Kalman filter is implemented in FPGA. A thorough analysis of the Kalman filter’s circuitry for real-world object tracks acquired by an aviation radar system proved that adaptive control systems can successfully compensate for the calculation errors introduced by the approximate arithmetic units. The main contributions of this paper are that the introduction of the approximate arithmetic circuits to the adaptive control system (1) preserves the required accuracy and (2) significantly reduces the power dissipation and the size of the adaptive system’s circuitry."
Labeling of adipose-derived stem cells with quantum dots provides stable and long-term fluorescent signal for ex vivo cell tracking,"Stem cells derived from adipose tissue (ADSC) have been used in cell therapy as an alternative to treat chronic and degenerative diseases. Using biomedical and image trials to track the cells when infused in the target tissue is essential to control cell migration and adhesion. The objective of the present study was to label and assess the adhesion of goat adipose tissue-derived stem cells (g-ADSC) after cell infusion in animal models by tracking luminescent intracytoplasmatic nanocrystals. The cells were labeled by using Qdots. The g-ADSCs infused with nanocrystal were prepared either fresh or fixed and further visualized under a fluorescence microscope. The labeled cells were infused in the goat mammary glands and mouse testicles and kidneys via tail vein injection. Thirty days after cell infusion, biopsy was carried out for analyses. The g-ADSC cultures were presented with high cellularity and fibroblast morphology, even after infusion of the nanocrystals. It was possible, by processing in paraffin and under fluorescence microscopy, demonstrating the success of the labeling in the long term. Freezing mammary gland biopsies in liquid NO2 did not alter the quality of labeling with Qdots. Therefore, g-ADSCs can be labeled with intracytoplasmatic nanocrystals (Qdots) enabling their in vitro and ex vivo tracking."
The influence of upstream slope on the local scour at drop structure,"The drop structure will fail as a result of local scoring downstream. This paper discusses the influence of a drop structures’ upstream slope to local scour. Empirical equations of the scour hole were developed by laboratory experiment, theoretical assumptions, and regression analysis. These equations include the maximum scour depth and length during the scouring period, the maximum equilibrium scour depth and length, and the unit width scour rate. The four channel slopes (0%, 2%, 4%, and 6%) before the drop structure has been included in the analysis. A series of laboratory experiments were conducted to obtain 48 groups of experiments and 419 scour hole profiles during the scouring period. The material used in the scour section is uniform non-cohesive and with a median diameter of d

50
 = 0.5 mm. The results have been used to develop empirical equations via regression analysis to determine the coefficients of theoretical equations. The high correlation coefficient indicates that the equations developed in this study are suitable for verifying the characteristics of a scour hole at drop structure in the sloped channel. The semi-empirical equation is more accurate than the empirical equation. Compared to a horizontal channel, a sloped channel tends to cause a greater equilibrium maximum scour length, shorter equilibrium maximum scour depth, and faster unit-wide scour rate."
"The influence of elevation on soil properties and forest litter in the Siliceous Moncayo Massif, SW Europe","Understanding the effects of elevation and related factors (climate, vegetation) on the physical and chemical soil properties can help to predict changes in response to future climate or afforestation forcings. This work aims to contribute to the knowledge of soil evolution and the classification of forest soils in relation to elevation in the montane stage, with special attention to podzolization and humus forms. The northern flank of the Moncayo Massif (Iberian Range, SW Europe) provides a unique opportunity to study a forest soils catena within a consistent quartzitic parent material over a relatively steep elevation gradient. With increasing elevation, pH, base saturation, exchangeable potassium, and fine silt-sized particles decrease significantly, while organic matter, the C/N ratio, soil aggregate stability, water repellency and coarse sand-sized particles increase significantly. The soil profiles shared a set of properties in all horizons: loamy-skeletal particle-size, extreme acidity (pH-H2O<5.6) and low base saturation (<50%). The most prevalent soil forming processes in the catena include topsoil organic matter accumulation and even podzolization, which increases with elevation. From the upper to lower landscape positions of wooded montane stage of the Moncayo Massif, mull-moder-mor humus and an Umbrisol-Cambisol-Podzol soil unit sequences were found."
Deep-seated large-scale toppling failure in metamorphic rocks: a case study of the Erguxi slope in southwest China,"Deep-seated large-scale toppling failure presents unique challenges in the study of natural slope deformation process in mountainous regions. An active deep-seated toppling process was identified in the Erguxi slope located in southwest China, which affected a large area and damaged critical transportation infrastructure with the volume of the deforming rock mass exceeding 24×106 m3. It poses significant risks to the downstream Shiziping Hydropower Station by damming the Zagunao River. Field investigation and monitoring results indicate that the deformation of the Erguxi slope is in the advanced stage of deep-seated toppling process, with the formation of a disturbed belt but no identifiable master failure surface. It was postulated that the alternating tensile and shear strength associated with the hard/soft laminated rock strata of metasandstone and phyllite layers preclude the development of either a tensile or shear failure surface, which resulted in the continuous deformation and displacement without a catastrophic mass movement. The slope movement is in close association with the unfavorable geological conditions of the study area in addition to the construction of transportation infrastructure and the increase of the reservoir level. On the basis of the mechanism and intensity of the ongoing toppling deformation, a qualitative grading system was proposed to describe the toppling process and to evaluate the slope stability. This paper summarized the field observation and monitoring data on the toppling deformation for better characterizing its effect on the stability of the Erguxi slope. The qualitative grading system intends to provide a basis for quantitative study of large-scale deep-seated toppling process in metamorphic rocks."
Landslide risk perception and communication for disaster risk management in mountain areas of developing countries: a Mexican foretaste,"The increasing impact of disasters at local, national, regional and global scales in recent decades has provided enough evidence to urgently direct attention towards the necessity of disaster risk reduction and management, and this requires knowledge. Knowledge without communication is barren, and to communicate the risk of disaster it is necessary to understand the perception of the people at risk. In particular, this paper deals with the necessity to delineate strategies of risk communication in pursuance of risk knowledge as a core of disaster risk reduction and management, especially in mountain areas of developing countries. To portray this issue, an analysis of landslide risk perception in terms of experience, landslide risk awareness, exposure, preparedness, and risk communication and trust was undertaken in the municipality of Teziutlán, Puebla, Mexico, an area that has been affected for several decades by episodes of mass movement. Analysis of the responses to a risk perception questionnaire has offered valuable insights in terms of the information and knowledge most required by the people living in the area of interest, in order to devise a realistic and functional strategy to communicate the risk of a landslide disaster. This includes better understanding of controlling factors and drivers of this risk, and the establishment of potential trusted sources of risk communication. Beyond considering practical matters of risk assessment and management, risk perception and communication can increase the resilience of vulnerable people, and can enhance capacity building for present and future generations."
Analytical analysis of pullout resistance of the hydraulic expansion rockbolts on a frictionally coupled model,"This paper proposes an empirical formula to estimate the shear strength of hydraulic expansion rockbolts. The field experimental results were obtained from eleven pullout tests to evaluate the results computed by the proposed formula. It was found that shear resistance of hydraulic expansion rockbolts significantly depends on the uniaxial compressive strength and elastic modulus of rock, with high correlation coefficients of 0.7651 and 0.8587, respectively. The developed formula enables estimation of the maximum pullout load in an analytical process without pullout tests in the field. Conversely, due to the poor interlocking at the initial pullout load, the measured displacements were higher than the estimated ones. To reduce the interlocking effects between bolt and rock, we recommend preloading of 29.4 kN. Preload allows reducing the distance between the measured and estimated displacement and making two load-displacement curves practically identical with marginal differences of 1.1 to 1.5 mm at the maximum pullout load."
"The status evaluation of the permafrost environment along the Chaida’er-Muli Railway in southern Qilian Mountains in northern Qinghai Province, China","Engineering construction has major influence on the permafrost environment. This paper analyzes the interaction between engineering construction and permafrost environment along the Chaidaer-Muli Railway (simply, CMR) based on the press-state-response (PSR) framework. The permafrost environmental system is divided into three subsystems, consisting of permafrost thermal stability, proneness to the freeze-thawing erosion and permafrost ecological fragility. Each subsystem considers its most important influencing factors. Catastrophe Progression Method (CPM) is applied to calculate the current environment condition along the railway. The result indicates that: (1) as far as the thermal stability is concerned, most sections along the CMR are mainly concentrated in rank III (fair situation), and a few in II (good situation) and IV (bad situation), respectively; (2) for the proneness to the freeze-thawing erosion, the entire railway route falls largely in rank II (good situation); (3) along the CMR, the ecological fragility of the permafrost environment is in rank II (good situation), or slightly fragile; (4) overall, the permafrost environments along the CMR are in rank III (fair situation) or II condition (good situation). In general, the permafrost environment along the CMR is fair. It is mainly because a series of active measures of protecting permafrost were taken for stabilizing the CMR foundation soils. On the one hand, we should try our best to minimize the influences that engineering activities have exerted on ecology and environment, on the other hand, the positive measures have made improvements to prevent the permafrost environment from deterioration."
"Impacts of reforestation on woody species composition, species diversity and community structure in dry-hot valley of the Jinsha River, southwestern China","To understand the impacts of reforestation on woody species composition, species diversity and community structure, seven plantation forests in dry-hot valley of the Jinsha River in Southwest China were investigated, with adjacent wastelands, natural shrub grassland and a natural forest as references. Species importance value, species richness, species heterogeneity and Sorenson similarity index between plantations and the natural forest were analyzed. Results indicated that compared to wastelands and natural shrub grassland, reforestation improved species diversity and community structure, and more forest woody species found suitable habitats in plantations. Species diversity in understory of plantations and Sorenson similarity index were significantly negatively correlated with stem density in mature plantations (26-31 years old). Higher species diversity and Sorenson similarity index existed in mature sparse plantations due to lower stem density and more tree species planted initially. In contrast, reference natural forest, with species heterogeneity of 2.28 for shrub layer, showed the highest species diversity. It would take a long time for species composition and diversity to recover through reforestation in a dry-hot valley. Therefore, it was essential to protect remnant natural forests strictly and reforest with suitable management such as lower stem density and increasing genetic diversity of trees planted."
A novel bat flower pollination algorithm for synthesis of linear antenna arrays,"In this paper, a novel algorithm, namely bat flower pollination (BFP) is proposed for synthesis of unequally spaced linear antenna array (LAA). The new method is a combination of bat algorithm (BA) and flower pollination algorithm (FPA). In BFP, both BA and FPA interact with each other to escape from local minima. The results of BFP for solving a set of 13 benchmark functions demonstrate its superior performance as compared to variety of well-known algorithms available in the literature. The novel proposed method is also used for the synthesis of unequally spaced LAA for single and multi-objective design. Simulation results show that BFP is able to provide better synthesis results than wide range of popular techniques like genetic algorithm, differential evolution, cuckoo search, particle swarm optimization, back scattering algorithm and others."
RETRACTED ARTICLE: Quality assessment for virtual reality technology based on real scene,"Virtual reality technology is a new display technology, which provides users with real viewing experience. As known, most of the virtual reality display through stereoscopic images. However, image quality will be influenced by the collection, storage and transmission process. If the stereoscopic image quality in the virtual reality technology is seriously damaged, the user will feel uncomfortable, and this can even cause healthy problems. In this paper, we establish a set of accurate and effective evaluations for the virtual reality. In the preprocessing, we segment the original reference and distorted image into binocular regions and monocular regions. Then, the Information-weighted SSIM (IW-SSIM) or Information-weighted PSNR (IW-PSNR) values over the monocular regions are applied to obtain the IW-score. At the same time, the Stereo-weighted-SSIM (SW-SSIM) or Stereo-weighted-PSNR (SW-PSNR) can be used to calculate the SW-score. Finally, we pool the stereoscopic images score by combing the IW-score and SW-score. Experiments show that our method is very consistent with human subjective judgment standard in the evaluation of virtual reality technology."
Reliability in content analysis: The case of semantic feature norms classification,"Semantic feature norms (e.g., STIMULUS: car → RESPONSE: <has four wheels>) are commonly used in cognitive psychology to look into salient aspects of given concepts. Semantic features are typically collected in experimental settings and then manually annotated by the researchers into feature types (e.g., perceptual features, taxonomic features, etc.) by means of content analyses—that is, by using taxonomies of feature types and having independent coders perform the annotation task. However, the ways in which such content analyses are typically performed and reported are not consistent across the literature. This constitutes a serious methodological problem that might undermine the theoretical claims based on such annotations. In this study, we first offer a review of some of the released datasets of annotated semantic feature norms and the related taxonomies used for content analysis. We then provide theoretical and methodological insights in relation to the content analysis methodology. Finally, we apply content analysis to a new dataset of semantic features and show how the method should be applied in order to deliver reliable annotations and replicable coding schemes. We tackle the following issues: (1) taxonomy structure, (2) the description of categories, (3) coder training, and (4) sustainability of the coding scheme—that is, comparison of the annotations provided by trained versus novice coders. The outcomes of the project are threefold: We provide methodological guidelines for semantic feature classification; we provide a revised and adapted taxonomy that can (arguably) be applied to both concrete and abstract concepts; and we provide a dataset of annotated semantic feature norms."
Studying the neural bases of prism adaptation using fMRI: A technical and design challenge,"Prism adaptation induces rapid recalibration of visuomotor coordination. The neural mechanisms of prism adaptation have come under scrutiny since the observations that the technique can alleviate hemispatial neglect following stroke, and can alter spatial cognition in healthy controls. Relative to non-imaging behavioral studies, fMRI investigations of prism adaptation face several challenges arising from the confined physical environment of the scanner and the supine position of the participants. Any researcher who wishes to administer prism adaptation in an fMRI environment must adjust their procedures enough to enable the experiment to be performed, but not so much that the behavioral task departs too much from true prism adaptation. Furthermore, the specific temporal dynamics of behavioral components of prism adaptation present additional challenges for measuring their neural correlates. We developed a system for measuring the key features of prism adaptation behavior within an fMRI environment. To validate our configuration, we present behavioral (pointing) and head movement data from 11 right-hemisphere lesioned patients and 17 older controls who underwent sham and real prism adaptation in an MRI scanner. Most participants could adapt to prismatic displacement with minimal head movements, and the procedure was well tolerated. We propose recommendations for fMRI studies of prism adaptation based on the design-specific constraints and our results."
An extensive literature survey on medical image steganography,"Steganography which is an art as well as a science of invisible transmission arrived as a saviour by providing utmost security through various techniques. Medical Image Steganography is a special subcategory of Image Steganography. It has come a long way to make the transmission of medical images more and more safe and to make sure that the diagnostic reading of the image does not get affected. Security is the most crucial aspect of communication in today’s world. While sharing documents on the internet, one needs assurance of privacy and secrecy, as these days’ communication is not only restricted to chatting but plays a vital role in almost all sectors. This paper discusses various algorithms used in medical image steganography and analyse the best out of all based on various characteristics of the algorithms like robustness, PSNR (Peak signal-to-noise ratio) value, MSE (Mean Squared Error) value, payload capacity etc."
Research on adaptive non-uniform rational B-spline real-time interpolation technology based on acceleration constraints,"In order to solve the problems of low machining precision and efficiency in machining complicated parametric curves in traditional computer numeric control systems, non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) real-time interpolation was studied. Considering the problem of feed speed fluctuation in a traditional NURBS interpolation method, the adaptive correction interpolation algorithm that is proposed corrects the calculational accuracy of the next interpolation point parameter value, and the correction time is mutated adaptively according to the length of the interpolation precision and interpolation cycle. This approach is based on the premise that the interpolation cycle will improve the correction accuracy as much as possible, thereby minimizing the interpolation feed speed fluctuation. To mitigate the problem of a large number of calculations and high calculational complexity in feed speed planning of NURBS real-time interpolation, we use a velocity planning algorithm based on a feed speed pretreatment curve; thus, the interpolation feed velocity planning tasks are completed on a non-real-time cycle, the maximum acceleration and jerk requirements of the machine tool are fully considered, and each interpolation point is planned during the speed planning period, which avoids the use of a complex planning algorithm and obtains a smoother velocity curve. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed approach were verified by simulation."
Modeling and analysis of cutting force in vibration-assisted broaching (VAB),"This paper aims to present a predicted force model of vibration-assisted broaching (VAB). Based on the geometric features and kinetic characteristics of broach, the model focuses on three important points: (i) the cutting force of single tooth, (ii) the number of teeth in contact with the workpiece, and (iii) the influence of simple harmonic motion (SHM). Firstly, according to the empirical approach (EA) and the shear angle (SA) theory, two kinds of single-tooth model of broaching are built. Secondly, considering the length of cutting edge and the number of cutting tooth, two multi-tooth models based on the single-tooth models are presented. Then, with the influence of broach motion, the models of VAB force are finally established. Verification experiments are conducted for the developed force model and show that the calculated results of SA model are more agreeing well with the experimental values when vibration frequency increased. In addition, the VAB model is helpful in the application of vibration broaching."
A comparative study of GMAW- and DE-GMAW-based additive manufacturing techniques: thermal behavior of the deposition process for thin-walled parts,"The surface temperature of the thin-walled parts deposited by gas metal arc welding (GMAW)- and double-electrode gas meal arc welding (DE-GMAW)-based additive manufacturing (AM) techniques was captured through the infrared thermography technique. The dimensions of the molten pool in the deposition process including length, depth, and width were reduced in different degrees by the bypass arc during the DE-GMAW-based AM. The volume of the molten pool can decrease by about 30% in DE-GMAW under the same deposition rate. The volume of the high-temperature metal for the deposited parts during DE-GMAW-based AM was smaller than that during GMAW-based AM when depositing the high layer. The mean temperature of the deposited parts after the cooling process in DE-GMAW-based AM was lower under the same condition. The bypass arc in DE-GMAW-based AM is conducive to the reduction of the heat accumulation in the deposited thin-walled parts without a corresponding decrease in the deposition rate."
Investigation on feasibility and process of PEI sheet by viscous warm pressure forming,"A viscous warm pressure forming method is proposed to reduce the cost in small batch for complex shape thin-walled parts of polyetherimide (PEI), which is based on the mechanical properties of PEI and combines with the advantages of viscous pressure forming method. The tensile test of PEI sheet, warm property experiment of viscous medium, and viscous warm pressure bulging experiment of PEI sheet were carried out to preliminary investigate the forming feasibility, deformation law, and forming quality. The results show that a PEI sheet is strongly sensitive to forming temperature and loading speed. From 20 to 150 °C, with the increasing of temperature and decreasing of loading speed, the formability is enhanced gradually. Furthermore, the formability of PEI sheet is greater in biaxial stress state than that in uniaxial stress state. The forming quality, surface finish, and light transmittance are not influenced by the deformation of PEI sheet. Meanwhile, different from the wall thickness distribution of sheet metal bulging specimen, the maximum wall thickness reduction rate of PEI sheet presents the regional distribution which locates at the center of the bulging specimen, and with the increasing of temperature and deformation, the area of regional distribution increases."
Process and loading path design for hydraulic compound forming of rectangular tubes,"Tubes with various cross-sectional shapes are widely used in automotive and bicycle manufacture for lightweight considerations. This study proposes a compound forming process for hydroforming a rectangular cross-sectional tube of aluminum alloys AA6061-O. The compound forming process is divided into crushing, hydroforming, and calibration. The finite element simulation software DEFORM was used to analyze the plastic deformation pattern of the tube during the compound forming processes and determine feasible loading paths that can generate a uniform thickness distribution, a lower internal pressure, and a smaller clamping force. The effects of varied internal pressures on the product shapes, thickness distributions, and forming loads are discussed. A self-designed hydroforming test machine with an internal pressure capacity of 30 MPa and axial feeding force of 40 tons was used to conduct hydroforming experiments. The experimental results of the product thickness distributions and dimensions were compared with simulation results, and the validity of the FE modeling is confirmed. Sound products with the required shape and dimensions can be obtained using the proposed hydraulic compound forming process with a low internal pressure of 8 MPa."
Probabilistic approach for predicting fatigue life improvement of cracked structure repaired by high interference fit bushing,"The purpose of this paper consists in developing a probabilistic approach for predicting fatigue life improvement of 7075-T6 cracked Single Edge Notch Tension (SENT) specimen repaired by high interference fit bushing. The developed approach is carried out by coupling FE-analysis and Monte Carlo reliability method. In this context, a 2D- finite element analysis of the cracked SENT specimen using ABAQUS commercial software is established to: (i) simulate the interference fit process and (ii) to predict the fatigue life improvement after repair. The non-linear isotropic/kinematic hardening model embedded in ABAQUS is used to characterize the material behavior. Different stress levels, different interference fit sizes and different expanded hole diameters are investigated. As a result, crack arrest hole diameter equals to 6 mm with larger interference fit size (IFS = 0.2 mm) provides higher beneficial compressive residual stress distribution and higher fatigue life improvement than drilling hole near the crack tip. The iso-probabilistic S-N curves and the Reliability-Life curves after repair can be determined for different interference fit sizes and different expanded hole diameters. This probabilistic approach can be used with the interference fit process as an interesting and practical tool to ensure an optimal maintenance planning for cracked structures and to improve the fatigue lives of these cracked components that cannot be replaced as soon as the cracks are observed, especially in the aeronautical filed."
Formation characteristics of the chip and damage equivalent stress of the cutting tool in high-speed intermittent cutting,"For the purpose of revealing the formation characteristics of the chip and analyzing damage equivalent stress of the cutting tool in high-speed intermittent cutting, cutting tests, and finite element simulation were performed in the present work. Characteristics of chip morphologies acquired in cutting tests were analyzed and compared for different cutting conditions. The effects of cutting parameters on force, temperature, and stress on the shear plane were investigated. On the basis of the concept of damage equivalent stress, the initial damage of the cutting tool and the tool stress were integrated and the influences of cutting parameters on damage equivalent stress were studied. The correlations between damage equivalent stress of the cutting tool and chip formation were analyzed. Analysis results indicated that there existed strong correlations between the evolution of damage equivalent stress of the cutting tool and the chip formation process. Relatively low damage equivalent stress and relatively long tool life appeared at the same time when small values of cutting speed and feed rate were used."
On the mechanical analogue of DNA,"The creation of mechanical analogues of biological systems is known as a useful instrument that helps to understand better the dynamical mechanisms of the functioning of living organisms. Mechanical analogues of biomolecules are usually constructed for imitation of their internal mobility, which is one of the most important properties of the molecules. Among the different types of internal motions, angular oscillations of nitrous bases are of special interest because they make a substantial contribution to the base pairs opening that in turn is an important element of the process of the DNA–protein recognition. In this paper, we investigate the possibility to construct a mechanical analogue for imitation of angular oscillations of nitrous bases in inhomogeneous DNA. It is shown that the analogue has the form of a mechanical chain of non-identical pendulums that oscillate in the gravitational field of the Earth and coupled by identical springs. The masses and lengths of pendulums, as well as the distances between neighboring pendulums and the rigidity of springs are calculated. To illustrate the approach, we present the result of construction of the mechanical analogue of the fragment of the sequence of bacteriophage T7D."
On Principles of Educational Change and Principled Action in Psychotherapy Supervision,"Change strategies/principles, a well-recognized and accepted component of therapeutic practice, have yet to be comparably considered in psychotherapy supervision. Can there be educational change strategies/principles for psychotherapy supervision? I take up that question subsequently. I contend that supervision is forever a principle-driven activity, that supervisors practice in a principle-driven manner, and that a common core of guiding supervision strategies/principles can be identified. Reasoning by analogy from the seminal works of Goldfried (Am Psychol 35:991–999, 1980; How people change: inside and outside therapy, Springer, New York, 1991; Clin Psychol Rev 33, 862–869, 2013) and Castonguay and Beutler (Principles of therapeutic change that work, Oxford University Press, New York, 2006a; J Clin Psychol 62:631–638, 2006b; Principles of therapeutic change that work, Oxford University Press, New York, 2006c), I propose one such common core: 20 educational strategies/principles that cut across any and all forms of supervision. What follows is foremost a stimulus paper, a starting point, designed to provoke further dialogue about this crucial but unconsidered aspect of supervision practice."
The synthesis of melamine-based polyether polyol and its effects on the flame retardancy and physical–mechanical property of rigid polyurethane foam,"A new type of melamine-based polyether polyol (HMMM–PG) was synthesized based on 1,2-propylene glycol (PG) and hexamethoxy methylene melamine (HMMM). The structure and properties of HMMM–PG were characterized using IR, LC–MS, TG, and shear viscosity analysis, which showed that HMMM–PG had better thermal stability than common polyols as well as shear thinning rheological characteristics. In addition, HMMM–PG was used to prepare polyurethane foams. The compressive strength, thermal conductivity, TG, SEM, LOI, HoC, and XPS were investigated to study the physical–mechanical and fire-retardant properties of the foams. The results showed that the physical–mechanical properties of the foams using HMMM–PG were substantially improved, which was attributed to the higher degree of hydroxyl functionality, which increased the crosslinking density and the number of triazine rings in the structures. Meanwhile, the flame-retardant properties of foams could be significantly improved, which were mainly reflected in the condensed phase. The more stable compounds were retained in the carbon residues during combustion. The continuous and dense char layer was formed. This char layer was effective in preventing heat transfer, and hindered the spread of decomposition products to the flame region."
The Poincaré-Hopf theorem for relative braid classes,"This paper studies the existence and multiplicity of closed integral curves of smooth vector fields on the closed 2-disc \({ \mathbb {D}^2}\) in the complement of a suitable geometric braid y—called a skeleton. The strands in a skeleton y must be trajectories of the vector field and the 1-periodic orbits to be counted must also be representatives of a suitable relative braid class x in the complement of y. From Leray–Schauder degree theory a signed count of the closed trajectories representing x in the complement of y is independent of the vector field. It therefore suffices to compute, or estimate the signed count of periodic orbits for a particularly convenient vector field. We show that the signed count equals the Euler-Floer characteristic of Braid Floer homology, (cf.  van den Berg et al. in J Differ Equ 259(5):1663–1721, 2015). The latter can be computed via a finite cube complex which serves as a model for the given braid class."
Processing and Properties of Bar-Shaped Single-Seeded and Multi-Seeded YBCO Bulk Superconductors by a Top-Seeded Melt Growth Technique,"The fabrication of (RE)-Ba-Cu-O bulk superconductors, where RE is a rare-earth element such as Y, Gd and Sm, is both time consuming and expensive due to the complexity of the melt process and the slow growth rate of large, single grains. In this study, different approaches to the fabrication of bar-shaped, bulk YBCO superconductors are investigated and compared using single- and multiple-seeding techniques via top-seeded melt growth (TSMG). Both the microstructural and superconducting properties of the bulk samples are investigated, including trapped field, critical current density, critical temperature and levitation force. The results of this study indicate that, in general, the superconducting properties of YBCO fabricated by a single-seeded process are significantly better than those of samples fabricated by a four-seeded process for non-bridge seeds. The differences between the samples are less pronounced in the levitation force measurements, however. In this paper, we attempt to explain the reasons for the similarities and differences observed between bulk samples fabricated by the different single- and multi-seeded processes."
Microplastics pollution and reduction strategies,"Microplastic particles smaller than 5 mm in size are of increasing concern, especially in aquatic environments, such as the ocean. Primary source is microbeads (<1 mm) used in cosmetics and cleaning agents and fiber fragments from washing of clothes, and secondary source such as broken down plastic litter and debris. These particles are mostly made from polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyesters. They are ingested by diverse marine fauna, including zooplanktons, mussel, oyster, shrimp, fish etc. and can enter human food chains via several pathways. Strategy for control of microplastics pollution should primarily focus on source reduction and subsequently on the development of cost-effective clean up and remediation technologies. Recent research results on biodegradation of plastics have revealed a potential for microbial biodegradation and bioremediation of plastic pollutants, such as PE, PS and PET under appropriate conditions."
Solvent-dehydrated dermal allograft (AXIS™) augmented cystocele repair: longitudinal results,"Surgical repair options for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) include native tissue, allograft, xenograft, and synthetic grafts. Solvent-dehydrated dermal allograft (SDDG) has an improved safety profile. We evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of SDDG use for cystocele repair."
The effects of heterogeneous interaction and risk attitude adaptation on the evolution of cooperation,"This paper addresses the evolution of cooperation in a multi-agent system with agents interacting heterogeneously with each other based on the iterated prisoner’s dilemma (IPD) game. The heterogeneity of interaction is defined in two models. First, agents in a network are restricted to interacting with only their neighbors (local interaction). Second, agents are allowed to adopt different IPD strategies against different opponents (discriminative interaction). These two heterogeneous interaction scenarios are different to the classical evolutionary game, in which each agent interacts with every other agent in the population by adopting the same strategy against all opponents. Moreover, agents adapt their risk attitudes while engaging in interactions. Agents with payoffs above (or below) their aspirations will become more risk averse (or risk seeking) in subsequent interactions, wherein risk is defined as the standard deviation of one-move payoffs in the IPD game. In simulation experiments with agents using only own historical payoffs as aspirations (historical comparison), we find that the whole population can achieve a high level of cooperation via the risk attitude adaptation mechanism, in the cases of either local or discriminative interaction models. Meanwhile, when agents use the population’s average payoff as aspirations (social comparison) for adapting risk attitudes, the high level of cooperation can only be sustained in a portion of the population (i.e., partial cooperation). This finding also holds true in both of the heterogeneous scenarios. Considering that payoffs cannot be precisely estimated in a realistic IPD game, simulation experiments are also conducted with a Gaussian disturbance added to the game payoffs. The results reveal that partial cooperation in the population under social comparison is more robust to the variation in payoffs than the global cooperation under historical comparison."
Self-Reported Questionnaire Detects Family History of Cancer in a Pancreatic Cancer Screening Program,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a leading cause of cancer death; approximately 5–10% of PDAC is hereditary. Self-administered health history questionnaires (HHQs) may provide a low-cost method to detail family history (FH) of malignancy. Pancreas Center patients were asked to enroll in a registry; 149 with PDAC completed a HHQ which included FH data. Patients with FH of PDAC, or concern for inherited PDAC syndrome, were separately evaluated in a Prevention Program and additionally met with a genetic counselor (GC) to assess PDAC risk (n = 61). FH obtained through GC and HHQ were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank sum and generalized linear mixed models with Poisson distribution. Agreement between GC and HHQ risk-assessment was assessed using kappa (κ) statistic. In the Prevention Program, HHQ was as precise in detecting FH of cancer as the GC (all p > 0.05). GC and HHQ demonstrated substantial agreement in risk-stratification of the Prevention Program cohort (κ = 0.73, 95% CI 0.59–0.87.) The sensitivity of the HHQ to detect a patient at elevated risk (i.e., moderate- or high-risk) of PDAC, compared to GC, was 82.9% (95% CI 67.3–92.3%) with a specificity of 95% (95% CI 73.1–99.7%). However, seven patients who were classified as average-risk by the HHQ were found to be at an elevated-risk of PDAC by the GC. In the PDAC cohort, 30/149 (20.1%) reported at least one first-degree relative (FDR) with PDAC. The limited sensitivity of the HHQ to detect patients at elevated risk of PDAC in the Prevention Program cohort suggests that a GC adds value in risk-assessment in this population. The HHQ may offer an opportunity to identify high-risk patients in a PDAC population."
Comparison of the response using ICR mice derived from three different sources to ethanol/hydrochloric acid-induced gastric injury,"Animal models for gastric ulcers produced by physical, pharmacological and surgical methods have been widely employed to evaluate therapeutic drugs and investigate the mechanism of action of this disease. ICR mice were selected to produce this model, even though several mice and rats have been widely used in studies of gastric ulcers. To compare the responses of ICR mice obtained from three different sources to gastric ulcer inducers, alterations in gastric injury, histopathological structure, and inflammation were measured in Korl:ICR (Korea NIFDS source), A:ICR (USA source) and B:ICR (Japan source) treated with three concentrations of ethanol (EtOH) (50, 70, and 90%) in 150 mM hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution. Firstly, the stomach lesion index gradually increased as the EtOH concentration increased in three ICR groups. Moreover, a significant increase in the level of mucosal injury, edema and the number of inflammatory cells was similarly detected in the EtOH/HCl treated group compared with the vehicle treated group in three ICR groups. Furthermore, the number of infiltrated mast cells and IL-1β expression were very similar in the ICR group derived from three different sources, although some differences in IL- 1β expression were detected. Especially, the level of IL-1β mRNA in 50 and 90EtOH/HCl treated group was higher in Korl:ICR and A:ICR than B:ICR. Overall, the results of this study suggest that Korl:ICR, A:ICR and B:ICR derived from different sources have an overall similar response to gastric ulcer induced by EtOH/HCl administration, although there were some differences in the magnitude of their responses."
Beneficial effect of diosgenin as a stimulator of NGF on the brain with neuronal damage induced by Aβ-42 accumulation and neurotoxicant injection,"To investigate the beneficial effects of diosgenin (DC) on the multiple types of brain damage induced by Aβ-42 peptides and neurotoxicants, alterations in the specific aspects of brain functions were measured in trimethyltin (TMT)-injected transgenic 2576 (TG) mice that had been pretreated with DC for 21 days. Multiple types of damage were successfully induced by Aß-42 accumulation and TMT injection into the brains of TG mice. However, DC treatment significantly reduced the number of Aß-stained plaques and dead cells in the granule cells layer of the dentate gyrus. Significant suppression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and Bax/Bcl-2 expression was also observed in the DC treated TG mice (TG+DG group) when compared with those of the vehicle (VC) treated TG mice (TG+VC group). Additionally, the concentration of nerve growth factor (NGF) was dramatically enhanced in TG+DG group, although it was lower in the TG+VC group than the non-transgenic (nTG) group. Furthermore, the decreased phosphorylation of downstream members in the TrkA high affinity receptor signaling pathway in the TG+VC group was significantly recovered in the TG+DG group. A similar pattern was observed in p75NTR expression and JNK phosphorylation in the NGF low affinity receptor signaling pathway. Moreover, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was enhanced in the TG+DG group, while the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of lipid peroxidation, was lower in the TG+DG group than the TG+VC group. These results suggest that DC could exert a wide range of beneficial activities for multiple types of brain damage through stimulation of NGF biosynthesis."
Postnatal changes in glucose transporter 3 expression in the dentate gyrus of the C57BL/6 mouse model,"In this study, we observed the ontogenetic changes in glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) immunoreactivity, a major neuronal GLUT, in the dentate gyrus of mouse brains at various ages: postnatal day (P) 1, 7, 14, 28, and 56. At P1, cresyl violet staining showed abundant neurons in the dentate gyrus, whereas the granule cell layer was ill-defined. At P7, the granule cell layer was observed, and cresyl violet-positive cells were dispersed throughout the polymorphic layer. At P14, the granule cell layer was well-defined, and cresyl violet positive cells were detected abundantly in the polymorphic layer. At P28 and P56, cresyl violet-positive cells were observed in the granule cell layer, as well as in the polymorphic layer. At P1, GLUT3 immunoreactivity was detected in the dentate gyrus. At P7, GLUT3 immunoreactive cells were scattered in the polymorphic and molecular layer. However, at P14, GLUT3 immunoreactivity was observed in the polymorphic layer as well as subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. At P28, GLUT3 immunoreactivity was detected in the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus. At P56, GLUT3 immunoreactivity was observed predominantly in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. GLUT3 immunoreactive cells were mainly colocalized with doublecortin, which is a marker for differentiated neuroblasts, in the polymorphic layer and subgranular zone of dentate gyrus at P14 and P56. These results suggest that the expression of GLUT3 is closely associated with postnatal development of the dentate gyrus and adult neurogenesis."
Antimicrobial activity of essential oil of Eucalyptus globulus against fish pathogenic bacteria,"The antibacterial activities of the essential oil of Eucalyptus globulus (EOEG) was determined against 7 fish pathogenic bacteria (Edwardsiella tarda, Streptococcus iniae, S. parauberis, Lactococcus garviae, Vibrio harveyi, V. ichthyoenteri and Photobacterium damselae) obtained from farmed olive flounder. The inhibitory activity was evaluated by three methods: Disc diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). According to the disc diffusion test, as the concentration of EOEG (5-40 u.g) rises, the inhibitory zone increases in size. Compared with amoxicillin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol, EOEG showed similar antibacterial activity. The MIC of EOEG ranged from 7.8 to 125 mg/mL and MBC values ranged from 62 to 250 mg/mL. These results show that EOEG has antimicrobial activity against all seven bacteria, but there was no marked difference between each genus. From these results, it is suggested that EOEG can be used as an antimicrobial agent against fish bacterial diseases in the fish industry."
Anti-atherosclerotic effects of perilla oil in rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet,"Anti-atherosclerosis effects of perilla oil were investigated, in comparison with lovastatin, in rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet (HCD). Hypercholesterolemia was induced in rabbits by feeding the HCD containing 0.5% cholesterol and 1% corn oil, and perilla oil (0.1 or 0.3%) was added to the diet containing 0.5% cholesterol for 10 weeks. HCD greatly increased blood total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins, and caused thick atheromatous plaques, covering 74% of the aortic wall. Hyper-cholesterolemia also induced lipid accumulation in the liver and kidneys, leading to lipid peroxidation. Perilla oil not only attenuated hypercholesterolemia and atheroma formation, but also reduced fat accumulation and lipid peroxidation in hepatic and renal tissues. The results indicate that perilla oil prevents atherosclerosis and fatty liver by controlling lipid metabolism, and that it could be the first choice oil to improve diet-induced metabolic syndrome."
Multilocus sequence typing analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from pet Chinese stripe-necked turtles (Ocadia sinensis),"Our research sought to characterize the phylogeny of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from pet Chinese stripe-necked turtles (Ocadia sinensis) to better understand its evolutionary relation to other isolates and increase understanding of a potential zoonotic pathogen transmitted through direct contact with pet turtles. Thirty-one Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were obtained from both immature and adult turtles sold in pet shops in Korea. To characterize the phylogenic position of Chinese stripe-necked turtle-borne P. aeruginosa relative to other strains, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was performed due to the accessibility and breadth of MLST databases. Seven housekeeping genes (acsA, aroE, guaA, mutL, nuoD, ppsA, and trpE) were sequenced and the results were compared with data from the MLST database. The genes were further used for phylogenetic analysis of P. aeruginosa using concatenated gene fragments. Both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees were generated. Eleven distinct sequence types were present within the isolates among which seven were new. Expanding an unrooted phylogenetic tree to include P. aeruginosa MLST sequences isolated from various other geographic locations and sources revealed a divergent cluster containing the majority of isolates obtained from turtles. This suggests that P. aeruginosa strains particularly well-adapted for inhabiting turtles occupy a distinct phylogenetic position."
Therapeutic effect of ethyl acetate extract from Asparagus cochinchinensis on phthalic anhydride-induced skin inflammation,"Asparagus cochinchinensis has been used to treat various diseases including fever, cough, kidney disease, breast cancer, inflammatory disease and brain disease, while IL-4 cytokine has been considered as key regulator on the skin homeostasis and the predisposition toward allergic skin inflammation. However, few studies have investigated its effects and IL-4 correlation on skin inflammation to date. To quantitatively evaluate the suppressive effects of ethyl acetate extracts of A. cochinchinensis (EaEAC) on phthalic anhydride (PA)-induced skin inflammation and investigate the role of IL-4 during their action mechanism, alterations in general phenotype biomarkers and luciferase-derived signals were measured in IL-4/Luc/CNS-1 transgenic (Tg) mice with PA-induced skin inflammation after treatment with EaEAC for 2 weeks. Key phenotype markers including lymph node weight, immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentration, epidermis thickness and number of infiltrated mast cells were significantly decreased in the PA+EaEAC treated group compared with the PA+Vehicle treated group. In addition, expression of IL-1ß and TNF-a was also decreased in the PA+EaEAC cotreated group, compared to PA+Vehicle treated group. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the luciferase signal derived from IL-4 promoter was detected in the abdominal region, submandibular lymph node and mesenteric lymph node of the PA+EaEAC treated group, compared to PA+Vehicle treated group. Taken together, these results suggest that EaEAC treatment could successfully improve PA-induced skin inflammation of IL-4/Luc/CNS-1 Tg mice, and that IL-4 cytokine plays a key role in the therapeutic process of EaEAC."
Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging features of compressive cervical myelopathy with traumatic intervertebral disc herniation in cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis),"Intervertebral disc herniation (IVDH) with nucleus pulposus extrusion, traumatic or not, is a devastating clinical condition accompanied by neurological problems. Here we report a cynomolgus macaque suffering from acute and progressive neurological dysfunction by a blunt trauma due to neck collar, an animal handling device. Tetraplegia, urinary incontinence, decreased proprioception, and imperception of pain were shown on physical and neurological examinations. MRI sagittal T2 weighted sequences revealed an extensive protrusion of disc material between C2 and C3 cervical vertebra, and this protrusion resulted in central stenosis of the spinal cord. Histopathologic findings showed a large number of inflammatory cells infiltrated at sites of spinal cord injury (SCI). This case is the first report of compressive cervical SCI caused by IVDH associated with blunt trauma."
"Role of mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-kappa B in 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol-induced hepatic injury","In this study, the potential hepatotoxicity of 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol and its hepatotoxic mechanisms in rats was investigated. The test chemical was administered orally to male rats at 0, 27.5, 55, and 110 mg/kg body weight. 1,3-Dichloro-2-propanol administration caused acute hepatotoxicity, as evidenced by an increase in serum aminotransferases, total cholesterol, and total bilirubin levels and a decrease in serum glucose concentration in a dose-dependent manner with corresponding histopathological changes in the hepatic tissues. The significant increase in malondialdehyde content and the significant decrease in glutathione content and antioxidant enzyme activities indicated that 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol-induced hepatic damage was mediated through oxidative stress, which caused a dose-dependent increase of hepatocellular apoptotic changes in the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling assay and immunohistochemical analysis for caspase-3. The phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases caused by 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol possibly involved in hepatocellular apoptotic changes in rat liver. Furthermore, 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol induced an inflammatory response through activation of nuclear factor-kappa B signaling that coincided with the induction of pro-inflammatory mediators or cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these results demonstrate that hepatotoxicity may be related to oxidative stress-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-kappa B-mediated inflammatory response."
Soil controls biomass and dynamics of an Amazonian forest through the shifting of species and traits,"The effects of soil on tree species composition and trait distributions in tropical forest, and how these interactions affect tree biomass and dynamics, are poorly understood because variation in soil is confounded with variation in climate over large areas. We excluded confounding due to climate by studying variation among 72 1-ha plots within 64 km2, and minimized within-plot variation in soil and stand properties by using long narrow plots oriented along altitudinal contours in Reserva Ducke, Central Amazonia, Brazil. Soil variation caused shifts in tree species composition, which determined stand-level wood density. Soil clay content, cation exchange capacity, plot mean wood density and one-dimensional ordination of tree species composition explained about 40% of variation in tree biomass, 24% of variation in tree mortality and 18% of variation in coarse wood production. As pioneer species were not abundant, lower biomass and higher mortality on sandy soils is a consequence of dominance of species with low to medium wood density adapted to waterlogged and nutrient-poor sandy soils. Therefore, mesoscale variation in biomass and dynamics is caused by co-occurrence of species with similar traits in different parts of the edaphic gradient. Identification of mechanisms controlling tree biomass and dynamics in Amazonian forest will require better understanding of tree–soil physiologic interactions."
"Comparison of copper and zinc effects on growth, micro- and macronutrients status and essential oil constituents in pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium L.)","Biosynthesis and metabolism of phytochemicals in aromatic and medicinal plants are vigorously affected by environmental agents. This study was undertaken to investigate the variations in the growth, nutrient status and the essential oils content and composition of pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium L.) plant exposed to different concentrations of copper (Cu; 0, 5, 25 mg kg−1 soil) and zinc (Zn; 0, 10, 50 mg kg−1 soil). The results of the plant treatment responses revealed that the highest plant height, shoot dry weight, essential oil content and yield were achieved in plants treated with Cu and Zn at 5 and 10 mg kg−1. Low Zn concentration showed a synergistic effect on the uptake of Cu, Fe, Mn and K, whereas it revealed **contrary effect on phosphorus (P) status. However, Cu in 5 mg kg−1 poses positive effect on Fe, Mn and P content in root and shoot tissues. Moreover, the addition of Cu and Zn especially at 5 and 10 mg kg−1 was the optimal level in increasing the status of K, Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn in shoot, infusion and decoction. The constituents and quality of M. pulegium essential oils in terms of its major volatile components, namely pulegone, cis-isopulegone, α-pinene, sabinene, 1,8-cineol and thymol, improved significantly with Cu and Zn treatment as compared to control. From this standpoint, M. pulegium can be grown as alternative crop for mildly Cu- and Zn-polluted agricultural soils without contamination of the its industrial products."
"Rumination mediates the associations between sexual minority stressors and disordered eating, particularly for men","Sexual minority individuals experience unique minority stressors leading to negative clinical outcomes, including disordered eating. The psychological mediation framework posits that stress related to discrimination, internalized homonegativity, and concealment makes sexual minority individuals more vulnerable to maladaptive coping processes, such as rumination, known to predict disordered eating. The current study examined the influence of sexual minority stressors and rumination on disordered eating, and whether these associations differed between sexual minority men and women. We hypothesized that perceived discrimination, internalized homonegativity, and concealment would be positively associated with disordered eating, and that rumination about sexual minority stigma would mediate these associations."
School Nurses’ perspectives on the role of the school nurse in health education and health promotion in England: a qualitative study,The role of the school nurse is complex with many possible elements identified by previous research. The aim of this study is to understand perceptions of the role of the school nurse in order to support school nurses in the delivery of health education.
"Predictors of knowledge and practice of exclusive breastfeeding among health workers in Mwanza city, northwest Tanzania","Universal exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for the first 6 months is estimated to reduce infant mortality by 13–15% (9 million) in resource poor countries. Although 97% of women initiate breastfeeding in Tanzania, exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months remains below 50%. Accurate knowledge and practical skills pertaining to exclusive breastfeeding among health workers is likely to improve breastfeeding rates. Our study reports the health workers’ knowledge and practice on EBF in Mwanza City, northwest of Tanzania."
From demand response to transactive energy: state of the art,"This paper reviews the state of the art of research and industry practice on demand response and the new methodology of transactive energy. Demand response programs incentivize consumers to align their demand with power supply conditions, enhancing power system reliability and economic operation. The design of demand response programs, performance of pilot projects and programs, consumer behaviors, and barriers are discussed. Transactive energy is a variant and a generalized form of demand response in that it manages both the supply and demand sides. It is intended for a changing environment with an increasing number of distributed resources and intelligent devices. It utilizes the flexibility of various generation/load resources to maintain a dynamic balance of supply and demand. These distributed resources are controlled by their owners. However, the design of transaction mechanisms should align the individual behaviors with the interests of the entire system. Transactive energy features real-time, autonomous, and decentralized decision making. The transition from demand response to transactive energy is also discussed."
Military-civilian cooperative emergency response to infectious disease prevention and control in China,"In recent years, the incidence of severe infectious diseases has increased, and the number of emerging infectious diseases continues to increase. The Chinese government and military forces have paid a great deal of attention to infectious disease prevention and control, and using military-civilian cooperation, they have successfully prevented numerous severe epidemic situations, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza A (H1N1), avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9, and Ebola hemorrhagic fever, while actively maintained public health, economic development, and national construction. This paper focuses on the mechanisms of the military-cooperative emergency response to infectious diseases--the joint working mechanism, the information-sharing mechanism, the research collaboration mechanism, and the joint disposal mechanism--and presents a sorted summary of the practices and experiences of cooperative emergency responses to infectious diseases. In the future, the Chinese military and the civilian sector will further strengthen the cooperative joint command system and emergency rescue force and will reinforce their collaborative information-sharing platform and technical equipment system to further improve military-civilian collaborative emergency infectious diseases disposal, advance the level of infectious disease prevention and control, and maintain public health."
Does increased connectivity with the Mediterranean Sea improve the ecological status of the macroinvertebrates in the lagoon of Boughrara (SW Mediterranean)?,"The lagoon of Boughrara is an almost closed system, with limited hydrological connections with the sea. Over the past several decades, the lagoon has been exposed to increased pollution due to growing human activities in the surrounding area. From 2004–2007, the channel “El-Kantra” connecting the lagoon to the sea has been extended with increased mixing with marine waters. In this work, we monitored the ecosystem of the lagoon after its rapid exposure to development and associated pollution. Two marine surveys were carried out in winter 2010 and then in winter 2013; the sediment was sampled and the principal physical and chemical parameters were measured at 13 stations. Results show that aspects of the environmental quality of the lagoon have improved from 2010 to 2013, most likely due to the extension of the channel whereby lagoon waters are better mixed resulting in improved physico-chemical conditions over this timeframe. Nevertheless, the study of the macrobenthic community did not show any improvement. On the contrary, the species richness and the abundance of the macrofauna have decreased, and some tolerant species such as bivalves (Abra alba and Cerastoderma edule) have increased in abundance. This demonstrates continued impacts on the lagoon ecosystem."
Analytical successional tools of fouling communities submitted to different light effects,"The present study uses transition matrices to compare successional processes (colonization, disturbance, persistence and replacement) of fouling communities submitted to different light effects on Cabo Frio Island, a seasonal upwelling region. Twelve functional groups were identified, and differences in the transition probabilities shown by the matrices suggest a preference for the replacement property of functional groups, which indicates the facilitation successional mechanism. The probability of colonization of these groups differed according to the direction of the substrate, which caused a negative effect of light reduction on algae with a greater probability of disturbance (sensu species replacement), which is typical of a more stressful environment. Species of the same functional group replace each other through competition and herbivory, which promotes the distinction between earlier and later groups on the successional process. Successional trajectories evaluated through global transition matrices change at each time step because they depend on the species turnover rate, and therefore, they are informative of the changing processes of the community. The probabilistic rate of changes related to successional processes may be used to evaluate future conditions of fouling communities, and the deterministic components and stochastic elements will render these communities self-organizable."
"Topological and biomass balance approaches to analyzing food webs of Bahía Magdalena, Baja California Sur, Mexico","In this paper, we used two methodological approaches to analyze the structure and function of a trophic web in the temperate coastal lagoon of Bahía Magdalena, Baja California Sur, Mexico, which represents the largest wetland ecosystem along the west coast of the Baja California peninsula. Ecosystem structure was studied using a topological approach, while ecosystem functioning was analyzed using a biomass balance model. Connectance values indicated a low number of functional group interactions, consistent with the range proposed for similar marine trophic webs. This pattern may reflect incorporation of a few functional groups clustered along the trophic web. Results would vary if the model included more functional groups or different levels of aggregation, since aggregation and diversity strongly influence the base of the food web. Topological results suggest that trophic web structure depends primarily on lower and intermediate trophic level organisms like macrobenthic invertebrates, penaeid shrimp and marine turtles. Balance biomass model results suggest that trophic groups positioned on the first level most strongly support Bahía Magdalena trophic web functioning. In particular, the pelagic red crab (Pleurocondes planipes) transfers energy between basal and upper levels of the food web (a wasp-waist energy control). When compared to ecosystems at different latitudes, the results indicate that the Bahía Magdalena ecosystem is still in a developmental phase, wherein trophic web functioning depends largely on the balance between energy flows originating from primary producers and those originating from detrital pathways. While these results are preliminary, they demonstrate the potential of combined topological and biomass approaches in analyzing highly organized ecosystems. The combined approach can make both theoretical and empirical predictions about the functional response of real systems to structural changes, thus enhancing evidence-based methods for ecosystem management."
Vegetative sprouting as an additional pathway for a seed size-number trade-off: a field-parameterised simulation approach,"Studies of perennial plants generally search for a seed size vs. seed number trade-off. Surprisingly, the fact that perennials may replace an investment in large seeds by the allocation to vegetative propagation has not yet been investigated as an additional pathway enabling species coexistence. We focused on the mechanisms of coexistence in Carex elata and C. elongata, two co-occurring clonal sedges dominant in European swamp alder forests. We asked the following questions: i) Is the number of germinated seeds a better predictor of species coexistence than the total number of seeds? ii) What recruitment conditions and competition rules determine vegetative sprouting to be an alternative to large, competitively superior seeds? We measured several species functional traits related to the colonisation and fitness of perennials. To examine the competitive hierarchy between species and microsite species preferences, we analysed the effects of environmental factors and plant densities on fitness-related traits using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Then, using a series of spatially explicit simulations partly parameterised based on the field measurement, we evaluated the importance of seed and ramet propagation and recruitment conditions for long-term species coexistence. SEM indicated a competitive hierarchy and a large overlap in microsite preferences between species. As a response to our initial questions we found that: i) Only differences in the numbers of germinated seeds, allowed the two species to coexist. If we consider only differences in the total number of seeds, the superior competitor (Carex elata) outcompeted the inferior competitor (C. elongata) in all scenarios. This is because the former produced about three-times as many seeds as the latter. ii) We show that vegetative sprouting represents an additional pathway for the seed size-number trade-off when the competitive superiority of species is attributed to vegetative propagation. This is another way that a species deals with the omnipresent seeds of other species. Taken together, our study demonstrates that differences in seed performance, coupled with differences in vegetative propagation related to competitive ability, are an additional mechanism allowing the coexistence of perennial plants."
Analysis of δ13C and δ15N isotopic signatures to shed light on the hydrological cycle’s influence on the trophic behavior of fish in a Mediterranean reservoir,"Stable isotope analysis (SIA) of carbon and nitrogen sheds light on the origin of the food resources exploited by the fish and provides basic information on the trophic relationships among taxa. In this study, SIA of C and N was used to investigate the trophic behavior of fish species in a small Mediterranean reservoir, Lake Sos Canales (SC) in Sardinia, Italy, during an annual hydrological cycle. Fish were caught approximately every two months, and baseline isotopic C and N levels in the pelagic and littoral area were analyzed to establish the origin of fish food sources, considering suspended particulate matter, planktonic crustaceans and littoral macroinvertebrates. To assess the relative contribution of the two different sources using SIA, a Dynamic Baseline Mixing Model (DBMM) was applied and the results were compared with the fish gut contents. Our aim was to chart the seasonal trophic behavior of the fish species inhabiting an anthropogenic aquatic environment under considerable stress due to water level fluctuations. Isotopic results showed a seasonal trend with 13C levels depleted more in autumn-winter and less in spring-summer, while an inverse trend was recorded for 15N, both in the isotopic baseline values and in the fish. Isotopic results and gut content analysis highlighted a year-round strict dependence on littoral food sources only for the brown trout, whereas the mosquitofish changed their trophic behavior seasonally, shifting from littoral (high water level period) to pelagic (low water level period) food sources, mirroring the hydrological conditions of Lake SO"
The Effects of Cadmium on the Biochemical and Physiological Parameters of Eruca Sativa,"In this study, Eruca sativa (Rocket) seedlings were treated with different cadmium (Cd) concentrations (0, 150, 300 and 450 μg ∙ g−1). The effects of Cd on lipid peroxidation, enzymatic (APx, CAT, GPX, SOD) and non-enzymatic antioxidants (total ascorbate, dehydroascorbate, ascorbate, non-protein thiol), fresh and dry masses, water content were determined. Also, Cd content of the leaves and the roots were analysed. The highest cadmium accumulation of leaves was at 450 μg ∙ g−1 Cd treatment and the accumulation was 2.62 times greater than those in the roots. The translocation factor was 3.89 at 300 μg ∙ g−1 Cd treatment. Cd treatments caused decreases of fresh, dry mass and water content of leaves and roots. Malondialdehyde content, which is an index of lipid peroxidation, was increased in proportion with the increase in Cd. While there was not change in the activity of GPX according to control, a decrease in activities of SOD, CAT and APX were observed with the increase of cadmium concentration. Although a significant increase in the amounts of non-protein thiol groups and proline were observed in 450 μg ∙ g−1 Cd treated plants, Cd did not lead to a significant change in AsA, DHA and total AsA contents. According to the results of the research, E. sativa may be a Cd hyperaccumulator plant and we suggest that the plant may be a candidate plant for remediation of Cd-contaminated soil."
Proteomic Insight Into the Primycin Fermentation Process of Saccharomonospora Azurea,"Saccharomonospora azurea SZMC 14600 is a member of the family Pseudonocardiaceae exclusively used for industrial scale production of primycin a large 36-membered non-polyene macrolide lactone antibiotic belonging to the polyketide class of natural products. Even though maximum antibiotic yield has been achieved by empirically optimized two-step fermentation process, little is known about the molecular components and mechanisms underlying the efficient antibiotic production. In order to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between the pre- and main-fermentation stages of primycin, comparative 2D-PAGE experiments were performed. In total, 98 DEP spots were reproducibly detected, out of which four spots were excised from gels, and identified through MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Peptide mass fingerprint analysis revealed peptide matches to HicB antitoxin for the HicAB toxinantitoxin system (EHK86651), to a nucleoside diphosphate kinase regulator ((Ndk; EHK81899) and two other proteins with unknown function (EHK88946 and EHK86777)."
"TK1656, an L-asparaginase from Thermococcus kodakarensis, a novel candidate for therapeutic applications","L-Asparaginase is a potential therapeutic agent owing to its anti-tumor activity. We have previously characterized a thermostable L-asparaginase (TK1656F from Thermococcus kodakaraensis that exhibits highest ever reported enzymatic activity, no glutaminase activity and high stability. In this study we have compared the cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative activity of TK1656 and a commercially available L-asparaginase from Escherichia coli on cancerous cells. Despite of the thermophilic origin, the amount of TK1656 required to inhibit equivalent growth of HeLa cells at 37°C was three times less than that of the L-asparaginase from E. coli. It is worth mentioning that TK1656 showed much reduced cytotoxic effect on non-cancerous cells as compared to the E. coli counterpart. Furthermore, TK1656 was found to potentiate induction of apoptosis of cancerous cells. Overall, our findings suggest that TK1656 harbors a remarkable potential for the cancer chemotherapeutics."
Diel activity and use of multiple artificially constructed shelters in Astacus leptodactylus (Decapoda: Astacidae),"Astacus leptodactylus is a widespread European crayfish species with both native and invasive populations. However, in spite of its wide distribution, studies regarding its activity seem to be lacking. Thus, our goal was to study its preference towards shelters built from natural and artificial materials and follow its activities throughout the day in order to understand its diel activity patterns. We analyzed the video recordings of diel activities for 20 individuals to find out more about this species routine in a captive environment. Every specimen spent 22 hours in an arena with 4 different kinds of shelters provided (stone, wood, PVC pipe, vegetation). We investigated time spent in every shelter and different activity patterns throughout the analysis period. A preference for stone and wooden shelters was clearly expressed by all the individuals, independent of sex and size. Most of the activity was concentrated in close proximity to the provided shelters. Individuals exhibited both daytime and nighttime activity, with the latter being more intense, although, specimens spent almost 85% of the entire time inside shelters. Crayfish used all available shelters during our trials, proving a wide flexibility of the species towards shelter type, but the frequency of visits and time spent inside certain type of shelter varied significantly. Our study brings novel information regarding narrow-clawed crayfish shelter preference and activity in the proximity of the shelters, highlighting the importance of natural refuges in its daily routine."
Lipschitz continuity of the value function in mixed-integer optimal control problems,"We study the optimal value function for control problems on Banach spaces that involve both continuous and discrete control decisions. For problems involving semilinear dynamics subject to mixed control inequality constraints, one can show that the optimal value depends locally Lipschitz continuously on perturbations of the initial data and the costs under rather natural assumptions. We prove a similar result for perturbations of the initial data, the constraints and the costs for problems involving linear dynamics, convex costs and convex constraints under a Slater-type constraint qualification. We show by an example that these results are in a sense sharp."
Myocardial stress perfusion magnetic resonance: initial experience in a pediatric and young adult population using regadenoson,"Dipyridamole and adenosine are traditional pharmacological stressors for myocardial perfusion. Regadenoson, a selective adenosine A2A agonist, has a lower side effect profile with lower incidence of bronchospasm and bradycardia. There is a growing need for myocardial perfusion assessment within pediatrics. There is no report on the utility of regadenoson as a stress agent in children."
Does substitution of brand name medications by generics differ between pharmacotherapeutic classes? A population-based cohort study in France,"The purpose of this study was to measure the rate of substitution failure to generic antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) compared to two other pharmacotherapeutic classes (neuroleptics, beta-blockers)."
Six-year activity on approval of compassionate use of medicines by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Bologna (Italy): time to update rules and recommendations,Compassionate use of forthcoming drugs has become an increasing pathway through which patients can take advantage of promising medicines. We aimed to analyse the main features of the requests of compassionate use submitted to the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of the University Hospital of Bologna in the period 2010–2015.
Evidence of independent evolution of genotype XIII Newcastle disease viruses in India,"Despite the prevalence of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) outbreaks in India through the decades, there has been little genetic characterisation of the virulent strains circulating in Northeast India. In 2014, a poultry farm in the Kamrup district of Assam reported an ND outbreak. In this study, genetic analysis and clinicopathological tests showed the virulent nature of the isolate Kamrup. Based on prudent classification criteria, the virulent strain Kamrup was found to be most closely related to members of genotype XIII of class II NDV. A phylogenetic analysis of NDV strains suggested three sub-genotypes: XIIIa, XIIIb and XIIIc. NDV strain Kamrup belonged to sub-genotype XIIIc. Sub-genotype XIIIc isolates were similar to the 1982 isolate from cockatoo and appeared to have evolved parallel to the preceding genotype XIII viruses circulating in India. The high genetic diversity and frequency of mutations observed in the envelope glycoproteins of strain Kamrup demonstrate the evolution of the pandemic genotype XIII NDV in India, which further undermines and complicates of NDV management in India."
Thermal stability and thermal degradation kinetics of bio-based epoxy resins derived from cardanol by thermogravimetric analysis,"Cardanol is a naturally occurring chemical compound consisting of meta substituted alkyl phenol. Two types of epoxy resins have been synthesized from cardanol. The synthesized epoxy resins have been characterized by FTIR and NMR spectroscopic analyses. The thermal stabilities and kinetics of the thermal degradation of cardanol-based resins were studied by thermogravimetric analysis under a nitrogen atmosphere with heating rates of 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C min−1. The molecular weights of the prepared novolac and epoxidized novolac resins were determined by gel permeation chromatography analysis. There is intense interest in understanding the degradation behavior and properties of cardanol-based epoxy resins. Three model-free methods, Kissinger, Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) and Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO), and the model-fitting Coats–Redfern method were employed to identify the kinetic triplet including activation energy, pre-exponential factor and reaction model. It was established that the Coats–Redfern model-fitting method is suitable for determining the kinetic reaction mechanism, but the most probable reaction functions R3 and D3 can be evaluated on the basis of the activation energy value which is nearest to the value of activation energy obtained by the FWO and KAS methods. A kinetic compensation effect was also observed for the above-mentioned bio-based epoxy resins."
Resolutions for unit groups of orders,We present a general algorithm for constructing a free resolution for unit groups of orders in semisimple rational algebras. The approach is based on computing a contractible G-complex employing the theory of minimal classes of quadratic forms and Opgenorth’s theory of dual cones. The information from the complex is then used together with Wall’s perturbation lemma to obtain the resolution.
Na7[Ga2B13O24(OH)4]: A Luminescent Sodium Gallium Borate Containing Two Different Types of Oxoboron Framework Building Blocks,"A new crystalline luminescent sodium gallium borate, namely, Na7Ga2B13O24(OH)4 (1), has been successfully synthesized through a surfactant-thermal method, and characterized by single-crystal X-ray structural analysis, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, and UV–Vis spectroscopy. Crystal data for 1: monoclinic, C2/c, a = 9.9918(8) Å, b = 8.4550(8) Å, c = 26.596(3) Å, β = 94.279(6)o, V = 2240.6(3), Z = 4. Compound 1 displays a 3D framework and contains two different oxoboron framework building blocks, namely B3O6(OH) and B7O14(OH)2 units, linked by oxo bridges or by tetrahedral Ga3+ centres. To date, the use of surfactant media in the synthesis of metal borates is relatively unexplored. Compounds 1 emits blue luminescence. UV–Vis spectral investigation indicates that 1 is a wide-band-gap semiconductor. Our results offer a new opportunity to grow diverse crystalline metal borates using surfactant-thermal strategy."
"Effects of Ti content on the structural and the magnetic properties of ZnCrO:Ti (Cr: 1 at.%, Ti: 0 - 0.8 at.%) thin films","We investigated the effects of the Ti content on the structural and the magnetic properties of ZnCrO:Ti thin films (Cr: 1.0 at.%, Ti: 0 - 0.8 at.%). The samples were prepared by co-sputtering of ZnCrO and Ti and showed the Ti solution limit to be ~0.3 at.%. When the Ti additives were doped with an appropriate concentration less than the solution limit, the magnetic properties of the films were improved due to the increased magnetic moments from Ti2+ ions (i.e., 3d24s0). For the samples doped with large amounts of Ti dopants over the solution limit, however, the magnetization was gradually degraded due to the formation of metastable TiO2 and ZnCrTiO having no spins (i.e., 3d04s0)."
In-vivo analysis of the uptake process of heavy metals through maize roots by using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy,"The uptake of heavy metals by plants has been receiving much attention for crop contamination and phytoremediation. We employed synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy for an in-vivo analysis of heavy-metal uptake through a strand of maize root. A focused X-ray beam of 2.5 × 2.5 μm2 in physical dimensions was scanned along horizontal lines of the maize root at intervals of 3 μm at the 4B X-ray micro-diffraction beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL). Time-resolved mapping of the fluorescence intensities from multiple metallic elements in the root tissues provided information about the radial distributions of heavy-metal elements and their temporal variations. The concentrated core stream of heavy-metal elements spread radially up to roughly 500 μm, corresponding to 40 % of the root diameter. The absorption characteristics of three heavy metals, Cr, Mn and Ni, and their physiological features were analyzed. The absolute concentrations and the contents of the heavy-metal elements in the tested maize roots were quantitatively evaluated by using the calibration curve obtained from reference samples with preset concentrations. The uptake quantities of the tested heavy-metal elements are noticeably different, although their molecular weights are similar. This study should be helpful for understanding plant physiology related with heavy-metal uptake."
Surface strain effects on the adsorption and the diffusion of Au atoms on MgO(001) surfaces,"The effects of surface strain on the adsorption and the diffusion properties of a Au adatom on MgO(001) surfaces are studied using first-principles electronic-structure calculations based on the density functional theory. The adsorption of Au on MgO(001) is found to become stronger with increasing surface strain. In addition, the adsorption site of Au changes from a site on top of a surface O atom of MgO(001) to a site near a surface O atom for tensile surface strains over +4 %. In the case of a tensile surface strain of +7 %, the adsorption energy changes from −0.87 eV for unstrained MgO(001) to −1.17 eV. The variation in the charge states of Au on MgO(001) with surface strain, based on a Bader charge analysis, is also presented. The Bader charges of Au are found to become more negative as the surface strain increases. For a tensile surface strain of +7 %, the Bader charge is −0.38 |e|, more negative than the value of −0.29 |e| for unstrained MgO(001). Contrary to the adsorption energies and the charge states of Au, the variation in the surface diffusion barriers of Au on MgO(001) is found to be very small, less than 0.03 eV."
Half-chain entanglement entropy in the one-dimensional spinless fermion model,"We calculate the half-chain entanglement entropy of the ground state in the one-dimensional spinless fermion model. Considering a tiny corner of the Hilbert space represented by matrix product states, we efficiently find the ground state by using infinite time-evolving block decimation. The Schmidt coefficients are used to determine the half-chain entanglement entropy. Using the bond dimension scaling of the half-chain entanglement entropy, we find the critical region, which is consistent with the previous results."
Deviations from stoichiometry and molecularity in non-stoichiometric Ag-In-Se thin films: Effects on the optical and the electrical properties,"Non-stoichiometric Ag-In-Se (AIS) thin films were prepared using co-sputtering with InSe2 and Ag targets followed by rapid thermal annealing. The internal stress of the non-stoichiometric AIS thin films was strongly affected by the deviation from molecularity, Δm. When Δm was far from stoichiometry, the non-stoichiometric AIS thin films showed better crystallinity. The improvement in the crystallinity and the release of internal stress led to a reduction in the optical band gap from 1.63 to 1.19 eV and in the resistivity from 6.45 × 10−2 to 3.21 × 10−3 Ω·cm for the non-stoichiometric AIS thin films, with a similar tendency for the deviation from molecularity, Δm. The non-stoichiometric AIS thin films, with Δm < 0 and Δs < 0, exhibited n-type conductivity with carrier concentrations on the order of magnitude of 1018 cm−3. The mean absorbance of the 200-nm-thick non-stoichiometric AIS thin films was 1.50, corresponding to an absorption of approximately 96.84 % of the incident light in the visible region."
Development of a novel depth-of-interaction encoding method and use of light spreading in a scintillation crystal array with single-ended readout,"We designed a depth-of-interaction (DOI) positron emission tomography detector by applying a simple light-spreading method in a single-layer crystal array with a single-ended photosensor. By configuring different reflector patterns along the depth of the crystal, we were able to alter the light distribution of the gamma interaction at each depth. To evaluate the characteristics of the new DOI detector, we simulated the optical photon transport in the crystal array by using DETECT2000. Three different arrays comprising triangular-, square-, and hexagonal-shaped crystals were modeled. The 511-keV gamma-ray interactions were generated for all depths, and flood images were acquired. We confirmed that DOI layers could be distinguished in the obtained images and that the number of DOI layers depends on the number of sides of the polygonal crystals."
Ten-year patient-reported outcomes following total and minimally invasive unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: a propensity score-matched cohort analysis,"For patients with medial compartment arthritis who have failed non-operative treatment, either a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) can be undertaken. This analysis considers how the choice between UKA and TKA affects long-term patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)."
Clinical outcome and prognostic factors of revision arthroscopic rotator cuff tear repair,The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of arthroscopic rotator cuff revision surgery in a cohort of patients and to identify prognostic factors for this procedure.
Postoperative Outcomes of Laparoscopic Bariatric Surgery in Older Obese Patients: a Matched Case-Control Study,Laparoscopic bariatric surgery (LBS) in older obese patients remains debated regarding postoperative outcomes.
Extraction of Phospholipids from Egg Yolk Flakes Using Aqueous Alcohols,"Two alcohols, ethanol and butanol, with different water contents were evaluated for phospholipids (PL) sequential extraction from drum dried egg yolk flakes. It showed that butanol was more effective in extracting total yolk lipids compared to ethanol, but the PL in the extract had the same concentration as in the original yolk total lipid. The use of aqueous ethanol of 95 and 75% resulted in lipid extracts with higher PL concentration during the initial stages of the sequential extraction. When ethanol was further diluted to a concentration of 55%, the solvent lost its PL extraction ability, and the total lipid recovery also decreased dramatically. When both the PL purity and recovery were considered, 75% ethanol was the most effective aqueous alcohol for PL extraction and enrichment from the yolk flakes. In the first stage of extraction using such a solvent, 67% of the total PL in the original yolk was recovered in a lipid fraction with a PL purity of 75%. This study identified the optimal ethanol concentration for PL extraction from dried egg yolk. With this information, the best solid:solvent ratio can be designed to extract and enrich the polar lipids from lipid-bearing materials with known moisture content using a renewable or “green” solvent, ethanol."
Poverty and the business cycle: A regional panel data analysis for Spain using alternative measures of unemployment,"Conventional wisdom predicts that changes in the aggregate unemployment rate may significantly affect a country’s income distribution and, consequently, have a relevant impact on the evolution of its poverty rate. However, the relationship between labour macroeconomic indicators and poverty seems to have become weaker recently. Using panel data on unemployment and poverty for Spanish regions, we estimate a system GMM model to model this relationship using alternative measures of the unemployment rate. We also test the hypothesis of asymmetric effects of the business cycle on the share of poor individuals in the population. Our results show that unemployment has a positive impact on severe poverty, while inflation has a negative effect. We also highlight the extent to which results differ when alternative intra-household unemployment distribution-sensitive measures are considered. Regarding the existence of asymmetric business cycle effects on severe poverty, our results show that despite the fact that the Great Recession has had a strong and positive effect on severe poverty, the effects of expansions and recessions on poverty are not significantly different."
Determining and Comparing Multivariate Distributions: An Application to AORD and GSPC with their related financial markets,"Many real world applications are associated with more than one variable and hence, identifying multivariate distributions associated with real world problems portrays great importance today. Many studies can be found in the literature in this aspect and most of them are associated with two variables/dimensions and the maximum dimension of multivariate distribution found in the literature is four. Different optimization techniques have been used by researchers to find multivariate distributions in their studies. Numerical methods can be identified as more preferable than analytical methods when the dimension of the problem is high. The main objective of this study is to identify the multivariate distribution associated with the return series of Australian all ordinary index (AORD) and those of the related financial markets and compare it with the multivariate distribution of return series of the US GSPC index and its related financial markets. No research were found in the literature which were aimed at finding aforesaid multivariate distribution and comparisons. Moreover no evidence found for identifying a multivariate distribution with six dimensions. Five financial markets: Amex oil index, Amex gold index, world cocoa index, exchange rate of Australian dollar to United States dollar and US GSPC index were found to be associated with AORD. Hence the attempt was to derive the multivariate distribution of return series of AORD and these five return series and therefore the optimization problem of the study is a six dimension problem which associated with forty three parameters need to be estimated. A local optimization technique and a global optimization technique were used to estimate the parameters of the multivariate distribution. Results exhibit that the parameter estimates obtained from the global optimization technique are better than the parameter estimates obtained from the local optimization technique. The multivariate distribution of return series of AORD and related financial markets is central, less peaked and have fat tails. A comparison was done with another multivariate distribution of a return series of a leading stock market index: GSPC and return series of its associated financial markets and found that both distributions are alike in shape. Two periods were identified in the AORD series and found that the shape of the multivariate distribution of one period is similar to the shape of the multivariate distribution of full data set while the shape of the multivariate distribution of the other period is dissimilar to that of full data set."
"Attraction of Coffee Bean Weevil, Araecerus fasciculatus, to Volatiles from the Industrial Yeast Kluyveromyces lactis","The coffee bean weevil (CBW), Araecerus fasciculatus (De Geer, 1775) (Coleoptera: Anthribidae) is an important pest of stored products such as grains, coffee beans, cassava, and traditional Chinese medicine materials. In China, CBW causes large losses of Daqu, a traditional Chinese liquor fermentation starter, and, unfortunately, the use of conventional insecticides against CBW is not suitable in Daqu storage. We found CBW to be highly attracted to fermenting yeast cultures, such as Kluyveromyces lactis. Eight volatile compounds, produced by fermenting cultures and not by sterile samples, were identified by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Five of these substances elicited significant responses in Y-tube behavioral bioassays. Field trapping experiments revealed 2-phenylethanol and 2-phenylethyl acetate to be crucial for attraction of CBW. Results show that yeast volatiles play an important role in host location, and that 2-phenylethanol and 2-phenylethyl acetate could be utilized as potential attractants in monitoring and control systems against this important pest."
Optimization of laser micro milling of alumina ceramic using radial basis functions and MOGA-II,"Laser milling provides an efficient method for the fabrication of micro-featured products for a wide range of materials including ceramics by directly importing the design data in various CAD formats. Despite the good process capabilities, research on micro milling for structural ceramics has been given less attention as compared to micro drilling and turning. In addition, most of the studies are limited to factorial analysis. Optimization in terms of multiple objectives and constraints are rare. This paper considers the analysis and optimization of Nd:YAG laser micro milling of alumina ceramic using smooth spline analysis of variance (ANOVA), radial basis functions (RBF), and a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA-II). MOGA-II uses a new smart multi-search elitism operator. It has been found that low surface roughness for micro-milled alumina ceramic is obtained with low frequencies, low pulse overlaps, and moderate intensities. On the other hand, high material removal rates are associated with high laser beam intensities. Optimized solutions are characterized by low and moderate frequencies, high intensities, and medium pulse overlaps."
Energy consumption characteristics of turn-mill machining,"Reducing the energy consumption of manufacturing processes and machine tools can considerably affect the environmental and economic impact of industrial activities. Since the 2008 global financial crisis, many scholars have focused on modeling the energy consumption of basic machining processes such as turning, milling or grinding, etc., and investigated the consumption characteristics of related machine tools. At the same time, various industries have increased their use of more complex and hybrid machine tool systems such as turn-mill machines; these advanced systems have part and operation flexibility and can be set up in a relatively short amount of time. As the complexity of these typically high-precision machining systems increases, understanding their energy consumption characteristics becomes more difficult. This study aimed to develop a generic energy model for turn-mill machine tools and related processes in order to predict the energy consumption of complex parts with both turn and mill features. The generic prediction model is adapted to a high precision, high-end turn-mill machine tool and further verified by two case studies. The results of the first case study revealed that the energy estimation model developed in this study had a 95% accuracy in estimating the energy consumption of a workpiece with both milling and turning features. The second case study investigated energy consumption of orthogonal turn-milling process with a high material removal rate (MRR), first time in literature. The results of this second case study indicate that even though the power requirements of turn-milling are higher than conventional rough cut turning, the high MRR results in a lower total energy consumed per feature."
A weighted rough set based fuzzy axiomatic design approach for the selection of AM processes,"Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing, as an enabling technology for mass customization or personalization, has been developed rapidly in recent years. Various design tools, materials, machines and service bureaus can be found in the market. Clearly, the choices are abundant, but users can be easily confused as to which AM process they should use. This paper first reviews the existing multi-attribute decision-making methods for AM process selection and assesses their suitability with regard to two aspects, preference rating flexibility and performance evaluation objectivity. We propose that an approach that is capable of handling incomplete attribute information and objective assessment within inherent data has advantages over other approaches. Based on this proposition, this paper proposes a weighted preference graph method for personalized preference evaluation and a rough set based fuzzy axiomatic design approach for performance evaluation and the selection of appropriate AM processes. An example based on the previous research work of AM machine selection is given to validate its robustness for the priori articulation of AM process selection decision support."
Future emissions of marine halogenated very-short lived substances under climate change,"Halogenated Very Short-lived Substances (VSLS), such as bromoform, dibromomethane and methyl iodide, are naturally produced in the oceans and are involved in ozone depletion in the troposphere and the stratosphere. The effect of climate change on the oceanic emissions of these compounds is not well quantified. Based on present-day observed global oceanic and atmospheric concentrations, and historic and future data from three CMIP5 models, past and future sea-to-air fluxes of these VSLS are calculated. The simulations are used to infer possible effects of projected changes of physical forcing on emissions in different oceanic regimes. CMIP5 model output for 1979–2100 from the historical scenario and the RCP scenarios 2.6 and 8.5 are used as input data for the emission calculations. Of the parameters that have the main influence on the sea-to-air fluxes, the global sea surface temperatures show a steady increase during the twenty-first century, while the projected changes of sea surface wind speed is very small. The calculated emissions based on the historical CMIP5 model runs (1979–2005) increased over the 26 year period and agree well with the emissions based on ERA-Interim data. The future sea-to-air fluxes of VSLS generally increase during the twenty-first century under the assumption of constant concentration fields in the ocean and atmosphere. The multi-model mean global emissions of bromoform increase by 29.4% (9.0%) between 1986 and 2005 and 2081–2100 under RCP 8.5 (2.6) and dibromomethane and methyl iodide emissions increase by 23.3% (6.4%) and 5.5% (1.5%), respectively. Uncertainties of the future emission estimates, driven by ongoing environmental changes such as changing oceanic productivity (not considered in this study) are discussed."
A note on the Fefferman–Stein inequality on Morrey spaces,"In this paper, we discuss the Fefferman–Stein inequality on Morrey spaces and give a sufficient and necessary condition for which the inequality holds. Further, we give an example of weights such that the Fefferman–Stein inequality on Morrey spaces fails. We also consider the multilinear setting."
Importance of background seasonality over the eastern equatorial Pacific in a coupled atmosphere-ocean response to westerly wind events,"Coupled atmosphere-ocean response to westerly wind events (WWEs), which sometimes trigger El Niños, was investigated using a coupled general circulation model to clarify its dependence on the timing and location of WWEs. Twelve sets of 20-member ensembles were made with an idealized single WWE imposed in different months from January to July and at different longitudes from 160\(^\circ\)E to 160\(^\circ\)W. The initial ocean states are set to be near neutral to El Niño/La Niña so that the lagged response to WWEs can be isolated. The results show that sea surface temperature (SST) in the Niño3.4 region increases largely and persistently favorable for El Niño growth when a WWE is imposed in May, whereas a WWE in March increases SST only in the easternmost Pacific. In both cases, an oceanic Kelvin wave propagates eastward to warm the eastern Pacific. When forced by the WWE in May, a positive Niño3.4 SST anomaly appears in boreal summer according to the seasonal outcrop of the equatorial thermocline, and it can strongly interact with seasonally active tropical rain belt to amplify the SST response further. A favorable combination of timing and location that maximize the impact of WWEs on El Niños in the subsequent winter is suggested albeit its relevance to nature should severely be tested. Another experiment with initial ocean states in El Niño/La Niña years showed that the WWEs in May are efficient to amplify El Niño similar to the neutral case, but are not efficient to suppress La Niña."
"Causality Nexus between Economic Growth, Inflation and Innovation","This paper uses the panel vector error-correction model to explore the Granger-causality relationships between inflation, innovation and economic growth. This study covers 25 countries classified according to their firms’ extent of capacity for innovation between 1990 and 2014. The econometric analysis gave various images and very interesting results concerning the causality links between the variables in the short and long run, especially between the inflation and the two measures of innovation. Including two different innovation indicators offers a rich menu of possible causal patterns. We found that the innovation productivity is more responsive to the inflation in the most innovative countries. However, the innovation funding is more sensitive to the inflation in the less innovative countries. The originality of this study stems from three aspects: First, two measures of innovation are considered—innovation funding and innovation productivity. Second, the causality nature between the inflation and the innovation is not revealed yet in the literature. Third, using panel VEC model to discover the causality link between more than two variables in the short and long run and for two samples is an important contribution and a complicated method."
Coastal Wetlands Connected to Lake Ontario Have Reduced Muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) Abundance,"Low muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) abundance has been linked to suboptimal water levels, predation, and changes in vegetation composition. We surveyed 43 coastal Lake Ontario wetlands for muskrat houses during winter 2014, and compared zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression models to evaluate effects of wetland and surrounding landscape characteristics on the presence and abundance of muskrat houses. The most informative models were those indicating whether the wetland had an open connection to Lake Ontario. Connection to the lake, which exposed wetlands to the water regulation regime of the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River system, had a negative influence on muskrat house abundance. Muskrats appeared to be absent from 56% of the surveyed wetlands, and houses occurred at a mean density of 0.27 houses/ha, which was lower than the mean density observed in previous studies. Mean muskrat house density was higher in wetlands without a connection to Lake Ontario (1.04 houses/ha), and muskrats were more prevalent in these wetlands (78%). The apparent low abundance of muskrats in the Lake Ontario study area is concerning, since muskrats are commonly recognized as “ecosystem engineers”, and consequently, the loss of muskrats has the potential to affect both the biotic and the abiotic wetland characteristics."
Cryptanalysis of a lattice based key exchange protocol,"2014年, WANG等人提出了一个基于格的密钥交换协议。原方案研究中首先在小整数解问题(SIS)基础上他们提出了两个新的困难问题, 并基于新困难问题设计了格密钥交换协议。本文提出了一个可以在多项式时间内恢复共享密钥的高效攻击算法, 并通过理论分析和实验验证严格论证攻击算法的正确性与高效性。由于最小整数解问题在格密码设计中有很广泛的研究, 因此该方法的研究可以进行进一步推广。"
A triangular decomposition algorithm for differential polynomial systems with elementary computation complexity,"In this paper, a new triangular decomposition algorithm is proposed for ordinary differential polynomial systems, which has triple exponential computational complexity. The key idea is to eliminate one algebraic variable from a set of polynomials in one step using the theory of multivariate resultant. This seems to be the first differential triangular decomposition algorithm with elementary computation complexity."
Linearization of multi-valued nonlinear feedback shift registers,"Nonlinear feedback shift registers (NFSRs) have been used in many stream ciphers for cryptographic security. The linearization of NFSRs is to describe their state transitions using some matrices. Such matrices are called their state transition matrices. Compared to extensive work on binary NFSRs, much less work has been done on multi-valued NFSRs. This paper uses a semi-tensor product approach to investigate the linearization of multi-valued NFSRs, by viewing them as logical networks. A new state transition matrix is found for a multi-valued NFSR, which can be simply computed from the truth table of its feedback function. The new state transition matrix is easier to compute and is more explicit than the existing results. Some properties of the state transition matrix are provided as well, which are helpful to theoretically analyze multi-valued NFSRs."
Intraday volume percentages forecasting using a dynamic SVM-based approach,This paper proposes a dynamic model to forecast intraday volume percentages by decomposing the trade volume into two parts: The average part as the intraday volume pattern and the residual term as the abnormal changes. An empirical test on data spanning half-a-year gold futures and S&P 500 futures reveals that a rolling average of the previous days’ volume percentages shows great predictive ability for the average part. An SVM approach with the input pattern consisting of two categories is employed to forecast the residual term. One is the previous days’ volume percentages in the same time interval and the other is the most recent volume percentages. The study shows that this dynamic SVM-based forecasting approach outperforms the other commonly used statistical methods and enhances the tracking performance of a VWAP strategy greatly.
Stochastic maximum principle for optimal control problems of forward-backward delay systems involving impulse controls,"This paper is concerned with the optimal control problems of forward-backward delay systems involving impulse controls. The authors establish a stochastic maximum principle for this kind of systems. The most distinguishing features of the proposed problem are that the control variables consist of regular and impulsive controls, both with time delay, and that the domain of regular control is not necessarily convex. The authors obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal controls, which have potential applications in mathematical finance."
Graph theory methods for decomposition w.r.t. outputs of Boolean control networks,"This paper focuses graph theory method for the problem of decomposition w.r.t. outputs for Boolean control networks (BCNs). First, by resorting to the semi-tensor product of matrices and the matrix expression of BCNs, the definition of decomposition w.r.t. outputs is introduced. Second, by referring to the graphical structure of BCNs, a necessary and sufficient condition for the decomposition w.r.t. outputs is obtained based on graph theory method. Third, an effective algorithm to realize the maximum decomposition w.r.t. outputs is proposed. Finally, some examples are addressed to validate the theoretical results."
Transdermal Adhesive Patches Loaded with Ketoprofen Evaluated by Dynamic Detection of Percutaneous Absorption,"Topical delivery has many benefits toward NSAIDs administration, and the best-selling transdermal preparation in 2015 was the NSAID patch MOHRUS®. Herein, we report a ketoprofen adhesive patch (KAP) and evaluate the penetration and absorption compared to MOHRUS®. Microdialysis sampling technique was applied to determine drug penetration in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Simultaneously, blood samples were withdrawn over time to obtain the drug absorption in plasma. The ketoprofen concentrations in the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, and plasma were compared with the commercially available patch (MOHRUS®). Based on the detection, pharmacokinetic parameters including Cmax, Tmax, and AUC0–8h were determined for both the formulations. No significant differences were found in the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, and plasma in rats according to the bioequivalence assessment. The KAP demonstrated multiple therapeutic advantages including the controlled drug release and the sustained drug concentration in the skin as well as in plasma. The pharmacokinetic study coupled with microdialysis sampling provided an effective strategy to evaluate transdermal delivery."
The hydrodynamics of active systems,"This is a series of four lectures presented at the 2015 Enrico Fermi Summer School in Varenna. The aim of the lectures is to give an introduction to the hydrodynamics of active matter concentrating on low-Reynolds-number examples such as cells and molecular motors. Lecture 1 introduces the hydrodynamics of single active particles, covering the Stokes equation and the Scallop Theorem, and stressing the link between autonomous activity and the dipolar symmetry of the far flow field. In lecture 2 I discuss applications of this mathematics to the behaviour of microswimmers at surfaces and in external flows, and describe our current understanding of how swimmers stir the surrounding fluid. Lecture 3 concentrates on the collective behaviour of active particles, modelled as an active nematic. I write down the equations of motion and motivate the form of the active stress. The resulting hydrodynamic instability leads to a state termed “active turbulence” characterised by strong jets and vortices in the flow field and the continual creation and annihilation of pairs of topological defects. Lecture 4 compares simulations of active turbulence to experiments on suspensions of microtubules and molecular motors. I introduce lyotropic active nematics and discuss active anchoring at interfaces."
Preschool children blood pressure percentiles by age and height,"We aimed to construct blood pressure (BP) references for the Polish preschool children and to compare them with the United States, German and European references. BP was measured oscillometrically using a validated device in 4378 randomly selected Polish children aged 3–6 years who were free of chronic diseases and behaved quietly during BP measurement. Height and weight were also measured. Gender-specific BP percentiles were constructed for age and height simultaneously with the use of quantile regression and a polynomial regression model. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial blood pressure reference percentiles by gender, age and height are presented. The Polish preschool children’s 90th and 95th SBP and DBP percentiles were mostly lower than those in the United States, German and IDEFICS study BP references. Compared with the German oscillometric BP reference and with the United States sphygmomanometric BP reference, differences in the 95th SBP percentiles ranged by age from −5 to 0 mm Hg and from −2 to −1 mm Hg, in boys and girls, respectively, whereas the differences in the 95th percentiles of DBP ranged from −7 to −1 mm Hg and from −5 to −1 mm Hg, in boys and girls, respectively. Polish preschool children’s BP percentiles based on measurements with the use of a validated oscillometric device in a nationally representative sample are lower than those from the current United States, German and European references. When interpreting BP measurements in children, adequate referential values should be used."
Beliefs and practices of Greek doctors in relation to patients’ adherence to antihypertensive medication,"Although it has been proven that decreasing the arterial blood pressure decreases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, <25% of hypertensive patients receiving antihypertensive treatment achieve target values, which are mainly attributed to failure of the patients to comply to treatment. Ensuring patient compliance to antihypertensive treatment, to prevent the development of hypertension-associated complications, has proven to be challenging in several countries. The aim of the present study was to investigate the knowledge, perceptions and practices applied by doctors treating hypertensive patients regarding patient compliance to the prescribed treatment. We also aimed to assess the possible barriers physicians face to using reinforcement methods and currently available guidelines. A total of 202 doctors from the Serres and Drama prefectures of Greece participated in this study. The data collection comprised a quantitative method questionnaire and the data were processed using Stata 8.0 statistical software. The results demonstrated that 84.7% of the participating doctors do not use the current guidelines for compliance, whereas only 10.1% have consultations lasting >15 min when discussing the medication with their patients. In addition, the majority (84.7%) of the doctors do not practice peer mentoring and consider the most effective interventions to be providing information and discussing the medication with their patients. In conclusion, the level of patient compliance to antihypertensive medication is unsatisfactory and the main reason is considered to be the non-use of guidelines by the treating physicians. Patients may benefit from further education of health professionals in this field."
Two-Stage Separation of V(IV) and Al(III) by Crystallization and Solvent Extraction from Aluminum-Rich Sulfuric Acid Leaching Solution of Stone Coal,"To improve separation of V(IV) and Al(III) from aluminum-rich sulfuric acid leaching solution of stone coal, the two-stage separation by crystallization and solvent extraction methods have been developed. A co-extraction coefficient (k) was put forward to evaluate comprehensively co-extraction extent in different solutions. In the crystallization stage, 68.2% of aluminum can be removed from the solution. In the solvent extraction stage, vanadium was selectively extracted using di-2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid/tri-n-butyl phosphate from the crystalline mother solution, followed by H2SO4 stripped efficiently. A V2O5 product with purity of 98.39% and only 0.10% Al was obtained after oxidation, precipitation, and calcination. Compared with vanadium extraction from solution without crystallization, the counter-current extraction stage of vanadium can be decreased from 6 to 3 and co-extraction coefficient (k) decreased from 2.51 to 0.58 with two-stage separation. It is suggested that the aluminum removal by crystallization can evidently weaken the influence of aluminum co-extraction on vanadium extraction and improve the selectivity of solvent extraction for vanadium."
Radiation dose of digital radiography (DR) versus micro-dose x-ray (EOS) on patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: 2016 SOSORT- IRSSD “John Sevastic Award” Winner in Imaging Research,"Patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) frequently receive x-ray imaging at diagnosis and subsequent follow monitoring. The ionizing radiation exposure has accumulated through their development stage and the effect of radiation to this young vulnerable group of patients is uncertain. To achieve the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) concept of radiation dose in medical imaging, a slot-scanning x-ray technique by the EOS system has been adopted and the radiation dose using micro-dose protocol was compared with the standard digital radiography on patients with AIS."
"Effects of nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate and fungicide iprodione on soil fungal biomass and community: based on internal transcribed spacer region","Nitrification inhibitors that impact soil nitrifying microorganisms have been widely applied in agricultural soils to enhance the efficiency of nitrogen fertilizers. However, little is known about their combined impact with other chemical applications, such as fungicides, on soil fungi. This study specifically examined the effects of the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), alone or together with the fungicide iprodione, on fungi biomass and community in a typical farmland soil."
"Which Technique is most Effective for Learning Declarative Concepts—Provided Examples, Generated Examples, or Both?","Students in many courses are commonly expected to learn declarative concepts, which are abstract concepts denoted by key terms with short definitions that can be applied to a variety of scenarios as reported by Rawson et al. (Educational Psychology Review 27:483–504, 2015). Given that declarative concepts are common and foundational in many courses, an important question arises: What are the most effective techniques for learning declarative concepts? The current research competitively evaluated the effectiveness of various example-based learning techniques for learning declarative concepts, with respect to both long-term learning and efficiency during study. In experiment 1, students at a large, Midwestern university were asked to learn 10 declarative concepts in social psychology by studying provided examples (instances of concepts that are provided to students illustrate how the concept can be applied), generating examples (instances of concepts that the student generates on his or her own to practice applying the concept), or by receiving a combination of alternating provided examples and generated examples. Two days later, students completed final tests (an example classification test and a definition cued recall test). Experiment 2 replicated and extended findings from experiment 1. The extension group was a variation of the combination group, in which participants were simultaneously presented with a provided example while generating an example. In both experiments, long-term learning and study efficiency were greater following the study of provided examples relative to the other example-based learning techniques."

"Health, safety and environmental unit performance assessment model under uncertainty (case study: steel industry)","Performance assessment is a critical objective of management systems. As a result of the non-deterministic and qualitative nature of performance indicators, assessments are likely to be influenced by evaluators’ personal judgments. Furthermore, in developing countries, performance assessments by the Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) department are based solely on the number of accidents. A questionnaire is used to conduct the study in one of the largest steel production companies in Iran. With respect to health, safety, and environment, the results revealed that control of disease, fire hazards, and air pollution are of paramount importance, with coefficients of 0.057, 0.062, and 0.054, respectively. Furthermore, health and environment indicators were found to be the most common causes of poor performance. Finally, it was shown that HSE management systems can affect the majority of performance safety indicators in the short run, whereas health and environment indicators require longer periods of time. The objective of this study is to present an HSE-MS unit performance assessment model in steel industries. Moreover, we seek to answer the following question: what are the factors that affect HSE unit system in the steel industry? Also, for each factor, the extent of impact on the performance of the HSE management system in the organization is determined."
Life cycle assessment of waste strategies for used lubricating oil,"The study aimed to evaluate the environmental impacts of used lubricating oil (ULO) recovery in the largest oil consumer country in Africa, Egypt.

ECG signal denoising via empirical wavelet transform,"This paper presents new methods for baseline wander correction and powerline interference reduction in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using empirical wavelet transform (EWT). During data acquisition of ECG signal, various noise sources such as powerline interference, baseline wander and muscle artifacts contaminate the information bearing ECG signal. For better analysis and interpretation, the ECG signal must be free of noise. In the present work, a new approach is used to filter baseline wander and power line interference from the ECG signal. The technique utilized is the empirical wavelet transform, which is a new method used to compute the building modes of a given signal. Its performance as a filter is compared to the standard linear filters and empirical mode decomposition.The results show that EWT delivers a better performance."
Resolutions for unit groups of orders,We present a general algorithm for constructing a free resolution for unit groups of orders in semisimple rational algebras. The approach is based on computing a contractible G-complex employing the theory of minimal classes of quadratic forms and Opgenorth’s theory of dual cones. The information from the complex is then used together with Wall’s perturbation lemma to obtain the resolution.

MOGA-II uses a new smart multi-search elitism operator. It has been found that low surface roughness for micro-milled alumina ceramic is obtained with low frequencies, low pulse overlaps, and moderate intensities. On the other hand, high material removal rates are associated with high laser beam intensities. Optimized solutions are characterized by low and moderate frequencies, high intensities, and medium pulse overlaps."

An example based on the previous research work of AM machine selection is given to validate its robustness for the priori articulation of AM process selection decision support."
Na7[Ga2B13O24(OH)4]: A Luminescent Sodium Gallium Borate Containing Two Different Types of Oxoboron Framework Building Blocks,"A new crystalline luminescent sodium gallium borate, namely, Na7Ga2B13O24(OH)4 (1), has been successfully synthesized through a surfactant-thermal method, and characterized by single-crystal X-ray structural analysis, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, and UV–Vis spectroscopy. Crystal data for 1: monoclinic, C2/c, a = 9.9918(8) Å, b = 8.4550(8) Å, c = 26.596(3) Å, β = 94.279(6)o, V = 2240.6(3), Z = 4. Compound 1 displays a 3D framework and contains two different oxoboron framework building blocks, namely B3O6(OH) and B7O14(OH)2 units, linked by oxo bridges or by tetrahedral Ga3+ centres. To date, the use of surfactant media in the synthesis of metal borates is relatively unexplored. Compounds 1 emits blue luminescence. UV–Vis spectral investigation indicates that 1 is a wide-band-gap semiconductor. Our results offer a new opportunity to grow diverse crystalline metal borates using surfactant-thermal strategy."
Future emissions of marine halogenated very-short lived substances under climate change,"Halogenated Very Short-lived Substances (VSLS), such as bromoform, dibromomethane and methyl iodide, are naturally produced in the oceans and are involved in ozone depletion in the troposphere and the stratosphere. The effect of climate change on the oceanic emissions of these compounds is not well quantified. Based on present-day observed global oceanic and atmospheric concentrations, and historic and future data from three CMIP5 models, past and future sea-to-air fluxes of these VSLS are calculated. The simulations are used to infer possible effects of projected changes of physical forcing on emissions in different oceanic regimes. CMIP5 model output for 1979–2100 from the historical scenario and the RCP scenarios 2.6 and 8.5 are used as input data for the emission calculations. Of the parameters that have the main influence on the sea-to-air fluxes, the global sea surface temperatures show a steady increase during the twenty-first century, while the projected changes of sea surface wind speed is very small. The calculated emissions based on the historical CMIP5 model runs (1979–2005) increased over the 26 year period and agree well with the emissions based on ERA-Interim data. The future sea-to-air fluxes of VSLS generally increase during the twenty-first century under the assumption of constant concentration fields in the ocean and atmosphere. The multi-model mean global emissions of bromoform increase by 29.4% (9.0%) between 1986 and 2005 and 2081–2100 under RCP 8.5 (2.6) and dibromomethane and methyl iodide emissions increase by 23.3% (6.4%) and 5.5% (1.5%), respectively. Uncertainties of the future emission estimates, driven by ongoing environmental changes such as changing oceanic productivity (not considered in this study) are discussed."
Development of a novel depth-of-interaction encoding method and use of light spreading in a scintillation crystal array with single-ended readout,"We designed a depth-of-interaction (DOI) positron emission tomography detector by applying a simple light-spreading method in a single-layer crystal array with a single-ended photosensor. By configuring different reflector patterns along the depth of the crystal, we were able to alter the light distribution of the gamma interaction at each depth. To evaluate the characteristics of the new DOI detector, we simulated the optical photon transport in the crystal array by using DETECT2000. Three different arrays comprising triangular-, square-, and hexagonal-shaped crystals were modeled. The 511-keV gamma-ray interactions were generated for all depths, and flood images were acquired. We confirmed that DOI layers could be distinguished in the obtained images and that the number of DOI layers depends on the number of sides of the polygonal crystals."
In-vivo analysis of the uptake process of heavy metals through maize roots by using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy,"The uptake of heavy metals by plants has been receiving much attention for crop contamination and phytoremediation. We employed synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy for an in-vivo analysis of heavy-metal uptake through a strand of maize root. A focused X-ray beam of 2.5 × 2.5 μm2 in physical dimensions was scanned along horizontal lines of the maize root at intervals of 3 μm at the 4B X-ray micro-diffraction beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL). Time-resolved mapping of the fluorescence intensities from multiple metallic elements in the root tissues provided information about the radial distributions of heavy-metal elements and their temporal variations. The concentrated core stream of heavy-metal elements spread radially up to roughly 500 μm, corresponding to 40 % of the root diameter. The absorption characteristics of three heavy metals, Cr, Mn and Ni, and their physiological features were analyzed. The absolute concentrations and the contents of the heavy-metal elements in the tested maize roots were quantitatively evaluated by using the calibration curve obtained from reference samples with preset concentrations. The uptake quantities of the tested heavy-metal elements are noticeably different, although their molecular weights are similar. This study should be helpful for understanding plant physiology related with heavy-metal uptake."
Surface strain effects on the adsorption and the diffusion of Au atoms on MgO(001) surfaces,"The effects of surface strain on the adsorption and the diffusion properties of a Au adatom on MgO(001) surfaces are studied using first-principles electronic-structure calculations based on the density functional theory. The adsorption of Au on MgO(001) is found to become stronger with increasing surface strain. In addition, the adsorption site of Au changes from a site on top of a surface O atom of MgO(001) to a site near a surface O atom for tensile surface strains over +4 %. In the case of a tensile surface strain of +7 %, the adsorption energy changes from −0.87 eV for unstrained MgO(001) to −1.17 eV. The variation in the charge states of Au on MgO(001) with surface strain, based on a Bader charge analysis, is also presented. The Bader charges of Au are found to become more negative as the surface strain increases. For a tensile surface strain of +7 %, the Bader charge is −0.38 |e|, more negative than the value of −0.29 |e| for unstrained MgO(001). Contrary to the adsorption energies and the charge states of Au, the variation in the surface diffusion barriers of Au on MgO(001) is found to be very small, less than 0.03 eV."
Half-chain entanglement entropy in the one-dimensional spinless fermion model,"We calculate the half-chain entanglement entropy of the ground state in the one-dimensional spinless fermion model. Considering a tiny corner of the Hilbert space represented by matrix product states, we efficiently find the ground state by using infinite time-evolving block decimation. The Schmidt coefficients are used to determine the half-chain entanglement entropy. Using the bond dimension scaling of the half-chain entanglement entropy, we find the critical region, which is consistent with the previous results."
"Effects of Ti content on the structural and the magnetic properties of ZnCrO:Ti (Cr: 1 at.%, Ti: 0 - 0.8 at.%) thin films","We investigated the effects of the Ti content on the structural and the magnetic properties of ZnCrO:Ti thin films (Cr: 1.0 at.%, Ti: 0 - 0.8 at.%). The samples were prepared by co-sputtering of ZnCrO and Ti and showed the Ti solution limit to be ~0.3 at.%. When the Ti additives were doped with an appropriate concentration less than the solution limit, the magnetic properties of the films were improved due to the increased magnetic moments from Ti2+ ions (i.e., 3d24s0). For the samples doped with large amounts of Ti dopants over the solution limit, however, the magnetization was gradually degraded due to the formation of metastable TiO2 and ZnCrTiO having no spins (i.e., 3d04s0)."
Deviations from stoichiometry and molecularity in non-stoichiometric Ag-In-Se thin films: Effects on the optical and the electrical properties,"Non-stoichiometric Ag-In-Se (AIS) thin films were prepared using co-sputtering with InSe2 and Ag targets followed by rapid thermal annealing. The internal stress of the non-stoichiometric AIS thin films was strongly affected by the deviation from molecularity, Δm. When Δm was far from stoichiometry, the non-stoichiometric AIS thin films showed better crystallinity. The improvement in the crystallinity and the release of internal stress led to a reduction in the optical band gap from 1.63 to 1.19 eV and in the resistivity from 6.45 × 10−2 to 3.21 × 10−3 Ω·cm for the non-stoichiometric AIS thin films, with a similar tendency for the deviation from molecularity, Δm. The non-stoichiometric AIS thin films, with Δm < 0 and Δs < 0, exhibited n-type conductivity with carrier concentrations on the order of magnitude of 1018 cm−3. The mean absorbance of the 200-nm-thick non-stoichiometric AIS thin films was 1.50, corresponding to an absorption of approximately 96.84 % of the incident light in the visible region."
Ten-year patient-reported outcomes following total and minimally invasive unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: a propensity score-matched cohort analysis,"For patients with medial compartment arthritis who have failed non-operative treatment, either a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) can be undertaken. This analysis considers how the choice between UKA and TKA affects long-term patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)."

"Attraction of Coffee Bean Weevil, Araecerus fasciculatus, to Volatiles from the Industrial Yeast Kluyveromyces lactis","The coffee bean weevil (CBW), Araecerus fasciculatus (De Geer, 1775) (Coleoptera: Anthribidae) is an important pest of stored products such as grains, coffee beans, cassava, and traditional Chinese medicine materials. In China, CBW causes large losses of Daqu, a traditional Chinese liquor fermentation starter, and, unfortunately, the use of conventional insecticides against CBW is not suitable in Daqu storage. We found CBW to be highly attracted to fermenting yeast cultures, such as Kluyveromyces lactis. Eight volatile compounds, produced by fermenting cultures and not by sterile samples, were identified by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Five of these substances elicited significant responses in Y-tube behavioral bioassays. Field trapping experiments revealed 2-phenylethanol and 2-phenylethyl acetate to be crucial for attraction of CBW. Results show that yeast volatiles play an important role in host location, and that 2-phenylethanol and 2-phenylethyl acetate could be utilized as potential attractants in monitoring and control systems against this important pest."
Determining and Comparing Multivariate Distributions: An Application to AORD and GSPC with their related financial markets,"Many real world applications are associated with more than one variable and hence, identifying multivariate distributions associated with real world problems portrays great importance today. Many studies can be found in the literature in this aspect and most of them are associated with two variables/dimensions and the maximum dimension of multivariate distribution found in the literature is four. Different optimization techniques have been used by researchers to find multivariate distributions in their studies. Numerical methods can be identified as more preferable than analytical methods when the dimension of the problem is high. The main objective of this study is to identify the multivariate distribution associated with the return series of Australian all ordinary index (AORD) and those of the related financial markets and compare it with the multivariate distribution of return series of the US GSPC index and its related financial markets. No research were found in the literature which were aimed at finding aforesaid multivariate distribution and comparisons. Moreover no evidence found for identifying a multivariate distribution with six dimensions. Five financial markets: Amex oil index, Amex gold index, world cocoa index, exchange rate of Australian dollar to United States dollar and US GSPC index were found to be associated with AORD. Hence the attempt was to derive the multivariate distribution of return series of AORD and these five return series and therefore the optimization problem of the study is a six dimension problem which associated with forty three parameters need to be estimated. A local optimization technique and a global optimization technique were used to estimate the parameters of the multivariate distribution. Results exhibit that the parameter estimates obtained from the global optimization technique are better than the parameter estimates obtained from the local optimization technique. The multivariate distribution of return series of AORD and related financial markets is central, less peaked and have fat tails. A comparison was done with another multivariate distribution of a return series of a leading stock market index: GSPC and return series of its associated financial markets and found that both distributions are alike in shape. Two periods were identified in the AORD series and found that the shape of the multivariate distribution of one period is similar to the shape of the multivariate distribution of full data set while the shape of the multivariate distribution of the other period is dissimilar to that of full data set."
Poverty and the business cycle: A regional panel data analysis for Spain using alternative measures of unemployment,"Conventional wisdom predicts that changes in the aggregate unemployment rate may significantly affect a country’s income distribution and, consequently, have a relevant impact on the evolution of its poverty rate. However, the relationship between labour macroeconomic indicators and poverty seems to have become weaker recently. Using panel data on unemployment and poverty for Spanish regions, we estimate a system GMM model to model this relationship using alternative measures of the unemployment rate. We also test the hypothesis of asymmetric effects of the business cycle on the share of poor individuals in the population. Our results show that unemployment has a positive impact on severe poverty, while inflation has a negative effect. We also highlight the extent to which results differ when alternative intra-household unemployment distribution-sensitive measures are considered. Regarding the existence of asymmetric business cycle effects on severe poverty, our results show that despite the fact that the Great Recession has had a strong and positive effect on severe poverty, the effects of expansions and recessions on poverty are not significantly different."
Preschool children blood pressure percentiles by age and height,"We aimed to construct blood pressure (BP) references for the Polish preschool children and to compare them with the United States, German and European references. BP was measured oscillometrically using a validated device in 4378 randomly selected Polish children aged 3–6 years who were free of chronic diseases and behaved quietly during BP measurement. Height and weight were also measured. Gender-specific BP percentiles were constructed for age and height simultaneously with the use of quantile regression and a polynomial regression model. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial blood pressure reference percentiles by gender, age and height are presented. The Polish preschool children’s 90th and 95th SBP and DBP percentiles were mostly lower than those in the United States, German and IDEFICS study BP references. Compared with the German oscillometric BP reference and with the United States sphygmomanometric BP reference, differences in the 95th SBP percentiles ranged by age from −5 to 0 mm Hg and from −2 to −1 mm Hg, in boys and girls, respectively, whereas the differences in the 95th percentiles of DBP ranged from −7 to −1 mm Hg and from −5 to −1 mm Hg, in boys and girls, respectively. Polish preschool children’s BP percentiles based on measurements with the use of a validated oscillometric device in a nationally representative sample are lower than those from the current United States, German and European references. When interpreting BP measurements in children, adequate referential values should be used."
Beliefs and practices of Greek doctors in relation to patients’ adherence to antihypertensive medication,"Although it has been proven that decreasing the arterial blood pressure decreases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, <25% of hypertensive patients receiving antihypertensive treatment achieve target values, which are mainly attributed to failure of the patients to comply to treatment. Ensuring patient compliance to antihypertensive treatment, to prevent the development of hypertension-associated complications, has proven to be challenging in several countries. The aim of the present study was to investigate the knowledge, perceptions and practices applied by doctors treating hypertensive patients regarding patient compliance to the prescribed treatment. We also aimed to assess the possible barriers physicians face to using reinforcement methods and currently available guidelines. A total of 202 doctors from the Serres and Drama prefectures of Greece participated in this study. The data collection comprised a quantitative method questionnaire and the data were processed using Stata 8.0 statistical software. The results demonstrated that 84.7% of the participating doctors do not use the current guidelines for compliance, whereas only 10.1% have consultations lasting >15 min when discussing the medication with their patients. In addition, the majority (84.7%) of the doctors do not practice peer mentoring and consider the most effective interventions to be providing information and discussing the medication with their patients. In conclusion, the level of patient compliance to antihypertensive medication is unsatisfactory and the main reason is considered to be the non-use of guidelines by the treating physicians. Patients may benefit from further education of health professionals in this field."
Effect of diabetes and metabolic syndrome on myocardial mechano-energetic efficiency in hypertensive patients. The Campania Salute Network,"Reduced myocardial mechano-energetic efficiency (MEE), estimated as stroke volume/heart rate ratio per g of left ventricular (LV) mass (LVM), and expressed in μl s−1 g−1 (MEEi), is a strong predictor of cardiovascular (CV) events, independently of LV hypertrophy and other confounders, including type II diabetes (DM). Decreased MEEi is more frequent in patients with diabetes. In the present analysis we evaluated the interrelation among MEEi, DM and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the setting of arterial hypertension. Hypertensive patients from the Campania Salute Network, free of prevalent CV disease and with ejection fraction >50% (n=12 503), were analysed. Coexistence of MetS and DM was ordinally categorized into 4 groups: 8235 patients with neither MetS nor DM (MetS−/DM−); 502 without MetS and with DM (MetS−/DM+); 3045 with MetS and without DM (MetS+/DM−); and 721 with MetS and DM (MetS+/DM+). After controlling for sex, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, relative wall thickness (RWT), antihypertensive medications and type of antidiabetic therapy, MEEi was 333 μl s−1 g−1 in MetS−/DM−, 328 in MetS−/DM+, 326 in MetS+/DM− and 319 in MetS+/DM+ (P for trend <0.0001). In pairwise comparisons (Sidak-adjusted), all conditions, except MetS−/DM+, were significantly different from MetS−/DM− (all P<0.02). No statistical difference was detected between MetS−/DM+ and MetS+/DM−. Both MetS and DM are associated with decreased MEEi in hypertensive patients, independently to each other, but the reduction is statistically less evident for MetS−/DM+. MetS+/DM+ patients have the lowest levels of MEEi, consistent with the alterations of energy supply associated with the combination of insulin resistance with insulin deficiency."
Transdermal Adhesive Patches Loaded with Ketoprofen Evaluated by Dynamic Detection of Percutaneous Absorption,"Topical delivery has many benefits toward NSAIDs administration, and the best-selling transdermal preparation in 2015 was the NSAID patch MOHRUS®. Herein, we report a ketoprofen adhesive patch (KAP) and evaluate the penetration and absorption compared to MOHRUS®. Microdialysis sampling technique was applied to determine drug penetration in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Simultaneously, blood samples were withdrawn over time to obtain the drug absorption in plasma. The ketoprofen concentrations in the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, and plasma were compared with the commercially available patch (MOHRUS®). Based on the detection, pharmacokinetic parameters including Cmax, Tmax, and AUC0–8h were determined for both the formulations. No significant differences were found in the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, and plasma in rats according to the bioequivalence assessment. The KAP demonstrated multiple therapeutic advantages including the controlled drug release and the sustained drug concentration in the skin as well as in plasma. The pharmacokinetic study coupled with microdialysis sampling provided an effective strategy to evaluate transdermal delivery."
Autophagy-related IRGM genes confer susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis in a Chinese female population: a case–control study,"It is known that ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) shared a common genetic component. The gist of current study is to assess the role of IBD-associated autophagy gene IRGM on AS susceptibility in a Chinese Han population. A total of 1270 unrelated subjects (643 AS and 627 controls) were enrolled. Two tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10065172 and rs4958846) were selected and were genotyped by iMLDR Assay technology. Genotypes and haplotype analysis were conducted by using SPSS 16.0 and haploview 4.2 software. Among two tag SNPs of IRGM, no correlation was observed between rs10065172 and AS susceptibility. For rs4958846, genotype and allelic frequencies were marginally discrepant between female cases and controls before, not after, Bonferroni correction (P=0.049; P=0.031). Logistic regression analysis revealed that carriers with CT+TT or CT genotype had a significantly decreased risk for developing AS among female subjects when compared with CC genotype (OR=0.514, 95% CI=0.301–0.876, P=0.014; OR=0.518, 95% CI=0.297–0.902, P=0.020, respectively). Additionally, a risk haplotype rs4958846C–rs10065172C (OR=2.093, 95% CI=1.301–3.368) and a protective haplotype rs4958846T–rs10065172C (OR=0.652, 95% CI=0.441–0.964) were also identified to be associated with female AS. IBD-associated IRGM gene is also associated with AS susceptibility in the Chinese female population, indicating that autophagy pathway may involve in AS genetic predisposition."
"Structural and decay properties of Z = 132, 138 superheavy nuclei","In this paper, we analyze the structural properties of Z = 132 and Z = 138 superheavy nuclei within the ambit of axially deformed relativistic mean-field framework with NL3 *  parametrization and calculate the total binding energies, radii, quadrupole deformation parameter, separation energies, density distributions. We also investigate the phenomenon of shape coexistence by performing the calculations for prolate, oblate and spherical configurations. For clear presentation of nucleon distributions, the two-dimensional contour representation of individual nucleon density and total matter density has been made. Further, a competition between possible decay modes such as \(\alpha\)-decay, \(\beta\)-decay and spontaneous fission of the isotopic chain of superheavy nuclei with Z = 132 within the range \( 312 \le A \le 392\) and \(318 \le A \le 398\) for Z = 138 is systematically analyzed within self-consistent relativistic mean-field model. From our analysis, we inferred that the \(\alpha\)-decay and spontaneous fission are the principal modes of decay in majority of the isotopes of superheavy nuclei under investigation apart from \(\beta\)-decay as dominant mode of decay in 318-322138 isotopes."
Understanding Customer Experience Diffusion on Social Networking Services by Big Data Analytics,"Social networking services (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) are playing a significant role of interacting with customers. In particular, most of businesses are trying to exploit such social networking services for more profit, since it has dramatically become an information carrier for customers who are disseminating latest information about products and services. Thus, this study examines how information shared by companies is distributed and what the important factors in understanding information dissemination are. More importantly, this study classifies the types of tweets posted by a company and then to investigate the effect of these types of tweets on diffusion. By using content analysis, this study defined three types, which are i) information provision (IF), ii) advertisement (AD), and iii) both (IFAD), with 8 specific concepts. These results indicate that the differences are significant for all three types of information content. It shows that companies can spread information more quickly by providing the IFAD type rather than the AD type."
Windowed and distortion-compensated vector modulation for blind audio watermarking in DWT domain,"A windowed vector modulation (WVM) scheme incorporable with distortion compensation is proposed to enhance the imperceptibility and robustness of blind audio watermarking in the norm space of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) domain. The merits of WVM are demonstrated through performance comparison among three DWT-based watermarking methods that adaptively modulate the vectors collected from the approximation subband after 2-level DWT decomposition of audio signals. The incorporation of window weighting into modulation formulation can smooth the transitions across adjacent vectors, while the employment of distortion compensation allows the WVM to be executable using larger quantization steps without introducing additional distortion. Experiment results confirm that the perceptual quality is noticeably improved through the windowing process, and the bit error rates of retrieved watermarks are manifestly reduced after integrating WVM with distortion compensation."
Anomaly detection using sparse reconstruction in crowded scenes,"In this paper, we propose an algorithm of anomaly detection in crowded scenes by using sparse representation over the normal bases. First, the histogram of maximal optical flow projection (HMOFP) features are extracted from a set of normal training data. Then, the online dictionary learning algorithm is used to train an optimal dictionary with proper redundancy, which is better than the dictionary simply composed by the HMOFP features of the whole training data. In order to detect the normalness of a frame, the l
1-norm of the sparse reconstruction coefficients is used as the Reconstruction Coefficient Sparsity (RCS). Our algorithm is effective for both global abnormal events (GAE) and local abnormal events (LAE). We evaluate our method on three benchmark datasets-the UMN dataset, the PETS2009 dataset and the UCSD Ped1 dataset. Compared with the most popular methods, experimental results show that our algorithm achieves good results especially for the pixel-level local abnormal event localization."
"Half-sandwich ruthenium, rhodium and iridium complexes of triazolopyridine ligand: Synthesis and structural studies","Triazolopyridine ligand, {3-(2-pyridyl)-[1,2,3]triazolo[1,5-a]-pyridine}, L was synthesized by reaction of p-toulenesulphonyl hydrazine and dipyridyl ketone in the presence of acetic acid. Half-sandwich ruthenium, rhodium and iridium complexes [1–4] have been synthesized by reaction of [{(arene)MCl 2} 2] (arene  = p-cymene/benzene/Cp* and M = Ru/Rh/Ir) with ligand L in methanol. The reaction in 1:2 (M:L) ratio has yielded all mononuclear cationic complexes such as [(arene)ML\(\kappa ^{2}_{\mathrm {N\cap N}}\)Cl]PF 6, where {(arene)M} = (p-cym)Ru (1), (benz)Ru (2), Cp*Rh (3) and Cp*Ir (4). All the complexes were characterized by spectral studies and the solid state structures of complexes, 1 and 3 were unambiguously determined by crystallographic studies."
Traffic-aware congestion control (TACC) for wireless multimedia sensor networks,"Wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) have emerged as a revolutionary technology, that has shifted the focus of low power wireless sensor networks (WSNs). These networks are aimed at gathering and delivering both scalar and multimedia data from the environment. WMSNs inherit the miniature size, low power, low processing and short range wireless communication traits from WSNs. Addition of multimedia content in WMSNs demands fulfillment of various QoS parameters like low end-to-end delay, acceptable jitter rate, low packet loss rate and higher throughput. Over the past few years, considerable research efforts have been directed towards the fulfillment of these QoS requirements; by proposing new traffic-aware medium access and routing algorithms. However, the issues of rate adaptation and congestion control are still largely unexplored. Congestion in wireless networks is a major cause of packet loss resulting in degraded network performance. In WMSNs congestion is a common occurrence, due to the communication of high data rate, bursty video traffic over lossy wireless link. Therefore, it is critical to adjust the sending rate of source nodes based on network conditions. This work investigates the issue of rate adaptation and congestion control in WMSNs. A traffic-aware congestion control protocol (TACC) is proposed that operates on end-to-end principle at the transport layer. The proposed protocol uses burst loss information to detect congestion at the destination and directs source nodes to adjust reporting rate accordingly. The proposed protocol is evaluated using simulation analysis which shows significant improvement in terms of packet losses, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio and received picture quality."
Videolization: knowledge graph based automated video generation from web content,"Web content nowadays can also be accessed through new generation of Internet connected TVs. However, these products failed to change users’ behavior when consuming online content. Users still prefer personal computers to access Web content. Certainly, most of the online content is still designed to be accessed by personal computers or mobile devices. In order to overcome the usability problem of Web content consumption on TVs, this paper presents a knowledge graph based video generation system that automatically converts textual Web content into videos using semantic Web and computer graphics based technologies. As a use case, Wikipedia articles are automatically converted into videos. The effectiveness of the proposed system is validated empirically via opinion surveys. Fifty percent of survey users indicated that they found generated videos enjoyable and 42 % of them indicated that they would like to use our system to consume Web content on their TVs."
Modeling the synchrony between interacting people: application to role recognition,"The study of social interactions has attracted increasing attentions. The role recognition is one of its possible applications and the core of this study. This article proposes some approaches to automatically recognize the role of the participants of a meeting by modeling the synchrony of temporal nonverbal audio features. In our approache the Influence Model (IM), a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-like, is used to model this synchrony and to extract from input data a feature vector that contains both information about temporal transitions (intra-personal data) and interaction between participants (inter-personal data). This modeling of the meeting is used as input of a Random Forests (RFs) for the role recognition task. The experiments are performed on 138 meetings (approximately 45 hours of recordings) from Augmented Multiparty Interaction (AMI) Corpus. Accuracy scores show that this combination of generative (IM) and discriminative (RFs) approaches permits to outperform state-of-the-art role recognition rates."
CSFV proliferation is associated with GBF1 and Rab2,"The Golgi apparatus and its resident proteins are utilized and regulated by viruses to facilitate their proliferation. In this study, we investigated Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) proliferation when the function of the Golgi was disturbed. Golgi function was disturbed using chemical inhibitors, namely, brefeldin A (BFA) and golgicide A (GCA), and RNA interfering targets, such as the Golgi-specific BFA-resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) and Rab2 GTPases. CSFV proliferation was significantly inhibited during RNA replication and viral particle generation after BFA and GCA treatment. CSFV multiplication dynamics were retarded in cells transfected with GBF1 and Rab2 shRNA. Furthermore, CSFV proliferation was promoted by GBF1 and Rab2 overexpression using a lentiviral system. Hence, Golgi function is important for CSFV multiplication, and GBF1 and Rab2 participate in CSFV proliferation. Further studies must investigate Golgi-resident proteins to elucidate the mechanism underlying CSFV replication."
Novel features and a cascaded classifier based Arabic numerals recognition system,"Individuality of handwriting inserts varying curvatures and angles whenever someone writes a sample of a particular numeral which makes the task of its off-line recognition more challenging. The paper addresses both these issues in novel and robust ways by merging two Digital domains, namely Digital Communications and Digital Image Processing. Curvature is treated by finding analytical features based on distance and slope. Distance based treatment is done by means of Delta Distance Coding whereas slope based analysis is executed with Delta Slope Coding. Angular variations have been countered with the help of rotation invariant physical feature i.e., Pixel Moment of Inertia. A due stress has been laid on Pixel Moment of Inertia by finding it both globally and locally in terms of Centroidal Moment of Inertia and Zonal Moment of Inertia respectively. The above mentioned features are further supported with statistical features in order to differentiate very similar looking numeral pairs like (3, 8), (1, 7), (7, 9). Feature extraction methods are devoid of cumbersome calculations, and classifiers are capable of yielding instantaneous results. Therefore, the current system is a real time system. The system has been tested on unconstrained MNIST dataset. The overall recognition accuracy of 99.26% has been obtained."
Fuzzy multi-objective stochastic programming model for disaster relief logistics considering telecommunication infrastructures: a case study,"In humanitarian relief logistics, providing a safe place for evacuees, supplying relief commodities and designing a proper telecommunication infrastructure, for fast communications during disaster, are important issues. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a fuzzy scenario-based optimization model concerning location of shelters, relief distribution centers and telecommunication towers. Towards effective management and reliable servicing, telecommunication towers and shelters are considered to constitute integrated facilities (shelter-TTs). Moreover, to enhance efficiency of emergency services during disaster, backup relief distribution centers, and to approach the model to the real world, failure probabilities in the routes and the relief distribution centers are considered. The problem is formulated in a nonlinear and multi-objective model. Nonlinearity is treated by applying heuristic arguments in conjunction with Lp-metrics method. Finally, the developed model for the case study of flood disaster in an urban district in Iran is implemented. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can help make decisions on both the preparation and response phases in humanitarian relief logistics."

Determination of serum aflatoxin B1-lysine to evaluate the efficacy of an aflatoxin-adsorbing feed additive in pigs fed an aflatoxin B1-contaminated diet,"In this study, serum aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-lysine was determined in order to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of a hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS) in pigs fed AFB1. Twenty-four 49-day-old crossbred barrows were maintained in individual cages and allowed ad libitum access to feed and water. A completely randomized design was used with six animals assigned to each of four dietary treatments for 21 days as follows: (A) basal diet (BD), (B) BD supplemented with 0.5 % HSCAS, (C) BD supplemented with 1.1 mg/kg AFB1, and (D) BD supplemented with 0.5 % HSCAS and 1.1 mg/kg AFB1. HSCAS was able to alleviate the toxic effects of AFB1 on pigs and reduce (P < 0.05) the levels of serum AFB1-lysine. Cumulative reductions of adduct yield values, calculated through the equation [(pg AFB1-lysine/mg albumin) / (μg AFB1/kg body weight)], were 53.0, 62.8, and 72.1 after 7, 14, and 21 days of oral exposure, respectively. AFB1-lysine has potential as an AFB1-specific biomarker for diagnostic purposes and for evaluating the efficacy of chemoprotective interventions in pigs."
Molecular Chains Interacting by Lennard-Jones and Coulomb Forces,We study equations for the mechanical movement of chains of identical particles in the plane interacting with their nearest-neighbors by bond stretching and by van der Waals and Coulomb forces. We find collinear and circular equilibria as minimizers of the energy potential for chains with Neumann and periodic boundary conditions. We prove global bifurcation of periodic brake orbits from these equilibria applying the global Rabinowitz alternative. These results are complemented with numeric computations for ranges of parameters that include carbon atoms among other molecules.
Assessment of genetic diversity among four orchids based on ddRAD sequencing data for conservation purposes,"Genetic diversity was assessed in the four orchid species using NGS based ddRAD sequencing data. The assembled nucleotide sequences (fastq) were deposited in the SRA archive of NCBI Database with accession number (SRP063543 for Dendrobium, SRP065790 for Geodorum, SRP072201 for Cymbidium and SRP072378 for Rhynchostylis). Total base pair read was 1.1 Mbp in case of Dendrobium sp., 553.3 Kbp for Geodorum sp., 1.6 Gbp for Cymbidium, and 1.4 Gbp for Rhynchostylis. Average GC% was 43.9 in Geodorum, 43.7% in Dendrobium, 41.2% in Cymbidium and 42.3% in Rhynchostylis. Four partial gene sequences were used in DnaSP5 program for nucleotide diversity and phylogenetic relationship determination (Ycf2 gene of Dendrobium, matK gene of Geodorum, psbD gene of Cymbidium and Ycf2 gene of Ryhnchostylis). Nucleotide diversity (per site) Pi (π) was 0.10560 in Dendrobium, 0.03586 in Geodorum, 0.01364 in Cymbidium and 0.011344 in Rhynchostylis. Neutrality test statistics showed the negative value in all the four orchid species (Tajima’s D value −2.17959 in Dendrobium, −2.01655 in Geodorum, −2.12362 in Rhynchostylis and −1.54222 in Cymbidium) indicating the purifying selection. Result for these gene sequences (matK and Ycf2 and psbD) indicate that they were not evolved neutrally, but signifying that selection might have played a role in evolution of these genes in these four groups of orchids. Phylogenetic relationship was analyzed by reconstructing dendrogram based on the matK, psbD and Ycf2 gene sequences using maximum likelihood method in MEGA6 program."
Crystallization and Gelation Behavior of Low- and High Melting Waxes in Rice Bran Oil: a Case-Study on Berry Wax and Sunflower Wax,"Low-melting berry wax (BEW) has proven to be a good oil gelator with a positive contribution to the consistency and flexibility of the structured oil. Nevertheless, the properties of BEW and the corresponding oleogel have not yet been investigated in-depth. In this research, the difference in crystallization and gelling behavior between sunflower wax (SW), a high melting wax, and BEW, a low-melting wax, in rice bran oil (RBO) was investigated. The difference in melting and crystallization temperatures can be explained by the different chemical composition (long-chain wax esters in SW and short-chain fatty acids in BEW). The heterogeneity in crystal habits (unidirectional platelets versus microcrystalline particles) and polymorphism (orthorhombic versus hexagonal) are responsible for the varying gel strength and hardness of the respective SW- and BEW-oleogels. The microcrystalline BEW particles aligned and reorganized during 1-month storage at 5 °C, which leaded to an increase in the gel strength and hardness of BEW-oleogel. The gelling property of SW-oleogel however did not significantly differ after 4 weeks at 5 °C, despite of the appearance of spherulitic crystalline clusters. The changes in the physical properties of wax-based oleogels during storage time were further explored using differential scanning calorimetry, polarized light microscope, powder X-ray diffraction and rheology."
Gene-based analyses reveal novel genetic overlap and allelic heterogeneity across five major psychiatric disorders,"Studies using genome-wide association (GWA) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level data have indicated genetic overlap across the five major disorders in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC): attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BPD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). However, such SNP-level analyses reveal little about the underlying biology and are reliant on correlated SNP effects across disorders. In contrast to SNPs, genes are more closely related to biology and gene-based tests can incorporate allelic heterogeneity. This study aimed to extend genetic overlap analysis across the five disorders from SNP level to gene level using a novel gene-based approach. Gene-based tests for association were performed using PGC GWA summary results for the five disorders in samples including 33,332 cases and 27,888 controls of European ancestry. After accounting for non-independence of gene-based test results, we determined whether the proportion of genes with association across multiple disorders was more than expected by chance. Similar to previous SNP-level analyses, we observed significant pairwise genetic overlap between ASD, BPD, MDD and SCZ. However, our approach also produced evidence for genetic overlap between ADHD and ASD, ADHD and BPD, and ADHD and MDD. Combining gene-based association results across disorders, 36 genes produced genome-wide significant P values (<3.2 × 10−6). Pathway analysis of genes with P values <1.0 × 10−3 highlighted magnesium ion binding and transport, as well as signal peptide processing, and provide insight into the biological mechanisms underlying these major psychiatric disorders."

Speckle Reduction with Trained Nonlinear Diffusion Filtering,"Speckle reduction is a prerequisite for many image processing tasks in synthetic aperture radar images, as well as all coherent images. In recent years, predominant state-of-the-art approaches for despeckling are usually based on nonlocal methods which mainly concentrate on achieving utmost image restoration quality, with relatively low computational efficiency. Therefore, in this study we aim to propose an efficient despeckling model with both high computational efficiency and high recovery quality. To this end, we exploit a newly developed trainable nonlinear reaction diffusion (TNRD) framework which has proven a simple and effective model for various image restoration problems. In the original TNRD applications, the diffusion network is usually derived based on the direct gradient descent scheme. However, this approach will encounter some problem for the task of multiplicative noise reduction exploited in this study. To solve this problem, we employed a new architecture derived from the proximal gradient descent method. Taking into account the speckle noise statistics, the diffusion process for the despeckling task is derived. We then retrain all the model parameters in the presence of speckle noise. Finally, optimized nonlinear diffusion filtering models are obtained, which are specialized for despeckling with various noise levels. Experimental results substantiate that the trained filtering models provide comparable or even better results than state-of-the-art nonlocal approaches. Meanwhile, our proposed model merely contains convolution of linear filters with an image, which offers high-level parallelism on GPUs. As a consequence, for images of size \(512 \times 512\), our GPU implementation takes less than 0.1 s to produce state-of-the-art despeckling performance."
Physical and mechanical properties of a novel hydrogen transport membrane,"A novel cermet (ceramic/metal composite) hydrogen transport membrane (HTM) was characterized for its physical and mechanical properties at both room temperature and at elevated temperature of 850 °C. The density of the HTM cermet was measured as 8.9 g/cm3 at ambient temperature with dynamic Young’s modulus of 145.5 GPa and the dynamic shear modulus (G-value) of 54.29 GPa, whereas the Poisson’s ratio (υ) is calculated to be 0.34. Vickers hardness numbers for the as-received HTM cermet are constant and in the range of 2.0–2.2 GPa, with the change of loading force from 100 to 1000 g. The flexural strength (σ
fs) of the HTM cermet is about 356 MPa at room temperature and decreases to 284 MPa at the elevated temperature of 850 °C in both air and nitrogen. A difference in testing atmosphere (air or N2) had insignificant effect on the load–displacement curves during the flexural strength test at the elevated temperature of 850 °C. From the load–displacement curves, HTM cermet behaves much more like elastic material at room temperature; with the temperature increased to 850 °C, its behaviour is much more like a metallic material with fractures preceded by plastic deformation. The initial yielding strength of HTM could be mainly controlled by the yield strength of the soft Pd metal material, and the zirconia fractures before yielding in Pd at room temperature, whereas at 850 °C, the yield stress of the Pd drops dramatically and allows it to work and harden in the constraint of a rigid ceramic. The final failure load is mainly dictated by ceramic fracture, while the initial yielding stress is determined on the yield strength of the soft Pd metal at both room temperature and the elevated temperature of 850 °C."
"Facile preparation of superamphiphobic phosphate–Cu coating on iron substrate with mechanical stability, anti-frosting properties, and corrosion resistance","We present a facile, low-cost, and fast method for preparing superamphiphobic surface with water contact angle and rapeseed oil contact angle of 160° and 153° on steel substrate. The fabrication process is composed of the phosphate, Cu co-deposition in phosphating bath and the low surface energy materials modification by 1H,1H,2H,2H-peruorodecyltriisopropoxysilane (FAS-17). Contact angle measurement, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical workstation were carried out to investigate the surface wettability, chemical composition, morphology, and anti-corrosion performance. Results show that the optimal CuSO4·5H2O concentration for the surface to achieve superamphiphobicity is 6 g L−1, and the prepared surface exhibits excellent mechanical abrasion resistance on 600 grit SiC sand paper. Moreover, the dynamic frosting–defrosting experiments indicated that the surface has a good anti-frosting ability. The potentiodynamic polarization proves that the superhydrophobic surface can protect the steel substrate from corrosion solution. Meanwhile the surface also shows a good chemical stability under different pH values and excellent self-cleaning ability in both muddy water and lubricating oil."
Postoperative Outcomes of Laparoscopic Bariatric Surgery in Older Obese Patients: a Matched Case-Control Study,Laparoscopic bariatric surgery (LBS) in older obese patients remains debated regarding postoperative outcomes.
"Remarkable change of structural, optical, photoluminescence and electrical properties of chemically prepared nanocrystalline films of PbS with concentration of triethanolamine (TEA)","Although triethanolamine (TEA) is widely used as complexing agent in the preparation of nanocrystalline PbS thin film by chemical bath deposition method, not enough studies have been reported on how its concentration affects various properties of the films. In the present work, we studied the effect of concentration of TEA on structural, morphological, optical, photoluminescence and electrical conduction properties of the films. We observed that with the increase of molar concentration of TEA—the crystallinity deteriorates with reduced crystallite size and increased strain and dislocation density; the densities of the films have been reduced; the films become non stoichiometric; optically these become more transparent but less reflecting showing prominent blue shift in the optical band gap which increased with the concentration of TEA; the width of the localized states in the band gap has been increased. The refractive index and extinction coefficient of the films are observed to be wavelength dispersive. The refractive index decreases with the increase of TEA complexation. In the NIR region, the extinction coefficient also decreases as concentration of TEA increases. The real and imaginary parts of dielectric constant replicates the refractive index and extinction coefficient curves respectively against wavelength. The PL spectra reveal conduction band to valence band transition with reduced intensity at higher molarity of TEA. The current–voltage measurement shows that the conductivity decreases considerably with the increase of TEA concentration. Our measurement estimated the crystallite size in the range of 29–37.49 nm, strain ~10−3, dislocation density ~1011 cm−2, band gap 0.8–1.55 eV, bandtail width 0.27–0.57 eV, the refractive index 2.3–5.8 and conductivity 0.0011–0.20 (Ωcm)−1."
"Growth, characterization and quantum chemical studies of an organic single crystal: 3-Aminopyridine 4-Nitrophenol for opto-electronic applications","A recently identified new organic nonlinear optical (NLO) material, 3-Aminopyridine 4-Nitrophenol (3AP4NP) was synthesized and good quality single crystals were grown by slow evaporation solution growth technique. Microanalysis, powder XRD and FT-IR spectral studies were performed on 3AP4NP to ascertain its composition, phase and various characteristic functional groups respectively. The NLO efficiency was measured to be about 2.7 times greater than that of standard KDP. The UV-Vis-NIR and fluorescence spectral data of the crystal were recorded to explore its optical transmission and emission properties respectively. The dielectric properties were evaluated as a function of frequency at various temperatures. The photoconducting nature was analyzed and confirmed to be positive. The hardness test performed at room temperature revealed the moderate hardness of the material. Quantum chemical calculations were performed for the title molecule by DFT using B3LYP/6-311 + + G(d,p) basis set to analyze first hyperpolarizability, HOMO–LUMO energies and molecular electrostatic potential. The atomic charge distributions of various atoms present in the molecule were obtained by Mulliken charge analysis. Stability of the compound arising from hyper-conjugative interactions, intra-molecule rehybridization and charge delocalization within the molecule were analyzed using NBO analysis."
