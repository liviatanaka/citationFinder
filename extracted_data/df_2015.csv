"Inflation persistence, learning dynamics and the rationality of inflation expectations","The rational expectations hypothesis for survey and model-based inflation forecasts—from the Survey of Professional Forecasters and the Greenbook respectively—is examined by properly taking into account the persistence characteristics of the data. The finding of near-unit-root effects in the inflation and inflation expectations series motivates the use of a local-to-unity specification of the inflation process that enables us to test whether the data are generated by locally non-stationary or stationary processes. Thus, we test, rather than assume, stationarity of near-unit-root processes. The paper combines the concept of localities in the underlying time series, such as those that may exist in the sample but not in the population, with cointegration analysis which permits the distinction between short-run and long-run structures. Thus, we examine possible in-sample departures from rationality both in the short run and the long run. Our empirical results indicate that the rational expectations hypothesis holds in the long run, while forecasters adjust their expectations slowly in the short run. This finding lends support to the hypothesis that the persistence of inflation comes from the dynamics of expectations."
Exchange rate persistence of the Chinese yuan against the US dollar in the NDF market,"This article analyses the persistence of the exchange rates of the Chinese yuan against the US dollar in the NDF market during 1999–2012 with fractional integration technique. It concludes that the exchange rates are I(d) with d close to 1 though statistically significantly below 1, suggesting a small degree of mean reverting behaviour. And the squared returns display long memory with an order of integration of about 0.2. Moreover, the unit root null hypothesis cannot be rejected during the years during 2006–2011 when the international financial crisis broke out and the exchange rate regime reform implemented. At last, we notice that d in the original series is highly negatively correlated with respect to the mean and the variance in the exchange rates, while it is positively correlated with them in the squared returns. And policy implications are also suggested."
"Synthesis, Structural and Optical Characterization of MgO Nanocrystalline Embedded in PVA Matrix","Nano-magnesium oxide (MgO) was prepared by wet chemical method using magnesium chloride and sodium hydroxide as precursors and soluble gelatin as stabilizing agent in this paper. The synthesized nano MgO was characterized by XRD, SEM, and FTIR. The results showed that the size of nano-MgO was about 20.62 nm. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) polymer based nanocomposites, with different concentrations of MgO (1, 2, 3, 4 wt%), have been prepared using solvent casting technique. The results of SEM revealed that the MgO nanoparticles are uniformly distributed in PVA polymer matrix. FTIR analysis evidently saw the interaction between MgO with hydroxyl group of PVA through hydrogen bonding. The influences of MgO nanoparticle on the optical characterisation of PVA have been considered using UV–Vis–NIR spectroscopy. Energy band gap and tail of localized state of PVA/MgO nanocomposites have been calculated by using Tauc and Urbach relations, respectively. The band gap of the nanocomposites samples decreases as MgO wt% increases. Wemple-DiDomenico single-oscillator model has been applied to analyze the dispersion of the refractive index of the films, and the dispersion parameters are calculated to obtain the information about disorder degree."
Feature Tracking-Derived Peak Systolic Strain Compared to Late Gadolinium Enhancement in Troponin-Positive Myocarditis: A Case–Control Study,"Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) assesses myocardial involvement in myocarditis (MYO). Current techniques are qualitative, subjective, and prone to interpretation error. Feature tracking (FT) analyzes myocardial strain using CMR and has not been examined in MYO. We hypothesize that regional left ventricular (LV) strain is abnormal in MYO. Regional strain by FT was compared to late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and troponin leak as measures of myocardial involvement. This single-center, retrospective CMR study reviewed patients with clinical MYO and structurally normal hearts who underwent CMR at our institution. Young adults with normal cardiac anatomy, function, and absent LGE served as controls. MYO patients with documented troponin leak and normal global ejection fraction (EF > 50 %) were included in comparison. FT determined regional myocardial peak systolic strain (pkS) in longitudinal and circumferential distributions. T tests compared strain values between cases and controls. Receiver operating characteristic curves determined pkS values with highest sensitivity and specificity for concurrent troponin leak and LGE. FT was performed on 57 patients: 37 MYO and 20 controls. Twenty-eight cases with normal EF, and 20 control patients were included in final analysis. Nearly all cases with normal function demonstrated abnormal regional pkS (27/28, 96 %). Cases had significantly diminished pkS when compared to controls in all regions except the longitudinal 2C distribution. FT-derived longitudinal and circumferential pkS is sensitive and specific in identifying myocardial involvement, namely the presence of troponin leak and LGE. FT may be a useful adjunctive, objective measure of myocardial involvement in patients with MYO and normal LV function."
2-Level error (drift) compensation for low-cost MEMS-based inertial measurement unit (IMU),"In this paper, we extend the 1-level compensation method for MEMS-based IMUs, dealing mainly with stochastic drifts, described in our previous work Yudanto et al. (Proc SPIE, 9517:95,172H-95–95,172H-12, 2015) to a 2-level compensation method dealing with both stochastic and temperature drifts. While the 1-level compensation method is based on an automatic detection of systems states which triggers an online recalibration of the sensors parameters, the 2-level compensation method extends the 1-level compensation method by using a model-based approach to remove the temperature influences in the sensors outputs. The 2-level compensation schemes are then integrated together to allow an algorithmic framework that can be used in an easy way to auto-calibrate MEMS-based IMUs. Experiments using an industrial MEMS-based IMU under various operating conditions have been conducted to demonstrate the added value of the 2-level compensation method. The experimental results show that the estimations of acceleration and angular velocity based on the 2-level compensation method are in general more accurate than the ones obtained based on the 1-level compensation method."
Pd Loaded TiO2 Nanotubes for the Effective Catalytic Reduction of p-Nitrophenol,"Titania nanotubes decorated with Pd nanoparticles were synthesised by a hydrothermal method. The increased amounts of Pd concentration is found to facilitate the anatase to rutile crystalline phase transformation as well as in collapse of the morphology as revealed by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The presence of metallic as well as the oxidized form (PdO2) of surface metal ions was characterized by using XPS. The catalytic activity of the Pd loaded titania nanotubes has been demonstrated by studying the reduction of p-nitrophenol to p-aminophenol. The 1.0 mol% Pd loaded titania nanotubes has been found to exhibit optimum catalytic activity (rate constant of 0.7072 min−1) while those with higher amounts of Pd loading showed lower catalytic activity. It is observed that retention of tubular morphology and higher anatase content play significant roles in their catalytic activity."
Ternary CoAgPd Nanoparticles Confined Inside the Pores of MIL-101 as Efficient Catalyst for Dehydrogenation of Formic Acid,"Highly dispersed ternary CoAgPd nanoparticles with different composition have been successfully immobilized on the metal-organic frameworks (MIL-101) by using a simple liquid impregnation method for the first time. The molecular scale electronic synergistic effect between non-noble metal Co and AgPd NPs and the confinement effect of MIL-101 are the crucial roles for the improvement of catalytic performances toward dehydrogenation of formic acid under mild conditions. The resultant catalysts are composition dependent toward dehydrogenation of formic acid, while Co9Ag21Pd70@MIL-101 exhibits exceedingly high catalytic activity, with the turnover frequency value of 98 h−1, and 100 % hydrogen selectivity at 50 °C."
Carbon Coated Metal Nanoparticles for Electrocatalysis,"To promote the performance of nanoparticle electrocatalysts, a facile hydrothermal method is developed to generate core–shell nanocomposites with a metal catalyst core and a carbon shell. In this method, glucose serves as the reducing agent and carbon precursor while cetyltrimethylammonium surfactants serve as both pore structure-directing agents and nanoparticle capping agent. The accessibility of the metal catalyst core was examined by gas-phase ethylene hydrogenation and the electrocatalytic activity was tested by formic acid oxidation (FOR). The selection of halide counter ions used during the synthesis was found to be critical. The optimized sample of Pd-carbon nanocomposite exhibits a FOR current density of 2.55 mA/cm2, which is higher than that of un-coated Pd nanoparticles with no support (0.89 mA/cm2) and with carbon nanotube support (1.08 mA/cm2)."
"Efficient Synthesis of α-Chloroketones Catalyzed by Fluorous Hydrazine-1,2-Bis(Carbothioate) Organocatalyst",A novel and recoverable fluorous hydrazine-carbothioate organocatalyst was prepared. It could catalyze α-chlorination of alkyl ketones with N-chlorosuccinimide as chlorine source under mild reaction conditions. The reaction afforded the corresponding α-chlorinated carbonyl compounds with excellent yields at rapid reaction speed.
Conversion of Poly(methylhydrosiloxane) Waste to Useful Commodities,"Poly(methylhydrosiloxane) [PMHS, R(OSiMeH)nOR] is applied in chemistry as cheap, low-toxic, air and moisture stable reducing reagent. However, along with the desired products significant amounts of silicone waste is produced, since only ~1.7 % of the PMHS is employed for the reduction process. The formation of PMHS-waste reduces the sustainability of such reduction protocols. For instance PMHS can be applied as reagent (a) in the methanolysis to produce molecular hydrogen; (b) in the reduction of sulfoxides to form the corresponding sulfides; (c) in the hydrodeoxygenation of fatty esters to produce hydrocarbons. An option for the treatment of the PMHS-waste can be the application of depolymerization methods to convert it to useful commodities. In more detail, the silicone waste is reacted in a depolymerization reaction with boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (BF3OEt2) to produce methyltrifluorosilane (MeSiF3) and difluoromethylsilane (MeSiF2H), which can be interesting building blocks for the silicone industry, overall demonstrating a resource conserving process."
Scaling Relationships for Binding Energies of Transition Metal Complexes,"In this work, we investigate the trends in binding energies of different reaction intermediates on transition metal complexes for homogeneous catalysis. We find that linear scaling relationships exist between the binding energies of N and NHx (x = 1, 2), analogous to the bond-order formulation well-known in heterogeneous catalysis. This approach provides a new perspective of reactivity trends in transition metal complexes and opens up the possibility of using a descriptor-based approach for investigating homogeneous catalysis. We show the first steps towards this analysis by analyzing a wide range of modified “Schrock-type” catalysts."
Improving Ultra-Deep Desulfurization Efficiency by Catalyst Stacking Technology,"The catalyst for diesel ultra-deep desulfurization is selected on the basis of several factors, including feedstock composition, liquid hourly space velocity, and operation pressure. Owing to their specific processing purposes, different catalyst systems, such as straight distillation, coking distillation, blends of straight distillation, and secondary processing oil, are applied for various feeds because of their considerable difference in terms of sulfur content, nitrogen content, aromatics constitute, and cetane number. This study aims to determine the most appropriate catalyst and grading scheme by evaluating the deep desulfurization efficiency of different schemes when processing various feeds. The results showed that the W–Mo–Ni/Mo–Co catalyst stacking is the most effective among various schemes because of the following reasons: (1) loading W–Mo–Ni catalyst on the upper bed of reactor not only benefits the saturation of polyaromatics even in the middle or at the end of the run but also provides low nitrogen feed for the bottom bed; (2) loading Mo–Co type catalyst with alkyl transfer performance in the bottom bed at high temperature reaction zone facilitates alkyl transfer reaction and mitigates the effect of thermodynamic equilibrium limitations in the middle and at the end of the run, consequently improving the HDS efficiency under high temperatures."
The Influence of the Nature of the Support on the Copper–Palladium Catalysed Suzuki–Miyaura-Coupling,"Copper–palladium bimetallic catalysts supported on mixed oxides (MgO)0.75(Al2O3)0.25 (MgAlO) were prepared with two step impregnation (TSI) and co-impregnation (CI). These materials were studied to determine the effect of the support on the activity and stability in the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction and on the properties of a catalyst. The catalyst prepared by CI was active and selective during 6 catalytic cycles in Suzuki coupling, whereas the activity of the catalyst prepared with TSI dropped at the sixth use. The kinetics of the reaction was examined along with its scope. The relationship between the basic properties of the support and the catalytic performances were examined too. The importance of the nature of the support was also studied by catalyst characterization methods."
The Effect of Bullying and Victimization on Cognitive Empathy Development During the Transition to Middle School,"Interventions aimed at reducing bullying behavior commonly target the development of empathy. Yet, few longitudinal studies have investigated how empathy levels vary with bullying and victimization over time, especially during the transition to middle school."
Small Creep Crack Growth Interacting with Microstructural and Mechanical Factors in a Polycrystalline Ni-Based Superalloy,"Behavior of small crack propagation during creep was studied, in comparison with that of physically long crack propagation behavior, based on non-linear fracture mechanics approach. Through the work special attention is paid to understand: (1) microstructural aspect on small creep crack propagation interacting with grain boundaries and dendrite boundaries, (2) difference between small and macroscopic long creep cracks, (3) role(s) of stress concentration and relaxation with creep time in the crack propagation behavior emanating from a notch introduced as a simulation of cooling holes in blades and vane applications. From the experimental results, a specific crack growth behavior was found at the beginning of early crack growth stage (small crack), where the crack growth rate decreased with increasing J

 under both the isothermal creep (ITC) and thermal gradient creep (TGC). Also, crack under the TGC showed different crack growth rate than that under the ITC condition, where the higher and lower rates were achieved at lower and higher temperature side, respectively, under a given value of J

The mean square stability analysis of a stochastic dynamic model for electricity market,"The mean square stability pertaining to a stochastic electricity market model is analyzed in this paper. Considering the random nature of demand elasticity, the stochastic electricity market model under small Gauss type random excitation has already been presented. Using the theory of stochastic differential equations, matrix theory and eigenvalue techniques, the sufficient conditions of the mean square stability for this electricity market model are provided and testified theoretically. The conclusions can judge the stability of the system by available data on demand elasticity. The obtained results are validated and illustrated by numerical examples."
New concepts of vague graphs,"The concept of vague graph was introduced by Ramakrishna (Int J Comput Cognit 7:51–58, 2009). Since the vague models give more precision, flexibility, and compatibility to the system as compared to the classical and fuzzy models, in this paper, the concept of energy of fuzzy graph is extended to the energy of a vague graph. It has many applications in physics, chemistry, computer science, and other branches of mathematics. We define adjacency matrix, degree matrix, laplacian matrix, spectrum, and energy of a vague graph in terms of their adjacency matrix. The spectrum of a vague graph appears in physics statistical problems, and combinatorial optimization problems in mathematics. Also, the lower and upper bounds for the energy of a vague graph are also derived. Finally, we give some applications of energy in vague graph and other sciences."
Effects of synthetic large-scale genome reduction on metabolism and metabolic preferences in a nutritionally complex environment,"The soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti forms nodules on the roots of leguminous plants, where N2 is reduced to ammonia. Its genome includes a 3.65 Mb chromosome, a 1.35 Mb pSymA megaplasmid, and a 1.68 Mb pSymB chromid. pSymA and pSymB constitute ~45 % of the genome and here a non-targeted approach was used to identify the metabolic consequences of the removal of these replicons. Polar and non-polar metabolites from wild-type, ∆pSymA, ∆pSymB, and ∆pSymAB cells and supernatants across a growth curve were analyzed by LC–HILIC–TOF–MS. 2008 metabolite features were identified in the extracellular metabolome of cells grown in LBmc containing yeast extract and casein hydrolysate. 1474 features were found from the intracellular metabolites of cells grown in minimal M9-sucrose medium. Analysis revealed both time and genotype influenced the metabolome, with the removal of pSymB having a much greater effect than the loss of pSymA. Strains lacking pSymB showed an increase in sugar, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolites in the intracellular metabolome, and the loss of pSymB clearly impaired the cell’s ability to catabolize exogenous amino acids. We conclude that despite the ability of wild-type, ∆pSymA, ∆pSymB, and ∆pSymAB strains to grow in both M9-sucrose and LBmc media, the removal of pSymA, and particularly pSymB, had clear and dramatic effects on the S. meliloti metabolome. The larger effect associated with the pSymB chromid is consistent with the large number of metabolic genes on this replicon and the greater genetic and metabolic integration of this replicon with the S. meliloti chromosome."
LC-ESI MS/MS profiling of polar steroid metabolites of the Far Eastern starfish Patiria (=Asterina) pectinifera,"Profiling of asterosaponins, polyhydroxysteroids and glycosides of polyhydroxysteroids of the common in the Far Eastern sea waters starfish Patiria (=Asterina) pectinifera was performed by LC-ESI MS and LC-APPI MS. The 72 polar steroid metabolites, including 35 asterosaponins, 22 polyhydroxysteroids and 15 sulfated glycosides of polyhydroxysteroids, were detected and identified using the LC–MS and LC–MS/MS spectra. The steroid metabolome of P. pectinifera is characterized by large number of sulfated and non-sulfated highly oxidized compounds with cholestane, ergostane and stigmastane skeleton systems of aglycones. Some peculiarities of biosynthesis of the starfish polar steroids were discussed. It was suggested that biosynthesis of asterosaponins from diet sterols is executed in a mosaic type manner with transformations in aglycone moieties and elongation of carbohydrate chains proceeding independently from each other and simultaneously."
Inference from the best systematization,"In recent decades “inference to the best explanation” has become a fashionable mode of reasoning. It is, however, highly problematic and flawed in ways that the article expounds. Instead, so it is argued, a process of inference from (not to) the best systematization of the relevant determinable facts is a far more plausible and promising procedure."
A service-oriented framework to the design of information system service,"The beginning of this century is marked by a paradigm shift due to the move of the production focus from goods-dominant to a service-dominant. At the same time, manufacturing automation and integration are undergoing changes, which open the possibility for classical model oriented products to be replaced by service models, supported by cognitive information systems. This paper analyzes a proposal to achieve a sound design process for service systems, which follows the model driven tendency. In fact, the aim is to bring together practical and formal approach, and therefore, to propose a good design discipline based on SOMF (Service Oriented Model Framework). Based on this model driven approach a new environment were developed which supports elicitation, modeling and requirements analysis supported by semi-formal methods (SOMF and UML) and formal methods (by using SysML and Petri Nets). The proposed method is applied to a case study based in an urban Smart Grid."
Simulation study of the effect of water removal from Fischer–Tropsch products on the process performance using a hydrophilic membrane reactor,"In this study, a mathematical model describing Fischer–Tropsch synthesis over an iron catalyst carried out in two configurations of membrane reactors was developed to predict the process performance. For this purpose, the impact of water removal from the reaction side on syngas conversion and on hydrocarbons selectivity was theoretically analyzed and quantified under different operating conditions. The obtained main results reveal that the process can be intensified when the catalyst was packed in a single region, whereas the produced water was continuously removed from the reaction side to the permeate side, which is constituted of two identical and parallel regions. This configuration design is characterized by a sufficient large area, which can enable fast water removal by an adequate sweep-fluid flow rate. As a result, the conversion and product selectivity could be enhanced obviously at the suitable conditions."
Hydraulic experiments of urban river meandering method and fish habitat revitalization,"Recently, the number of urban river restoration projects that use artificial spurs to create ecologically sound rivers has steadily increased. In this study, the effect of spur placement on improving the ecological environment of rivers is investigated for an optimal riverbank spur design based on small-scale experimental results. The experiments were conducted by varying the placement of the spur formations, the spur types, and the dimensionless Froude Numbers. Stone mattress, wickerwork, and combinations of these materials were used as spurs. The experimental results show that the spur placement helped create a gentle meandering river and secured the fish habitat. A combination of stone mattress and wickerwork (wickerwork beneath a stone mattress) resulted in the most effective type of spur for achieving a gentle meandering and sound fish habitat. The average water flow velocities in front of the spurs decreased by roughly 30%, while the average water flow velocities behind the stone mattress decreased by approximately 70%. Consequently, it is concluded that the well-implementation of spurs could induce an ecologically favorable habitat for fish and fish spawning."
Physical model study of bridge contraction scour,"Because scour has contributed to the collapse of a large number of bridges, many researchers have tried to find a general method of predicting scour to prevent the failure of bridge foundations. However, existing scour depth equations recommended by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in the United States generally give excessively conservative estimates of the scour depth. One reason is that these equations are based primarily on idealized and simplified laboratory experiments in rectangular flumes. In addition to idealized and simplified laboratory experiments, another possible reason for scour depth overprediction is the current practice of adding separate estimates of contraction scour and local scour when in fact these processes occur simultaneously and interact. This study focuses specifically on the hydraulic modeling of local pier scour and contraction scour. Scaled field site was constructed in the Hydraulics Laboratory at the Georgia Institute of Technology based on their Froude number similarity. We used several flow rates, including the 50- and 100-year peak flood discharge and the 1998 historical flood discharge from field measurements provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and used them to compare scour measurements (contraction scour and local scour) in the laboratory and in the field. Based on the findings, a procedure for hydraulic modeling with scaled field geometry is suggested."
Streptomyces sanglieri which colonised and enhanced the growth of Elaeis guineensis Jacq. seedlings was antagonistic to Ganoderma boninense in in vitro studies,"Actinomycete strain AUM 00500 was 99.5 % similar to Streptomyces sanglieri NBRC 100784T and was evaluated for antagonistic activity towards Ganoderma boninense, the causative fungus of basal stem rot of oil palm. The strain showed strong antifungal activity towards G. boninense in in vitro and SEM analysis showed various modes of inhibition of the fungus. Ethyl acetate extracts of single culture and inhibition zone of cross-plug culture by HPLC indicated that strain AUM 00500 produced two different antibiotics of the glutarimide group namely cycloheximide and actiphenol. In greenhouse trials, oil palm seed treated with spores of S. sanglieri strain AUM 00500 at 109 cfu/ml showed significant (P < 0.05) increase in oil palm seedlings growth when compared to the control. Streptomyces sanglieri strain AUM 00500 successfully colonised the epidermal surface of the roots of treated oil palm seedlings and it was recovered from root fragments plated on starch casein agar."
"Evaluation of light attraction for the stored-product psocid, Liposcelis bostrychophila","The psocid, Liposcelis bostrychophila Badonnel (Psocoptera: Liposcelididae), is the most widespread psocid pest of stored products. Because L. bostrychophila has developed resistance to several chemical insecticides, it is important to investigate other integrated pest management (IPM) approaches, and a critical part of IPM programs is an effective monitoring program, Monitoring tools for psocids are limited, and few studies have been conducted on monitoring of psocids, with none on the attraction of lights for psocids. Therefore, we studied the response of L. bostrychophila adults to eight wavelengths of light-emitting diodes (LED) in paired-choice pitfall test. Among the LEDs evaluated, the strongest response by L. bostrychophila adults was to 351 nm UV. When LEDs were tested against brewer’s yeast (the most preferred attractant for L. bostrychophila among more than 20 potential attractants found in previous studies), the 351 nm UV wavelength was the only light that attracted more psocids than brewer’s yeast. These results suggest that the use of LEDs might be useful in psocid-monitoring programs for L. bostrychophila and other psocid species."
Attraction behaviors of entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae) to synthetic volatiles emitted by insect-damaged carrot roots,"Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) play a role in indirect defenses of plants under attack by root herbivores. We have tested the chemotactic responses of 4 EPN species (Steinernema
feltiae, S. carpocapsae, S. kraussei, and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora) to 5 compounds ([1] α-Pinene, [2] Terpinolene, [3] Bornyl acetate, [4] 2-Ethyl-hexanol, and [5] 2, 4-Di-tert-butylphenol) released by damaged (3, 4, 5) and undamaged (1, 2) carrot roots. We hypothesized that the EPN directional responses to the tested volatile compounds (VOCs) could be related to foraging strategy and would vary among species, VOC, and VOC concentrations. Our results indicate that all of the tested EPN species exhibited a weak attraction or repulsion to volatiles, irrespective of their foraging strategy. Terpinolene was a repellent for EPN species classified in all three foraging groups. However, such values of chemotaxis index (CI) were reported with EPN species only when pure concentration of VOC was used. Based on our current results, we conclude that responses to distinct volatile cues are a species-specific characteristic. Our results suggest that EPNs are able to distinguish herbivore-induced chemicals from chemicals that are typical for healthy roots."
Feeding gastrostomy in children with complex heart disease: when is a fundoplication indicated?,Malnutrition is common among children with complex heart disease (CHD). Feeding gastrostomies are often used to improve the nutritional status of such patients. Our purpose was to evaluate a cohort of children with CHD following open Stamm gastrostomy without fundoplication.
The Causal Factors of International Inequality in \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) Emissions Per Capita: A Regression-Based Inequality Decomposition Analysis,"This paper uses the possibilities provided by the regression-based inequality decomposition (Fields in Res Labor Econ 22:1–38, 2003) to explore the contribution of different explanatory factors to international inequality in \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emissions per capita. In contrast to previous emissions inequality decompositions, which were based on identity relationships, this methodology does not impose any a priori specific relationship. Thus, it allows an assessment of the contribution to inequality of different relevant variables. In short, the paper appraises the relative contributions of affluence, sectoral composition, demographic factors and climate. The analysis is applied to selected years of the period 1993–2007. The results show the important (though decreasing) share of the contribution of demographic factors, as well as a significant contribution of affluence and sectoral composition."
"Catalytic properties, functional attributes and industrial applications of β-glucosidases","β-Glucosidases are diverse group of enzymes with great functional importance to biological systems. These are grouped in multiple glycoside hydrolase families based on their catalytic and sequence characteristics. Most studies carried out on β-glucosidases are focused on their industrial applications rather than their endogenous function in the target organisms. β-Glucosidases performed many functions in bacteria as they are components of large complexes called cellulosomes and are responsible for the hydrolysis of short chain oligosaccharides and cellobiose. In plants, β-glucosidases are involved in processes like formation of required intermediates for cell wall lignification, degradation of endosperm’s cell wall during germination and in plant defense against biotic stresses. Mammalian β-glucosidases are thought to play roles in metabolism of glycolipids and dietary glucosides, and signaling functions. These enzymes have diverse biotechnological applications in food, surfactant, biofuel, and agricultural industries. The search for novel and improved β-glucosidase is still continued to fulfills demand of an industrially suitable enzyme. In this review, a comprehensive overview on detailed functional roles of β-glucosidases in different organisms, their industrial applications, and recent cloning and expression studies with biochemical characterization of such enzymes is presented for the better understanding and efficient use of diverse β-glucosidases."
Beneficial Effect of Metformin on Nerve Regeneration and Functional Recovery After Sciatic Nerve Crush Injury in Diabetic Rats,"Neuroprotective effects of metformin have been increasingly recognized in both diabetic and non-diabetic conditions. Thus far, no information has been available on the potential beneficial effects of metformin on peripheral nerve regeneration in diabetes mellitus. The present study was designed to investigate such a possibility. Diabetes was established by a single injection of streptozotocin at 50 mg/kg in rats. After sciatic nerve crush injury, the diabetic rats were intraperitoneally administrated daily for 4 weeks with metformin (30, 200 and 500 mg/kg), or normal saline, respectively. The axonal regeneration was investigated by morphometric analysis and retrograde labeling. The functional recovery was evaluated by electrophysiological studies and behavioral analysis. It was found that metformin significantly enhanced axonal regeneration and functional recovery compared to saline after sciatic nerve injury in diabetic rats. In addition, metformin at 200 and 500 mg/kg showed better performance than that at 30 mg/kg. Taken together, metformin is capable of promoting nerve regeneration after sciatic nerve injuries in diabetes mellitus, highlighting its therapeutic values for peripheral nerve injury repair in diabetes mellitus."
Noncanonical Activin A Signaling in PC12 Cells: A Self-Limiting Feedback Loop,"Activin A (Act A), a member of transforming growth factor-β superfamily, plays a neuroprotective role in multiple neurological diseases through Act A/Smads signal activation. Traditionally, the up-regulation of Act A gene and extracellular Act A accumulation show the signal activation as a linear pathway. However, one of our discoveries indicated that Act A could lead a loop signaling in ischemic injury. To clarify the characteristic of this loop signaling in a non-pathological state, we up-regulated the expression of Act A, monitored extracellular Act A accumulation and examined the activity of Act A signaling, which was quantified by the expression of phosphorylated Smad3 and the fluorescence intensity of Smad4 in nuclei. The results demonstrated a noncanonical Act A signal loop with self-amplifying property in PC12 cells. Further, it showed self-limiting behavior due to temporary activation and spontaneous attenuation. This periodic behavior of Act A signal loop was found to be regulated by the level of Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA). Moreover, increased activity of Act A signal loop could promote PC12 cell proliferation and enhance the survival rate of cells to Oxygen–Glucose Deprivation. These practical discoveries will bring new insight on the functional outcome of Act A signaling in neurological diseases by the further understanding: loop signaling."
Neuroprotection as a Potential Therapeutic Perspective in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Focus on Antiepileptic Drugs,"Neuroprotection is conceived as one of the potential tool to prevent or slow neuronal death and hence a therapeutic hope to treat neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. Increase of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, inflammatory changes, iron accumulation, and protein aggregation have been identified as main causes of neuronal death and adopted as targets to test experimentally the putative neuroprotective effects of various classes of drugs. Among these agents, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), both the old and the newer generations, have shown to exert protective effects in different experimental models. Their mechanism of action is mediated mainly by modulating the activity of sodium, calcium and potassium channels as well as the glutamatergic and GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid) synapses. Neurological pathologies in which a neuroprotective action of AEDs has been demonstrated in specific experimental models include: cerebral ischemia, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. Although the whole of experimental data indicating that neuroprotection can be achieved is remarkable and encouraging, no firm data have been produced in humans so far and, at the present time, neuroprotection still remains a challenge for the future."
A Tribute to Mary C. McKenna: Glutamate as Energy Substrate and Neurotransmitter—Functional Interaction Between Neurons and Astrocytes,"Glutamate metabolism in the brain is extremely complex not only involving a large variety of enzymes but also a tight partnership between neurons and astrocytes, the latter cells being in control of de novo synthesis of glutamate. This review provides an account of the processes involved, i.e. pyruvate carboxylation and recycling as well as the glutamate–glutamine cycle, focusing on the many seminal contributions from Dr. Mary McKenna. The ramification of the astrocytic end feet allowing contact and control of hundreds of thousands of synapses at the same time obviously puts these cells in a prominent position to regulate neural activity. Additionally, the astrocytes take active part in the neurotransmission processes by releasing a variety of gliotransmitters including glutamate. Hence, the term “the tripartite synapse”, in which there is an active and dynamic interplay between the pre- and post-synaptic neurons and the ensheathing astrocytes, has been coined. The studies of Mary McKenna and her colleagues over several decades have been of paramount importance for the elucidation of compartmentation in astrocytes and synaptic terminals and the intricate metabolic processes underlying the glutamatergic neurotransmission process."
Acrylamide Retards the Slow Axonal Transport of Neurofilaments in Rat Cultured Dorsal Root Ganglia Neurons and the Corresponding Mechanisms,"Chronic acrylamide (ACR) exposure induces peripheral-central axonopathy in occupational workers and laboratory animals, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we first investigated the effects of ACR on slow axonal transport of neurofilaments in cultured rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons through live-cell imaging approach. Then for the underlying mechanisms exploration, the protein level of neurofilament subunits, motor proteins kinesin and dynein, and dynamitin subunit of dynactin in DRG neurons were assessed by western blotting and the concentrations of ATP was detected using ATP Assay Kit. The results showed that ACR treatment results in a dose-dependent decrease of slow axonal transport of neurofilaments. Furthermore, ACR intoxication significantly increases the protein levels of the three neurofilament subunits (NF-L, NF-M, NF-H), kinesin, dynein, and dynamitin subunit of dynactin in DRG neurons. In addition, ATP level decreased significantly in ACR-treated DRG neurons. Our findings indicate that ACR exposure retards slow axonal transport of NF-M, and suggest that the increase of neurofilament cargoes, motor proteins, dynamitin of dynactin, and the inadequate ATP supply contribute to the ACR-induced retardation of slow axonal transport."
Potential Role of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Pathogenesis of Diabetic Retinopathy,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease that leads to several complications which include retinopathy. Multiple biochemical abnormalities have been proposed to explain the development of retinopathy, including oxidative stress. Although the existence of oxidative stress has been established in the retina from long standing diabetic animals, pathogenesis and progression of retinopathy remain unclear. In order to gain insight into the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, we analyzed the levels of different oxidative stress biomarkers in the retina at early stages during the progress of streptozotocin-induced diabetes. No significant changes in glutathione content, expression of NADPH-oxidase, levels of lipid peroxidation, nor production of free radicals were observed in the retina up to 45 days of diabetes induction. Likewise, a transient decrease in aconitase activity, parallel to an increase in the superoxide dismutase activity was observed at 20 days of hyperglycemia, suggesting a high capacity of retina to maintain its redox homeostasis, at least at early stages of diabetes. Nonetheless, we found an early and time-dependent increase in the levels of oxidized proteins, which was not affected by the administration of the antioxidant quercetin. Also, positive immunoreactivity to the reticulum stress protein CHOP was found in glial Müller cells of diabetic rat retinas. These findings suggest the occurrence of endoplasmic reticulum stress as a primary event in retina pathogenesis in diabetes."
The optimal regimen of bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastoma: does dose matter?,"The FDA-approved schedule and dose of bevacizumab (BVZ) for recurrent glioblastoma (rGB) (10 mg/kg q 2 weeks) were adopted from systemic cancer protocols. No dose-defining studies have been performed for glioblastoma. We began using BVZ for the treatment of rGB in 2005 at the dose of 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks combined with irinotecan, and later as single agent. Our previous report of 20 patients treated with BVZ 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks showed similar response rates and overall survival (OS) compared to other BVZ treatment protocols, with less adverse effects. In this study we retrospectively reviewed our 7 year experience with BVZ in 162 rGB patients. Treatment outcomes were analyzed from 87 patients who received BVZ at 5 mg/kg and 75 patients at 10 mg/kg. While median age was similar in both groups, the median KPS was significantly higher in the group treated with 10 mg/kg BVZ (85 versus 60). There was no significant difference in OS or progression free survival (PFS) between the groups treated with BVZ 5 versus 10 mg/kg. Overall survival was significantly improved in the subgroup treated with cytotoxic therapy in addition to BVZ 10 mg/kg. There were more adverse events seen with BVZ 10 mg/kg. There is no significant difference in OS for rGB treated with BVZ 5 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg when given as monotherapy. The smaller dose was slightly less toxic. Addition of cytotoxic therapy resulted in prolongation of OS in a small subgroup of BVZ 10 mg/kg."
NMR assignments of the N-terminal domain of Ogataea polymorpha telomerase reverse transcriptase,"Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that adds telomeric DNA fragments to the ends of chromosomes. This enzyme is the focus of substantial attention, both because its structure and mechanism of action are still poorly studied, and because of its pivotal roles in aging and cellular proliferation. The use of telomerase as a potential target for the design of new anticancer drugs is also of great interest. The catalytic protein subunit of telomerase (TERT) contains an N-terminal domain (TEN) that is essential for activity and processivity. Elucidation of the structure and dynamics of TEN in solution is important for understanding the molecular mechanism of telomerase activity and for the design of new telomerase inhibitors. To approach this problem, in this study we report the 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shift assignments of TEN from Ogataea polymorpha. Analysis of the assigned chemical shifts allowed us to identify secondary structures and protein regions potentially involved in interaction with other participants of the telomerase catalytic cycle."

"Local and nonlocal material models, spatial randomness, and impact loading","In many material systems, both man-made and natural, we have an incomplete knowledge of geometric or material properties, which leads to uncertainty in predicting their performance under dynamic loading. Given the uncertainty and a high degree of spatial variability in properties of geological formations subjected to impact, a stochastic theory of continuum mechanics would be useful for modeling dynamic response of such systems. In this paper, we examine spatial randomness in local and nonlocal material-mechanics models. We begin with classical linear elasticity. Then, we consider nonlocal elasticity and, finally, peridynamic theory. We discuss a formulation of stochastic peridynamic theory and illustrate this formulation with examples of impact loading of geological materials with uncorrelated versus correlated properties, sampled in a Monte Carlo sense. We examine wave propagation and damage to the material. The most salient feature is the absence of spallation, referred to as disorder toughness, which, in fact, generalizes similar results from earlier quasi-static damage mechanics."
A bridging law and its application to the analysis of toughness of carbon nanotube-reinforced composites and pull-out of fibres grafted with nanotubes,"Bridging laws are essential in predicting the mechanical behaviour of conventional short-fibre-reinforced composites and the emerging nanofibre-reinforced composites. In this paper, we first review some studies on the toughness of carbon nanotube-reinforced composites that is induced by the pull-out of the nanotubes from the matrix, and on the development of the corresponding bridging laws. A close examination of the available bridging laws for carbon nanotubes reveals that some fundamental issues need to be further addressed. We propose a simple nonlinear and smooth bridging law to describe the pull-out force–displacement behaviour of carbon nanotubes from a matrix. This law contains only two material parameters, reflects the basic features of the pull-out experiments, and is easy to use. We then use this bridging law to calculate the fracture toughness of carbon nanotube-reinforced nanocomposites and predict the pull-out force–displacement response of conventional short fibres that are grafted with carbon nanotubes. Some parametric studies are conducted to reveal the influence of various parameters at the nano- and micro-scale on these properties."
On lateral buckling of subsea pipe-in-pipe systems,"Lateral buckling is a common phenomenon in unburied high temperature and high pressure (HT/HP) subsea pipe-in-pipe systems. An effective finite element model based on beam element and tube-to-tube contact element is proposed to study lateral buckling in pipe-in-pipe systems, in which the initial imperfection (out-of-straightness), nonlinear pipe-soil interaction and nonlinear material properties are considered. The results show that it is the resultant axil force of the inner and outer pipe that governs the lateral buckling phenomenon in pipe-in-pipe systems. The initial imperfection and pipe-soil interaction are the most important factors which influence evolution of the displacement and stress in pipe-in-pipe systems. Nonlinear material properties are necessary when plastic strain may occur in post-buckling stage. At last, a simplified model is proposed which can easily calculate the critical buckling temperature of the corresponding pipe-in-pipe system."
The effects of process parameters for joining of AISI 1010-Cu alloys by friction welded,"In this study, the effects of process parameters for joining of AISI 1010 low carbon steel and copper alloys by friction welded were investigated. Low carbon steel and commercial copper each of 12 mm diameter was used to fabricate the joints. The friction welding tests were carried out using a direct-drive type friction welding machine which was designed and manufactured for this purpose by us. After friction welding, in order to determine the microstructural changes that occurred, the interface regions of the welded specimens were examined by means of OM, SEM, EDS and X-Ray analysis. Microhardness and tensile tests were conducted to determine the mechanical properties of the welded specimens. The experimental results indicated that AISI 1010 low carbon steel could be joined to copper using the friction welding technique and for achieving a welding with a sufficient strength, the friction time has to be held as short as possible, while the rotational speed, friction and forging pressure has to be as high as possible. Tensile strength values also confirmed this result and at the interface did not occurred intermetallic phases. The maximum tensile strength of 294,67 MPa could be obtained for the joints welded under the welding conditions of rotation speed of 2300 rpm, friction pressure of 40 MPa, forging pressure of 80 MPa, friction time of 6 s and forging time of 3 s."
Experimental and numerical investigation on LTB strengths of monosymmetric compact I-beams with thickness-stepped-flanges,"This paper investigates the inelastic lateral torsional buckling, LTB, of doubly stepped singly symmetric compact I-beams under two concentrated loads. The results are obtained by conducting actual destructive tests on the beams using a testing machine and running simulation tests using the finite element program, ABAQUS. The main factors that are considered for the analyses are the degree of symmetry, the loading and supports, the stepped beam factors and the length. For this study, the beams have simple supports. The monosymmetric ratio of all the beams analyzed is fixed at 0.7. The unbraced lengths of the beams are 3 meters and 4 meters. The results obtained from ABAQUS are compared with the results from design specifications to determine the effects of steps and from proposed design equations to determine the equations’ applicability and safety. The results revealed that the stepped beams did have an increase in capacity in comparison with the prismatic beams and that the proposed equations are suitable to be used in predicting the strength of stepped beams under the observed loading condition."
A mode contribution ratio method for seismic analysis of large-span spatial structures,"The structural forms of large-span spatial structures can be characterized by the dense distribution of their natural frequencies, and their vibration subjected to seismic loads is three-dimensional. There are many modes that contribute to the seismic response. The high-order modes typically dominate. The mode superposition dynamic analysis method used for seismic design of spatial structures requires a criterion to determine the dominant modes. The criterion for tall buildings is not applicable for spatial structures; instead, we have proposed the mode contribution ratio method for the selection of the dominant modes of spatial structures subjected to seismic loads. A set of 18 typical cases of different single-layer spherical lattice shells was used to verify the validity of this method. The following conclusions can be drawn: First, the method for combining the first thirty modes to calculate the seismic responses specified in the Technical Specification for Space Frame Structures is not accurate and is not applicable to spatial structures. Second, the mode contribution ratio method can be used to choose the dominant modes of spatial structures. Third, the mode contribution ratio is physically different from the effective mass ratio. Especially when the structural mass distribution is uneven, the two ratios are different, and the mode contribution ratio is more precise in calculation of the seismic responses of spatial structures."
Lateral compression behaviors of thin-walled equilateral triangular tubes,"The paper deals with one important topic in impact engineering - the lateral compression behavior of thin-walled tubes. To study the lateral collapse modes and energy absorption behaviors of equilateral triangular tubes, quasi-static compression experiments were carried out. Crushing modes were revealed by the experiments. Three typical crushing stages characterize the lateral deformation plateaus of equilateral triangular tubes. In simulation, perfect tubes have symmetrical crushing modes. Strengths of the tubes were correctly predicted by the competition between yielding and buckling. Based on the observed crushing modes, plastic models were proposed for each stage to predict the lateral crushing behaviors theoretically. Equilateral triangular tubes have unified energy absorbing mechanisms, including five plastic hinges and one traveling plastic hinge. Plastic models have been constructed to predict the mean crushing forces and evaluate the energy absorption efficiency of the equilateral triangular tubes."
Experimental study and parameter analysis of L-shaped composite column under axial loading,"A special-shaped column composed of concrete-filled steel tubes (SCFST column) is experimentally investigated in this paper. The SCFST column is composed of several small-sized concrete-filled square tubular columns (mono-columns) connected by connection plates. This kind of column is proposed because it can increase the usable space in residential buildings. The axial loading behavior of L-shaped SCFST columns is experimentally investigated. The failure mode, strain distribution, cooperation of mono-columns, bearing capacity, and the effect of a concrete core on column behavior were tested. As concluded, the SCFST column can be regarded as a useful kind of column. A finite element analysis model was proposed according to the experimental results, and the influence of connection plate size on bearing capacity was studied using the finite element model. Finally, proposed were the optimal width and thickness of connection plates for improving the design of the SCFST column."
An experimental study on structural performance evaluation of steel wire-integrated deck plate,"Recently, due to the decreased work term and the convenience of construction work, the steel wire-integrated deck plate has been widely used in the construction sites in Korea. Most of all, owing to its good stiffness and economic consideration, the steel wire-integrated deck plate system has become very popular in recent years. This research suggested the new-type shear connector that can perform the roles of vertical bar and shear connector at the same time to obtain safety on construction load of the steel wire-integrated deck plate and improvement on constructability, and used many variables such as the location of lattice end and diameter of the lattice bar to evaluate the structural safety of the steel wire-integrated deck plate in construction step. The test results show that the new-type shear connectors sufficiently perform the roles of the vertical bars."
Evaluation of microvibration control performance of a smart base isolation system,"Because of the rapid progress in the state-of-the-art R&D technology in the semiconductor and optical instruments industry, the microvibration performance requirements for high-technology facilities and R&D institutes have become increasingly severe. Therefore, the microvibrations of high-technology facilities due to nearby road and rail traffic has attracted considerable attention. A smart base isolation system was developed to protect structures from seismic excitation. The research presented thus far showed that a smart base isolation system effectively reduced both the structural responses and isolator displacements. On the other hand, the control performance of a smart base isolation system for microvibration has not been studied. Therefore, this study evaluated the microvibration control performance of a smart base isolation. An MR damper and low damping elastomeric bearings were used to compose a smart base isolation system. The microvibration control performance was compared with that of a passive lead rubber bearing (LRB) isolation system. A train-induced ground acceleration was used as the excitation source for microvibration. A fuzzy logic control algorithm (FLC) was used to effectively control the smart base isolation system and a multi-objective genetic algorithm was employed to optimize the FLC. A sky-hook control algorithm was used as a comparative algorithm. The numerical simulation results showed that the smart base isolation system can effectively reduce the microvibrations of a high-technology facility subjected to train-induced excitation."
Efficient method to include joint zones of chord members in finite element model of tubular transmission tower at linear elastic stage,"To include the effects of the joint zones efficiently, firstly a chord member considering the joint zones is seen as a combination of three beams with different sections and its element stiffness matrix is derived; Secondly, based on the statistically geometrical properties of the joint zones and chord members in service, the coefficients in the element stiffness matrix of the varied section beam element related to the moments and shear forces greatly increase more than 70%, while the coefficients related to axial forces only increase less than 2%. Therefore, along with the other two inherent mechanical properties of member structures, it is essential to include the effects of the joint zones. Finally, the results by the finite element models where the chord members and the joint zones are simulated by four methods are compared, which proves the efficiency and the accuracy of the varied section beam element."

Two Titanium-oxo-Clusters with Malonate and Succinate Ligands: Single-Crystal Structures and Catalytic Property,"Two alkane dicarboxylates substituted titanium-oxo-clusters, Ti6O3(OOCCH2COO)2(OiPr)14 (1) and Ti6O3(OOCC2H4COO)2(OiPr)14 (2), were successfully prepared by one step in situ solvothermal synthesis. The compounds are the first examples of only flexible alkane dicarboxylate-substituted titanium-oxo-clusters. The structures of the compounds are best described as two trinuclear oxo-Ti3 subunits linked by a μ
2-O bridge and two malonate or succinate ligands, forming Ti6 clusters. A photochromic effect was observed upon irradiating the crystals, and the color of the crystals was changed from transparent to gray. Photodegradation of the methyl orange in aqueous dispersions of microcrystals of compounds 1 and 2 were carried out under UV cut white light with the assistance of H2O2. Compound 2 exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than 1, which might be related to the smaller angles of μ
2-O bridge in 2."
"Wind erosion occurrence probabilities maps in the watershed of the Ningxia–Inner Mongolia reach of the Yellow River, China","The watershed of the Ningxia–Inner Mongolia reach of the Yellow River suffers serious wind erosion hazards and the areas with high wind erosion probabilities need to be identified to help in the building of the correct wind-sand blown hazard protection systems. In this study, the Integrated Wind-Erosion Modelling System model and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data set were used to identify the distributions of threshold wind speeds and wind erosion occurrence probabilities. Through field observations, the relationships among NDVI, vegetation cover, frontal area (lateral cover), roughness length, and threshold friction velocity were obtained. Then, using these relationships, the spatial distributions of threshold wind speeds for wind erosion at a height of 10 m for the different months were mapped. The results show that the threshold wind speed ranged from 7.91 to 35.7 m/s. Based on the threshold wind speed distributions, the wind erosion occurrence probabilities of different months were calculated according to the current wind speed. The results show that the distributions of wind erosion occurrence probabilities and threshold wind speeds were related to each other. The resulting maps of threshold wind speeds and wind erosion occurrence probabilities would help environmental and agricultural researchers in determining some strategies for mitigating or adapting from wind erosion hazards."
"Long-term TNT and DNT contamination: 1-D modeling of natural attenuation in the vadose zone: case study, Portugal","The vadose zone of a trinitrotoluene (TNT) and dinitrotoluene (DNT) contaminated site was investigated to assess the mobility of those explosives under natural conditions. Located in the left margin of the River Tejo Basin, Portugal, the site is located on unconsolidated sediments. Wastewaters associated with the 50-year explosives production were disposed in excavated ponds, from where water would infiltrate and pollute the unsaturated and saturated parts of the local aquifers. Two boreholes were drilled to 9 m depth in such a former waste pond to investigate the contaminant’s fate in the vadose zone. Sediment samples were taken every 1–2 m for analysis of the poly-nitroaromatics (p-NACs) and organic volatile compounds, pH, organic carbon content, cation exchange capacity and grain size analysis. The main contaminant was TNT representing >70 % of the total p-NACs concentration that peaked approximately 7 mg/kg in one borehole, even if the median in both boreholes was of ~1 mg/kg. DNT was 4–30 % of the total p-NACs and nitrotoluene (NT), up to 5 %. No other (volatile) organic compound was detected. The predominance of TNT as the main contaminant implies that any natural mass reduction has been inefficient to clean the site. Several 1-D model simulations of p-NACs cleaning of the vadose zone under natural conditions indicated that the most probable scenario of combined advection and partitioning will only remove TNT after 10’s of years, whereas DNT and NT will hardly be removed. Such low concentrations and long times for the p-NACs removal, suggest that by now those compounds have been washed-out to a level below standard limits."
Recurrent activating mutations of CD28 in peripheral T-cell lymphomas,"Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) comprise a heterogeneous group of mature T-cell neoplasms with a poor prognosis. Recently, mutations in TET2 and other epigenetic modifiers as well as RHOA have been identified in these diseases, particularly in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). CD28 is the major co-stimulatory receptor in T cells which, upon binding ligand, induces sustained T-cell proliferation and cytokine production when combined with T-cell receptor stimulation. We have identified recurrent mutations in CD28 in PTCLs. Two residues—D124 and T195—were recurrently mutated in 11.3% of cases of AITL and in one case of PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS). Surface plasmon resonance analysis of mutations at these residues with predicted differential partner interactions showed increased affinity for ligand CD86 (residue D124) and increased affinity for intracellular adaptor proteins GRB2 and GADS/GRAP2 (residue T195). Molecular modeling studies on each of these mutations suggested how these mutants result in increased affinities. We found increased transcription of the CD28-responsive genes CD226 and TNFA in cells expressing the T195P mutant in response to CD3 and CD86 co-stimulation and increased downstream activation of NF-κB by both D124V and T195P mutants, suggesting a potential therapeutic target in CD28-mutated PTCLs."
"Evaluation of the orofacial antinociceptive profile of the ethyl acetate fraction and its major constituent, rosmarinic acid, from the leaves of Hyptis pectinata on rodents","Hyptis pectinata (L.) Poit, Lamiaceae, popularly known as “sambacaitá, ” is an aromatic shrub largely grown in the Brazilian northeastern. We investigated the antinociceptive effects of the ethyl acetate fraction obtained from the leaves of H. pectinata and of its main constituent rosmarinic acid, on formalin (2%)-, glutamate (25 μM)- and capsaicin (2.5 (μg)-induced orofacial nociception in rodents. Male mice were pretreated with ethyl acetate fraction (100, 200 or 400mg/kg, p.o.), rosmarinic acid (10 or 20mg/kg, p.o.), morphine (5mg/kg, i.p.), or vehicle (distilled water + 0.2% Tween 80). Ethyl acetate fraction reduced the nociceptive face-rubbing behavior during the two phase of the formalin test, whereas pretreatment with rosmarinic acid decreased the pain behavior in the second phase. Ethyl acetate fraction produced significant antinociceptive effects in the capsaicin and glutamate tests. This study showed that oral administration of ethyl acetate fraction produced potent antinociceptive effects compared to treatment with rosmarinic acid."
Simultaneous determination of epicatechin and procyanidin A2 markers in Litchi chinensis leaves by high-performance liquid chromatography,"The fruits of Litchi chinensis Sonn., Sapindaceae, are renowned for their biological activities. However, their leaves are poorly explored, although they represent an important source of vegetable raw material with biological properties as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive. An HPLC method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of epicatechin and procyanidin A2 in the leaf hydroethanolic extract of I. chinensis. The markers and other unidentified components were separated on a Luna Phenomenex C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 (im) with mobile phase composed of acetonitrile: water pH 3.0 (with sulfuric acid), in a gradient run; at 1.0mlmin-1, 30°C and 278nm for detection. The method was linear over an epicatechin and procyanidin A2 concentration range of 10-100 (μgml-1. The Limit of Quantification for epicatechin and procyanidin A2 were 1.7 and 2 jig ml-1, respectively. The Relative Standard Deviation (%) values for markers (intra- and inter-day precision studies) were <4.0% and the accuracy was 100 ± 5%. The method was applied to ten samples collected in the state of Santa Catarina (Brazil), which showed 14.8–44.5 and 44.8–69.6 mg g-1 of epicatechin and procyanidin A2, respectively. The proposed method could be a valuable tool for quality assessment of I. chinenis leaves as well as their herbal derivatives."
Comparative HPTLC analysis of bioactive marker barbaloin from in vitro and naturally grown Aloe vera,"Aloe vera (L.) Burm. f., Xanthorrhoeaceae, a succulent, produces barbaloin, a bioactive compounds used in various pharmaceutical products. Extracts prepared from the leaves have been widely used as bittering agents, taste modifiers and also as cathartic agent against severe constipation. Barbaloin is reported for its anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiviral and anticancer activities and these properties are mostly mediated by its antioxidative capacity. Presently, a study has been conducted on the comparative High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography analysis of barbaloin from the dried leaf skin powder of in vivo and in vitro grown A vera. Shoot tips of A vera were cultured in Murashige and Skoog media supplemented with different combination of 6-benzylaminopurine and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid. [Best multiplication response was noted in benzylaminopurine (2.0 mg/l) +1 -naphthaleneacetic acid (0.1 mg/l) supplemented Murashige and Skoog media]. The quantitative determination of barbaloin was performed on silica gel 60 F254 HPTLC plates as stationary phase. The linear ascending development was carried out in a twin trough glass chamber saturated with a mobile phase consisting of ethyl acetate: methanol: water ( 100:16.5:13.5) at room temperature (22±2°C). CAMAG Thin Layer Chromatography scanner-3 equipped with CATS software (version: 1.4.4.6337) was used for spectrodensitometric scanning and analysis in the ultraviolet region at X = 366 nm. The method was validated for linearity, precision and accuracy. Correlation coefficient, limit of detection, limit of quantification as well as recovery values were found to be satisfactory. Out of the five populations studied, the leaf skin of A vera collected from Jodhpur (Rajasthan, India) and raised in vitro was found to contain higher amount of barbaloin (2.78%) when compared to its naturally growing counterparts (2.46%) and other plant populations."
Microscopic and UV/Vis spectrophotometric characterization of Cissampelos pareira of Brazil and Africa,"Cissampelos pareira L., belonging to Menispermaceae family, has worldwide distribution, occurring in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa and Asia. It is the most popular species of Cissampelos, known for its medicinal uses of leaves and roots. The study aims to find distinctive leaf anatomical characters, and also demonstrate the importance of spectral data to identify C. pareira samples, in order to contribute to its taxonomy and quality control of its drugs. Anatomical leaf analyses were performed by optical and scanning electron microscopy. The spectral profile was obtained from methanolic extracts of C. pareira samples from Brazil and Africa, with application of UV-vis spectrophotometry data, which were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA). Some anatomical characters such as leaf epidermal cells walls, stornata, trichomes, mesophyll, features of midrib and petiole, and the spectral profile within the wavelength ranging between 770 and 240 nm (eight bands) differs between Brazilian and African samples. The results represent an additional support to the taxonomy of C. pareira, and the quality control of their leaf drugs, mainly in relation to misidentified samples."
Hypolipidemic and antiatherogenic effects of Cynara scolymus in cholesterol-fed rats,"Cynara scolymus L., Asteraceae, are traditionally used to treat dyspepsia. This study evaluated the hypolipidemic and antiatherogenic effects of an aqueous extract prepared from the leaves of C. scolymus in rat’s model. Hypercholesterolemic rats (1% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid for 15 days) were treated (0.5ml/200g) with extract of C. scolymus (150, 300, or 600mg/kg p.o.; n = 6) or simvastatin (4 mg/kg p.o.; n = 6) once per day for 30 days along with hypercaloric diet. A control group ( C) was given water (0.5 ml/200 g; n = 6). A high-cholesterol diet was maintained throughout the treatment period. Rats treated with extract of C scolymus (150, 300, or 600 mg/kg) and simvastatin showed significant decreases in serum levels of total cholesterol (-46.9%, -51.9%, -44%, and -41.9%, respectively) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C; -52.1%, -54.8%, -51.9%, and -46.7%, respectively), compared with group C (p < 0.005). Biochemical analyses revealed significant decrease in the concentration of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-7, C-reactive protein, oxidized-LDL, and antioxidized-LDL in rats treated with extract of C. scolymus (150, 300, or 600 mg/kg). There were no differences in serum ALT enzyme activity between the groups. Our results suggest that hypolipidemic and antiatherogenic effects could be related with the presence of polar substances present in aqueous extract of C. scolymus."
Fragmenting global business processes: A protection for proprietary information,"This study shows that, when sourcing business services in foreign countries, the fragmentation of processes across production units acts as an operational-level adjustment variable for firms to adapt their information protection approach to the regulative environment of the host country they have selected and to the possibility to use internal controls over the activities performed abroad. We hypothesize that, when the above mechanisms are not available, firms are more likely to fragment processes across multiple foreign production units instead of collocating all process tasks in the same unit. Thanks to IT-enabled integration capabilities, firms can exploit the complementarities between the dispersed fragments of a process while reducing the misappropriation hazard of individual fragments. Empirical results and robustness tests are strongly congruent with these hypotheses. We find also that the propensity to turn to the process fragmentation protection mechanism increases with firm host-country-specific experience and with the alternative value of the proprietary information involved in the activity sourced abroad."
Production of 3-Oxo-2-(2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic Acid in the Fungus Aspergillus oryzae: A Step Towards Heterologous Production of Pyrethrins in Fungi,"Pyrethrins are natural insecticides, which accumulate to high concentrations in pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium) flowers. Synthetic pyrethroids are more stable, more efficacious and cheaper, but contemporary requirements for safe and environmentally friendly pesticides encourage a return to the use of natural pyrethrins, and this would be favoured by development of an efficient route to their production by microbial fermentation. The biosynthesis of pyrethrins involves ester linkage between an acid moiety (chrysanthemoyl or pyrethroyl, synthesised via the mevalonic acid pathway from glucose), and an alcohol (pyrethrolone). Pyrethrolone is generated from 3-oxo-2-(2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid, which originates from α-linolenic acid via the jasmonic acid biosynthetic cascade. The first four genes in this cascade, encoding lipoxygenase 2, allene-oxide synthase, allene-oxide cyclase 2 and 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase 3, were amplified from an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library, cloned in a purpose-built fungal multigene expression vector and expressed in Aspergillus oryzae. HPLC–MS analysis of the transgenic fungus homogenate gave good evidence for the presence of 3-oxo-2-(2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid."
An Effective Deuterium Exchange Method for Neutron Crystal Structure Analysis with Unfolding–Refolding Processes,"A method of hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange with an unfolding–refolding process has been applied to hen egg-white lysozyme (HWL), and accurate evaluation of its deuteration was carried out by time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. Neutron crystallography requires a suitable crystal with enough deuterium exchanged in the protein to decrease incoherent scattering from hydrogens. It is very expensive to prepare a fully deuterated protein, and therefore a simple H/D exchange technique is desirable for this purpose. Acid or base addition to protein solutions with heating effectively increased the number of deuterium up to more than 20 % of that of all hydrogen atoms, and refolded structures were determined by X-ray structure analysis at 1.8 Å resolution. Refolded HWL had increased deuterium content in its protein core and its native structure, determined at atomic resolution, was fully preserved."
Generation of regulatory dendritic cells after treatment with paeoniflorin,"Regulatory dendritic cells are a potential therapeutic tool for assessing a variety of immune overreaction diseases. Paeoniflorin, a bioactive glucoside extracted from the Chinese herb white paeony root, has been shown to be effective at inhibiting the maturation and immunostimulatory function of murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. However, whether paeoniflorin can program conventional dendritic cells toward regulatory dendritic cells and the underlying mechanism remain unknown. Here, our study demonstrates that paeoniflorin can induce the production of regulatory dendritic cells from human peripheral blood monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells in the absence or presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but not from mature dendritic cells, thereby demonstrating the potential of paeoniflorin as a specific immunosuppressive drug with fewer complications and side effects. These regulatory dendritic cells treated with paeoniflorin exhibited high CD11b/c and low CD80, CD86 and CD40 expression levels as well as enhanced abilities to capture antigen and promote the proliferation of CD4+CD25+ T cells and reduced abilities to migrate and promote the proliferation of CD4+ T cells, which is associated with the upregulation of endogenous transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-mediated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression. Collectively, paeoniflorin could program immature dendritic cells (imDCs) and imDCs stimulated with LPS toward a regulatory DC fate by upregulating the endogenous TGF-β-mediated IDO expression level, thereby demonstrating its potential as a specific immunosuppressive drug."
Experimental study of a momentum-based method for identifying the inertia barycentric parameters of a human body,"Physical modeling, simulation and analysis of an individual human body require inertia properties of the body segments of the human. Such subject-specific inertia data can be obtained only by measuring the individual human body as opposed to be derived from statistically generated anthropometric database. This paper presents experimental validation of a momentum-based approach for identifying the barycentric parameters of an individual human body which fully describes the inertia properties of the human. The identification algorithm is derived from the impulse–momentum equations of the human body which is assumed to be a multibody system with tree-type topology. Since the impulse–momentum equations are linear in terms of the unknown barycentric parameters, these parameters can be solved from the equations using a least-squares method. The approach does not require measuring or estimating accelerations and joint forces/torques because they do not appear in the impulse–momentum equations, and thus, the resulting identification procedure is less demanding on measurement data than the methods derived from the equations of motion. In this paper the test results of the identification method are validated by comparing the identified inertia parameters against the statistically established anthropometric data. Additionally, the identification results are also confirmed by comparing the contact forces using inverse dynamics to those obtained by forces plates."
Visuospatial Working Memory Capacity Predicts Physiological Arousal in a Narrative Task,"Physiological arousal that occurs during narrative production is thought to reflect emotional processing and cognitive effort (Bar-Haim et al. in Dev Psychobiol 44:238–249, 2004). The purpose of this study was to determine whether individual differences in visuospatial working memory and/or verbal working memory capacity predict physiological arousal in a narrative task. Visuospatial working memory was a significant predictor of skin conductance level (SCL); verbal working memory was not. When visuospatial working memory interference was imposed, visuospatial working memory was no longer a significant predictor of SCL. Visuospatial interference also resulted in a significant reduction in SCL. Furthermore, listener ratings of narrative quality were contingent upon the visuospatial working memory resources of the narrator. Potential implications for educators and clinical practitioners are discussed."
Equal Improvement in Men and Women in the Treatment of Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome Using a Multi-modal Protocol with an Internal Myofascial Trigger Point Wand,"Both men and women require treatment for urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS), which includes interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, pelvic floor dysfunction, and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome. However, it is unknown if men and women respond differently to a protocol that includes specific physical therapy self-treatment using an internal trigger point wand and training in paradoxical relaxation. We performed a retrospective analysis by gender in a single arm, open label, single center clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a protocol for the treatment of UCPPS from October, 2008 to May, 2011. 314 adult men (79.9 %) and 79 (20.1 %) women met inclusion criteria. The median duration of symptoms was 60 months. The protocol required an initial 6-day clinic for training followed by a 6-month self-treatment period. The treatment included self-administered pelvic floor trigger point release with an internal trigger point device for physical therapy along with paradoxical relaxation training. Notable gender differences in prior treatments were observed. Men had a lower median [Interquartile Range] NIH-CPSI score at baseline than women (27 [21, 31] vs. 29 [22, 33], p = 0.04). Using a 1–10 scale with 10 = Most Severe, the median reduction in trigger point sensitivity was 3 units for both men and women after 6 months therapy (p = 0.74). A modified Intention to Treat analysis and a multivariate regression analysis found similar results. We conclude that men and women have similar, significant reductions in trigger point sensitivity with this protocol."
Estimating Green Net National Product for Puerto Rico: An Economic Measure of Sustainability,"This paper presents the data sources and methodology used to estimate Green Net National Product (GNNP), an economic metric of sustainability, for Puerto Rico. Using the change in GNNP as a one-sided test of weak sustainability (i.e., positive growth in GNNP is not enough to show the economy is sustainable), we measure the movement away from sustainability by examining the change in GNNP from 1993 to 2009. In order to calculate GNNP, we require both economic and natural capital data, but limited data for Puerto Rico require a number of simplifying assumptions. Based on the environmental challenges faced by Puerto Rico, we include damages from air emissions and solid waste, the storm protection value of mangroves and the value of extracting crushed stone as components in the depreciation of natural capital. Our estimate of GNNP also includes the value of time, which captures the effects of technological progress. The results show that GNNP had an increasing trend over the 17 years studied with two periods of negative growth (2004–2006 and 2007–2008). Our additional analysis suggests that the negative growth in 2004–2006 was possibly due to a temporary economic downturn. However, the negative growth in 2007–2008 was likely from the decline in the value of time, suggesting the island of Puerto Rico was moving away from sustainability during this time."
Analysis of pediatric airway morphology using statistical shape modeling,"Traditional studies of airway morphology typically focus on individual measurements or relatively simple lumped summary statistics. The purpose of this work was to use statistical shape modeling (SSM) to synthesize a skeleton model of the large bronchi of the pediatric airway tree and to test for overall airway shape differences between two populations. Airway tree anatomy was segmented from volumetric chest computed tomography of 20 control subjects and 20 subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF). Airway centerlines, particularly bifurcation points, provide landmarks for SSM. Multivariate linear and logistic regression was used to examine the relationships between airway shape variation, subject size, and disease state. Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to test the ability to detect shape differences between control and CF groups. Simulation experiments, using tree shapes with known size and shape variations, were performed as a technical validation. Models were successfully created using SSM methods. Simulations demonstrated that the analysis process can detect shape differences between groups. In clinical data, CF status was discriminated with good accuracy (precision = 0.7, recall = 0.7) in leave-one-out cross-validation. Logistic regression modeling using all subjects showed a good fit (ROC AUC = 0.85) and revealed significant differences in SSM parameters between control and CF groups. The largest mode of shape variation was highly correlated with subject size (R = 0.95, p < 0.001). SSM methodology can be applied to identify shape differences in the airway between two populations. This method suggests that subtle shape differences exist between the CF airway and disease control."
Effects of sensory augmentation on postural control and gait symmetry of transfemoral amputees: a case description,"Despite recent advances in leg prosthetics, transfemoral amputees still experience limitations in postural control and gait symmetry. It has been hypothesized that artificial sensory information might improve the integration of the prosthesis into the human sensory-motor control loops and, thus, reduce these limitations. In three transfemoral amputees, we investigated the effect of Electrotactile Moving Sensation for Sensory Augmentation (EMSSA) without training and present preliminary findings. Experimental conditions included standing with open/closed eyes on stable/unstable ground as well as treadmill walking. For standing conditions, spatiotemporal posturographic measures and sample entropy were derived from the center of pressure. For walking conditions, step length and stance duration were calculated. Conditions without feedback showed effects congruent with findings in the literature, e.g., asymmetric weight bearing and step length, and validated the collected data. During standing, with EMSSA a tendency to influence postural control in a negative way was found: Postural control was less effective and less efficient and the prosthetic leg was less involved. Sample entropy tended to decrease, suggesting that EMSSA demanded increased attention. During walking, with EMSSA no persistent positive effect was found. This contrasts the positive subjective assessment and the positive effect on one subject’s step length."
Fluctuation results for Hastings–Levitov planar growth,"We study the fluctuations of the outer domain of Hastings–Levitov clusters in the small particle limit. These are shown to be given by a continuous Gaussian process \(\mathcal {F}\) taking values in the space of holomorphic functions on \(\{ |z|>1 \}\), of which we provide an explicit construction. The boundary values \(\mathcal {W}\) of \(\mathcal {F}\) are shown to perform an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process on the space of distributions on the unit circle \(\mathbb {T}\), which can be described as the solution to the stochastic fractional heat equation"
Altered resonance properties of somatosensory responses in mice deficient for the schizophrenia risk gene Neuregulin 1,"To reveal the neuronal underpinnings of sensory processing deficits in patients with schizophrenia, previous studies have investigated brain activity in response to sustained sensory stimulation at various frequencies. This paradigm evoked neural activity at the stimulation frequency and harmonics thereof. During visual and auditory stimulation that elicited enhanced or ‘resonant’ responses in healthy controls, patients with schizophrenia displayed reduced activity. The present study sought to elucidate the cellular basis of disease-related deficits in sensory resonance properties using mice heterozygous for the schizophrenia susceptibility gene Neuregulin 1 (NRG1). We applied repetitive whisker stimulation at 1–15 Hz, a range relevant to whisking behavior in mice, and measured cellular activity in the primary somatosensory cortex. At frequencies where control mice displayed enhancements in measures of response magnitude and precision, NRG1 (+/−) mutants showed reductions. Our results demonstrate for the first time a link between a mutation of a schizophrenia risk gene and altered neuronal resonance properties in sensory cortex."
\({\mathcal A}\)-compact mappings,"For a fixed Banach operator ideal \({\mathcal A}\), we use the notion of \({\mathcal A}\)-compact sets of Carl and Stephani to study \({\mathcal A}\)-compact polynomials and \({\mathcal A}\)-compact holomorphic mappings. Namely, those mappings \(g:X\rightarrow Y\) such that every \(x \in X\) has a neighborhood \(V_x\) such that \(g(V_x)\) is relatively \({\mathcal A}\)-compact. We show that the behavior of \({\mathcal A}\)-compact polynomials is determined by its behavior in any neighborhood of any point. We transfer some known properties of \({\mathcal A}\)-compact operators to \({\mathcal A}\)-compact polynomials. In order to study \({\mathcal A}\)-compact holomorphic functions, we appeal to the \({\mathcal A}\)-compact radius of convergence which allows us to characterize the functions in this class. Under certain hypothesis on the ideal \({\mathcal A}\), we give examples showing that our characterization is sharp."
Genetic distance revealed by genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms and their relationships with harvest index heterotic traits in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.),"Identifying and using heterotic loci in breeding programs is crucial for increasing crop yield. In this study, we planted 68 inbred lines and their 132 testcrosses at Wuhan and Xiangyang, China. We performed a phenotypic analysis of nine yield-related traits, including plant height, main inflorescence length, branch number, seeds per silique, effective silique number on the main inflorescence, thousand seed weight, biomass yield per plant, seed yield per plant, and harvest index (HI). Additionally, the mid-parent heterosis (MPH) and better-parent heterosis (BPH) for each trait were evaluated. The genetic distance (GD) calculated using high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed no correlation with HI heterosis, and the difference in GD in the two groups (H-154 and H-155) was not correlated with the difference in HI heterosis levels. The MPH and BPH of HI were significantly correlated with the MPH and BPH of biomass yield per plant, but not with the other traits. Our results indicate that yield-related traits heterosis, including HI heterosis, are extremely complex. The effectiveness of predicting heteroses with GD based on SNPs may be limited, though the SNPs can be used to instead of older markers for high-throughput and accurate genotyping. Our findings may contribute a better understanding to rapeseed breeding and the natural variations of HI heterosis."
International stock return predictability: Is the role of U.S. time-varying?,"This study investigates the predictability of 11 industrialized stock returns with emphasis on the role of U.S. returns. Using monthly data spanning 1980:2–2014:12, we show that there exist multiple structural breaks and nonlinearities in the data. Therefore, we employ methods that are capable of accounting for these and at the same time date stamping the periods of causal relationship between the U.S. returns and those of the other countries. First we implement a subsample analysis which relies on the set of models, data set and sample range as in Rapach et al. (J Finance LXVIII(4):1633–1662, 2013). Our results show that while the U.S. returns played a strong predictive role based on the OLS pairwise Granger causality predictive regression and news-diffusion models, its role based on the adaptive elastic net model is weak. Second, we implement our preferred model: a bootstrap rolling window approach using our newly updated data on stock returns for each countries, and find that U.S. stock return has significant predictive ability for all the countries at certain sub-periods. Given these results, it would be misleading to rely on results based on constant-parameter linear models that assume that the relationship between the U.S. returns and those of other industrialized countries are permanent, since the relationship is, in fact, time-varying, and holds only at specific periods."
"Functional characterization of the corazonin-encoding gene in phase polyphenism of the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria (Orthoptera: Acrididae)","Locusts exhibit phase polyphenism in which phase transition between the solitarious (isolation-reared) and gregarious (crowd-reared) phenotypes occurs in response to crowding conditions. Phase transformation from solitarious to gregarious nymphs is accompanied by darkening of the body color and changes in classical morphometric ratios such as F/C (F hind femur length; C maximum head width). These changes occur in the absence of crowding if solitarious locusts are injected with the neuropeptide, corazonin (Crz). This study investigated the effects of the knockdown of the CRZ gene on body color and morphometric characteristics in the migratory locust Locusta migratoria (L.) (Orthoptera: Acrididae). An injection of dsRNA for Crz significantly reduced CRZ mRNA levels and reduced the intensity of darkening on the pronotum in nymphs. The silencing of CRZ expression in gregarious nymphs shifted the F/C toward a value typical of the solitarious form in the adult stage. However, the expression profiles of CRZ were similar between the gregarious and solitarious nymphs. Therefore, we conclude that Crz is responsible for phase-dependent changes in darkening and the morphometric ratio; however, these changes are not controlled through differential CRZ expression at the transcriptional level."
Value of intelligence applied to networks,"A methodology is proposed to complement the subjective “value” of intelligence with an objective metric of “impact” of information on network models. This is a deterministic one-way sensitivity analysis similar to value of information used in inference diagrams. It would measure the impact of a piece of information on a network’s metric, in this case being used to answer intelligence analyst questions. This methodology suggests that the sensitivity of each link to existing analysis implies that the link has an impact on the analysis. The impact of these links can be measured quantitatively. In this paper, we explore data of tweets and apply the methodology to the links between twitter users and use the network measure of betweenness centrality to determine their quantitative impact on the overall network."
Social Capital Accessibility of Intermarrieds,"Grounded in Bourdieu’s social capital theory, the study’s purpose was to investigate social capital accessibility of intermarrieds compared to intramarrieds. Using the 2001 Integrated Health Interview Series data, two generalized linear models with Poisson distribution and identity link were performed: Model 1 compared intermarrieds to intramarrieds; Model 2 compared specific types of intermarrieds to intramarrrieds. Model 1 indicated that intermarrieds had less accessibility to social capital than intramarrieds. Model 2 indicated that intermarrieds, particularly interracially marrieds, had less social capital accessibility than intramarrieds, although the influence was moderate. Social capital accessibility of the interethnically or internationally marrieds was not significantly different from that of intramarrieds. Findings provide partial support to previous research concerning a lack of social capital accessibility for intermarrieds."
Adjustment Strategy Use in Minority Family Businesses: Differences Across Gender,"The objectives of this study were to explore the adjustment strategies employed by minority female owners of small family firms and to compare their use of adjustment strategies with those of their male counterparts. There were significant gender differences in the adoption of adjustment strategies among minority-owned family firms. The major findings of this study suggest that minority female business owners were more likely to reallocate family resources to help with business tasks and were more likely to intertwine both tasks than minority male business owners when demands were particularly great for the family or the firm. In addition, compared to male business owners, a relatively higher proportion of female business owners used volunteer help without pay during hectic times. Implications for business consultants and educators working with minority business owners are discussed."
Effects of alien invasion by Bombus terrestris L. (Apidae) on the visitation patterns of native bumblebees in coastal plants in northern Japan,"When alien pollinator species enter a native community of pollinators in which resource partitioning has been established, the pollination network between plants and pollinators may be modified through the interactions between the pollinators over the use of floral resources. We observed the floral-use patterns of native (Bombus hypocrita and B. deuteronymus) and alien (B. terrestris) bumblebee species in a coastal grassland in northern Japan. We analyzed the factors determining resource partitioning patterns. B. hypocrita tended to visit flowers with shallow or wide open corollas, such as Rosa rugosa, whereas B. deuteronymus visited flowers with complex or deeper corollas, such as Lathyrus japonicus. Given the wider floral preference of B. terrestris, floral use by the alien bumblebees consistently overlapped with that of native bumblebees. The visitation of B. terrestris to R. rugosa flowers was positively correlated with that of B. hypocrita. These bumblebee species frequently used similar floral resources, in part because of the large overlap in the seasonality of their foraging activity. The visitation frequency of B. deuteronymus to L. japonicus flowers was independent of the visitation frequency of other bumblebee species. The major visitation periods of the bumblebees to L. japonicus flowers reciprocally differed between B. deuteronymus and B. terrestris, suggesting phenological resource partitioning between these species. Our study suggests that phenological niche partitioning is more common in specialized flowers (L. japonicus) than in generalized flowers (R. rugosa)."
A Structural Molar Volume Model for Oxide Melts Part II: Li2O-Na2O-K2O-MgO-CaO-MnO-PbO-Al2O3-SiO2 Melts—Ternary and Multicomponent Systems,"A structural molar volume model based on the silicate tetrahedral Q-species has been developed to accurately predict the molar volume of molten oxides. In this study, the molar volumes of ternary and multicomponent melts in the Li2O-Na2O-K2O-MgO-CaO-MnO-PbO-Al2O3-SiO2 system are reviewed and compared with the predicted molar volumes from the newly developed structural model. The model can accurately predict the molar volumes using binary model parameters without any ternary or multicomponent parameters. The nonlinear behavior in the molar volume of silicate melts is well predicted by the present model."
Three-source partitioning of soil respiration by 13C natural abundance and its variation with soil depth in a plantation,"Partitioning soil respiration into three components is vital to identify CO2 sink or source and can help us better understand soil carbon dynamics. However, knowledge about the influences of soil depth and the priming effect on soil respiration components under field has been limited. Three components of soil respiration (root respiration, rhizomicrobial respiration and basal respiration) in a plantation in the hilly area of the North China were separated by the 13C natural abundance method. The results showed that the average proportions of rhizomicrobial respiration, root respiration and basal respiration at the 25–65 cm depths were about 14, 23 and 63 %, respectively. Three components of soil respiration varied with soil depth, and root respiration was the main component of soil respiration in deeper soil. The priming effect was obvious for the deep soil respiration, especially at the 40–50 cm depth. Thus, depth and priming effect should be taken into account to increase the accuracy of estimations of soil carbon flux."
Synthesis of uniform WS2 nanoflowers via a sodium silicate-assisted hydrothermal process,"The three-dimensional architectures often exhibit good functional properties. In current work, the unique WS2 nanoflowers self-assembled by nanosheets have been successfully synthesized via a novel hydrothermal method with the assistance of sodium silicate. A possible growth mechanism was further proposed in detail. The obtained WS2 nanoflowers showed a very excellent optical absorption properties and holds substantial promise for rendering WS2 as an excellent visible photocatalyst material. Such a synthetic way may open up an avenue to tailor the morphologies of some other transition metal disulfides and enhance their functional performance."
Fabrication of nanoscale step height structure using atomic layer deposition combined with wet etching,"The current techniques used for the fabrication of nanosteps are normally done by layer growth and then ion beam thinning. There are also extra films grown on the step surfaces in order to reduce the roughness. So the whole process is time consuming. In this paper, a nanoscale step height structure is fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and wet etching techniques. According to the traceable of the step height value, the fabrication process is controllable. Because ALD technology can grow a variety of materials, aluminum oxide (Al2O3) is used to fabricate the nanostep. There are three steps of Al2O3 in this structure including 8 nm, 18 nm and 44 nm. The thickness of Al2O3 film and the height of the step are measured by anellipsometer. The experimental results show that the thickness of Al2O3 film is consistent with the height of the step. The height of the step is measured by AFM. The measurement results show that the height is related to the number of cycles of ALD and the wet etching time. The bottom and the sidewall surface roughness are related to the wet etching time. The step height is calibrated by Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and the results were 7.5±1.5 nm, 15.5±2.0 nm and 41.8±2.1 nm, respectively. This research provides a method for the fabrication of step height at nanoscale and the nanostep fabricated is potential used for standard references."
Applications of Advanced Marine Electric and Hybrid Drives,
Exposure and inhaled dose of susceptible population to chemical elements in atmospheric particles,"The objective of this study was to assess the exposure and inhaled dose of susceptible populations to chemical elements in atmospheric particles. Particles were sampled in schools, fitness centers and elderly care centers and k
0-INAA was used to determine their chemical composition. Results show that besides the similar element concentrations measured in the outdoor levels of all micro-environments, the inhaled dose experienced by each one of the vulnerable population groups was significantly different, indicating that measurements of outdoor air concentrations do not provide an accurate estimation of the population exposure to particles and specific elements and of the respective dose."
Microstate connectivity alterations in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease,"Electroencephalography (EEG) microstates and brain network are altered in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and discussed as potential biomarkers for AD. Microstates correspond to defined states of brain activity, and their connectivity patterns may change accordingly. Little is known about alteration of connectivity in microstates, especially in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment with stable or improving cognition within 30 months (aMCI)."
Inadequate fine-tuning of protein synthesis and failure of amino acid homeostasis following inhibition of the ATPase VCP/p97,"The cellular mechanisms that control protein degradation may constitute a non-oncogenic cancer cell vulnerability and, therefore, a therapeutic target. Although this proposition is supported by the clinical success of proteasome inhibitors in some malignancies, most cancers are resistant to proteasome inhibition. The ATPase valosin-containing protein (VCP; p97) is an essential regulator of protein degradation in multiple pathways and has emerged as a target for cancer therapy. We found that pharmacological depletion of VCP enzymatic activity with mechanistically different inhibitors robustly induced proteotoxic stress in solid cancer and multiple myeloma cells, including cells that were insensitive, adapted, or clinically resistant to proteasome inhibition. VCP inhibition had an impact on two key regulators of protein synthesis, eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), and attenuated global protein synthesis. However, a block on protein translation that was itself cytotoxic alleviated stress signaling and reduced cell death triggered by VCP inhibition. Some of the proteotoxic effects of VCP depletion depended on the eIF2α phosphatase, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15A (PPP1R15A)/PP1c, but not on mTORC1, although there appeared to be cross-talk between them. Thus, cancer cell death following VCP inhibition was linked to inadequate fine-tuning of protein synthesis and activity of PPP1R15A/PP1c. VCP inhibitors also perturbed intracellular amino acid levels, activated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α kinase 4 (EIF2AK4), and enhanced cellular dependence on amino acid supplies, consistent with a failure of amino acid homeostasis. Many of the observed effects of VCP inhibition differed from the effects triggered by proteasome inhibition or by protein misfolding. Thus, depletion of VCP enzymatic activity triggers cancer cell death in part through inadequate regulation of protein synthesis and amino acid metabolism. The data provide novel insights into the maintenance of intracellular proteostasis by VCP and may have implications for the development of anti-cancer therapies."
Targeting RING domains of Mdm2–MdmX E3 complex activates apoptotic arm of the p53 pathway in leukemia/lymphoma cells,"Reactivation of tumor-suppressor p53 for targeted cancer therapy is an attractive strategy for cancers bearing wild-type (WT) p53. Targeting the Mdm2–p53 interface or MdmX ((MDM4), mouse double minute 4)–p53 interface or both has been a focus in the field. However, targeting the E3 ligase activity of Mdm2–MdmX really interesting new gene (RING)–RING interaction as a novel anticancer strategy has never been explored. In this report, we describe the identification and characterization of small molecule inhibitors targeting Mdm2–MdmX RING–RING interaction as a new class of E3 ligase inhibitors. With a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based E3 activity assay in high-throughput screening of a chemical library, we identified inhibitors (designated as MMRis (Mdm2–MdmX RING domain inhibitors)) that specifically inhibit Mdm2–MdmX E3 ligase activity toward Mdm2 and p53 substrates. MMRi6 and its analog MMRi64 are capable of disrupting Mdm2–MdmX interactions in vitro and activating p53 in cells. In leukemia cells, MMRi64 potently induces downregulation of Mdm2 and MdmX. In contrast to Nutlin3a, MMRi64 only induces the expression of pro-apoptotic gene PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis) with minimal induction of growth-arresting gene p21. Consequently, MMRi64 selectively induces the apoptotic arm of the p53 pathway in leukemia/lymphoma cells. Owing to the distinct mechanisms of action of MMRi64 and Nutlin3a, their combination synergistically induces p53 and apoptosis. Taken together, this study reveals that Mdm2–MdmX has a critical role in apoptotic response of the p53 pathway and MMRi64 may serve as a new pharmacological tool for p53 studies and a platform for cancer drug development."
Novel heuristics for consolidation of virtual machines in cloud data centers using multi-criteria resource management solutions,"Increasing demand for acquiring diverse range of services has led to the establishment of huge energy hungry cloud data centers all around the world. Cloud providers face with major concerns to reduce their energy consumption while ensuring high quality of service based on the Service Level Agreement (SLA). Consolidation is proposed as one of the most effective techniques for online energy saving in cloud environments with dynamic workloads. This paper proposes novel proactive online resource management policies to optimize energy, SLA, and number of migrations in cloud data centers. More precisely, this paper proposes new prediction algorithm for determination of overloaded hosts as well as novel multi-criteria decision making techniques to select virtual machines. The results of simulations using CloudSim simulator shows up to 98.11 % reduction in the output metric which is representative of energy consumption, SLA violation, and number of migrations, in comparison with state of the art."
Bovine Herpes Virus 1 Major Immediate Early Transcription Unit 1 (IETU-1) Uses Alternative Promoters to Transcribe BICP0 and BICP4 Transcripts,"Immediate early (IE) genes are transcribed immediately after infection in BHV1 from two different immediate early transcription units. It is reported that the immediate early transcription unit I (IE TU1) of Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) transcribes two proteins BICP0 and BICP4 from a single promoter by alternative splicing but with identical 5′UTR. We found that the transcripts of BICP0 and BICP4 have different 5′UTRs. The bioinformatics analysis shows two similar spatially arranged TATA less promoter for the two transcripts. The bioinformatics analysis also showed a similar promoter for the IE TU2 which transcribes BICP22. The data strongly suggest that BICP0 and BICP4 are transcribed from two different promoters. The transcript produced by each promoter is spliced specifically as opposed to what has been reported earlier. The BICP0 and BICP4 also show different levels of expression. The expression level of BICP4 continuously declines after attaining a peak level at 1 h, while BICP0 shows biphasic expression supporting the earlier observation that it is expressed from two different promoters."
A Coxeter-Conway Duality,
Design and implementation of waveguide bandpass filter using complementary metaresonator,"During past few years, designing of complementary metamaterials-based microwave devices have extensively increased. In this paper, passband filter for rectangular waveguide is designed using complementary symmetric split-ring resonator (CSSRR). By varying different geometrical parameters of CSSRR, the passband frequency and bandwidth can be varied. Effect of design parameter on quality factor of filter is also calculated. By appropriate choice of CSSRR geometrical parameters, a filter is proposed which gives passband of 2 GHz. The results are calculated numerically using HFSS 14.0."

Multimodality Imaging Approach towards Primary Aortic Sarcomas Arising after Endovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair: Case Series Report,"Primary aortic neoplasms are rare. Aortic sarcoma arising after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a scarce subset of primary aortic malignancies, reports of which are infrequent in the published literature. The diagnosis of aortic sarcoma is challenging due to its non-specific clinical presentation, and the prognosis is poor due to delayed diagnosis, rapid proliferation, and propensity for metastasis. Post-EVAR, aortic sarcomas may mimic other more common aortic processes on surveillance imaging. Radiologists are rarely knowledgeable about this rare entity for which multimodality imaging and awareness are invaluable in early diagnosis. A series of three pathologically confirmed cases are presented to display the multimodality imaging features and clinical presentations of aortic sarcoma arising after EVAR."
"Biogenic synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of silver nanoparticles using leaf extract of Indoneesiella echioides: in vitro assessment on antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxicity potential","Natural synthesis of metal nanoparticles is gaining more attention in recent years. This article demonstrates the phytochemical synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by using Indoneesiella echioides (L) leaf extract as a reducing and stabilizing agent. Biosynthesis of AgNPs was monitored by UV–visible spectroscopy which revealed intense surface plasmon resonance bands at 420 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction were employed to identify various functional groups and crystalline nature of AgNPs. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy studies demonstrated that synthesized particles were spherical with average size of ~29 nm. In vitro antioxidant effects were analyzed by 2,2′-Azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), which exhibited 69 and 71 % of scavenging activity, respectively. The antimicrobial activity of green AgNPs displayed better zone of inhibition against selected human pathogens. The present study also investigated the toxicity effect of biogenic AgNPs against human lung adenocarcinoma cancer cells (A549) and normal human epithelial cells (HBL-100) in vitro, and the inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were found to be 30 and 60 µg/mL, respectively. Herein, we propose a previously unexplored medicinal plant for the biological synthesis of AgNPs with potent biomedical applications."
Spleen and splenic vessel preserving distal pancreatectomy for bifocal PNET in a young patient with MEN1,"MEN1 patients requiring resection of neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) are frequently young, active patients in whom a minimal access approach minimizes perioperative morbidity and splenic preservation decreases the risk of post-splenectomy sepsis. Laparoscopic spleen preserving distal pancreatectomy can be performed with removal (Warshaw’s technique) or preservation of the splenic vessels, the later having a higher rate of successful splenic preservation."
Modeling diffusion of sulfate through concrete using mixture theory,"Concrete exposed to sulfates deteriorates. Here, an attempt is made to see whether the framework of mixture theory can be used to model the changes that occur in concrete exposed to sodium sulfate. Toward this, diffusion and reaction of sulfates with concrete is modeled within the framework of mixture theory. Appropriate choices are made for the Helmholtz free energy and interaction momentum so that the process of diffusion of sulfates in concrete can be captured. As expected in mixture theory, diffusion causes deformation of the solid. The parameters in the mixture theory model are determined by comparing the steady-state concentration profile of the diffusing sodium sulfate solution and inlet velocity of the fluid with that of Fick’s solution for the same boundary conditions. An assumption is made for the mass production term to capture the reaction of sulfates with concrete. The rate constant and order of the reaction are estimated using the concentration of gypsum, calcium hydroxide and ettringite reported in the literature, for various duration of exposure of cement pastes to known concentration of sodium sulfate solution. Finally, the governing equations for the combined problem of steady-state diffusion and reaction of sulfates with concrete are presented. A numerical scheme to solve the governing equations is outlined. Long-term concentration profiles of sodium sulfate predicted by the framework agree qualitatively with the experimentally observed profile reported in the literature."
Understanding intra and inter-archipelago population genetic patterns within a recently evolved insular endemic lineage,"The recently evolved genus Tolpis Adans. has its major center of diversity located in Macaronesia. Although recent advances have been made to understand the relationships of Tolpis species within Macaronesia, little is still known about the genetic patterns and genetic diversity of the Azorean and Madeiran Tolpis populations. To achieve this, a set of 8 microsatellite loci (SSR) was applied to 478 individuals of Tolpis azorica and T. succulenta. Genetic structure analysis, in addition to a spatial analysis, confirmed the existence of geographically circumscribed genetic patterns allied to a barrier effect by the sea in the Azorean T. azorica and T. succulenta. A detailed analysis of T. azorica revealed three different genetic groups, each group being particular to a different Azorean sub-archipelago, while the analysis conducted with T. succulenta confirmed the occurrence of a differential grouping between individuals from Azores and Madeira populations. The impact of catastrophic volcanic events and intense humanization of the habitats is discussed, in view of the present genetic diversity and structure of the species. In general, T. azorica populations showed high F
is values and some populations of T. succulenta both in Azores and in Madeira also showed signs of putative inbreeding. Conservation actions such as the eradication of invasive plant and animal species are advised but translocations of plants or diaspores between islands or between populations of a same island should not be attempted."
"Gobius salamansa, a new species of goby (Gobiidae) from the Cape Verde Islands supported by a unique cephalic lateral line system and DNA barcoding","Gobius salamansa sp. nov., a new species of tropical eastern Atlantic goby (Teleostei: Gobiidae: Gobiinae) is described from the island of São Vicente in the Republic of Cabo Verde. With adults measuring less than 35 mm TL (total length) it is the smallest species among Gobius. It is easily distinguishable from its Atlantico-Mediterranean congeners thanks to a unique character: an additional posterior ocular head pore, newly named α’, part of the anterior oculoscapular canal and connected to pore α by a suborbital branch. The new species also possesses a rare character among gobiids: a continuous oculoscapular canal, undivided into anterior and posterior parts. The species is distinguishable from its relatives thanks to its distinctive multi-colored (white, red, black, yellow and brown) eyespot, located on the first dorsal fin; by a low number of soft rays on the second dorsal fin (11) and anal fin (9); by row r not divided into two sections; by a divided row d. The two type of specimens were collected at 0.2–0.6 m depth, at the entrance of cracks in compact volcanic boulders forming a rocky islet submerged at high tide. DNA barcoding based on COI of the species compared with sympatric gobiids and species of Atlantico-Mediterranean Gobius reveals a high nucleotide sequence divergence [Kimura’s (1980) two parameter distances of 16.5 %)], with Gobius ateriformis identified as its closest species. A dichotomous key for Gobius–Mauligobius from tropical eastern Atlantic is provided. It is the eleventh gobiid species, and the fourth endemic species, to be described in Cape Verde."
"Chemical composition and in vitro evaluation of total phenolic, flavonoid, and antioxidant properties of essential oil and solvent extract from the aerial parts of Teucrium polium grown in Tunisia","Total phenolic and flavonoid contents and antioxidant properties of extracts and essential oils of the aerial parts of Teucrium polium growing in Tunisia were evaluated. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents of extracts ranged from 48.88±0.01 to 400.00±0.01 mg of GAE/g and from 2.75±0.01 to 38.85±0.04mg of QE/g, respectively.

Techniques developed here are suitable tools for qualitative and quantitative comparison of sausage contents."
"Chromatic characteristics and anthocyanin compositions of cabernet sauvignon wines: Influence of indigenous Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains in Ningxia, China","Eight Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were used for preparation of Cabernet Sauvignon musts from Yuma vineyard in China, where the strains were isolated, to study the importance of yeast strain for optimization of Cabernet Sauvignon wine color and anthocyanin composition. Differences in chromatic characteristics between indigenous yeast strains and a commercial F15 control were not found. Twenty-one anthocyanins were detected and quantified using HPLC-MS. Concentrations of anthocyanins were significantly (p<0.05) influenced by the yeast strain used. Use of the commercial F15 yeast resulted in the highest anthocyanin concentration. Among 9 pyranoanthocyanins detected, amounts of must were influenced by the yeast strain used. The color of wine produced using the N11424 yeast was more stable because of a higher pyranoanthocyanin concentration. Use of Principal Component Analysis indicated that indigenous yeast treatments were separated from the F15 control yeast treatment based on anthocyanin components."
An immune-enhancing water-soluble α-glucan from Chlorella vulgaris and structural characteristics,"Water-extractable polysaccharides obtained from Chlorella vulgaris were fractionated using anion-exchange chromatography to investigate molecular characteristics and biological activities. Crude and fractionated polysaccharides F1, F2, and F3 mostly consisted of carbohydrates (40.0-64.7%), proteins (18.3-31.0%), ash (4.10-16.6%), and uronic acids (1.02-7.30%). Monosaccharide constituents were predominantly glucose (83.9-100%) with small amounts of xylose (10.8-16.1%). Crude polysaccharide and fractions contained 1 or 2 sub-fractions with average Mw values ranging from 19.7 to 1,145×103 g/mol. Fractions F1, F2, and F3 stimulated RAW264.7 cells, inducing release of NO, PGE2, and the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10.

"Purification, characterization, and DNA damage protection of active components from tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) hull","Isolation and purification of antioxidants with strongest activities using a guided strategy with 2,2,-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) were performed. Crude extracts were obtained from Tartary buckwheat hulls using 70% ethanol. After polar-solvent extraction and purification using silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, and MCI gel CHP 20P column chromatography, the active component was subjected to structural identification. HPLC analysis indicated a high-purity yield for the purification process. Results of ultraviolet-visible spectrometry and HPLC with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry indicated that the main component was quercetin, with micro-quercetin-3-rhamnoside and kaempferol. Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed the potential of the purified active component as an in vitro protectant against DNA damage. Dose-dependent damage protection was observed for all tested concentrations. Quantitative analysis indicated the active component combines with radicals derived from H2O2 + UV treatment for termination of the radical chain reaction."
Preparation and characterization of acid and pepsin-soluble collagens from scales of croceine and redlip croakers,"Acid-soluble (ASC) and pepsin-soluble collagen (PSC) from scales of croceine croaker (ASC-PC and PSC-PC) and redlip croaker (ASC-PP and PSC-PP) were prepared with yields of 0.37±0.08% (ASCPC), 1.09±0.23% (PSC-PC), 0.42±0.09% (ASC-PP), and 1.14±0.30% (PSC-PP) (dry scale basis). Gly (347.1-359.8 residues/1,000 residues) was the major amino acid. Contents of imino acid were between 189.4 and 192.9 residues/1,000 residues in all 4 collagens. ASC-PC and ASC-PP were type I collagens. Differences in subunit components between ASC and PSC were observed. Denaturation temperature values of ASC-PC, ASC-PP, PSC-PC, and PSC-PP were 30.7, 30.1, 27.5, and 26.6°C, respectively. All 4 collagens were soluble at pH 1-4. Values declined when NaCl concentrations exceeded 2%. Freeze-dried collagens showed loose, fibrous, and porous structures. The 4 scale collagens can be alternatives to collagen from terrestrial animals for applications in functional food, cosmetic, and biomedical industries."
Effect of diammonium phosphate supplementation on the amino acid metabolism during fermentation and sensory properties of fresh spine grape (Vitis davidii Foex) wine,"Spine grapes (Vitis daviddi Foex) are cultivated in southern China and possess a unique taste and flavor. However, nitrogen-deficiency results in poor quality spine wine. Diammonium phosphate (DAP) was added to spine grape must to determine the effect of DAP supplementation on the evolution of amino acids and associated by-products. DAP addition increased concentrations of amino acids from 73.5 to 101.0mg/L and biogenic amines from 3.9 to 5.0mg/L, but decreased concentrations of higher alcohols from 322.3 to 273.8mg/L and ethyl carbamate from 16.0 to 10.2 μg/L after fermentation. Sensory evaluation revealed that DAP supplementation kept the unique aroma and taste of fresh spine wine. DAP supplementation can benefit spine grape vinification and improve the quality of fresh spine wine."
"Distribution of phytic acid and associated catabolic enzymes in soybean sprouts and indoleacetic acid promotion of Zn, Fe, and Ca bioavailability","Phytic acid is involved in storage of phosphorus and minerals in soybeans. The effects of 6 basic plant hormones on phytic acid degradation were investigated. After 6 days of germination, phytic acid contents in soybean sprouts decreased by 70%, compared with day 0 soybeans. Zn and Fe bioavailability of 6-day-old germinating soybean both significantly increased (p<0.05), by contrast, Ca bioavailability decreased compared with controls. Phytic acid was detectable only in cotyledons of soybean sprouts during germination. In germinating soybeans, 39.19-45.85% and 54.15-60.81% of phytase existed in embryos and cotyledons, respectively. Unlike phytase, acid phosphatase was present mainly in cotyledons (92.57-97.51%). Among the 6 hormones, 50 mg/L indoleacetic acid (IAA) brought the highest degradation value to phytic acid content, meanwhile, Zn, Fe, and Ca bioavailability of IAA-treated soybeans were significantly (p<0.05) improved, compared with that of the control, respectively."
"Structural characterization and functional evaluation of an exopolysaccharide produced by Weissella confusa AJ53, an isolate from fermented Uttapam batter supplemented with Piper betle L. leaves","Weissella confusa AJ53 isolated from fermented Uttapam batter supplemented with Piper betle L. leaves produced an exopolysaccharide (EPS) from sucrose. The optimum culture conditions were determined for maximum production. EPS AJ53 was characterized using spectral analysis as an unbranched linear (α-1→6 linked) dextran, homopolymer of D-glucose. Melting and degradation temperatures of EPS AJ53 were 103.84 and 265°C, respectively. EPS AJ53 exhibited antioxidant activities for scavenging of hydroxyl, DPPH, and nitric oxide radicals, and metal ion chelating and poor reducing abilities. A fat binding ability, oil emulsifying activity, and syneresis-prevention activity due to a water holding capacity were demonstrated. Application as an adjunct to provide value addition to food products is indicated. A potent flocculating ability enables EPS AJ53 to be used for water treatment and cryoprotectant applications as an alternative cryoprotective agent. The yield and properties of EPS AJ53 indicate multiple uses."
A Bacillus coagulans and its application in pine pollen fermentation,"In the study, a potential L-lactic acid-producing bacillus-strain LT1 was isolated.

The fermentation conditions of pine pollen by strain LT1 were optimized using Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology. Optimum values of the tested variables for production of viable counts were an inoculum size of 9.22%, temperature=49.21°C, and an initial pH of 6.82. Under optimized conditions, the viable count was 5.49×109 CFU/mL. Finally, the single factor experiment as preliminary research for fermentation product treatment was performed."
Anti-hypertensive effect of grape seed extract in male spontaneously hypertensive rats,"Grape seed extract contains high concentration of polyphenols that are well known as potent vasodilators. Herein, we investigated the blood pressure-lowering effect of enzyme-treated grape seed extract (ET-GSE) and the involvement of endothelium nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which plays an important role in the regulation of vasodilation and relaxation of blood vessels in male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Six-week-old male Wistar Kyoto rats and SHRs were orally administered ET-GSE (15 and 30 mg/kg/day) as treatments for 8 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured by the tail-cuff method. After treatment for 8 weeks, thoracic aortas of sacrificed rats were harvested for detecting eNOS by Western blot analysis. SHRs treated with ET-GSE exhibited significantly lower SBP and DBP as well as higher expression of eNOS compared with control animals (p<0.05). These findings suggest that ET-GSE can contribute to regulate blood pressure through up-regulated eNOS expression for nitric oxide production."
Small angle neutron scattering study of nanostructural changes in microbial transglutaminase-treated low-fat yogurt during fermentation,Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) studies of fermentation of bovine milk with and without microbial transglutaminase (mTG) are described. Use of mTG increased the quality of low-fat yogurt via cross-linking of milk proteins. The SANS method was suitable for simultaneous characterization of the fermentation process and the effect of mTG. A decrease of whey protein release into the supernatant of centrifuged low-fat yogurt samples showed how mTG was capable to cross-link them already after 1 h of fermentation. The applied SANS method can be used to follow the sol-gel transformation of fermented dairy products in general. Moreover it can be a special tool for detecting the activity of mTG during fermentation of low-fat yogurts.
Production of xylooligosaccharides from corncobs using ultrasound-assisted enzymatic hydrolysis,"Xylooligosaccharides were obtained using ultrasound-assisted enzymatic hydrolysis from xylan that was alkali extracted from corncobs. Effects of alkali treatments on xylan extraction were investigated. The influence of operational conditions in ultrasound-assisted enzymatic hydrolysis on xylooligosaccharide production was also studied. Optimal conditions for xylan extraction were determined to be an alkaline concentration of 15%, a corncobs to alkaline solution ratio of 1:20, a reaction temperature of 100°C, and a reaction time of 2 h. Optimal conditions for xylanase-catalyzed hydrolysis of xylan to xylooligosaccharides were determined to be an enzyme concentration of 4 g/L, an ultrasound power of 200 W, a reaction temperature of 50°C and a reaction time of 10 min. Using a combination of ultrasound and enzyme increased the reducing sugar content by approximately 50%, compared with using of enzymes alone. Ultrasound and enzymes exert a synergistic effect."
Effect of drying and storage on the rheological characteristics of mozzarella cheese,"Rheological properties of stress relaxation and bending of 1 cm dried Mozzarella cheese cubes were investigated at drying temperatures of 20, 25, and 30°C. Changes in water activity were predicted using isotherm curves at each temperature based on the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. Instantaneous and residual stresses, obtained from stress relaxation testing, increased from 289.1 to 382.2 kPa and from 137.2 to 223.6 kPa, respectively, as the drying temperature increased from 20 to 30°C. Mozzarella cheese was cut into stick shapes and dried at 20°C for 5 h, then the bending force was measured at 5°C during 5 weeks. Failure stress and modulus of elasticity values of dried stick-shaped Mozzarella cheese were increased during the storage period at 5°C. Only hardness values among sensory evaluations of dried cheese significantly (p<0.05) increased as the storage time increased."
Evaluation and comparison of functional properties of freshwater-cultivated glasswort (Salicornia herbacea L.) with naturally-grown glasswort,"Glasswort (Salicornia herbacea L.) is a halophyte that grows normally in salt marshes and has been used as a seasoned vegetable. Physico-chemical properties, antioxidant, cytotoxic, and anti-inflammatory activities of water extracts from freshwater-cultivated (FWE) and naturally-grown (SWE) glasswort were investigated. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents of FWE were higher than for SWE. The salinity was higher in SWE. Radical scavenging activities and inhibitory effects against lipid peroxidation of FWE were more potent than for SWE. FWE also showed more potent cytotoxic effects with higher potency against cancer cells. FWE was effective for inhibition of protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Constituents in FWE were more active than in SWE, and freshwater-cultivated glasswort can be a useful dietary source with health benefits."
Cloning of the LEU2 gene from the amylolytic yeast Saccharomycopsis fibuligera,"The SfLEU2 structural gene of LEU2 encoding β-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase was cloned from the amylolytic yeast Saccharomycopsis fibuligera isolated from Nuruk, a Korean traditional starter for rice wine production. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of an uninterrupted open-reading frame of 1,107 bp, including a stop codon, encoding a 368 amino acid residue. The deduced amino acid sequence of Leu2 in S. fibuligera was 76.4% homologous with Candida boidinii and Kluyveromyces marxianus sequences. The SfLEU2 gene complemented leu2Δ mutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that the gene encodes a functional LEU2 in S. fibuligera. The GenBank Accession No. for SfLEU2 is KR820563."
The hypoglycemic effect of fermented Pueraria thunbergiana extract in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice,"This study investigated the effect of fermented and non-fermented Pueraria thunbergiana extract (FPE and PE, respectively) on postprandial hyperglycemia in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. FPE was prepared by fermentation of P. thunbergiana with Bifidobacterium breve K-111 followed by methanol extraction. FPE’s inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase and α-amylase was significantly higher than that of PE with IC50 values of 0.15 and 0.10 and 0.23 and 0.44 mg/mL for FPE and PE, respectively. The increase in postprandial blood glucose levels was significantly higher in FPE- than in PE-treated diabetic mice. Furthermore, FPE significantly lowered the incremental area under the curve (AUC) in the diabetic mice; the AUC in the normal mice corroborated FPE’s hypoglycemic effect. The results from this study suggest that FPE, more than PE, may help decrease postprandial hyperglycemia by inhibiting α-glucosidase and a-amylase."
Optimizing preparation conditions for Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides derived from enzymatic hydrolysates of ovalbumin,"Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides were prepared from ovalbumin using enzyme hydrolysis with pepsin as an enzyme source. Effects of pH, enzyme dosage, substrate concentration, hydrolysis temperature, and time on the degree of hydrolysis and the ACE inhibition rate were investigated using single factor experiments. Preparation conditions for ACE inhibitory peptides were optimized using a response surface design on the base of single factor experiments. Optimum preparation conditions were a substrate concentration of 5.2 g/100 mL of D.W with a pH value of 2.5, an enzyme dosage of 14,000 U/g, and a hydrolysis time of 250 min at 30°C. The ACE inhibition rate was up to 70.55±1.13% under these conditions."
New facets of mobile botnet: architecture and evaluation,"It is without a doubt that botnets pose a growing threat to the Internet, with DDoS attacks of any kind carried out by botnets to be on the rise. Nowadays, botmasters rely on advanced Command and Control (C&C) infrastructures to achieve their goals and most importantly to remain undetected. This work introduces two novel botnet architectures that consist only of mobile devices and evaluates both their impact in terms of DNS amplification and TCP flooding attacks, and their cost pertaining to the maintenance of the C&C channel. The first one puts forward the idea of using a continually changing mobile HTTP proxy in front of the botherder, while the other capitalizes on DNS protocol as a covert channel for coordinating the botnet. That is, for the latter, the messages exchanged among the bots and the herder appear as legitimate DNS transactions. Also, a third architecture is described and assessed, which is basically an optimized variation of the first one. Namely, it utilizes a mixed layout where all the attacking bots are mobile, but the proxy machines are typical PCs not involved in the actual attack. For the DNS amplification attack, which is by nature more powerful, we report an amplification factor that fluctuates between 32.7 and 34.1. Also, regarding the imposed C&C cost, we assert that it is minimal (about 0.25 Mbps) per bot in the worst case happening momentarily when the bot learns about the parameters of the attack."
Gender differences in the perception of difficulty of self-management in patients with diabetes mellitus: a mixed-methods approach,The aim of this study was to examine the challenges of self-management of diabetes comparing gender.
"Inflammatory, lipid, and body composition responses to interval training or moderate aerobic training","The goal of this study was to compare the effect of work- and duration-matched interval training (HIIT) versus moderate aerobic endurance training (ET) on acute and chronic inflammation, along with changes in the lipid profile, to determine which may be more beneficial for improving cardiovascular health."
Separate waste collection in Italy: the role of socio-cultural factors and targets set by law,"The aim of this paper was twofold: on the one hand, we analyse the results achieved in terms of percentages of separate collection in Italy by testing the effectiveness of Legislative Decree 152/2006 in improving the separate collection process; and on the other hand, we investigate on some of the factors, related to the sociocultural local context, that could explain the different impacts of the law in the three macro-areas considered (North, Central and South Italy). To this purpose, an econometric analysis on the Italian regions for the 1996–2013 period is performed, comparing the period before (1996–2006) and after (2006–2013) the date of entry into force of the new law. The results show the effectiveness of Legislative Decree 152/2006 in promoting separate collection, although a regional difference in terms of separate collection rate is observed. Northern regions proved to be more dynamic and reactive to the above-mentioned legislation, while Central and especially Southern regions achieved poorer results in moving to higher separate waste collection rates. Finally, our work provides evidence on some local factors that may have hampered an effective policy implementation in Southern regions, among them, the presence of criminal activities and the lack of citizen participation in politics."
Multiplicative (generalized)-derivation in semiprime rings,"Let R be a semiprime ring and \(\alpha \) any mapping on R. A mapping \(F:R\rightarrow R\) is called multiplicative (generalized)-derivation if \(F(xy)=F(x)y+xd(y)\) for all \(x, y \in R\), where \(d:R\rightarrow R\) is any map (not necessarily additive). In this paper our main motive is to study the commutativity of semiprime rings and nature of mappings."
Systematic design of a learning environment for domain-specific and domain-general critical thinking skills,"Identifying effective instructional approaches that stimulate students’ critical thinking (CT) has been the focus of a large body of empirical research. However, there is little agreement on the instructional principles and procedures that are theoretically sound and empirically valid to developing both domain-specific and domain-general CT skills. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of systematically designed subject matter instruction in stimulating the development of domain-specific and domain-general CT skills, and to investigate the relationship between the two. The study employed a pretest–posttest quasi-experimental design with two conditions: 45 students participated in an experimental condition and 44 students in a control condition. A learning environment, in the context of a freshman physics course, was designed according to the First Principles of Instruction model. The experimental condition followed the designed learning environment, while the control condition followed regular subject matter instruction that was not designed according to the First Principles of Instruction model. The experimental condition scored significantly higher than the control condition on a domain-specific CT test. The results also showed that better performance on a domain-specific CT test explained a significant proportion of the variance on a domain-general CT test. However, the experimental learning environment did not result in a significantly greater pretest–posttest improvement in the acquisition of domain-general CT skills compared to the control learning environment. Instructional design principles that may contribute to the present understanding of the integration of CT skills within the regular subject matter instruction are discussed."
A novel approach for SEMG signal classification with adaptive local binary patterns,"Feature extraction plays a major role in the pattern recognition process, and this paper presents a novel feature extraction approach,
 adaptive local binary pattern (aLBP). aLBP is built on the local binary pattern (LBP), which is an image processing method, and one-dimensional local binary pattern (1D-LBP). In LBP, each pixel is compared with its neighbors. Similarly, in 1D-LBP, each data in the raw is judged against its neighbors. 1D-LBP extracts feature based on local changes in the signal. Therefore, it has high a potential to be employed in medical purposes. Since, each action or abnormality, which is recorded in SEMG signals, has its own pattern, and via the 1D-LBP these (hidden) patterns may be detected. But, the positions of the neighbors in 1D-LBP are constant depending on the position of the data in the raw. Also, both LBP and 1D-LBP are very sensitive to noise. Therefore, its capacity in detecting hidden patterns is limited. To overcome these drawbacks, aLBP was proposed. In aLBP, the positions of the neighbors and their values can be assigned adaptively via the down-sampling and the smoothing coefficients. Therefore, the potential to detect (hidden) patterns, which may express an illness or an action, is really increased. To validate the proposed feature extraction approach, two different datasets were employed. Achieved accuracies by the proposed approach were higher than obtained results by employed popular feature extraction approaches and the reported results in the literature. Obtained accuracy results were brought out that the proposed method can be employed to investigate SEMG signals. In summary, this work attempts to develop an adaptive feature extraction scheme that can be utilized for extracting features from local changes in different categories of time-varying signals."
Hand–tool–tissue interaction forces in neurosurgery for haptic rendering,"Haptics provides sensory stimuli that represent the interaction with a virtual or tele-manipulated object, and it is considered a valuable navigation and manipulation tool during tele-operated surgical procedures. Haptic feedback can be provided to the user via cutaneous information and kinesthetic feedback. Sensory subtraction removes the kinesthetic component of the haptic feedback,
 having only the cutaneous component provided to the user. Such a technique guarantees a stable haptic feedback loop, while it keeps the transparency of the tele-operation system high, which means that the system faithfully replicates and render back the user’s directives. This work focuses on checking whether the interaction forces during a bench model neurosurgery
 operation can lie in the solely cutaneous perception of the human finger pads. If this assumption is found true, it would be possible to exploit sensory subtraction techniques for providing surgeons with feedback from neurosurgery. We measured the forces exerted to surgical tools by three neurosurgeons performing typical actions on a brain phantom, using contact force sensors, while the forces exerted by the tools to the phantom tissue were recorded using a load cell placed under the brain phantom box. The measured surgeon–tool contact forces were 0.01–3.49 N for the thumb and 0.01–6.6 N for index and middle finger, whereas the measured tool–tissue interaction forces were from six to 11 times smaller than the contact forces, i.e., 0.01–0.59 N. The measurements for the
 contact forces fit the range of the cutaneous sensitivity for the human finger pad; thus, we can say that, in a tele-operated robotic neurosurgery scenario, it would possible to render forces at the fingertip level by conveying haptic cues solely through the cutaneous channel of the surgeon’s finger pads. This approach would allow high transparency and high stability of the haptic feedback loop in a tele-operation system."
Capacity in fading environment based on soft sensing information under spectrum sharing constraints,"In this paper, the ergodic channel capacity for a secondary user is investigated using soft sensing information about primary user activity in a shared channel under joint peak transmit power and average received interference power constraints for Nakagami-m fading channel. The results of the proposed power adaptation scheme illustrate the effect of communication environment parameters and soft sensing information about primary user activity on the channel capacity of secondary user. In particular, the effect of cross link channel state information to maximize the channel capacity for the power adaptation scheme is emphasized by considering the Lagrangian optimization problem for joint peak transmit power and average interference power constraints. Moreover, the performance of the primary user is also investigated considering the interference of the secondary user to the primary in spectrum sharing environment in terms of transmission rate and average channel capacity."
Influence of Dynamic Precipitation During Low Cycle Fatigue of Under-Aged AA6063 Alloy,"The present study is aimed to understand the influence of dynamic precipitation on the low cycle fatigue (LCF) behavior of an under-aged (UA) AA6063 Al–Mg–Si alloy. This was accomplished by the estimation of plastic strain energy density (PSED) at varied isolated cycles during LCF of the UA alloy with subsequent comparison of these results with those of peak-aged (PA) and over-aged (OA) ones. The LCF tests of the UA alloy were carried out in the range of strain amplitudes of 0.2–1.0 % together with the evolution of hardness and tensile properties. The UA alloy shows Masing behavior, evaluated in terms of the variation of Bauschinger strain with plastic strain amplitude, and exhibits continuous hardening till failure unlike the PA and OA alloys. Higher average PSED value for the UA alloy in comparison to that for the PA and the OA alloys indicates dynamic precipitation during cycling; the magnitudes of average PSED were calculated using a proposed method. In addition, pronounced increase in the post LCF hardness values substantiate the dynamic precipitation."
Voice Activity Detection Using an Improved Unvoiced Feature Normalization Process in Noisy Environments,"Noise-elimination technology is used to eliminate noise, including environmental noise, from voice signals in order to increase voice recognition rates. Noise estimation is the most important factor in noise-elimination technology. One of the effective estimation methods is voice activity detection, which is based on the statistical properties of noise and voice. This method is a way of estimating noise using the statistical properties of both noise and voice, which have an independent Gaussian distribution. In cases of severe differences in a statistical property, like white noise, the method is very reliable but limited to signals having a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or having speech shape noise, which has statistical properties similar to voice signals. Methods to increase the voice recognition rate suffer from decreasing voice recognition performance due to distortion of the voice spectrum and to missing voice frames, because noise remains if there has been incorrect estimation of the noise. Degradation in voice recognition performance emerges in the differences between the model training environment and the voice recognition environment. In order to decrease environmental discordance, various silence feature normalization methods are used. Existing silence feature normalization suffers from degradation of recognition performance because the classification accuracy for the voiced and unvoiced signals decreases by an increasing energy level in the silence section of a low SNR. This paper proposes a robust voice characteristic detection method for noisy environments using feature extraction and unvoiced feature normalization for a classification relative to the voiced and unvoiced signals. The suggested method constitutes a model for recognition by extracting the characteristics for classification of the voiced and unvoiced signals in a high SNR environment. Also, the model affects noise for voice characteristics less, and recognition performance improves by using the Cepstrum feature distribution property of voiced and unvoiced signals with a low SNR. The model was checked for its ability to improve recognition performance relative to the existing method based on recognition experiment results."
Hydrocarbons via CO2 Hydrogenation Over Iron Catalysts: The Effect of Potassium on Structure and Performance,"We present a study in which the suitability of potassium promoted iron-based Fischer–Tropsch (FT) catalysts for the generation of synthetic natural gas additives via the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide through a combined reverse water gas shift (WGS) and FT reaction is studied. Using novel in situ instrumentation based on XRD and magnetometry techniques the reversible conversion of metallic iron to Hägg carbide under reaction conditions and its decomposition in hydrogen could be monitored. The facilitating effect of potassium in the formation of iron carbide could be exposed as function of time on stream. While the FT reaction was reduced in the presence of high potassium loadings the reverse WGS reaction seemed to be unperturbed. A faster activation of an iron phase obtained via the decomposition of iron carbide, compared to the initial activation of a pristine iron phase obtained via the reduction of iron oxide was witnessed."
Intrinsic groundwater vulnerability determination at the aquifer scale: a methodology coupling travel time estimation and rating methods,"Groundwater vulnerability has been subject of much research due to the valuable information it provides concerning groundwater protection and exploitation potential. Up to now, most groundwater vulnerability studies adopt subjective systems of rating the various factors and subsequently, their results are often ambiguous and contradicting. Within the present study a methodology for the estimation of intrinsic groundwater vulnerability at the aquifer scale is presented. The methodology is based on travel time estimation from specified sources of pollution to the aquifer. Besides the deterministic calculation of travel times, the methodology provides a rating system for each pollution source, based on its relative severity and the estimated threat that it poses to the aquifer. Therefore, it can be regarded as a hybrid method that couples the advantages provided by the physically based methods with those of the subjective rating systems. The methodology is applied to the Neon Sidirochorion aquifer, Northeastern Greece, an overexploited aquifer where river waters, sea waters and lake waters interact, causing groundwater quality deterioration to the aquifer. The results indicated that the proposed groundwater vulnerability assessment methodology is well capturing pollution related to saltwater intrusion and agricultural activities, while it is concluded that the conceptual model is significantly affecting the vulnerability assessment results and therefore has to be previously developed."
Application of different enzyme assays and biomarkers for pollution monitoring of the marine environment,"New phosphatase and DNase inhibition tests for assessing the total pollution of a natural marine ecosystem were applied. The seawater samples with different pollution degrees were collected in the Troitsa Bay of the Peter the Great Bay (the Sea of Japan). The sensitivity of the alkaline phosphatase test to integrated pollution was in accordance with the sensitivity of the standard sea urchin sperm cell toxicity test. The increased seawater pollution level was shown to result in an up to fourfold increase in specific activities of acid and alkaline phosphatases from the mussel Crenomytilus grayanus. It was demonstrated that a complex methodological approach can be used to assess marine water areas, as well as to assess the biological conditions of invertebrates adapting to different environmental and anthropogenic effects."
Reliability of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy by ECG Criteria in Children with Syncope: Do the Criteria Need to be Revised?,"In the outpatient setting, children who present with syncope routinely undergo electrocardiograms (ECG). Because of concerns for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, children with syncope meeting ECG criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) will frequently undergo an echocardiogram. Our objectives were to determine whether Davignon criteria for ECG waves overestimate LVH in children presenting with syncope, and to study the usefulness of echocardiography in these children. We hypothesize that the Davignon criteria presently used for interpretation of ECGs overestimate LVH, resulting in unnecessary echocardiography in this clinical setting. The clinical database of The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia was evaluated from 2002 to 2012 to identify children between 9 and 16 years of age, who presented with non-exercise-induced, isolated syncope. From this group of patients, only those with clear-cut evidence of LVH (by Davignon criteria), who also underwent an echocardiogram, were selected. A total of 136 children with syncope were identified as having LVH by Davignon ECG criteria. None of these patients manifested any evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with normal ventricular septum (average Z-score −0.68 ± 0.84), LV posterior wall (average Z-score −0.66 ± 1.18) and LV mass (average Z-score 0.52 ± 1.29). No significant correlation was found between summed RV6 plus SV1 and LV mass. Correlations between additional ECG parameters and measures of LVH by echocardiography were similarly poor. In children presenting with syncope and LVH by ECG, there was no evidence of true LVH by echocardiography. We propose that the Davignon ECG criteria for interpreting LVH in children overestimate the degree of hypertrophy in these children and the yield of echocardiography is extremely low."
IKSOEP: past de SOEP nog bij deze tijd?,Het gestructureerd vastleggen van patiëntcontacten in het huisartsinformatiesysteem (HIS) heeft ons veel gebracht.

Assessing the effects of basal media on the in vitro propagation and nutritional status of Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden,"In tissue culture, essential aspects of growth and development can be modulated by managing mineral nutrition and growth regulators. Therefore, basal medium selection is one of the key factors for success with this technique since the nutritional status of tissue cultures relies on it. Although Murashige and Skoog (MS), JADS, and woody plant medium (WPM) media are among the most common basal media used for the in vitro propagation of eucalypts, they have shown limited success for use in Eucalyptus dunnii micropropagation, where excessive callus formation, hyperhydricity, and chlorosis are frequent issues. These morpho-physiological responses could be related to different nutritional conditions provided by each media, showing that none of them was competent for E. dunnii micropropagation. To prevent these problems, a modified version of a novel basal medium for E. dunnii (EDMm), based on chemical analysis of E. dunnii young stump shoots was developed. The morpho-physiological responses and mineral nutrient contents of four E. dunnii clones cultured in EDMm, JADS, MS, and WPM basal media were assessed. Multivariate analysis suggested that Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn concentrations in tissues, all of which are at higher concentrations in EDMm medium than the other media, were associated to higher rooting rates. On the other hand, higher K and S concentrations were related to higher multiplication and growth rates. The results showed that all basal media tested support axillary shoot multiplication, but only the shoots grown in EDMm media presented no Fe chlorosis or oxidation symptoms and showed higher rooting rates."
"Design, synthesis and neuraminidase inhibitory activity of N-(5-benzyl-4-(tert-butyl)thiazol-2-yl)benzamides","A series of N-(5-benzyl-4-(tert-butyl)thiazol-2-yl)benzamides were synthesized and the structures were characterized by 1H NMR, MS and elemental analyses. The crystal structures of compounds F5 and F16 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The neuraminidase inhibitory activities of compounds F1–F32 were evaluated in vitro at the concentration of 40 μg/mL. The results indicated that compounds F8, F26 and F32 exhibited most potent inhibitory activity against NA. Molecular docking was performed by LeDock to further explain the structure–activity relationship of compound F26. The docking modeling showed that compound F26 was in good combination with oseltamivir binding sites of NA and could be a potential NA inhibitor agent."
Regional Risk Assessment addressing the impacts of climate change in the coastal area of the Gulf of Gabes (Tunisia),"Sound, cost efficient management strategies in developed coastal zones can be reinforced by a thorough understanding of risks associated with the combination of anthropogenic and natural drivers of change. A Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology was developed for the assessment of the potential impacts of climate change in the Tunisian coastal zone of the Gulf of Gabes. It is based on the use of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis techniques and Geographic Information Systems and is designed to support the development and prioritization of adaptation strategies. The RRA focuses on sea-level rise and storm surge flooding impacts for human and natural systems, i.e., beaches, wetlands, urban areas, agricultural areas, and terrestrial ecosystems. Results suggest that for both of the studied climate change impacts, i.e., sea-level rise and storm surge flooding, the area potentially exposed is limited to a narrow, low elevation region adjacent to the shoreline. However, the exposed areas showed a high relative risk score, obtained by the integration of exposure and susceptibility factors. Beaches have the lowest relative risk scores, while wetlands and terrestrial ecosystems have the higher relative risk scores. The final outputs of the analysis (i.e., exposure, susceptibility, and risk maps) can support end-users in the establishment of relative priorities for intervention and in the identification of suitable areas for human settlements, infrastructure, and economic activities, thus providing a basis for coastal zoning and land-use planning."
Peripheral nerve blocks as the sole anesthetic technique in a patient with severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy,"General anesthesia and central neuraxial blockades in patients with severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy are associated with high risks of complications, including rhabdomyolysis, malignant hyperthermia, hemodynamic instability, and postoperative mechanical ventilation. Here, we describe peripheral nerve blocks as a safe approach to anesthesia in a patient with severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy who was scheduled to undergo surgery. A 22-year-old male patient was scheduled to undergo reduction and internal fixation of a left distal femur fracture. He had been diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy at 5 years of age, and had no locomotive capability except for that of the finger flexors and toe extensors. He had developed symptoms associated with dyspnea 5 years before and required intermittent ventilation. We blocked the femoral nerve, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, and parasacral plexus under ultrasound on the left leg. The patient underwent a successful operation using peripheral nerve blocks with no complications. In conclusion general anesthesia and central neuraxial blockades in patients with severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy are unsafe approaches to anesthesia because of hemodynamic instability and respiratory depression. Peripheral nerve blocks are the best way to reduce the risks of critical complications, and are a safe and feasible approach to anesthesia in patients with severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy."
Improving Implementation of a School-Based Program for Traumatized Students: Identifying Factors that Promote Teacher Support and Collaboration,"The purpose of this study was to delineate the factors that influence teachers’ support and involvement in successful implementation of an early intervention, school-based trauma program, Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS). In schools that had already used the intervention for at least one school year, we interviewed teachers and other stakeholders to understand what factors influence teacher support and clarify the role teachers desire in the implementation process. This paper also illuminates barriers to their support and collaboration and identifies methods to improve future implementation and sustainability. We conducted 40 semi-structured qualitative telephone interviews with school staff across three geographic regions in the USA. Participants were asked about their experiences with CBITS in their schools and asked to share both facilitators and challenges to implementation. Four key themes emerged: Support for CBITS was related to teachers’ perceived need for a trauma program on campus; teachers struggled with the competing priorities of balancing students’ social-emotional needs with their missing class to attend CBITS; teachers desired more direct communication with clinicians; and teachers felt they needed more trauma education. Suggested improvements include acknowledging teacher concerns about lost instructional time for CBITS sessions and offering groups during non-core academic instruction, expanding trauma education for teachers, so they can better respond to and connect traumatized students with intervention services, including regular consultation between teacher and clinicians about participating students, and improvements in academic performance following the intervention should be shared with teachers to improve their support."
Reciprocity in Human-Robot Interaction: A Quantitative Approach Through the Prisoner’s Dilemma and the Ultimatum Game,"Reciprocity is an important factor in human–human interaction, so it can be expected that it should also play a major role in human–robot interaction (HRI). Participants in our study played the Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma Game (RPDG) and the mini Ultimatum Game (mUG) with robot and human agents, with the agents using either Tit for Tat (TfT) or Random strategies. As part of the study we also measured the perceived personality traits in the agents using the TIPI test after every round of RPDG and mUG. The results show that the participants collaborated more with humans than with a robot, however they tended to be equally reciprocal with both agents. The experiment also showed the TfT strategy as the most profitable strategy; affecting collaboration, reciprocation, profit and joint profit in the game. Most of the participants tended to be fairer with the human agent in mUG. Furthermore, robots were perceived as less open and agreeable than humans. Consciousness, extroversion and emotional stability were perceived roughly the same in humans and robots. TfT strategy became associated with an extroverted and agreeable personality in the agents. We could observe that the norm of reciprocity applied in HRI has potential implications for robot design."
Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism on Exon 17 of Insulin Receptor Gene Influences Insulin Resistance in PCOS: A Pilot Study on North Indian Women,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a major cause of infertility, is also strongly associated with insulin resistance. Defects in insulin receptor signaling are considered as one of the major molecular pathogeneses for insulin resistance. To investigate the possible mechanism of this signaling defect at genetic level, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [His 1085 C/T] at the exon 17 of insulin receptor gene (INSR) was studied in this pilot study. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on leucocytic DNA of women diagnosed with PCOS, selected from the outpatient department of Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, using suitable primer to amplify a region on INSR. An equal number of age-matched healthy women were selected as controls. SNP analysis was performed with restriction enzyme length polymorphism technique using Pm II enzyme. Serum insulin level was measured by ELISA kit and HOMA-IR was calculated mathematically. A higher frequency of the CC genotype was observed in PCOS women than in controls. Also, HOMA-IR, a tool for estimating insulin resistance, was significantly high in PCOS women with the CC genotype. C1008T SNP at exon 17 of INSR is associated with insulin resistance in Indian women with PCOS. Presence of CC genotype (C1085T) could be developed as a marker for insulin resistance and metabolic complications in PCOS women."
Spread of the introduced biocontrol agent Torymus sinensis in north-eastern Italy: dispersal through active flight or assisted by wind?,"In successful classical biological control, natural enemies can provide enduring pest suppression if they reproduce and disperse without continued human management. To explain the efficient control exerted on the Asian chestnut gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) by the parasitoid Torymus sinensis Kamijo (Hymenoptera: Torymidae), it is required that the latter has the capacity to track the range expansion of its host. In the present study, we hypothesized that the distribution of infested patches and the prevailing wind directions would interactively influence and accelerate the spread of the parasitoid. It emerged that the spread capability of T. sinensis is high and likely affected by a combination of short- and long-distance flights (stratified dispersal). In particular, the ability to disperse long distances represents a successful trait of the parasitoid because the natural dispersal of its host is high and frequently aided by unintentional human-mediated transportation."
"Different dispersal histories of lineages of the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa (Lumbricidae, Annelida) in the Palearctic","Earthworms are among the most abundant and ecologically important invasive species, and are therefore a good object for studying genetic processes in invasive populations. Aporrectodea caliginosa is one of the most widespread invasive earthworms in the temperate zone. It is believed to have dispersed from Europe to all continents except Antarctica. It is known that A. caliginosa consists of three genetic lineages, and genetic diversity is high both among and between them. We attempted to use that high genetic diversity to study A. caliginosa dispersal in the Palearctic based on a sample of 40 localities ranging from eastern Europe to the Russian Far East, and to compare our data to other studies on this species in western Europe and North America. Two genetic lineages were found in the studied sample. Only negligible decrease in genetic diversity was observed for the lineage 2 of A. caliginosa from West Europe to the Far East, suggesting multiple human-mediated introductions. In contrast, lineage 3 is abundant in West Europe and Belarus, but is absent from the East European Plain, the Urals, and the Far East. However, it is present in West Siberia, where it has greatly reduced genetic diversity, indicating long-distance dispersal accompanied by a bottleneck event. Thus, although these two lineages of A. caliginosa are morphologically indistinguishable, they have dramatic differences in their distributions and dispersal histories."
Simultaneous glucose and xylose uptake by an acetone/butanol/ethanol producing laboratory Clostridium beijerinckii strain SE-2,"Most butanol-producing strains of Clostridium prefer glucose over xylose, leading to a slower butanol production from lignocellulose hydrolysates.

De novo CpG methylation on an artificial chromosome-like vector maintained for a long-term in mammalian cells,"To examine whether an autonomously replicating, artificial chromosome-like vector containing a long genomic DNA sequence (namely, Epigenosome-Nanog) undergoes de novo CpG methylation after maintenance in cultured cells for more than a half year."
"Increased blubber cortisol in ice-entrapped beluga whales (Delphinapterus
leucas)","Entrapments of whales in sea ice occur occasionally in the Arctic and often last several weeks or months, resulting in emaciation or death of whales. These events provide a unique opportunity for investigating the physiological response to a prolonged or chronic stress in an otherwise healthy population of marine mammals. By measuring cortisol in blubber, a peripheral tissue, we expect to see a reflection of long-term or chronic stress rather than short-term or acute stress. Adipose tissue should be less subject to rapid changes compared to blood cortisol, reflecting stressors experienced over a longer period of time, and should not be affected by potential stress associated with sampling. We measured blubber cortisol of 29 beluga whales (Delphinapterus
leucas) entrapped in November 2006 in Husky Lakes basin and 26 whales from the same population (Eastern Beaufort Sea) during regular seasonal harvests in July of 2006 and 2007. Mean cortisol concentrations (±SEM) were seven times higher in blubber from entrapped whales (1.76 ± 0.32 ng/g wet weight) compared to whales from regular seasonal harvests (0.26 ± 0.042 ng/g wet weight) and appeared to increase with whale age. Our results provide a measure of blubber cortisol from a prolonged stress and demonstrate blubber cortisol as a useful indicator of longer-term exposure to stress in beluga whales."

Intravenous Nicotine Self-Administration in Smokers: Dose–Response Function and Sex Differences,"Sex differences in the sensitivity to nicotine may influence vulnerability to tobacco dependence. The goal of this study was to investigate the dose–response function for the reinforcing and subjective effects of intravenous nicotine in male and female smokers. Tobacco-dependent subjects (12 male and 14 female) participated in four experimental sessions in which they received sample infusions of saline and nicotine (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, or 0.4 mg doses) in a randomized double-blind crossover design. During each session, subjects first received the sample infusions, and heart rate (HR), blood pressure, and subjective stimulatory, pleasurable and aversive responses were monitored. Immediately following the sample infusions, subjects self-administered either nicotine or saline in six double-blind forced-choice trials. A sex by dose interaction was observed in the nicotine choice paradigm. Nicotine self-administration rate was negatively correlated with nicotine dose in males (males displayed choice preference for low doses of nicotine over high doses of nicotine), but no significant relationship between dose and choice preference was evident in females. Relative to placebo, sample doses of nicotine increased heart rate and blood pressure, and induced stimulatory, pleasurable, and aversive subjective effects. Diastolic blood pressure increased dose dependently in males, but not in females. These findings, which demonstrate sex differences in nicotine self-administration for doses that are near to the reinforcement threshold, suggest that male and female smokers may respond differently to the changes in nicotine doses available for self-administration."
Activin Controls Ethanol Potentiation of Inhibitory Synaptic Transmission Through GABAA Receptors and Concomitant Behavioral Sedation,"Activin, a member of the transforming growth factor-β family, exerts multiple functions in the nervous system. Originally identified as a neurotrophic and -protective agent, increasing evidence implicates activin also in the regulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission in brain regions associated with cognitive and affective functions. To explore how activin impacts on ethanol potentiation of GABA synapses and related behavioral paradigms, we used an established transgenic model of disrupted activin receptor signaling, in which mice express a dominant-negative activin receptor IB mutant (dnActRIB) under the control of the CaMKIIα promoter. Comparison of GABAA receptor currents in hippocampal neurons from dnActRIB mice and wild-type mice showed that all concentrations of ethanol tested (30–150 mM) produced much stronger potentiation of phasic inhibition in the mutant preparation. In dentate granule cells of dnActRIB mice, tonic GABA inhibition was more pronounced than in wild-type neurons, but remained insensitive to low ethanol (30 mM) in both preparations. The heightened ethanol sensitivity of phasic inhibition in mutant hippocampi resulted from both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms, the latter probably involving PKCɛ. At the behavioral level, ethanol produced significantly stronger sedation in dnActRIB mice than in wild-type mice, but did not affect consumption of ethanol or escalation after withdrawal. We link the abnormal narcotic response of dnActRIB mice to ethanol to the excessive potentiation of inhibitory neurotransmission. Our study suggests that activin counteracts oversedation from ethanol by curtailing its augmenting effect at GABA synapses."
"Paenibacillus
puernese sp. nov., a β-glucosidase-producing bacterium isolated from Pu’er tea","A Gram-staining-positive, endospore-forming, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium, designated as DCY97T, was isolated from ripened Pu’er tea and was identified by using a polyphasic approach. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain DCY97T was closely related to Paenibacillus dongdonensis KUDC0114T (98.0 %), Paenibacillus oceanisediminis L10T (97.7 %), and Paenibacillus barcinonensis BP-23T (97.2 %). The phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics of strain DCY97T matched with the characteristics of members belonging to the genus Paenibacillus. The major identified polar lipids included phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and diphosphatidylglycerol. The predominant quinone was MK-7. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0 (35.1 %), anteiso-C16:0 (19.0 %), and iso-C16:0 (13.9 %). The peptidoglycan cell wall was composed of meso-diaminopimelic acids, alanine, and d-glutamic acid. The genomic DNA G + C content was determined to be 46.7 mol%. The DNA–DNA relatedness between strain DCY97T and Paenibacillus dongdonensis KCTC 33221T, Paenibacillus oceanisediminis KACC 16023T, Paenibacillus barcinonensis KCTC 13019T were 27, 19, and 10 %, respectively. Based on the genotypic, phenotypic, and chemotaxonomic characteristics, strain DCY97T is considered as a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus puernese sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is DCY97T (=KCTC 33596T = JCM 140369T)."
A Cross-case Study on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the Philippines: A Comparative Analysis on Perspectives from the Top Banking Institutions in the Philippines from 2010-2014,"Corporate Social Responsibility by corporations and businesses helps alleviate the effect of the significant problems faced by the community such as poverty, environmental degradation, social inequality, health and illness, drugs, crime and terrorism and some others. This paper investigates the major Philippine banking institutions’ awareness on these given social problems by content analysis methodology, which is done by understanding the use of media releases (such as Annual reports, Sustainability Reports and other online press releases and news releases) in the marketing and communication of corporate social responsibility (CSR). The scope of the CSR reports is based on the 4-year time period 2010-2014. This study tries to determine the coverage on the social aspects of the top Philippine banking institutions based on the classification: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Corporate Communication, Corporate Philanthropy, and Corporate Social Behavior in Banks. Moreover, the paper seeks to: (1) Examine the social-responsibility issues portrayed in the annual reports by banks; (2) Examine the nature of such issues handled by banks (3) Know what are the most important CSR issues being addressed by the top Philippine banking institutions."

"Financial Reporting Quality, Executive Stock Options and Business Ethics","This paper tests the improvement of financial reporting quality when firms award stock options to their executives. The originality of this study is that we introduce the moderating effect of business ethics in the model. The sample is made up of 116 Canadian high-technology firms with available data for the fiscal year ending in 2012. We define the quality of financial reporting as the value relevance of accounting information as developed by Ohlson. Our results show that executive stock option award alone does not improve the quality of financial reporting. Rather, the quality improves when a firm awards stock options to its executives and investors perceive that the level of business ethics in that firm is high."
Economic Fluctuations and the Role of Monetary Policy: An Investigation of an Agent-based Model,"The merit of ABM comes directly from removing set of unreal assumptions that are commonly assumed in standard models. Not only can ABM regenerates macroeconomics regularities at the same level as the traditional models without introducing any exogenous process but also displays the ability to capture microeconomics dynamics. Simulation results conform to standard monetary economics theory—expansionary monetary policy can be used as a stabilization tool and leave no permanent impacts to real variables. When an economy experiences growth, an increase in money supply is required to stabilize price level, otherwise, severe deflation is expected as well as high fluctuations in unemployment level. Simple monetary policy can be used to stabilize such fluctuations and would reduced economy-wide default risk, which may have positive economic impacts in the long run. Provided that agents do not hold assets in this model setup, the study supports Friedman’s K-percent rule as it performs the best in term of output improvement. The asymmetric effects of monetary policy are found in number of aspects: impact to GDP, impact duration, and impact to unemployment level. Less flexibility in downward price adjustment is the reason behind such asymmetric responses."
Factors Influencing Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Uptake in Emergency Medical Services Workers: A Concept Mapping Approach,"Seasonal influenza has serious impacts on morbidity and mortality and has a significant economic toll through lost workforce time and strains on the health system. Health workers, particularly emergency medical services (EMS) workers have the potential to transmit influenza to those in their care, yet little is known of the factors that influence EMS workers’ decisions regarding seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) uptake, a key factor in reducing potential for transmitting disease. This study utilizes a modified Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model as a guiding framework to explore the factors that influence SIV uptake in EMS workers. Concept mapping, which consists of six-stages (preparation, generation, structuring, representation, interpretation, and utilization) that use quantitative and qualitative approaches, was used to identify participants’ perspectives towards SIV. This study identified nine EMS-conceptualized factors that influence EMS workers’ vaccination intent and behavior. The EMS-conceptualized factors align with the modified TPB model and suggest the need to consider community-wide approaches that were not initially conceptualized in the model. Additionally, the expansion of non-pharmaceutical measures went above and beyond original conceptualization. Overall, this study demonstrates the need to develop customized interventions such as messages highlighting the importance of EMS workers receiving SIV as the optimum solution. EMS workers who do not intend to receive the SIV should be provided with accurate information on the SIV to dispel misconceptions. Finally, EMS workers should also receive interventions which promote voluntary vaccination, encouraging them to be proactive in the health decisions they make for themselves."
Do hassles and uplifts trajectories predict mortality? Longitudinal findings from the VA Normative Aging Study,"We examined whether longitudinal patterns of hassles and uplifts trajectories predicted mortality, using a sample of 1315 men from the VA Normative Aging Study (mean age = 65.31, SD = 7.6). In prior work, we identified different trajectory classes of hassles and uplifts exposure and intensity scores over a period of 16 years. In this study, we used the probabilities of these exposure and intensity class memberships to examine their ability to predict mortality. Men with higher probabilities of high hassle intensity trajectory class and high uplift intensity class had higher mortality risks. In a model combining the probabilities of hassle and uplift intensities, the probability of high intensity hassle class membership significantly increased the risk of mortality. This suggests that appraisals of hassles intensity are better predictors of mortality than simple exposure measures, and that uplifts have no independent effects."
Prediction of fluid responsiveness in the beach chair position using dynamic preload indices,"Hemodynamic instability in the beach chair position (BCP) may lead to adverse outcomes. Cardiac preload optimization is a prerequisite to improve hemodynamics. We evaluated the clinical usefulness of dynamic indices for the prediction of fluid responsiveness in BCP patients under general anesthesia. Forty-two patients in the BCP under mechanical ventilation received colloids at 6 ml/kg for 10 min. Stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), pleth variability index (PVI), and hemodynamic data were measured before and after the fluid challenge. Patients were considered responders to volume expansion if the stroke volume index increased by ≥15 %. The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves for SVV, PPV and PVI were 0.83, 0.81 and 0.74, respectively (p < 0.05), with the corresponding optimal cut-off values of 12, 15 and 10 %. SVV, PPV and PVI can be used to predict fluid responsiveness in the BCP under mechanical ventilation."
The scaling of geographic ranges: implications for species distribution models,"The geographic ranges of many species are responding to ongoing environmental change. Processes operating at different levels of biological organization, with corresponding spatial extents and grains and temporal rates, interact with the evolving configuration of environmental conditions to determine range dynamics."
Oral l-thyroxine liquid versus tablet in patients with hypothyroidism without malabsorption: a prospective study,"No consistent data are present in literature about the effectiveness of levothyroxine (l-T4) liquid formulation in patients without malabsorption. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of l-T4 liquid formulation, with l-T4 tablets, in hypothyroid patients without malabsorption or drug interference. One hundred and fifty two patients were recruited. Patients were switched from the l-T4 therapy in tablets, to liquid l-T4 at the same dosage, 30 min before breakfast. Serum thyrotropic hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), and free triiodothyronine (FT3) were re-evaluated after 1–3 months (first control) and 5–7 months (second control) from the switch. TSH values significantly declined with respect to the basal value after the switch to liquid l-T4 both at the first control (P < 0.05) and at the second control (P < 0.01); FT4 and FT3 levels were not significantly changed. We show that liquid l-T4 is more effective than l-T4 tablet in controlling TSH levels in hypothyroid patients without malabsorption, gastric disorders, or drug interference."
Disentangling the effects of tocilizumab on neutrophil survival and function,"The synovial tissue in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) represents a hypoxic environment with up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and cellular infiltrates including neutrophils. Although inhibition of the interleukin (IL)6 receptor pathway by tocilizumab is a potent treatment option for RA, it may also cause adverse effects such as an occasionally high-grade neutropenia. We analysed the impact of tocilizumab on survival, mediator secretion, oxidative burst, phagocytosis and energy availability of high-dose toll-like receptor (TLR)2/4-stimulated neutrophils (to mimic an arthritis flare) under normoxic versus hypoxic conditions. Human neutrophils were purified, pre-treated with varying doses of tocilizumab, dexamethasone or human IgG1 and high-dose-stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) alone—triggering TLR2/4-, LPS plus IL6, or left unstimulated. Cells were then incubated under normoxic (18 % O2) or hypoxic (1 % O2) conditions and subsequently analysed. Neutrophil survival and energy availability were significantly decreased by tocilizumab in a dose-dependent manner in high-dose TLR2/4-stimulated cells, but to a greater extent under normoxia as compared to hypoxia. We also found high-dose LPS-stimulated oxidative burst and phagocytosis of neutrophils to be higher under hypoxic versus normoxic conditions, but this difference was reduced by tocilizumab. Finally, we observed that tocilizumab affected neutrophil mediator secretion as a function of oxygen availability. Tocilizumab is known for both beneficial effects and a higher incidence of neutropenia when treating RA patients. Our results suggest that both effects can at least in part be explained by a reduction in neutrophil survival, a dose-dependent inhibition of hypoxia-induced NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative burst and phagocytosis of infiltrating hypoxic neutrophils and an alteration of mediator secretion."
Effect of High-Dose Simvastatin on Cerebral Blood Flow and Static Autoregulation in Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,Statins may promote vasodilation following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and improve the response to blood pressure elevation. We sought to determine whether simvastatin increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) and alters the response to induced hypertension after SAH.
Fractal analysis of soil physical and chemical properties in five tree-cropping systems in southwestern China,"To quantify changes in soil properties caused by agroforestry management practice, the fractal dimension (Dm) of soil particle size distribution (PSD) and their relationships with soil bulk density, porosity, soil organic matter (SOM) and soil total nitrogen (TN) were investigated in five types of tree-cropping systems in Chongqing, southwestern China. The five tree-cropping systems included (1) Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck system (CO), (2) CO and Ipomoea batatas Lam system (CI), (3) CO and Arachishypogaea (L.) system (CA), (4) CO and Zea mays (L.) system (CZ), and (5) CO and Solanummelongena (L.) system (CS). The results showed that the Dm values ranged from 2.7318 to 2.8062 with an order CO > CS > CZ > CA > CI. The Dm was positively related to clay and silt contents, but negatively related to sand contents. A relatively closer relationship was found between Dm and soil bulk density, non-capillary porosity and soil TN than with capillary porosity, total porosity and SOM. Soil quality was more effectively improved under multiple-species systems than monoculture systems. Our study confirmed that Dm is a useful parameter able to describe and monitor changes of soil properties in agroforestry systems. The results provide scientific reference for evaluating effect of management practices in agroforestry systems and have important implications for sustainable management of tree-cropping systems."
"Estimated Number of People Who Inject Drugs in San Francisco, 2005, 2009, and 2012","Allocation of resources to public health responses depends on having plausible estimates of the size of the population at risk. Unfortunately, the numbers of people who inject drugs (PWID) are difficult to estimate since injection drug use is highly stigmatized. Though estimation methods exist, the robustness of the methods to their assumptions is not well understood. Comparisons between methods are also lacking; information regarding the successive-sampling method is particularly scarce. The present study used several methods—including the successive-sampling method—to produce population size estimates from three rounds of cross-sectional surveys of PWID in San Francisco. It compares these estimates across time and across method. Our summary estimates are 10,158 for 2005, 15,554 for 2009, and 22,500 for 2012. Though the point summaries suggest an increasing population, considerable uncertainty is involved. Comparisons between and within methods reveal high variability, suggesting dependence on assumptions and analytic choices. We conclude that further research is needed to improve upon the estimation methods or develop entirely new ones. Meanwhile, plausible estimates can be achieved via multiple methods while avoiding the pitfall of relying on a single method that may be highly biased and highly imprecise."
Is ‘Resilience’ Maladaptive? Towards an Accurate Lexicon for Climate Change Adaptation,"Climate change adaptation is a rapidly evolving field in conservation biology and includes a range of strategies from resisting to actively directing change on the landscape. The term ‘climate change resilience,’ frequently used to characterize adaptation strategies, deserves closer scrutiny because it is ambiguous, often misunderstood, and difficult to apply consistently across disciplines and spatial and temporal scales to support conservation efforts. Current definitions of resilience encompass all aspects of adaptation from resisting and absorbing change to reorganizing and transforming in response to climate change. However, many stakeholders are unfamiliar with this spectrum of definitions and assume the more common meaning of returning to a previous state after a disturbance. Climate change, however, is unrelenting and intensifying, characterized by both directional shifts in baseline conditions and increasing variability in extreme events. This ongoing change means that scientific understanding and management responses must develop concurrently, iteratively, and collaboratively, in a science-management partnership. Divergent concepts of climate change resilience impede cross-jurisdictional adaptation efforts and complicate use of adaptive management frameworks. Climate change adaptation practitioners require clear terminology to articulate management strategies and the inherent tradeoffs involved in adaptation. Language that distinguishes among strategies that seek to resist change, accommodate change, and direct change (i.e., persistence, autonomous change, and directed change) is prerequisite to clear communication about climate change adaptation goals and management intentions in conservation areas."
DTB-IDS: an intrusion detection system based on decision tree using behavior analysis for preventing APT attacks,"Due to rapid growth of communications and networks, a cyber-attack with malicious codes has been coming as a new paradigm in information security area since last few years. In particular, an advanced persistent threats (APT) attack is bringing out big social issues. The APT attack uses social engineering methods to target various systems for intrusions. It breaks down the security of the target system to leak information or to destroy the system by giving monetary damages on the target. APT attacks make relatively simple attacks such as spear phishing during initial intrusion but a back door is created by leaking the long-term information after initial intrusion, and it transmits the malicious code by analyzing the internal network. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system based on the decision tree using analysis of behavior information to detect APT attacks that intellectually change after intrusion into a system. Furthermore, it can detect the possibility on the initial intrusion and minimize the damage size by quickly responding to APT attacks."
A systematic review of geographical variation in access to chemotherapy,"Rising cancer incidence, the cost of cancer pharmaceuticals and the introduction of the Cancer Drugs Fund in England, but not other United Kingdom(UK) countries means evidence of ‘postcode prescribing’ in cancer is important. There have been no systematic reviews considering access to cancer drugs by geographical characteristics in the UK."
An evolutionary model of bi-flux diffusion processes,"In previous papers, we presented a new theory of bi-flux diffusion processes. The bi-flux consists of the simultaneous flux of two sets of particles scattering with two distinct velocities. The first set obeys the classical Fick’s law, it is the primary flux. The complementary set follows a new law, it is the secondary flux. The primary and secondary fluxes are excited into two distinct energy states. The fundamental energy source for the primary flux is the translational energy or active energy. For the secondary flux, linear and angular momentum, both, contribute to the excitation state. Two cases are analyzed. The first one refers to an isolated system in a particular phase state S1 where active energy decreases continuously. The system tends to an energy state where active energy is absent. In the second case, the system is in a different phase state S2 where active energy increases continuously. The system recovers active energy and tends to a pure Fickian diffusion process. In both processes, the fractions representing the density distribution functions for the primary and secondary fluxes vary with time. It is remarkable that the fourth order equation provides a consistent approach to take into account the rotational energy which otherwise would not be possible with the classical theory. A particular law for the variation of the fraction of particles following Fick’s law is derived. A notion of entropy related to the particular energy states is introduced. Selected examples are presented showing the concentration profile evolution for different rates of energy transfer."
Residual value of inorganic fertilizer and farmyard manure for crop yields and soil fertility after long-term use on a loam soil in Norway,"Mineral NPK fertilizer and manure have been compared since 1922 in a ley–arable rotation. During 1982–2003, cattle manure at 20–60 Mg ha−1 year−1 yielded 10–20 % less than mineral fertilizer at 100 kg N:25 kg P:120 kg K ha−1 year−1. The higher manure rates gave large nutrient surpluses. Both manure and mineral fertilizer had increased soil organic carbon (SOC), by 11.3 and 3.4 Mg ha−1 in 1996. In order to study possible residual effects, no manure was applied in 2004–2007 and mineral fertilizer was withheld from some NPK plots. Effects on yield and nutrient uptake were evaluated in relation to plots with no nutrient supply since 1922 and plots still receiving 100 kg N, 25 kg P and 120 kg K ha−1 annually. No residual response of mineral fertilizer was found, but previous manure use gave large effects. The latter yields remained around 85 % of those obtained with mineral fertilizer. Previous use of both mineral fertilizer and manure still increased available soil nutrients and pH in 2007. Differences between treatments in SOC had by then declined slightly, to 9.7 and 2.8 Mg ha−1 for manure and mineral fertilizer respectively, relative to the unfertilized control. Manure and fertilizer applications were resumed in 2008, except at the highest previous manure rate, where mean residual responses up to 2014, relative to the unfertilized control, amounted to 55 % higher yield and increases in nutrient uptake of 47 kg N, 8 kg P and 53 kg K ha−1."
Hand–tool–tissue interaction forces in neurosurgery for haptic rendering,"Haptics provides sensory stimuli that represent the interaction with a virtual or tele-manipulated object, and it is considered a valuable navigation and manipulation tool during tele-operated surgical procedures. Haptic feedback can be provided to the user via cutaneous information and kinesthetic feedback. Sensory subtraction removes the kinesthetic component of the haptic feedback,
 having only the cutaneous component provided to the user. Such a technique guarantees a stable haptic feedback loop, while it keeps the transparency of the tele-operation system high, which means that the system faithfully replicates and render back the user’s directives. This work focuses on checking whether the interaction forces during a bench model neurosurgery
 operation can lie in the solely cutaneous perception of the human finger pads. If this assumption is found true, it would be possible to exploit sensory subtraction techniques for providing surgeons with feedback from neurosurgery. We measured the forces exerted to surgical tools by three neurosurgeons performing typical actions on a brain phantom, using contact force sensors, while the forces exerted by the tools to the phantom tissue were recorded using a load cell placed under the brain phantom box. The measured surgeon–tool contact forces were 0.01–3.49 N for the thumb and 0.01–6.6 N for index and middle finger, whereas the measured tool–tissue interaction forces were from six to 11 times smaller than the contact forces, i.e., 0.01–0.59 N. The measurements for the
 contact forces fit the range of the cutaneous sensitivity for the human finger pad; thus, we can say that, in a tele-operated robotic neurosurgery scenario, it would possible to render forces at the fingertip level by conveying haptic cues solely through the cutaneous channel of the surgeon’s finger pads. This approach would allow high transparency and high stability of the haptic feedback loop in a tele-operation system."
A novel approach for SEMG signal classification with adaptive local binary patterns,"Feature extraction plays a major role in the pattern recognition process, and this paper presents a novel feature extraction approach,
 adaptive local binary pattern (aLBP). aLBP is built on the local binary pattern (LBP), which is an image processing method, and one-dimensional local binary pattern (1D-LBP). In LBP, each pixel is compared with its neighbors. Similarly, in 1D-LBP, each data in the raw is judged against its neighbors. 1D-LBP extracts feature based on local changes in the signal. Therefore, it has high a potential to be employed in medical purposes. Since, each action or abnormality, which is recorded in SEMG signals, has its own pattern, and via the 1D-LBP these (hidden) patterns may be detected. But, the positions of the neighbors in 1D-LBP are constant depending on the position of the data in the raw. Also, both LBP and 1D-LBP are very sensitive to noise. Therefore, its capacity in detecting hidden patterns is limited. To overcome these drawbacks, aLBP was proposed. In aLBP, the positions of the neighbors and their values can be assigned adaptively via the down-sampling and the smoothing coefficients. Therefore, the potential to detect (hidden) patterns, which may express an illness or an action, is really increased. To validate the proposed feature extraction approach, two different datasets were employed. Achieved accuracies by the proposed approach were higher than obtained results by employed popular feature extraction approaches and the reported results in the literature. Obtained accuracy results were brought out that the proposed method can be employed to investigate SEMG signals. In summary, this work attempts to develop an adaptive feature extraction scheme that can be utilized for extracting features from local changes in different categories of time-varying signals."
Novel Development of a qPCR Assay Based on the rpoB Gene for Rapid Detection of Cronobacter spp.,"A novel real-time PCR (qPCR) assay with internal amplification control based on the rpoB gene was developed for the detection and quantification of Cronobacter spp. Inclusivity and exclusivity of the qPCR assay were tested on a strain collection containing 19 Cronobacter and 26 non-Cronobacter strains. All Cronobacter strains were successfully identified, whereas no cross-reactivity was observed with non-Cronobacter strains. The sensitivity of the qPCR assay for pure culture and powdered infant formula (PIF) without enrichment was 3.44 log CFU/ml(g) (2.74 × 103 CFU/ml(g)). When the qPCR assay was applied to artificially contaminated PIF after a 12-h enrichment step, as few as 0.03 log CFU/ml (1.06 × 100 CFU/ml) of C. sakazakii could be detected. The limit of detection of the qPCR assay was not reduced by the presence of 8 log CFU/ml of Salmonella Enteritidis in PIF. A total of 70 food samples were analyzed for the presence of Cronobacter spp., out of which 3 dry cereal products, 5 maternal milk, and 1 infant food formula were found as positive by qPCR. The results obtained by qPCR were consistent with those obtained by culture-based method. Results from this study demonstrate that the qPCR assay is a rapid, specific, and accurate method suitable for Cronobacter detection in foods."
Combined Application of Essential Oil Compounds and Bacteriophage to Inhibit Growth of Staphylococcus aureus In Vitro,"Staphylococcus aureus is considered an important human pathogen. This study aimed to investigate the combination of essential oil compounds (EOCs) and bacteriophage as alternative antimicrobials to control S. aureus in vitro. Here, four EOCs (alpha-pinene, 3-carene, (+)-limonene, (1S)-(−)-β-pinene) were evaluated by disc diffusion assay (DDA) and growth inhibition assay (GIA) to determine inhibitory effects against five strains of S. aureus. Phage adsorption assays were performed with phage K up to 120 h at 6, 13, and 37 °C to determine lytic activity. Combinations of phage K and EOCs against S. aureus were also evaluated at 37 °C. Alpha-pinene exhibited significantly greater inhibition towards S. aureus strains when compared to other EOCs tested by the DDA. GIAs indicate that all S. aureus strains exhibited significantly reduced growth (P < 0.006) over a 48-h period when exposed to EOCs. Phage adsorption assays indicate that phage K has high lytic activity at 37 °C with at least a 1.5-log increase in the number of plaque-forming units (PFU) over 6 h when compared to 6 and 13 °C. S. aureus strains showed significantly reduced growth (P < 0.05) when treated with combined phage K and EOCs. Results from the combined effect of EOC and phage indicate that phage alone inhibits S. aureus in vitro at 37 °C as effectively as EOCs alone or in combination with phage with variability between strains. The results from DDA, GIA, and phage adsorption assays indicate that select EOCs and phage K can be used as antimicrobials against S. aureus in vitro with potential application in situ."
The promise of pick-the-winners contests for producing crowd probability forecasts,"This paper considers pick-the-winners contests as a simple method for harnessing the wisdom of crowds to produce probability forecasts (and be used as a business forecasting tool). Pick-the-winners contests are those in which players pick the outcomes of selected future binary events with a prize going to the player with the most correct picks. In contrast to soliciting probability forecasts from experts (for which competition among the forecasters leads to exaggerated and less accurate probabilities), this paper shows that competition among players is to be encouraged because it improves the accuracy of the resulting crowd probability forecasts. This improvement comes because the competition not only discourages the overbetting of favorites that occurs if prizes are awarded based on absolute performance, but also helps mitigate the public knowledge bias that occurs if everyone reports truthfully. In addition to the theoretical arguments, the paper analyzes picks from 6 years of pick-the-winners contests involving hundreds of players and 1037 college lacrosse games to find that the crowd proportions outperformed two benchmark sets of probabilities."
Hydrogen sulfide partly mediates abscisic acid-induced heat tolerance in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) suspension cultured cells,"Abscisic acid (ABA), a plant hormone, plays crucial roles in plant growth, development and response to environmental stress. Recently, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) also has emerged similar functions, but interaction between ABA and H2S in the acquisition of heat tolerance is not clear. In this study, pretreatment of tobacco suspension cultured cells with ABA improved the survival percentage and regrowth ability, alleviated a decrease in cell vitality, increase in malondialdehyde content and electrolyte leakage of cells under heat stress, suggesting that ABA pretreatment could improve the heat tolerance of tobacco cells. In addition, treatment with ABA induced the accumulation of endogenous H2S in both tobacco cells and culture medium, increased the activity of l-cysteine desulfhydrase, a key enzyme in H2S biosynthesis. Also, ABA-induced heat tolerance was enhanced by addition of NaHS, a H2S donor, but weakened by dl-propargylglycine (specific inhibitor of H2S biosynthesis) and hypotaurine (H2S scavenger) respectively. These results suggest that ABA pretreatment could improve the heat tolerance of tobacco suspension cultured cells, and H2S, at least partly, mediated the acquisition of heat tolerance induced by ABA."
A novel Dreb2-type gene from Carica papaya confers tolerance under abiotic stress,"The ethylene-responsive element-binding factors AP2/ERF compose one of the largest families of transcription factors in plants. Dreb2-type gene from Carica papaya L. cv. Maradol was found to be a member of the AP2/ERF family and contains a conserved APETALA 2 (AP2) domain located within the group IV of the AP2/ERF superfamily. CpDreb2-type gene is differentially expressed under stress by extreme temperatures. Moreover, genetic transformation of tobacco plants that overexpress the CpDreb2-type gene showed an increase amount of proline and a greater tolerance level to low and high temperature as well as drought experiments. CpDREB2-type protein::GFP is localized mainly in the nuclei of cells from specific organs such as roots and leaves in tobacco seedlings. Our results indicate that CpDreb2-type gene can be used to gain tolerance to extreme conditions of temperature and drought in other plants."
Structural Studies of Component of Lysoamidase Bacteriolytic Complex from Lysobacter sp. XL1,"The lysoamidase bacteriolytic complex (LBC) comprising five enzymes (L1–L5) is secreted into the culture liquid by gram-negative bacterium Lysobacter sp. XL1. The medicinal agent lysoamidase has a broad-antimicrobial spectrum. Bacteriolytic protease L1 belongs to the LBC. Recombinant L1 protease of Lysobacter sp. XL1 was expressed, purified to homogeneity and crystallized. The X-ray structure of L1 at 1.35 Å resolution has been determined using the synchrotron data and the molecular replacement method. L1 protease is a thermostable whose thermal unfolding proceeds in one step without forming stable intermediates. Structural information concerning L1 will contribute to the development of new-generation antimicrobial drugs, whose application will not be accompanied by the selection of resistant microorganisms."
Trivariate Modeling of Interparental Conflict and Adolescent Emotional Security: An Examination of Mother–Father–Child Dynamics,"Recognizing the significance of interacting family subsystems, the present study addresses how interparental conflict is linked to adolescent emotional security as a function of parental gender. A total of 272 families with a child at 12.60 years of age (133 boys, 139 girls) were invited to participate each year for three consecutive years. A multi-informant method was used, along with trivariate models to test the associations among mothers, fathers, and their adolescent children’s behaviors. The findings from separate models of destructive and constructive interparental conflict revealed intricate linkages among family members. In the model of destructive interparental conflict, mothers and fathers predicted each other’s conflict behaviors over time. Moreover, adolescents’ exposure to negativity expressed by either parent dampened their emotional security. Consistent with child effects models, adolescent emotional insecurity predicted fathers’ destructive conflict behaviors. As for the model of constructive interparental conflict, fathers predicted mothers’ conflict behaviors over time. Adolescents’ exposure to fathers’ constructive conflict behaviors also enhanced their sense of emotional security. Consistent with child effects models, adolescent emotional security predicted mothers’ and fathers’ constructive conflict behaviors. These findings extended the family and the adolescent literature by indicating that family processes are multiidirectional, involving multiple dyads in the study of parents’ and adolescents’ functioning. Contributions of these findings to the understanding of interparental conflict and emotional security in adolescence are discussed."
"Isolation of hydroquinone (benzene-1,4-diol) metabolite from halotolerant Bacillus methylotrophicus MHC10 and its inhibitory activity towards bacterial pathogens","A halotolerant bacterial isolate-MHC10 with broad spectrum antibacterial activity against clinical pathogens was isolated from saltpans located in Tuticorin and Chennai (India). 16S rRNA gene analysis of MHC10 revealed close similarity to that of Bacillus methylotrophicus. The culture conditions of B. methylotrophicus MHC10 strain were optimized for antibacterial production using different carbon and nitrogen sources, as well as varying temperature, pH, sodium chloride (NaCl) concentrations and incubation periods. The maximum antibacterial activity of B.
methylotrophicus MHC10 was attained when ZMB was optimized with 1 % (w/v) glucose, 0.1 % (w/v) soybean meal which corresponded to a C/N ratio of 38.83, temperature at 37 °C, pH 7.0 and 8 % NaCl. The activity remained stable between 72 and 96 h and then drastically decreased after 96 h. Solvent extraction followed by chromatographic purification steps led to the isolation of hydroquinone (benzene-1,4-diol). The structure of the purified compound was elucidated based on FTIR, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The compound exhibited efficient antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Gram-positive pathogens ranged from 15.625 to 62.5 µg/mL−1, while it was between 7.81 and 250 µg/mL−1 for Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. This is the first report of hydroquinone produced by halotolerant B. methylotrophicus exhibiting promising antibacterial activity."
"Inflammatory, lipid, and body composition responses to interval training or moderate aerobic training","The goal of this study was to compare the effect of work- and duration-matched interval training (HIIT) versus moderate aerobic endurance training (ET) on acute and chronic inflammation, along with changes in the lipid profile, to determine which may be more beneficial for improving cardiovascular health."
Gender differences in the perception of difficulty of self-management in patients with diabetes mellitus: a mixed-methods approach,The aim of this study was to examine the challenges of self-management of diabetes comparing gender.
Separate waste collection in Italy: the role of socio-cultural factors and targets set by law,"The aim of this paper was twofold: on the one hand, we analyse the results achieved in terms of percentages of separate collection in Italy by testing the effectiveness of Legislative Decree 152/2006 in improving the separate collection process; and on the other hand, we investigate on some of the factors, related to the sociocultural local context, that could explain the different impacts of the law in the three macro-areas considered (North, Central and South Italy). To this purpose, an econometric analysis on the Italian regions for the 1996–2013 period is performed, comparing the period before (1996–2006) and after (2006–2013) the date of entry into force of the new law. The results show the effectiveness of Legislative Decree 152/2006 in promoting separate collection, although a regional difference in terms of separate collection rate is observed. Northern regions proved to be more dynamic and reactive to the above-mentioned legislation, while Central and especially Southern regions achieved poorer results in moving to higher separate waste collection rates. Finally, our work provides evidence on some local factors that may have hampered an effective policy implementation in Southern regions, among them, the presence of criminal activities and the lack of citizen participation in politics."
Non-circular nano-inclusions with interface effects that achieve uniform internal strain fields in an elastic plane under anti-plane shear,"This paper verifies the existence of a single non-circular nano-inclusion with interface effect that achieves a uniform internal strain field in an elastic plane under uniform remote anti-plane shear loadings. The uniform strain field inside such a non-circular inclusion is prescribed via perturbations of the uniform strain field inside the analogous circular inclusion, and the unknown (non-circular) inclusion shape is characterized by a conformal mapping whose unknown coefficients are determined by a system of nonlinear equations. Numerical examples show various shapes of non-circular nano-inclusions with interface effects that achieve uniform internal strain fields. It is found that such a non-circular inclusion shape depends on the inclusion size and the specific uniform internal strain field. In particular, for given interface shear modulus and residual tension, it is shown that the minimum inclusion size required to guarantee the existence of such a non-circular inclusion usually increases as the shear modulus of the inclusion approaches that of the matrix. Moreover, the relationship between the shear traction jump across the interface and the curvature of the interface is discussed in detail for such non-circular inclusions."
Multiplicative (generalized)-derivation in semiprime rings,"Let R be a semiprime ring and \(\alpha \) any mapping on R. A mapping \(F:R\rightarrow R\) is called multiplicative (generalized)-derivation if \(F(xy)=F(x)y+xd(y)\) for all \(x, y \in R\), where \(d:R\rightarrow R\) is any map (not necessarily additive). In this paper our main motive is to study the commutativity of semiprime rings and nature of mappings."
Early experience of duet laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (duet-LDG) using three abdominal ports for gastric carcinoma: surgical technique and comparison with conventional laparoscopic distal gastrectomy,"Reduced port laparoscopic surgery may lead to less pain and better cosmetic outcome than conventional surgery. Also, it requires fewer assistants and abdominal ports. Recently, some experts have reported operative techniques and outcomes of reduced port laparoscopic gastrectomy. In this study, we sought to introduce our techniques of duet laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (duet-LDG) using three abdominal ports and surgical outcomes of early experience of this procedure."
Long and short range order structural analysis of In-situ formed biphasic calcium phosphates,"Biphasic calcium phosphates (BCP) have attracted considerable attention as a bone graft substitute. In this study, BCP were prepared by aqueous co-precipitation and calcination method. The crystal phases of in-situ formed BCP consisting of hydroxyapatite (HAp) and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) were controlled by the degree of calcium deficiency of precursors. The long and short range order structures of biphasic mixtures was investigated using Rietveld refinement technique and high resolution Raman spectroscopy. The refined structural parameters of in-situ formed BCP confirmed that all the investigated structures have crystallized in the corresponding hexagonal (space group P63/m) and rhombohedral (space group R3c) structures."
Myocyte-derived Tnfsf14 is a survival factor necessary for myoblast differentiation and skeletal muscle regeneration,"Adult skeletal muscle tissue has a uniquely robust capacity for regeneration, which gradually declines with aging or is compromised in muscle diseases. The cellular mechanisms regulating adult myogenesis remain incompletely understood. Here we identify the cytokine tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 14 (Tnfsf14) as a positive regulator of myoblast differentiation in culture and muscle regeneration in vivo. We find that Tnfsf14, as well as its cognate receptors herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) and lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR), are expressed in both differentiating myocytes and regenerating myofibers. Depletion of Tnfsf14 or either receptor inhibits myoblast differentiation and promotes apoptosis. Our results also suggest that Tnfsf14 regulates myogenesis by supporting cell survival and maintaining a sufficient pool of cells for fusion. In addition, we show that Akt mediates the survival and myogenic function of Tnfsf14. Importantly, local knockdown of Tnfsf14 is found to impair injury-induced muscle regeneration in a mouse model, affirming an important physiological role for Tnfsf14 in myogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that localized overexpression of Tnfsf14 potently enhances muscle regeneration, and that this regenerative capacity of Tnfsf14 is dependent on Akt signaling. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel regulator of skeletal myogenesis and implicate Tnfsf14 in future therapeutic development."
Public knowledge about white-collar crime: an exploratory study,"A growing body of research has revealed that the financial cost and physical harmfulness of white-collar crime overshadow the impact of street crime on society. To date, scholarly efforts that have investigated societal response to crimes of the powerful have limited their field of inquiry to public opinions about white-collar crime. Although these studies have provided valuable empirical evidence of a growing concern among U.S. citizens regarding the danger posed by elite offenses, their failure to include a valid measure of lay knowledge about white-collar crime significantly limits our ability to infer the extent to which the public is familiar with the scope and magnitude of this social issue. The present study seeks to address such limitations by providing the first measure of public knowledge about white-collar crime. Four hundred and eight participants completed an online questionnaire that measured their knowledge about white-collar crime. Results revealed that participants were not sufficiently informed about it and suggest the existence of popular “myths” about crimes of the powerful. These findings have important implications insofar as white-collar crime awareness programs are concerned. Hypothetically, public demand for tougher sanctions against high-status offenders could result from exposure to relevant information about white-collar crime. Nevertheless, “myth” adherence might also undermine the effect of increased awareness on prosecutorial efforts against upper-class criminality."
Intrinsic groundwater vulnerability determination at the aquifer scale: a methodology coupling travel time estimation and rating methods,"Groundwater vulnerability has been subject of much research due to the valuable information it provides concerning groundwater protection and exploitation potential. Up to now, most groundwater vulnerability studies adopt subjective systems of rating the various factors and subsequently, their results are often ambiguous and contradicting. Within the present study a methodology for the estimation of intrinsic groundwater vulnerability at the aquifer scale is presented. The methodology is based on travel time estimation from specified sources of pollution to the aquifer. Besides the deterministic calculation of travel times, the methodology provides a rating system for each pollution source, based on its relative severity and the estimated threat that it poses to the aquifer. Therefore, it can be regarded as a hybrid method that couples the advantages provided by the physically based methods with those of the subjective rating systems. The methodology is applied to the Neon Sidirochorion aquifer, Northeastern Greece, an overexploited aquifer where river waters, sea waters and lake waters interact, causing groundwater quality deterioration to the aquifer. The results indicated that the proposed groundwater vulnerability assessment methodology is well capturing pollution related to saltwater intrusion and agricultural activities, while it is concluded that the conceptual model is significantly affecting the vulnerability assessment results and therefore has to be previously developed."
"Resistivity imaging survey to delineate subsurface seepage of hydrocarbon contaminated water at Karbala Governorate, Iraq","This research is an attempt to accomplish a 3-D resistivity imaging survey, which was carried out near a water well contaminated with hydrocarbon materials in Karbala governorate. Two-dimensional resistivity imaging measurements were collected along four parallel profiles, using a Wenner array with electrode spacing of 1 m. The RES3DINV program was used to invert the apparent resistivity data. The results displayed a resistivity distribution of the subsurface in a three-dimensional volume. Thus, both the horizontal and vertical extents of the contaminated zone were displayed. This technique revealed a low resistivity zone at depth ranges from 3 to 6 m in the investigation area, but the seepage starts at depth ranges between 2 and 3 m and continues down depth (may be to the groundwater level). This low resistivity zone is the most likely location for a subsurface seepage of contaminated water. It is clear that the sufficient measurement points along 2-D lines in a small area can increase the 3-D imaging resolution, and nearly real 3-D imaging can be achieved, when the size of subsurface anomaly compared with the electrode spacing (a) of the Wenner array is taken into consideration."
Effect of a polypropylene ((PP) patch containing isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) root on the shelf-life of low-salt Myeong-ran Jeotgal,"The effect of isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish root in the vapor phase on shelf-life extension of low-salt Myeong-ran Jeotgal was evaluated. Microbiological analysis showed that total viable cell counts, lactic acid bacterial counts, and proteolytic bacterial counts were inhibited in 0.50 and 0.75mL of ITCs (200 mg/mL)-treated Myeong-ran Jeotgal at 5 and 10°C. Chemical analysis revealed that 0.50 and 0.75 mL of ITCs (200mg/mL) treatments retarded formation of volatile basic nitrogen and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and reduced accumulation of alkaline compounds in 0.50 and 0.75 mL of ITCs (200mg/mL)-treated Myeong-ran Jeotgal. Arrhenius equations and sensory evaluations confirmed that the freshness of 0.75mL of ITCs (200mg/mL)-treated Myeong-ran Jeotgal was better preserved than for controls and showed that 0.75 mL of ITCs (200 mg/mL)-treated Myeong-ran Jeotgal had a shelf life that was approximately 4 days at 5°C and 2 days at 10°C longer than controls."
Quality comparison of sweet flour pastes produced via natural and temperature-controlled fermentation,"The quality of sweet flour pastes (SFP) produced via natural and temperature-controlled fermentation was investigated. Temperature-controlled fermentation shortened the production time with no significant (p<0.05) differences between sample types in amino nitrogen, total acid, reducing sugar, and organic acid concentrations observed at the end of fermentation. Naturally fermented SFP exhibited higher concentrations of free amino acids than temperature-controlled fermented SFP. Analysis of SFP volatile compounds showed that naturally fermented SFP samples had higher concentrations of aroma constituents. Ethyl palmitate was the dominant ester in SFP with a 5.2× higher content of ethyl palmitate than for naturally fermented SFP. In addition, 4-ethyl guaiacol and 4-vinyl guaiacol were only identified in naturally fermented SFP samples. Temperature-controlled fermentation accelerates the production process, and naturally fermented SFP exhibited a higher quality."
Comparison of antioxidant activities and volatile components using GC/MS from leaves of Korean purple perilla (Perilla frutescens) grown in a greenhouse,"Volatile profiles using GC/MS with hydrodistillation extraction and antioxidant effects against DPPH and ABTS radicals of purple perilla (Perilla fructescens) leaf extracts from plants grown in greenhouse were investigated. Volatiles were characterized as 25 components of 7 types including 2 alcohols, 3 furans, 3 esters, 2 aldehydes, 4 ketones, 10 hydrocarbons, and an acid. The dominant component was perillaketone (>54%) in total average content. Isoegomaketone was the second major compound (21%), followed by α-bergamotene (8.7%) and β-caryophyllene (5.7%). Contents of these 4 major components differed between cultivars, especially perillaketone and isoegomaketone (39.0-74.1 and Not Detected-36.9%, respectively). Antioxidant properties of methanol extracts containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) showed differences with highest effects at 50 μg/mL. The main volatiles of perilla were affected by genetics and cultivars more than by environmental conditions. Antioxidant activities are probably correlated with phenolic and anthocyanin contents."
Investigating possible correlations between the porosimetry and insoluble residue content of Malta’s Lower Globigerina Limestone,"The millenary use of Lower Globigerina Limestone (LGL) as the main building stone of the Maltese Islands is testimony to the importance of this resource to the local building industry. Today, the pressing need to conserve Malta’s rich patrimony of archaeological/historical masonry buildings and structures drives research in this field, particularly in view of the observed variable durability of this stone type. LGL has been described as a moderately weak calcarenite characterised by a predominance of calcite (86–99 %) and high porosity. In theory, these physical properties should make this type of stone particularly susceptible to deterioration involving (a) mechanisms of capillary salt-laden moisture accumulation and movement together with (b) thermodynamic changes in soluble salts during dissolution and crystallisation cycles. The study reported here forms part of a wider research programme aimed at characterising this resource. In this work, we assessed the durability of the LGL in a temperate Mediterranean climate characterised by two main factors, namely (i) a salt-laden marine environment and (ii) relatively short spans of heavy precipitation alternated with longer periods of virtual drought. The main aim of the study was to analyse macro/microporosity variations and minute, yet quantifiable, fluctuations in minor geochemical constituents of the stone with respect to observed weathering characteristics and accelerated crystallisation damage test results. This was achieved through systematic sampling and testing of retrieved core samples extracted from dimension-stone quarrying areas in Malta."
Compressed \(\text {k}\mathsf {^d}\text {-tree}\) for temporal graphs,"Temporal graphs represent vertices and binary relations that change along time. The work in this paper proposes to represent temporal graphs as cells in a 4D binary matrix: two dimensions to represent extreme vertices of an edge and two dimensions to represent the temporal interval when the edge exists. This strategy generalizes the idea of the adjacency matrix for storing static graphs. The proposed structure called Compressed \(\text {k}\mathsf {^d}\text {-tree}\) (\(\text {ck}\mathsf {^d}\text {-tree}\)) is capable of dealing with unclustered data with a good use of space. The \(\text {ck}\mathsf {^d}\text {-tree}\) uses asymptotically the same space than the (worst case) lower bound for storing cells in a 4D binary matrix, without considering any regularity. Techniques that group leaves into buckets and compress nodes with few children show to improve the performance in time and space. An experimental evaluation compares the \(\text {ck}\mathsf {^d}\text {-tree}\) with \(\text {k}\mathsf {^d}\text {-tree}\) (the d-dimensional extension of the \(\text {k}\mathsf {^2}\text {-tree}\)) and with other up-to-date compressed data structures based on inverted indexes and \(\mathsf {Wavelet}\text { Tree}\)s, showing the potential use of the \(\text {ck}\mathsf {^d}\text {-tree}\) for different types of temporal graphs."

Reciprocity in Human-Robot Interaction: A Quantitative Approach Through the Prisoner’s Dilemma and the Ultimatum Game,"Reciprocity is an important factor in human–human interaction, so it can be expected that it should also play a major role in human–robot interaction (HRI). Participants in our study played the Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma Game (RPDG) and the mini Ultimatum Game (mUG) with robot and human agents, with the agents using either Tit for Tat (TfT) or Random strategies. As part of the study we also measured the perceived personality traits in the agents using the TIPI test after every round of RPDG and mUG. The results show that the participants collaborated more with humans than with a robot, however they tended to be equally reciprocal with both agents. The experiment also showed the TfT strategy as the most profitable strategy; affecting collaboration, reciprocation, profit and joint profit in the game. Most of the participants tended to be fairer with the human agent in mUG. Furthermore, robots were perceived as less open and agreeable than humans. Consciousness, extroversion and emotional stability were perceived roughly the same in humans and robots. TfT strategy became associated with an extroverted and agreeable personality in the agents. We could observe that the norm of reciprocity applied in HRI has potential implications for robot design."
Improving Implementation of a School-Based Program for Traumatized Students: Identifying Factors that Promote Teacher Support and Collaboration,"The purpose of this study was to delineate the factors that influence teachers’ support and involvement in successful implementation of an early intervention, school-based trauma program, Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS). In schools that had already used the intervention for at least one school year, we interviewed teachers and other stakeholders to understand what factors influence teacher support and clarify the role teachers desire in the implementation process. This paper also illuminates barriers to their support and collaboration and identifies methods to improve future implementation and sustainability. We conducted 40 semi-structured qualitative telephone interviews with school staff across three geographic regions in the USA. Participants were asked about their experiences with CBITS in their schools and asked to share both facilitators and challenges to implementation. Four key themes emerged: Support for CBITS was related to teachers’ perceived need for a trauma program on campus; teachers struggled with the competing priorities of balancing students’ social-emotional needs with their missing class to attend CBITS; teachers desired more direct communication with clinicians; and teachers felt they needed more trauma education. Suggested improvements include acknowledging teacher concerns about lost instructional time for CBITS sessions and offering groups during non-core academic instruction, expanding trauma education for teachers, so they can better respond to and connect traumatized students with intervention services, including regular consultation between teacher and clinicians about participating students, and improvements in academic performance following the intervention should be shared with teachers to improve their support."

Formation of terrestrial planets in disks with different surface density profiles,"We present the results of an extensive study of the final stage of terrestrial planet formation in disks with different surface density profiles and for different orbital configurations of Jupiter and Saturn. We carried out simulations in the context of the classical model with disk surface densities proportional to \({r^{-0.5}}, {r^{-1}}\) and \({r^{-1.5}}\), and also using partially depleted, non-uniform disks as in the recent model of Mars formation by Izidoro et al. (Astrophys J 782:31, 2014). The purpose of our study is to determine how the final assembly of planets and their physical properties are affected by the total mass of the disk and its radial profile. Because as a result of the interactions of giant planets with the protoplanetary disk, secular resonances will also play important roles in the orbital assembly and properties of the final terrestrial planets, we will study the effect of these resonances as well. In that respect, we divide this study into two parts. When using a partially depleted disk (Part 1), we are particularly interested in examining the effect of secular resonances on the formation of Mars and orbital stability of terrestrial planets. When using the disk in the classical model (Part 2), our goal is to determine trends that may exist between the disk surface density profile and the final properties of terrestrial planets. In the context of the depleted disk model, results of our study show that in general, the \(\nu _5\) resonance does not have a significant effect on the dynamics of planetesimals and planetary embryos, and the final orbits of terrestrial planets. However, \(\nu _6\) and \(\nu _{16}\) resonances play important roles in clearing their affecting areas. While these resonances do not alter the orbits of Mars and other terrestrial planets, they strongly deplete the region of the asteroid belt ensuring that no additional mass will be scattered into the accretion zone of Mars so that it can maintain its mass and orbital stability. In the context of the classical model, the effects of these resonances are stronger in disks with less steep surface density profiles. Our results indicate that when considering the classical model (Part 2), the final planetary systems do not seem to show a trend between the disk surface density profile and the mean number of the final planets, their masses, time of formation, and distances to the central star. Some small correlations were observed where, for instance, in disks with steeper surface density profiles, the final planets were drier, or their water contents decreased when Saturn was added to the simulations. However, in general, the final orbital and physical properties of terrestrial planets seem to vary from one system to another and depend on the mass of the disk, the spatial distribution of protoplanetary bodies (i.e., disk surface density profile), and the initial orbital configuration of giant planets. We present results of our simulations and discuss their implications for the formation of Mars and other terrestrial planets, as well as the physical properties of these objects such as their masses and water contents."
Construction of cellulose/nanosilver sponge materials and their antibacterial activities for infected wounds healing,"Antibacterial sponges with the silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were constructed by freeze-drying of cellulose composite hydrogels, which were prepared in NaOH/urea aqueous system with cooling, where the interconnecting pores of the sponge not only were used as micro-reactors to synthesize Ag nanoparticles but also inhibited the aggregation of Ag NPs. The Ag nanoparticles with size range from 4 to 50 nm, depending on the AgNO3 concentration, were uniformly immobilized in the cellulose/nanosilver sponges. The cellulose/nanosilver composite materials exhibited excellent antibacterial activities. Further, in vivo tests confirmed that the composite sponges had an ability to accelerate infected wound healing, as a result of the existence of the antibacterial Ag nanoparticles and absorbing capacity for wound exudate. The experimental data strongly encouraged the use of cellulose/nanosilver composite sponge as antibacterial materials, especially in case of serious wound infection. The composite cellulose sponge containing Ag nanoparticles provided an alternative material for the application of the infected wound healing."
A novel decision making approach based on intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets,"Molodtsov’s soft set was initiated as a general emerging mathematical tool to deal with uncertain problems, which is free from the limitations of other traditional mathematical tool. It has been proven that decision making based on soft sets boom in recent years in many different fields. In this paper, a novel multi-criteria ranking approach is generalized based on intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets. There will be only one optimal decision among all the selections, instead of several or all by this method. Firstly, we present several notations named degree-hesitation function, score function and accuracy function to intuitionistic fuzzy soft set, and then give several principles based on these concepts. Some different decision making algorithms can be got for different preference, and a concrete algorithm is proposed in a certain condition. Moreover, we introduced the weighted ranking approach to the weighted intuitionistic fuzzy soft set. At the same time, both of these situations are proved to be effective with the help of examples. Finally, we conclude the research and further research directions."
Knowledge reduction of dynamic covering decision information systems caused by variations of attribute values,"In practical situations, it is time-consuming to conduct knowledge reduction of dynamic covering decision information systems caused by variations of attribute values with the non-incremental approaches. In this paper, motivated by the need for knowledge reduction of dynamic covering decision information systems, we introduce incremental approaches to computing the type-1 and type-2 characteristic matrices for constructing the second and sixth lower and upper approximations of sets in dynamic covering approximation spaces caused by revising attribute attributes. We also employ several examples to explain how to compute the second and sixth lower and upper approximations of sets in dynamic covering approximation spaces. Then we propose the incremental algorithms for computing the second and sixth lower and upper approximations of sets and employ experimental results to illustrate the incremental algorithms are effective to calculate the second and sixth lower and upper approximations of sets in dynamic covering approximation spaces. Finally, we give two examples to show how to conduct knowledge reduction of dynamic covering decision information systems caused by altering attribute values."
Therapeutic mammoplasty combining partial mastectomy with nipple-areola grafting for patients with early breast cancer: a case series,Therapeutic mammoplasty (TM) for breast cancer is a widely practiced oncoplastic technique. Intraductal spread towards the nipple or the location of the cancerous lesion on the central breast may become a contraindication for breast-conserving surgery. We herein report the results of TM in such cases.
The roles of temperature and thickness of barrier layer in the electrodeposition efficiency of nickel inside anodic alumina templates,"As a dielectric interface, the alumina barrier layer has so far been shown to influence the electrochemical deposition mechanism of different types of ions inside nanopores of anodic alumina templates. Here, the roles of temperature (Tb) and thickness of the barrier layer in the electrodeposition efficiency (EE) of nickel inside 45 nm pore diameter anodic alumina templates, made by the two step anodization process, are reported. By performing a pulsed electrodeposition method, the former role is investigated by increasing Tb from 10 to 50 °C, whereas the latter role is realized by decreasing the final anodization voltage (V
th) from 40 V to 12, 16 and 20 V. While using Tb ~ 20 °C and V
th = 16 V leads to a maximum EE of 65 % in the fabrication of 8.5 μm long nickel nanowires (NWs), the use of Tb ~ 50 °C is indicative of the growth of approximately 3 μm long NWs, resulted from an EE of 20 %. However, by increasing V
th up to 20 V, EE reaches a plateau with an average value of 45 % as a function of Tb. On the other hand, although the crystallinity of the resulting NWs increases by increasing Tb up to 30 °C, the magnetic properties are found to be almost independent of V
th and Tb."
Residual value of inorganic fertilizer and farmyard manure for crop yields and soil fertility after long-term use on a loam soil in Norway,"Mineral NPK fertilizer and manure have been compared since 1922 in a ley–arable rotation. During 1982–2003, cattle manure at 20–60 Mg ha−1 year−1 yielded 10–20 % less than mineral fertilizer at 100 kg N:25 kg P:120 kg K ha−1 year−1. The higher manure rates gave large nutrient surpluses. Both manure and mineral fertilizer had increased soil organic carbon (SOC), by 11.3 and 3.4 Mg ha−1 in 1996. In order to study possible residual effects, no manure was applied in 2004–2007 and mineral fertilizer was withheld from some NPK plots. Effects on yield and nutrient uptake were evaluated in relation to plots with no nutrient supply since 1922 and plots still receiving 100 kg N, 25 kg P and 120 kg K ha−1 annually. No residual response of mineral fertilizer was found, but previous manure use gave large effects. The latter yields remained around 85 % of those obtained with mineral fertilizer. Previous use of both mineral fertilizer and manure still increased available soil nutrients and pH in 2007. Differences between treatments in SOC had by then declined slightly, to 9.7 and 2.8 Mg ha−1 for manure and mineral fertilizer respectively, relative to the unfertilized control. Manure and fertilizer applications were resumed in 2008, except at the highest previous manure rate, where mean residual responses up to 2014, relative to the unfertilized control, amounted to 55 % higher yield and increases in nutrient uptake of 47 kg N, 8 kg P and 53 kg K ha−1."
"Paenibacillus
puernese sp. nov., a β-glucosidase-producing bacterium isolated from Pu’er tea","A Gram-staining-positive, endospore-forming, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium, designated as DCY97T, was isolated from ripened Pu’er tea and was identified by using a polyphasic approach. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain DCY97T was closely related to Paenibacillus dongdonensis KUDC0114T (98.0 %), Paenibacillus oceanisediminis L10T (97.7 %), and Paenibacillus barcinonensis BP-23T (97.2 %). The phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics of strain DCY97T matched with the characteristics of members belonging to the genus Paenibacillus. The major identified polar lipids included phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and diphosphatidylglycerol. The predominant quinone was MK-7. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0 (35.1 %), anteiso-C16:0 (19.0 %), and iso-C16:0 (13.9 %). The peptidoglycan cell wall was composed of meso-diaminopimelic acids, alanine, and d-glutamic acid. The genomic DNA G + C content was determined to be 46.7 mol%. The DNA–DNA relatedness between strain DCY97T and Paenibacillus dongdonensis KCTC 33221T, Paenibacillus oceanisediminis KACC 16023T, Paenibacillus barcinonensis KCTC 13019T were 27, 19, and 10 %, respectively. Based on the genotypic, phenotypic, and chemotaxonomic characteristics, strain DCY97T is considered as a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus puernese sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is DCY97T (=KCTC 33596T = JCM 140369T)."
Factors Influencing Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Uptake in Emergency Medical Services Workers: A Concept Mapping Approach,"Seasonal influenza has serious impacts on morbidity and mortality and has a significant economic toll through lost workforce time and strains on the health system. Health workers, particularly emergency medical services (EMS) workers have the potential to transmit influenza to those in their care, yet little is known of the factors that influence EMS workers’ decisions regarding seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) uptake, a key factor in reducing potential for transmitting disease. This study utilizes a modified Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model as a guiding framework to explore the factors that influence SIV uptake in EMS workers. Concept mapping, which consists of six-stages (preparation, generation, structuring, representation, interpretation, and utilization) that use quantitative and qualitative approaches, was used to identify participants’ perspectives towards SIV. This study identified nine EMS-conceptualized factors that influence EMS workers’ vaccination intent and behavior. The EMS-conceptualized factors align with the modified TPB model and suggest the need to consider community-wide approaches that were not initially conceptualized in the model. Additionally, the expansion of non-pharmaceutical measures went above and beyond original conceptualization. Overall, this study demonstrates the need to develop customized interventions such as messages highlighting the importance of EMS workers receiving SIV as the optimum solution. EMS workers who do not intend to receive the SIV should be provided with accurate information on the SIV to dispel misconceptions. Finally, EMS workers should also receive interventions which promote voluntary vaccination, encouraging them to be proactive in the health decisions they make for themselves."

Genotypic Variation in Physiological Traits Under High Temperature Stress in Maize,"Maize (Zea mays L.) is a major cereal crop in India and worldwide whose production and productivity are greatly affected by high temperature stress. Twenty-one maize genotypes were staggered sown and evaluated for the variations in different physiological traits under high temperature stress. Observations were recorded for net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, leaf temperature, canopy temperature, maximum quantum yield PSII photochemistry (F
v/F
m), SPAD, ASI, stover and grain yield. Meteorological data of cropping season for first and second date of sowings showed maximum and mean day time temperature of 37.6, 37.2 and 41.4, 37.5 °C, respectively, during reproductive stage. These temperatures were optimal for photosynthesis, fertilization and grain filling in early sown crop, while for the late sown crop, it was optimal for photosynthesis but above threshold and detrimental for fertilization and grain filling. Combined analysis of ANOVA showed that all the parameters were found significant with respect to genotypes (G), date of sowings (T) and their interaction (G * T) except leaf temperature. The high temperature stress increased the plant stover weight due to increased photosynthesis coupled with maximum quantum yield PSII photochemistry which may improve the total plant growth. Results revealed that high temperature promoted the growth of vegetative plant parts but affected yield-related parameters. Higher temperatures during vegetative growth improved net photosynthetic rate resulting in higher total stover yield (28 %) at maturity. It impacted pollen viability and source to sink supply of photosynthates leading to reduced grain yield (13 %) in all genotypes."

Ultrasound-assisted extraction of flavonoids and phenolic compounds from Ocimum tenuiflorum leaves,"Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was optimized for extraction of flavonoids and phenolics from dried leaves of Ocimum tenuiflorum using response surface methodology with a central composite rotatable design and independent variables of ethanol concentration (30-70%), sonication time (5-15 min), and ultrasonic energy density (UED) (0.15-0.35 W/cm3). A significant (p<0.0001) quadratic model described experimental data with a non-significant lack of fit (p>0.05). Linear and quadratic effects of independent variables significantly (p<0.001) influenced flavonoid content (FC) and total phenolic content (TPC) yields. Optimized UAE conditions of ethanol concentration, sonication time, and UED were 55.34%, 11.71 min, and 0.26 W/cm3, respectively, resulting in predicted FC and TPC yields of 6.69 mg of quercetin equivalents QE/g and 9.41 mg of gallic acid equivalents GAE/g, respectively. HPLC analysis revealed different phenolic and flavonoid compounds. UAE extracts exhibited better in vitro antioxidant activities and thermo-oxidative stability values than conventional solvent extracts."
Effect of a polypropylene ((PP) patch containing isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) root on the shelf-life of low-salt Myeong-ran Jeotgal,"The effect of isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish root in the vapor phase on shelf-life extension of low-salt Myeong-ran Jeotgal was evaluated. Microbiological analysis showed that total viable cell counts, lactic acid bacterial counts, and proteolytic bacterial counts were inhibited in 0.50 and 0.75mL of ITCs (200 mg/mL)-treated Myeong-ran Jeotgal at 5 and 10°C. Chemical analysis revealed that 0.50 and 0.75 mL of ITCs (200mg/mL) treatments retarded formation of volatile basic nitrogen and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and reduced accumulation of alkaline compounds in 0.50 and 0.75 mL of ITCs (200mg/mL)-treated Myeong-ran Jeotgal. Arrhenius equations and sensory evaluations confirmed that the freshness of 0.75mL of ITCs (200mg/mL)-treated Myeong-ran Jeotgal was better preserved than for controls and showed that 0.75 mL of ITCs (200 mg/mL)-treated Myeong-ran Jeotgal had a shelf life that was approximately 4 days at 5°C and 2 days at 10°C longer than controls."
Monitoring of trimethoprim antibiotic residue in livestock and marine products commercialized in Korea,"A survey for trimethoprim (TMP) was performed using 369 livestock and marine products distributed in Korea. Product samples included beef, pork, milk, egg, chicken, flatfish, jacopever, common eel, and shrimp. TMP residues were analyzed using ultra performance LC with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). The analytical method was validated according to FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) guidelines and all results fully complied with FDA recommendations. TMP was detected in 7 product samples (1.9% incidence), including 5 jacopever, 1 flatfish, and 1 common eel. Residue levels were 1.17 to 16.43 μg/kg in jacopever, 40.0 μg/kg in flatfish, and 13.3 μg/kg in common eel. All positive product samples were below the legal residue limit of 20- 50 μg/kg in the Korean food code."
"GC/MS-based metabolomic analysis of the radish water kimchi, Dongchimi, with different salts","Non-volatile and volatile metabolites of 40-day fermented dongchimi, a radish water kimchi, with purified salt, solar salt (SS), and bamboo salt (BS) were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to investigate the salt effect on dongchimi quality. Dongchimi salt varieties were significantly separated from each other based on the partial least squares-discriminant multivariate statistical analysis scores plots. Sulfur compound, free sugar, sugar alcohol, and lactic acid levels, altered by salts, contributed to differences among dongchimi types. Sulfur compound levels were decreased using SS and BS, whereas the lactic acid level was increased. Fructose and mannitol levels were increased using BS and SS, respectively. A metabolic pathway associated with flavor and taste of dongchimi was proposed. The nutritional quality of dongchimi was affected by different salts."
Lipid oxidation of sodium caseinate-stabilized emulsion-gels prepared using microbial transglutaminase,"Development of lipid oxidation in casein-stabilized emulsion-gels prepared using microbial transglutaminase was investigated. The oxidative stability of emulsion-gels was assessed based on measurement of the amount of lipid hydroperoxide, hexanal, and 1-octen-3-ol. Profiles of lipid hydroperoxide showed that formation of lipid hydroperoxide was reduced in emulsion-gels, compared with emulsions, regardless of the storage temperature. Quantitative analysis of hexanal and 1-octen-3-ol showed no significant (p>0.05) difference between oxidative stabilities of emulsion-gels and emulsions. The storage temperature did not affect formation patterns of hydroperoxide, hexanal, and 1-octen-3-ol. Transglutaminase can be a useful tool for retardation of lipid oxidation based on formation of emulsion-gels."
Quality comparison of sweet flour pastes produced via natural and temperature-controlled fermentation,"The quality of sweet flour pastes (SFP) produced via natural and temperature-controlled fermentation was investigated. Temperature-controlled fermentation shortened the production time with no significant (p<0.05) differences between sample types in amino nitrogen, total acid, reducing sugar, and organic acid concentrations observed at the end of fermentation. Naturally fermented SFP exhibited higher concentrations of free amino acids than temperature-controlled fermented SFP. Analysis of SFP volatile compounds showed that naturally fermented SFP samples had higher concentrations of aroma constituents. Ethyl palmitate was the dominant ester in SFP with a 5.2× higher content of ethyl palmitate than for naturally fermented SFP. In addition, 4-ethyl guaiacol and 4-vinyl guaiacol were only identified in naturally fermented SFP samples. Temperature-controlled fermentation accelerates the production process, and naturally fermented SFP exhibited a higher quality."
"Synthesis, characterization and photoactivity of bi-crystalline mesoporous TiO2","Mesoporous titania (meso-TiO2) has received extensive attention owing to its versatile potential applications. This paper reports a low-temperature templating approach for the fabrication of meso-TiO2 using the peroxo titanic acid (PTA) sol as precursor and Pluronic P123 as nonionic template. The TGA, XRD, N2 sorption, FE-SEM and HRTEM were used to characterize the obtained samples. The results showed that meso-TiO2 with high surface area up to 163 m2·g–1 and large pore volume of 0.65 cm3·g–1 can be obtained. The mesopore sizes can be varied between 13 and 20 nm via this synthesis approach. The amount of P123 and the calcination conditions were found to have great influence on the mesoporous and crystalline structures of meso-TiO2. The photocatalytic activity testing clearly shows that the high surface area and bi-crystallinity phases of meso-TiO2 play important roles in enhancing photocatalytic properties of meso-TiO2 in photo-decomposing Rhodamine B in water."
Early-stage nucleation of manganese sulfide particle and its processing evolution in Fe—3wt.%Si alloys,"Manganese sulfide is often referred to as one of important inhibitors in grain-oriented electrical steels, which is of great importance to yield strong Goss texture. However, the early stage of nucleation for such inhibitors and their evolution during the processing has not been well understood. In present work we selected a Fe—3.12wt.%Si—0.11wt.%Mn—0.021wt.%S model system and used FE-SEM and atom probe tomography (APT) to investigate the precipitation behavior of MnS inhibitors at near atomic scale. It was found that the Si—S enriched clusters with sizes of 5—15 nm were formed close to the MnS particles. The density of inhibitors decreased after large pseudo-plane-strain compression because of the effect of dislocation motion, and then slightly increased again when sample was aged at 200°C for 48 h. The dislocations and grain boundaries can act as fast diffusion paths and assist the reemergence of Si—S enriched clusters."
Examining the effect of initialization strategies on the performance of Gaussian mixture modeling,"Mixture modeling is a popular technique for identifying unobserved subpopulations (e.g., components) within a data set, with Gaussian (normal) mixture modeling being the form most widely used. Generally, the parameters of these Gaussian mixtures cannot be estimated in closed form, so estimates are typically obtained via an iterative process. The most common estimation procedure is maximum likelihood via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Like many approaches for identifying subpopulations, finite mixture modeling can suffer from locally optimal solutions, and the final parameter estimates are dependent on the initial starting values of the EM algorithm. Initial values have been shown to significantly impact the quality of the solution, and researchers have proposed several approaches for selecting the set of starting values. Five techniques for obtaining starting values that are implemented in popular software packages are compared. Their performances are assessed in terms of the following four measures: (1) the ability to find the best observed solution, (2) settling on a solution that classifies observations correctly, (3) the number of local solutions found by each technique, and (4) the speed at which the start values are obtained. On the basis of these results, a set of recommendations is provided to the user."
Effect of ionic concentration on drug release from polyelectrolyte hydrogel carriers analyzed via triphasic mechanism model,"In different parts of the gastrointestinal tract, the rate of drug release from polyelectrolyte hydrogel tablets is highly affected by variance of ionic concentration. This research aims at revealing clearly how the drug release from a hydrogel matrix is affected by ionic concentration of external solution through the finite element simulation and triphasic mechanism model. The coupled relationship of the motions including the polyelectrolyte hydrogel swelling, the water flow and the ion diffusion, is illustrated in the present work. In order to simulate the drug controlled release from a swollen polyelectrolyte hydrogel carrier, the mathematical model was built on the basis of the multiphasic theory of polyelectrolyte hydrogels. Finally, the reliability of the simulation method was verified qualitatively by experimental results. The results reveal that when the initial concentration of fixed anions of polymer network is higher than the concentration of free anions in the external solution, the drug release rate increases with increasing the ionic concentration of the external solution. The research is helpful for the optimal design of oral drug release in gastrointestinal tract."
"Design, synthesis and biological activity of novel chalcone derivatives as anti-influenza agents","series of novel chalcone derivatives was designed and synthesized via a suitable synthetic strategy in good yields using commercially available 2-amino-4-nitrophenol as an initiator. The structures of the target compounds were confirmed by means of 1H NMR, 13C NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry(HRMS). And the ability of the target compounds to inhibit influenza viruses was evaluated. These compounds showed moderate inhibitory activity against influenza A(H9N2 and H5N1) viruses. Within this series, compounds S14 and S15 with good potency(IC50=40.3―51.5 μmol/L) could be used as lead compounds in the future."
Addressing Behavioral Health Disparities for Somali Immigrants Through Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Led by Community Health Workers,"To test the feasibility and acceptability of implementing an evidence-based, peer-delivered mental health intervention for Somali women in Minnesota, and to assess the impact of the intervention on the mental health of those who received the training. In a feasibility study, 11 Somali female community health workers were trained to deliver an 8-session cognitive behavioral therapy intervention. Each of the trainers recruited 5 participants through community outreach, resulting in 55 participants in the intervention. Self-assessed measures of mood were collected from study participants throughout the intervention, and focus groups were conducted. The 55 Somali women who participated recorded significant improvements in mood, with self-reported decreases in anxiety and increases in happiness. Focus group data showed the intervention was well received, particularly because it was delivered by a fellow community member. Participants reported gaining skills in problem solving, stress reduction, and anger management. Participants also felt that the intervention helped to address some of the stigma around mental health in their community. Delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy by a community health workers offered an acceptable way to build positive mental health in the Somali community."
Customer stock in repairable item systems,"Many enterprises that use expensive capital goods outsource the process of spare parts supply and stocking to a maintenance-, repair-, and overhaul provider (MRO-provider). Because of the high value, these spare parts are stocked in repairable item systems, in which defective parts are repaired after removal from the machine and put back into stock. When setting inventory levels, the providers do not consider all of the spare parts that are stocked in the system because customers hold own stock to bridge the delivery time from the MRO-provider. As these spare parts are not property of the MRO-provider, the provider does not take them into account when planning inventory, incurring overstocking at the central depot. A model, which considers customer stock when determining depot inventory levels, is developed by extending the METRIC model with a heuristics. The heuristics calculates backorder levels according to the depot inventory levels as well as customer stock levels and allows for an inventory reduction. Using the proposed model, savings of depot inventory can be up to 100 %, while keeping the backorder level of part requests below a preset threshold."
A hybrid approach to modeling and control of vehicle height for electronically controlled air suspension,"The control problems associated with vehicle height adjustment of electronically controlled air suspension (ECAS) still pose theoretical challenges for researchers, which manifest themselves in the publications on this subject over the last years. This paper deals with modeling and control of a vehicle height adjustment system for ECAS, which is an example of a hybrid dynamical system due to the coexistence and coupling of continuous variables and discrete events. A mixed logical dynamical (MLD) modeling approach is chosen for capturing enough details of the vehicle height adjustment process. The hybrid dynamic model is constructed on the basis of some assumptions and piecewise linear approximation for components nonlinearities. Then, the on-off statuses of solenoid valves and the piecewise approximation process are described by propositional logic, and the hybrid system is transformed into the set of linear mixed-integer equalities and inequalities, denoted as MLD model, automatically by HYSDEL. Using this model, a hybrid model predictive controller (HMPC) is tuned based on online mixed-integer quadratic optimization (MIQP). Two different scenarios are considered in the simulation, whose results verify the height adjustment effectiveness of the proposed approach. Explicit solutions of the controller are computed to control the vehicle height adjustment system in realtime using an offline multi-parametric programming technology (MPT), thus convert the controller into an equivalent explicit piecewise affine form. Finally, bench experiments for vehicle height lifting, holding and lowering procedures are conducted, which demonstrate that the HMPC can adjust the vehicle height by controlling the on-off statuses of solenoid valves directly. This research proposes a new modeling and control method for vehicle height adjustment of ECAS, which leads to a closed-loop system with favorable dynamical properties."
Dynamic topology multi force particle swarm optimization algorithm and its application,"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is an effective bio-inspired algorithm but it has shortage of premature convergence. Researchers have made some improvements especially in force rules and population topologies. However, the current algorithms only consider a single kind of force rules and lack consideration of comprehensive improvement in both multi force rules and population topologies. In this paper, a dynamic topology multi force particle swarm optimization (DTMFPSO) algorithm is proposed in order to get better search performance. First of all, the principle of the presented multi force particle swarm optimization (MFPSO) algorithm is that different force rules are used in different search stages, which can balance the ability of global and local search. Secondly, a fitness-driven edge-changing (FE) topology based on the probability selection mechanism of roulette method is designed to cut and add edges between the particles, and the DTMFPSO algorithm is proposed by combining the FE topology with the MFPSO algorithm through concurrent evolution of both algorithm and structure in order to further improve the search accuracy. Thirdly, Benchmark functions are employed to evaluate the performance of the DTMFPSO algorithm, and test results show that the proposed algorithm is better than the well-known PSO algorithms, such as µPSO, MPSO, and EPSO algorithms. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to optimize the process parameters for ultrasonic vibration cutting on SiC wafer, and the surface quality of the SiC wafer is improved by 12.8% compared with the PSO algorithm in Ref. [25]. This research proposes a DTMFPSO algorithm with multi force rules and dynamic population topologies evolved simultaneously, and it has better search performance."
An approach combining periodicity ratio and secondary Poincaré map for characteristics diagnosis of nonlinear oscillatory systems,"A secondary Poincaré map approach is developed in this research for diagnosing the nonlinear characteristics such as quasiperiodic and chaotic responses of a dynamic system. With the secondary Poincaré map approach developed, an approach combining the periodicity ratio method and the secondary Poincaré map approach is established such that all the dynamical characteristics of a nonlinear dynamic system can be systemically and completely identified. An example of an ecological oscillatory system is presented in the research to demonstrate the application of the combined approach. Periodic–quasiperiodic–chaotic region diagrams are generated with the employment of the approach, for a global characterization of this system with consideration of large ranges of system parameters. The approach developed in this research demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency in completely diagnosing the complex dynamical characteristics of nonlinear oscillatory systems, such as periodic, quasiperiodic, chaotic responses of the systems together with those in between periodic and chaotic responses."
Long-term follow up of single-stage anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and high tibial osteotomy and its relation with posterior tibial slope,Open-wedge high tibial osteotomy is considered to be an effective treatment for medial compartmental osteoarthritis. It is generally admitted that tibial slope increases after open-wedge high tibial osteotomy and decreases after closing-wedge high tibial osteotomy. Young patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency along with medial compartment osteoarthritis need a combined procedure of ACL reconstruction along with high tibial osteotomy to regain physiological knee kinematics and to avoid chondral damage.
A novel multiplex PCR method for the detection of virulence-associated genes of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in food,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) strains are foodborne infectious agents that cause a number of life-threatening diseases, including hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Shiga toxin 1 (stx1), shiga toxin 2 (stx2), or a combination of both are responsible for most clinical symptoms of these diseases. Hence, various diagnostic methods have been developed so far to detect shiga toxins such as cell culture, ELISA, Rapid Latex Agglutination (RPLA) and hybridization, but due to high costs and labor time in addition to low sensitivity, they have not received much attention. The aim of this study was to develop a complete, rapid and reliable multiplex PCR (mPCR) method by using two pairs of specific primers to detect either the stx1 or the stx2 gene confirms the presence of E.coli O157:H7. The study results show that stx1F/stx1R primers are specific for stx1 and primers stx2F/stx2R are specific for stx2 genes in E. coli O157:H7. The mPCR method with two pairs of primers for amplifying the stx1, stx2 target genes to detect E. coli O157:H7 in food has been set up successfully. Complete method performed well in both types of food matrices with a detection limit of 3 CFU/25 g or mL of food samples. Tests on 180 food samples have shown a specificity value of 93.75 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 82.83–100), a sensitivity of 100 % (95 % CI, 83.79–99.85 %), and an accuracy of 96.66 % (CI 95 %, 83.41–99.91 %). Interestingly, results indicate that the mPCR performed as well as the traditional culture methods and can reduce the diagnosis time to 2 days. Finally, complete mPCR method was applied to natural samples covering a wide variety of food types proving that the mPCR method was a rapid and reliable screening method for detection of E. coli O157:H7 in food and environmental samples."
Peripheral nerve blocks as the sole anesthetic technique in a patient with severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy,"General anesthesia and central neuraxial blockades in patients with severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy are associated with high risks of complications, including rhabdomyolysis, malignant hyperthermia, hemodynamic instability, and postoperative mechanical ventilation. Here, we describe peripheral nerve blocks as a safe approach to anesthesia in a patient with severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy who was scheduled to undergo surgery. A 22-year-old male patient was scheduled to undergo reduction and internal fixation of a left distal femur fracture. He had been diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy at 5 years of age, and had no locomotive capability except for that of the finger flexors and toe extensors. He had developed symptoms associated with dyspnea 5 years before and required intermittent ventilation. We blocked the femoral nerve, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, and parasacral plexus under ultrasound on the left leg. The patient underwent a successful operation using peripheral nerve blocks with no complications. In conclusion general anesthesia and central neuraxial blockades in patients with severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy are unsafe approaches to anesthesia because of hemodynamic instability and respiratory depression. Peripheral nerve blocks are the best way to reduce the risks of critical complications, and are a safe and feasible approach to anesthesia in patients with severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy."
Socialization Effects of Authoritative Parenting and Its Discrepancy on Children,"Authoritative parenting provided by the parent and received by the child offers support and demand to socialize the child, possibly in terms of the performance of taking others’ perspectives and self-esteem. Nevertheless, when the child receives less authoritative parenting than the parent claims to provide, a discrepancy in authoritative parenting between the parent–child pair happens and would be likely to reduce the performance. Such impacts on the performance are the focus of this study. Based on cross-sectional data collected from 223 children (aged 14–21 years) and their parents through self-administered questionnaires, results analyzed from structural equation modeling show that (1) authoritative parents, based on the reports of both the parent and child, engendered a positive direct effect on the child’s perspective taking, which in turn sustained a positive effect on the child’s self-esteem; (2) discrepancy in authoritative parenting between the parent–child pair indicated negative direct effects on both the child’s perspective taking and self-esteem; and (3) the child’s perspective taking significantly mediated, although not totally, the effects of authoritative parenting and its discrepancy on the child’s self-esteem. The present study supports the propositions of symbolic-interactionist theory in explanation of the importance of authoritative parenting and its discrepancy in relation to the child’s development of perspective taking and self-esteem. Implications and future research directions are discussed."
Impact of the substrate dependent polarity distribution in c-axis oriented AlN thin films on the etching behaviour and the piezoelectric properties,"In this work, the influence of substrate properties on the polarization of highly c-axis oriented aluminium nitride (AlN) thin films and as a consequence, on the piezoelectric properties and the wet-chemical etching behaviour is investigated. Therefore, 620 nm thin AlN layers are simultaneously sputter-deposited under nominal unheated substrate conditions on silicon (Si) substrates or on those covered with a sputter-deposited titanium (Ti) film. After wet-chemically etching in a phosphorous acid based solution at 80 °C different residues of AlN remain. Wet-chemical etching of AlN films deposited on Ti results in a high film porosity. In contrast, AlN layers on Si are either hardly attacked or the complete thin film is removed except some remaining conical shaped residues. Furthermore, we demonstrate a change in the measured electro-mechanical properties with changing maximum deposition temperature caused by a self-heating effect of the substrate during the AlN deposition process. The change in piezoelectric properties and the differing etching behaviour is caused by a change in polarity within the AlN layer. These domains are visualized by piezoresponse force microscopy measurements, and are in good agreement with the observed etching results. For layers with mixed polarization, the absolute values of the piezoelectric constant d

33
 are reduced due to the counteraction of piezoelectric domains with opposite polarization."
Autocorrelation descriptor improvements for QSAR: 2DA_Sign and 3DA_Sign,"Quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) is a branch of computer aided drug discovery that relates chemical structures to biological activity. Two well established and related QSAR descriptors are two- and three-dimensional autocorrelation (2DA and 3DA). These descriptors encode the relative position of atoms or atom properties by calculating the separation between atom pairs in terms of number of bonds (2DA) or Euclidean distance (3DA). The sums of all values computed for a given small molecule are collected in a histogram. Atom properties can be added with a coefficient that is the product of atom properties for each pair. This procedure can lead to information loss when signed atom properties are considered such as partial charge. For example, the product of two positive charges is indistinguishable from the product of two equivalent negative charges. In this paper, we present variations of 2DA and 3DA called 2DA_Sign and 3DA_Sign that avoid information loss by splitting unique sign pairs into individual histograms. We evaluate these variations with models trained on nine datasets spanning a range of drug target classes. Both 2DA_Sign and 3DA_Sign significantly increase model performance across all datasets when compared with traditional 2DA and 3DA. Lastly, we find that limiting 3DA_Sign to maximum atom pair distances of 6 Å instead of 12 Å further increases model performance, suggesting that conformational flexibility may hinder performance with longer 3DA descriptors. Consistent with this finding, limiting the number of bonds in 2DA_Sign from 11 to 5 fails to improve performance."
Characterization of Raw and Decopperized Anode Slimes from a Chilean Refinery,"This work characterizes raw and decopperized slimes, with the objective of identifying the phases in these two sub-products. The main phases in copper anodes are metallic copper, including CuO, which are present in free form or associated with the presence of copper selenide or tellurides (Cu2(Se,Te)) and several Cu-Pb-Sb-As-Bi oxides. During electrorefining, the impurities in the anode release and are not deposited in the cathode, part of them dissolving and concentrated in the electrolyte, and others form a raw anode slime that contains Au, Ag, Cu, As, Se, Te and PGM, depending on the composition of the anode. There are several recovery processes, most of which involve acid leaching in the first step to dissolve copper, whose product is decopperized anode slime. SEM analysis revealed that the mineralogical species present in the raw anode slime under study were mainly eucarite (CuAgSe), naumannite (Ag2Se), antimony arsenate (SbAsO4), and lead sulfate (PbSO4). In the case of decopperized slime, the particles were mainly composed of SbAsO4 (crystalline appearance), non-stoichiometric silver selenide (Ag(2−x)Se), and chlorargyrite (AgCl)."
Regional Risk Assessment addressing the impacts of climate change in the coastal area of the Gulf of Gabes (Tunisia),"Sound, cost efficient management strategies in developed coastal zones can be reinforced by a thorough understanding of risks associated with the combination of anthropogenic and natural drivers of change. A Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology was developed for the assessment of the potential impacts of climate change in the Tunisian coastal zone of the Gulf of Gabes. It is based on the use of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis techniques and Geographic Information Systems and is designed to support the development and prioritization of adaptation strategies. The RRA focuses on sea-level rise and storm surge flooding impacts for human and natural systems, i.e., beaches, wetlands, urban areas, agricultural areas, and terrestrial ecosystems. Results suggest that for both of the studied climate change impacts, i.e., sea-level rise and storm surge flooding, the area potentially exposed is limited to a narrow, low elevation region adjacent to the shoreline. However, the exposed areas showed a high relative risk score, obtained by the integration of exposure and susceptibility factors. Beaches have the lowest relative risk scores, while wetlands and terrestrial ecosystems have the higher relative risk scores. The final outputs of the analysis (i.e., exposure, susceptibility, and risk maps) can support end-users in the establishment of relative priorities for intervention and in the identification of suitable areas for human settlements, infrastructure, and economic activities, thus providing a basis for coastal zoning and land-use planning."
Disentangling the effects of tocilizumab on neutrophil survival and function,"The synovial tissue in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) represents a hypoxic environment with up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and cellular infiltrates including neutrophils. Although inhibition of the interleukin (IL)6 receptor pathway by tocilizumab is a potent treatment option for RA, it may also cause adverse effects such as an occasionally high-grade neutropenia. We analysed the impact of tocilizumab on survival, mediator secretion, oxidative burst, phagocytosis and energy availability of high-dose toll-like receptor (TLR)2/4-stimulated neutrophils (to mimic an arthritis flare) under normoxic versus hypoxic conditions. Human neutrophils were purified, pre-treated with varying doses of tocilizumab, dexamethasone or human IgG1 and high-dose-stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) alone—triggering TLR2/4-, LPS plus IL6, or left unstimulated. Cells were then incubated under normoxic (18 % O2) or hypoxic (1 % O2) conditions and subsequently analysed. Neutrophil survival and energy availability were significantly decreased by tocilizumab in a dose-dependent manner in high-dose TLR2/4-stimulated cells, but to a greater extent under normoxia as compared to hypoxia. We also found high-dose LPS-stimulated oxidative burst and phagocytosis of neutrophils to be higher under hypoxic versus normoxic conditions, but this difference was reduced by tocilizumab. Finally, we observed that tocilizumab affected neutrophil mediator secretion as a function of oxygen availability. Tocilizumab is known for both beneficial effects and a higher incidence of neutropenia when treating RA patients. Our results suggest that both effects can at least in part be explained by a reduction in neutrophil survival, a dose-dependent inhibition of hypoxia-induced NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative burst and phagocytosis of infiltrating hypoxic neutrophils and an alteration of mediator secretion."
Oral l-thyroxine liquid versus tablet in patients with hypothyroidism without malabsorption: a prospective study,"No consistent data are present in literature about the effectiveness of levothyroxine (l-T4) liquid formulation in patients without malabsorption. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of l-T4 liquid formulation, with l-T4 tablets, in hypothyroid patients without malabsorption or drug interference. One hundred and fifty two patients were recruited. Patients were switched from the l-T4 therapy in tablets, to liquid l-T4 at the same dosage, 30 min before breakfast. Serum thyrotropic hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), and free triiodothyronine (FT3) were re-evaluated after 1–3 months (first control) and 5–7 months (second control) from the switch. TSH values significantly declined with respect to the basal value after the switch to liquid l-T4 both at the first control (P < 0.05) and at the second control (P < 0.01); FT4 and FT3 levels were not significantly changed. We show that liquid l-T4 is more effective than l-T4 tablet in controlling TSH levels in hypothyroid patients without malabsorption, gastric disorders, or drug interference."
Effect of High-Dose Simvastatin on Cerebral Blood Flow and Static Autoregulation in Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,Statins may promote vasodilation following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and improve the response to blood pressure elevation. We sought to determine whether simvastatin increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) and alters the response to induced hypertension after SAH.
The scaling of geographic ranges: implications for species distribution models,"The geographic ranges of many species are responding to ongoing environmental change. Processes operating at different levels of biological organization, with corresponding spatial extents and grains and temporal rates, interact with the evolving configuration of environmental conditions to determine range dynamics."
Trivariate Modeling of Interparental Conflict and Adolescent Emotional Security: An Examination of Mother–Father–Child Dynamics,"Recognizing the significance of interacting family subsystems, the present study addresses how interparental conflict is linked to adolescent emotional security as a function of parental gender. A total of 272 families with a child at 12.60 years of age (133 boys, 139 girls) were invited to participate each year for three consecutive years. A multi-informant method was used, along with trivariate models to test the associations among mothers, fathers, and their adolescent children’s behaviors. The findings from separate models of destructive and constructive interparental conflict revealed intricate linkages among family members. In the model of destructive interparental conflict, mothers and fathers predicted each other’s conflict behaviors over time. Moreover, adolescents’ exposure to negativity expressed by either parent dampened their emotional security. Consistent with child effects models, adolescent emotional insecurity predicted fathers’ destructive conflict behaviors. As for the model of constructive interparental conflict, fathers predicted mothers’ conflict behaviors over time. Adolescents’ exposure to fathers’ constructive conflict behaviors also enhanced their sense of emotional security. Consistent with child effects models, adolescent emotional security predicted mothers’ and fathers’ constructive conflict behaviors. These findings extended the family and the adolescent literature by indicating that family processes are multiidirectional, involving multiple dyads in the study of parents’ and adolescents’ functioning. Contributions of these findings to the understanding of interparental conflict and emotional security in adolescence are discussed."
Adverse event grading following CTCAE v3.0 underestimates hypertensive side effects in patients with glioma treated with Bevacizumab,"Anti-VEGF therapy with Bevacizumab (BEV) is widely used in cases of relapsed high-grade glioma (HGG). Arterial hypertension is a known side effect of anti-VEGF therapy. 42 Patients with relapsed HGG were treated with BEV 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of 28-day cycles in addition to treatment with 40 mg TMZ daily until disease progression, based on magnetic resonance imaging and/or worsening of clinical status. In a retrospective analysis, hypertensive side effects were evaluated as the primary endpoint, while survival information in addition to toxicity was analyzed as secondary endpoint. Grading which employs the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 detected hypertensive events with a significantly higher sensitivity than CTCAE version 3.0. The rate of severe hypertensive events observed as CTCAE ≥ °3 were 9.5 % in version 3.0 and 45.2 % in version 4.0. The results presented here indicate that CTCAE version 3.0 may underreport the incidence and grade of BEV-induced hypertension within clinical trials. As hypertension has not only long-term, but also severe short-term side effects, we suggest that arterial hypertension under BEV should be scored according to CTCAE version 4.0 to avoid clinically relevant hypertension-related adverse events in these patients."
The Influence of Early Experiences and Adult Attachment on the Exhibition of the Sexual Double Standard,"The sexual double standard is the phenomenon whereby men and women are judged differently for the same sexual behavior. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the potential relationship between life history theory, attachment theory and the sexual double standard. Life history theory posits that one’s upbringing (e.g., quality of early relationship with one’s parents) may have implications for one’s future mating strategies, especially for women. Furthermore, adult attachment orientation often influences individuals’ feelings toward sexual behavior. To address the relationship between these variables, we had participants complete questionnaires regarding their early relationships with their parents and their current attachment regarding romantic partners. Participants then evaluated a target individual who reported having 1 or 12 sexual partners (N = 154). Results showed that female participants’ early relationships with their parents and their current attachment avoidance predicted their exhibition of the double standard. Results are discussed in the context of theoretical and empirical implications."
An approach combining periodicity ratio and secondary Poincaré map for characteristics diagnosis of nonlinear oscillatory systems,"A secondary Poincaré map approach is developed in this research for diagnosing the nonlinear characteristics such as quasiperiodic and chaotic responses of a dynamic system. With the secondary Poincaré map approach developed, an approach combining the periodicity ratio method and the secondary Poincaré map approach is established such that all the dynamical characteristics of a nonlinear dynamic system can be systemically and completely identified. An example of an ecological oscillatory system is presented in the research to demonstrate the application of the combined approach. Periodic–quasiperiodic–chaotic region diagrams are generated with the employment of the approach, for a global characterization of this system with consideration of large ranges of system parameters. The approach developed in this research demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency in completely diagnosing the complex dynamical characteristics of nonlinear oscillatory systems, such as periodic, quasiperiodic, chaotic responses of the systems together with those in between periodic and chaotic responses."
Bifurcation analysis in a modified Lesile–Gower model with Holling type II functional response and delay,"In this paper, a modified Lesile–Gower predator–prey system with delay is considered. The existence of Hopf bifurcations at the positive equilibrium is established by analyzing the distribution of the characteristic values. Furthermore, different to previous papers, a multiple time scale technique is employed to calculate the normal form on the center manifold of delay differential equations, which is much easier to implement in practice than the conventional method, center manifold reduction. Finally, to verify our theoretical predictions, some numerical simulations are also included."
Non-isolating Bondage in Graphs,"A dominating set of a graph \(G = (V,E)\) is a set D of vertices of G such that every vertex of \(V(G){\setminus }D\) has a neighbor in D. The domination number of a graph G, denoted by \(\gamma (G)\), is the minimum cardinality of a dominating set of G. The non-isolating bondage number of G, denoted by \(b'(G)\), is the minimum cardinality among all sets of edges \(E' \subseteq E\) such that \(\delta (G-E') \ge 1\) and \(\gamma (G-E') > \gamma (G)\). If for every \(E' \subseteq E\) we have \(\gamma (G-E') = \gamma (G)\) or \(\delta (G-E') = 0\), then we define \(b'(G) = 0\), and we say that G is a \(\gamma \)-non-isolatingly strongly stable graph. First we discuss various properties of non-isolating bondage in graphs. We find the non-isolating bondage numbers for several classes of graphs. Next we show that for every non-negative integer, there exists a tree having such non-isolating bondage number. Finally, we characterize all \(\gamma \)-non-isolatingly strongly stable trees."
An evolutionary model of bi-flux diffusion processes,"In previous papers, we presented a new theory of bi-flux diffusion processes. The bi-flux consists of the simultaneous flux of two sets of particles scattering with two distinct velocities. The first set obeys the classical Fick’s law, it is the primary flux. The complementary set follows a new law, it is the secondary flux. The primary and secondary fluxes are excited into two distinct energy states. The fundamental energy source for the primary flux is the translational energy or active energy. For the secondary flux, linear and angular momentum, both, contribute to the excitation state. Two cases are analyzed. The first one refers to an isolated system in a particular phase state S1 where active energy decreases continuously. The system tends to an energy state where active energy is absent. In the second case, the system is in a different phase state S2 where active energy increases continuously. The system recovers active energy and tends to a pure Fickian diffusion process. In both processes, the fractions representing the density distribution functions for the primary and secondary fluxes vary with time. It is remarkable that the fourth order equation provides a consistent approach to take into account the rotational energy which otherwise would not be possible with the classical theory. A particular law for the variation of the fraction of particles following Fick’s law is derived. A notion of entropy related to the particular energy states is introduced. Selected examples are presented showing the concentration profile evolution for different rates of energy transfer."
Childhood growth in boys with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism,We describe childhood growth patterns in a series of well-characterized patients with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) with special emphasis on genotype–phenotype correlation.
A study of microRNAs from dried blood spots in newborns after perinatal asphyxia: a simple and feasible biosampling method,"The potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) as bedside biomarkers in selecting newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) for neuroprotection has yet to be explored. Commonly, blood-based biomarker tests use plasma or serum which don’t allow evaluation of both intracellular and extracellular changes."
The transcriptome of nitrofen-induced pulmonary hypoplasia in the rat model of congenital diaphragmatic hernia,We currently do not know how the herbicide nitrofen induces lung hypoplasia and congenital diaphragmatic hernia in rats. Our aim was to compare the differentially expressed transcriptome of nitrofen-induced hypoplastic lungs to control lungs in embryonic day 13 rat embryos before the development of embryonic diaphragmatic defects.
Medium- to Long-Term Impact of Rotavirus Vaccination on Hospital Care in Belgium: A 7-Year Follow-Up of the Rotavirus Belgium Impact Study (RotaBIS),"Rotavirus (RV) vaccination was introduced in Belgium in 2006. With the high uptake it had (>85%), a sharp decline in hospitalizations was observed during the first years after vaccine introduction. The objective of this study was to investigate whether this decline was maintained and to simulate projections."
Do teas rich in antioxidants reduce the physicochemical and peroxidative risk factors for calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis in humans? Pilot studies with Rooibos herbal tea and Japanese green tea,"Several experimental and animal studies have demonstrated that substances rich in antioxidants can reduce the physicochemical and peroxidative risk factors for calcium oxalate (CaOx) renal stone formation in urine and blood. However, there are very few such investigations in humans. In the present pilot study, two varieties of tea, a green one from Japan (JGT) and a herbal one from South Africa (Rooibos) (RT), both rich in antioxidants, were administered to a group of CaOx stone formers (SF) (n = 8) for 30 days. Both teas were analysed for polyphenols by high-performance liquid chromatography and for minerals by plasma atomic and optical emission spectroscopy. 24 h urines (baseline and day 30) were analysed for lithogenic factors. CaOx metastable limits and crystal nucleation and growth kinetics were also determined in each urine sample. Deposited crystals were inspected by scanning electron microscopy. Blood samples were collected (baseline and day 30). Biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma and urinary thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and urinary N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) were also determined. Urinary physicochemical risk factors were also investigated after ingestion of RT for 30 days in two control groups (CG1 and CG2), the latter one of which consisted of habitual JGT drinkers. Statistical analyses were performed using Wilcoxon signed rank tests and Mann–Whitney tests for paired and independent measurements, respectively. Several flavonoids and catechins were quantified in RT and JGT, respectively, confirming that both teas are rich sources of antioxidants. Mineral content was found to be far below dietary reference intakes. There were no significant changes in any of the urinary physicochemical or peroxidative risk factors in the control groups or in SF, except for the supersaturation (SS) of brushite (Bru) which decreased in the latter group after ingestion of JGT. Crystal morphology showed a tendency to change from mixed CaOx mono- and di-hydrate to monohydrate after ingestion of each tea. Since the latter form has a stronger binding affinity for epithelial cells, this effect is not protective. Analysis of the physicochemical and peroxidative risk factors in CG1 and CG2 did not reveal any evidence of a synergistic effect between the two teas. Paradoxically, baseline risk factors in the habitual JGT control group were significantly raised relative to those in CG1. Our preliminary results suggest that ingestion of RT and JGT does not reduce the risk factors for CaOx stone formation in humans, but these findings need to be tested in further studies involving much larger sample sizes."
A comment on ‘resolving spurious regressions and serially correlated errors’,"In order to diminish size distortions of the t test in a time series linear specification, Agiakloglou (Agiakloglou in Empir Econ, 45(3):1361–1366, 2013) proposed to (1) include the first lag of the dependent variable as a regressor or (2) estimate it using the first differences of the variables. He provided finite-sample evidence to support his proposal. In this paper, we extend the Monte Carlo experiment to different data-generating processes and calculate the asymptotic behavior of the modified specifications. We show that including the lag of the dependent variable as a regressor reduces size distortions when the variables are driftless unit roots, but this approach does not hold under the presence of long memory, nonlinearities, or structural breaks."
Evaluating and Reporting the Immunogenicity Impacts for Biological Products—a Clinical Pharmacology Perspective,"Immunogenicity assessment is important for biological products due to potential impacts of immunogenicity on safety and efficacy. We reviewed the prescribing information and the FDA’s clinical pharmacology review of 121 approved biological products for evaluating and reporting of immunogenicity data. Of the 121 products, 89% (n = 108) reported the incidence of immunogenicity and 49% (n = 59) reported immunogenicity impact on efficacy. However, only 26% (n = 31) reported whether the immunogenicity affected pharmacokinetics. A subset of 16 products reported effects of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) on both systemic clearance and efficacy; 8 of 16 products had increased systemic clearance coinciding with reduced efficacy, and 6 of 16 products had no changes in either clearance or efficacy. Factors contributing to infrequent reporting of the ADA effect on exposure and methods for determining the effect of ADA on exposure are summarized. Measuring ADA and drug concentrations concurrently over time enables the evaluation of ADA impact on pharmacokinetics. Within-subject comparison of concentration data (before vs. after ADA formation) is a useful alternative to between-subject (ADA+ vs. ADA−) comparison when sample size is limited or when the majority of subjects developed ADA. The biological complexity of immune responses presents challenges to quantifying the ADA impact on pharmacokinetics using model-based methods. Our findings support that pharmacokinetic exposure is more sensitive than efficacy endpoints for evaluating ADA effects. A decrease in drug concentration due to formation of ADA during treatment can serve as an early indicator for potential reduced efficacy occurring at a later time."
Mechanical Properties of Mg-Gd and Mg-Y Solid Solutions,"The mechanical properties of Mg-Gd and Mg-Y solid solutions have been studied under uniaxial tension and compression between 4 K and 298 K (−269 °C and 25 °C). The results reveal that Mg-Gd alloys exhibit higher strength and ductility under tension and compression attributed to the more effective solid solution strengthening and grain-boundary strengthening effects. Profuse twinning has been observed under compression, resulting in a material texture with strong dominance of basal component parallel to compression axis. Under tension, twining is less active and the texture evolution is controlled mostly by slip. The alloys exhibit pronounced yield stress asymmetry and significantly different work-hardening behavior under tension and compression. Increasing of Gd and/or Y concentration leads to the reduction of the tension–compression asymmetry due to the weakening of the recrystallization texture and more balanced twinning and slip activity during plastic deformation. The results suggest that under compression of Mg-Y alloys slip is more active than twinning in comparison to Mg-Gd alloys."
Insight into the Consolidation Mechanism of Oxidized Pellets Made from the Mixture of Magnetite and Chromite Concentrates,"To produce more competitive stainless steel products, the utilization of low-cost chromite concentrate is of great importance. In a previous study, a high-quality product pellet (CMP) for blast furnace smelting process made from a mixture of 40 wt pct chromite and 60 wt pct magnetite concentrates was manufactured by a high-pressure grinding rollers pretreatment. In this work, an insight into the consolidation mechanism of CMP is taken in comparison with the oxidized pellets (MP) made from 100 pct magnetite concentrate by adopting the scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectrometer, and X-ray diffractometer. The mineralogy of the pellets and the morphology of the preheated and roasted mineral particles are demonstrated. To gain better understanding of the consolidation mechanism of CMP, the thermodynamics of chromite–magnetite spinel system and hematite–sesquioxide corundum system in air are considered by using FactSage software. It can be found that the solid-state bonding is the dominant form in the consolidation of CMP, which mainly depends on the recrystallization of hematite, the solid solution bonding in adjacent areas of both magnetite–chromite particles and chromite–chromite particles. The latter two bonds rely on the formation of the miscible sesquioxide and spinel solid solution at the contact areas of particles, which is largely affected by the oxidizability of magnetite and chromite spinels. When more chromite concentrate is blended, the weak bonding among the chromite particles gradually becomes the dominant factor, which will lead to the decrease of the mechanical strength of fired pellets. The presence of a small quantity of siliceous liquid phase in CMP is believed to be beneficial to the hardening by accelerating the ion diffusion rate and forming slag bonds."
Preliminary study on liver function changes after trisectionectomy with versus without prior portal vein embolization,"Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is the major risk factor for mortality after hepatectomy. Preoperative planning of the future liver remnant volume reduces PHLF rates; however, future liver remnant function (FLR-F) might have an even stronger predictive value. In this preliminary study, we used a new method to calculate FLR-F by the LiMAx test and computer tomography-assisted volumetric-analysis to visualize liver function changes after portal vein embolization (PVE) before extended hepatectomy."
Vascular Prostheses Based on Nanofibers from Aliphatic Copolyamide,"Tubular grafts based on nanofibers of copolymer of ε-caprolactam and hexamethylendiaminadipate were obtained by the electrospinning method. The strength of materials based on the dry nanofibers was 6.2 MPa with elongation at break of 133%, or 7.5 MPa and 299% in saline, respectively. The pressure value at which liquid started seeping through the tube wall was P = 10 kPa. Absence of cytotoxicity was proved, as well as adhesion and proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells on the surface. Tubes with inner diameter of 1 mm were tested in vivo in rat abdominal aorta. A layer of endothelial cells was shown to form on the inner side of the prosthesis after 30 days. There was no evidence of stenosis or dilatation of the prosthesis after 14 months with observation of endothelial and subendothelial layers."
Diversity and antagonistic potential of marine microbes collected from south-west coast of India,"The diversity of some of the culturable microorganisms associated with marine flora and fauna collected off Vizhinjam and Mulloor coast of South India was evaluated and their bioactive production potential determined. From a total of 24 bacteria, 4 actinomycetes and 8 fungi isolated from diverse marine sources, five bacterial species-BLM3, BSP2, BCS1, BCS4 and BMA6 showed inhibitory activity against at least one of the tested pathogens viz., Klebsiella pneumonia KU1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa VL3, Salmonella enterica typhimurium MTCC 98, Escherichia coli MTCC 40, Micrococcus luteus MTCC 105, Staphylococcus simulans MTCC 3610, Proteus vulgaris MTCC 426, Vibrio fluvialis, Vibrio sp. P3a and Vibrio sp. P3b. The isolated actinomycetes and fungi did not produce significant inhibition zones against the tested pathogens; however, the macroalgal isolated actinomycetes strain AMA1 produced reddish pigment in Starch Casein medium which remained stable till the stationary phase of growth. The marine sediment isolate BCS4, identified as Bacillus sp. showed wide spectrum of activity against the tested Gram positive bacteria, S. simulans MTCC 3610 and Gram negative bacteria, Proteus vulgaris with zone of inhibitions of 25 and 11 mm respectively. Better extraction of the bioactive compound was obtained with ethyl acetate when compared with methanol, benzene and hexane and TLC analysis revealed the presence of an active compound. The 16SrRNA sequencing confirmed the potent strain belong to Bacillus sp. and hence designated Bacillus sp. BCS4."
Why are Fishers not Enforcing Their Marine User Rights?,"Over-fishing is a global problem that damages the marine environment and compromises the long-term sustainability of fisheries. This damage can be mitigated by restricting catch or other activities which can occur in marine areas. However, such management is only effective when restrictions are enforced to ensure compliance. We expect fishers to help enforce restrictions when they have exclusive user rights and can capture the benefits of management. In a number of such cases, however, fisher participation in the enforcement of user rights is absent. In this analysis we used central Chile as a case-study to investigate why some fishers may not participate in enforcement even when they have exclusive territorial user rights for fisheries. We used a best-worst scaling survey to assess why fishers would choose not to participate in enforcement through monitoring their TURF management areas, and what would help to increase their participation. We found that the main reason fishers may not monitor is because they consider government policing of marine areas and punishment of poachers to be ineffective. Increased and timely responsiveness by government when poachers are detected and more stringent penalisation of poachers may lead to greater involvement in enforcement by fishers."
Index bounds for character sums of polynomials over finite fields,"We provide an index bound for character sums of polynomials over finite fields. This improves the Weil bound for high degree polynomials with small indices, as well as polynomials with large indices that are generated by cyclotomic mappings of small indices. As an application, we also give some general bounds for numbers of solutions of some Artin–Schreier equations and minimum weights of some dual cyclic codes."
Pathological α-synuclein distribution in subjects with coincident Alzheimer’s and Lewy body pathology,"We investigated the distribution patterns of Lewy body-related pathology (LRP) and the effect of coincident Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology using a data-driven clustering approach that identified groups with different LRP pathology distributions without any diagnostic or researcher’s input in two cohorts including: Parkinson disease patients without (PD, n = 141) and with AD (PD-AD, n = 80), dementia with Lewy bodies subjects without AD (DLB, n = 13) and demented subjects with AD and LRP pathology (Dem-AD-LB, n = 308). The Dem-AD-LB group presented two LRP patterns, olfactory-amygdala and limbic LRP with negligible brainstem pathology, that were absent in the PD groups, which are not currently included in the DLB staging system and lacked extracranial LRP as opposed to the PD group. The Dem-AD-LB individuals showed relative preservation of substantia nigra cells and dopamine active transporter in putamen. PD cases with AD pathology showed increased LRP. The cluster with occipital LRP was associated with non-AD type dementia clinical diagnosis in the Dem-AD-LB group and a faster progression to dementia in the PD groups. We found that (1) LRP pathology in Dem-AD-LB shows a distribution that differs from PD, without significant brainstem or extracranial LRP in initial phases; (2) coincident AD pathology is associated with increased LRP in PD indicating an interaction; (3) LRP and coincident AD pathology independently predict progression to dementia in PD, and (4) evaluation of LRP needs to acknowledge different LRP spreading patterns and evaluate substantia nigra integrity in the neuropathological assessment and consider the implications of neuropathological heterogeneity for clinical and biomarker characterization."
"Conventional over-the-top-aiming devices with short offset fail to hit the center of the human femoral ACL footprint in medial portal technique, whereas medial-portal-aiming devices with larger offset hit the center reliably",Aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of a conventional over-the-top-guide (OTG) with a typically short offset to hit the center of the native femoral ACL footprint through the anteromedial portal in comparison to a specific medial-portal-aimer (MPA) with larger offset.
A Hopf theorem for non-constant mean curvature and a conjecture of A. D. Alexandrov,"We prove a uniqueness theorem for immersed spheres of prescribed (non-constant) mean curvature in homogeneous three-manifolds. In particular, this uniqueness theorem proves a conjecture by A. D. Alexandrov about immersed spheres of prescribed Weingarten curvature in \(\mathbb {R}^3\) for the special but important case of prescribed mean curvature. As a consequence, we extend the classical Hopf uniqueness theorem for constant mean curvature spheres to the case of immersed spheres of prescribed antipodally symmetric mean curvature in \(\mathbb {R}^3\)."
"Understanding the ring-opening, chelation and non-chelation reactions between nedaplatin and thiosulfate: a DFT study based on NBO, ETS-NOCV and QTAIM","The current work investigates a DFT-based in silico study on the mechanism of reaction between the anticancer drug nedaplatin [Pt(NH3)2(Gly-κ2O,O′)] (Gly = –OCCH2COO–) and the rescue agent thiosulfate (S2O3
2−) in molar ratios 1:1 and 1:2, in neutral- and proton-assisted pathways. The first step produces stable (κS or κO) intermediates via ring opening of Gly. The second, rate-limiting step consists of three competing reactions: (1) κ2S,O-chelate formation by S2O3
2− or HS2O3
− (2) Pt-bis(thiosulfate) formation by the elimination of Gly ligand and (3) Pt-bis(thiosulfate) formation by the elimination of one NH3
trans to sulfur owing to strong trans-labilizing thiosulfate ligand. Results show that non-chelation reaction involving uptake of the second thiosulfate is kinetically more favorable than the corresponding κ2S,O-chelate formation. Further, the kinetic barrier of NH3 loss reaction is found to be very close to that of Gly loss. However, in solution phase, the ammine loss reaction is slower than the glycolate loss. The possibility of the formation of four-membered binuclear μ-thiosulfate bridge [Pt2(μ-S2O3)2(NH3)4] has also been considered. The proposed reaction paths have been substantiated through computation of structural, thermodynamic and kinetic parameters involved in the gas and solution phase, and also by topological analysis based on quantum theory of atoms in molecules of Bader and the ETS-NOCV energy decomposition scheme."
Novel approach for predicting partition coefficients of linear perfluorinated compounds,"A new approach for predicting octanol–water partition coefficients (Log P) of linear perfluorinated compounds is described, making use of the limited experimental data available, previous observations and the consistent similarities observed between the experimental and calculated (with electronic structure methods and using EPI Suite) slopes of the linear plots of Log P values with the number of carbon atoms (N = 2–11). Eight families of linear organic compounds were investigated: carboxylic acids, perfluorinated carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids and perfluorinated sulfonic acids, together with their corresponding conjugate bases."
Characterization of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Coatings Deposited by Low-Pressure Plasma Spraying,"The research presented here aimed to apply plasma spraying at a low pressure of 100 Pa for fabricating the columnar structure or dense coatings. These coatings with different structures were elaborated from the vapor condensation and molten droplets, respectively, using the agglomerated YSZ powders and a relatively low power commercial F4-VB torch. It was shown that the crystallite size of coating deposited from the vapor condensation at a spraying distance of 200 mm was reduced to 17.1 nm from 43.7 nm of the feedstock. Observations indicated that a thin columnar structured coating was produced out of the line of sight of projection. In the line of sight of projection, the hybrid structured coating was obtained. The relatively dense coating was fabricated using a specifically designed extended nozzle. Investigations by means of optical emission spectroscopy were performed to analyze the nature of the plasma jet with YSZ powders. The Vickers microhardness was also conducted. It was found that the relatively dense coating showed a higher value in comparison to the hybrid structure coating, up to 1273 ± 56 Hv100g."
Late L2ers can acquire grammatical features that do not occur in their L1: Evidence from the effect of animacy on verb agreement in L1 Chinese,"Second language (L2) learners often have persistent difficulty with agreement between the number of the subject and the number of the verb. This study tested whether deviant L2 verb number agreement reflects maturational constraints on acquiring new grammatical features or resource limitations that impede access to the representations of L2 grammatical features. L1-Chinese undergraduate students at three age of arrival (AoA) levels were tested for online verb agreement accuracy by completing preambles in three animacy combinations: animate–inanimate [AI; e.g., The officer(s) from the station(s)], inanimate–animate [IA; e.g., The letters from the lawyer(s)], and inanimate–inanimate [II; e.g., The poster(s) from the museum(s)]. AI should be less costly to process than IA or II sequences, because animacy supports the subject in AI but competes with the subject for control of agreement in IA sequences, and is neutralized in II. Agreement accuracy was greater overall for AI than for IA or II, and although an AoA-related increase in erroneous agreement after plural subjects occurred for IA and II, there were no AoA effects for AI. Higher scores on memory tasks were associated with greater agreement accuracy, and the memory tasks significantly predicted variance in erroneous agreement when AoA was partialed out. The fact that even late learners can do verb agreement in the case of AI demonstrates that they can acquire new grammatical features. The greater difficulty with agreement in the case of IA or II than of AI, in conjunction with the results for the memory tasks, supports the resource limitation hypothesis."
One-step hydrothermal synthesis of Fe3O4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites with improved photocatalytic activities,"The nanocomposites of g-C3N4 supported by Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4/g-C3N4) have been fabricated through a simple hydrothermal route in a water–ethanol system. The nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. The results showed that g-C3N4 nanosheets were decorated randomly by Fe3O4 nanoparticles with average diameters of 7 nm. The photocatalytic activities were evaluated in terms of the efficiencies of photodecomposition of Rhodamine B in aqueous solution under visible light illumination. The as-synthesized Fe3O4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites showed unprecedented photodecomposition efficiency compared with pure g-C3N4 under visible-light. The Fe3O4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites with improved photocatalytic activities would have a great potential in removing organic dyes from polluted water."
Different cytokine profiles of skin-derived T cell cultures from patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis,"To investigate differences in expression of surface markers, cytokine profiles, and presence of CD4+CD8+ T cells in skin-derived T cell cultures from patients with extrinsic atopic dermatitis (AD), intrinsic AD, and psoriasis expanded in the presence of IL-2 and IL-4."
The object detection logic of latent variable technologies,"Endemic to theoretical and applied psychometrics is a failure to appreciate that the logic at root of each and every latent variable technology is object detection logic. The predictable consequence of a discipline’s losing sight of an organizing logic, is that superficiality, confusion, and mischaracterization are visited upon discussion. In this paper, I elucidate the detection logic that is the foundational, and unifying, logic, of latent variable technology, and discuss and dissolve a number of the more egregious forms of confusion and mischaracterization that, consequent upon its having been disregarded, have come to infect psychometrics."
Early adult learning affects host preferences in the tephritid parasitoid Psyttalia concolor (Hymenoptera: Braconidae),"Parasitic wasps rely on a hierarchy of stimuli to locate their hosts. Olfactory cues from the natal host complex affect parasitoid preferences and can be learned by parasitoids during larval stages and the early adult stage. While the existence of pre-imaginal conditioning has been documented in several braconid aphid parasitoids, no evidence has yet been provided for parasitic wasps attacking Tephritidae. Psyttalia concolor (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a koinobiont larval–pupal endoparasitoid of tephritid flies. In this study, we evaluated the influence of larval and early adult experience on subsequent host seeking in P. concolor females. Parasitoids were reared using Ceratitis capitata or Bactrocera oleae larvae as hosts, and emerging wasp adults were tested for host preferences in two-choice bioassays. P. concolor females preferred to oviposit in, and had higher oviposition success rates on the natal host. When P. concolor females were excised from their host puparia, preventing them from chewing emergence holes, they lost their natal host preference, solidifying the evidence of early adult learning for host selection. This study adds to the growing body of basic knowledge on braconid host-location behavior. From an applied point of view, training procedures for early adult learning has potential for use in mass rearing of parasitoids employed in biological control programs against tephritid flies."
Reliability and Association with Injury of Movement Screens: A Critical Review,"Subjective assessment of athletes’ movement quality is widely used by physiotherapists and other applied practitioners within many sports. One of the beliefs driving this practice is that individuals who display ‘poor’ movement patterns are more likely to suffer an injury than those who do not. The aim of this review was to summarize the reliability of the movement screens currently documented within the scientific literature and explore the evidence surrounding their association with injury risk. Ten assessments with accompanying reliability data were identified through the literature search. Only two of these ten had any evidence directly related to injury risk. A number of methodological issues were present throughout the identified studies, including small sample sizes, lack of descriptive rater or participant information, ambiguous injury definitions, lack of exposure time reporting and risk of bias. These factors, combined with the paucity of research on this topic, make drawing conclusions as to the reliability and predictive ability of movement screens difficult. None of the movement screens that appear within the scientific literature currently have enough evidence to justify the tag of ‘injury prediction tool’."
Differences in Problems Paying Medical Bills between African Americans and Whites from 2007 and 2009: the Underlying Role of Health Status,"Although the proportion of people reporting problems paying medical bills has declined in the aftermath of the Great Recession, it is unclear if this decline has been caused by self-rationing of care, particularly among disadvantaged groups. We examined African American-White differences in problems paying medical bills prevalence along with factors which may account for observed differences."
PET/MRI of Hepatic 90Y Microsphere Deposition Determines Individual Tumor Response,The purpose of our study is to determine if there is a relationship between dose deposition measured by PET/MRI and individual lesion response to yttrium-90 (90Y) microsphere radioembolization.
Economic factors on the mate selection by the human face and voice,"Humans are reported to be the eighth most visually sexually dimorphic primates. The visual difference between men and women can be attributed to variance in height, weight, body fat, muscle distribution, body hair, facial hair, etc. However, the most obvious difference between men and women occur in faces and voices. Now, one can raise the question, what mechanism is responsible for creating mate dimorphism? Mate selection arises due to the differential reproductive success among individuals in obtaining mates. Women tend to choose masculine- faced men who tend to have good genes so that their offspring may inherit the good genes to be able to survive and thrive in the hostile environment. The trend of men having many wives has a strong tie with economy. Men and women have vast difference in face features and voice pitch. The new trends have arrived in which women started to choose feminized men as their mates. Men started to “hide” their masculinity by trimming their beard, softening their voices, wearing tight clothes and so forth. This paper will present how the mate selection shaped on the economic factors in human faces and voices."
The effect of stiffener on behavior of reduced beam section connections in steel moment-resisting frames,"Reduced Beam Section (RBS) connections are a new type of connection which have been used in steel moment-resisting frames since the 1994 Northridge earthquake. This study is primarily aimed at analyzing the effects of suitable web stiffeners on preventing the deterioration effect of the hysteresis curve for RBS connections. Results of more than 183 nonlinear finite element analyses on different IPE sections with radius cut, straight cut, and drilled-flange RBS connection showed that different web stiffeners considerably contribute to the enhancement of seismic performance of RBS connections. In this research, the effects of factors such as the geometry and the number of the stiffeners, the distance between the stiffener and column side, and the length and thickness of the stiffener on the seismic performance of RBS connections were also studied."
The relationship between temperature behaviors and section factors of fire spray protection coated composite beams exposed to standard fire,"Concrete-steel composite beams, when they are exposed to high temperatures, it increases the quantity of heat inside the composite beams that restrain temperature rise caused by concretes. As a result, composite beams appear to have better fire resistance efficiency than regular steel beams due to the integrated structure between materials. In the case of composite beams, the temperature rise of steel exposed externally is directly related to the shape of sections and the degree of exposure. In this study, fireproof spray coat, approved as fire resistant construction for composite beams and regular steel beams, are coated in the same thickness and exposed to standard fire conditions. Then, the relationship between temperature history of steel and section factors of composite beams, derived from the fire resistance test result, is compared and analyzed. As a result, we came to a conclusion that the steel temperature measurement results and section factors per material are closely related, and it suggests that a standard approval of fire resistant construction can be widely used, instead of getting approval for each member, if relatively better performance can be predicted by distinct condition of fire resistance efficiency of members."
Does conflict matter? Spatial distribution of disposal sites in Japan,"This study is an empirical investigation of the location of industrial waste disposal sites in Japan. We found some evidence of spatial concentration of industrial waste disposal sites in area with other waste-related facilities. In addition, we found a higher number of industrial waste disposal sites per capita in municipalities that had not experienced conflict relating to the construction of disposal sites. Our results suggest that companies may decide to locate disposal sites in areas in which other waste-related facilities already exist and/or where there is less citizen conflict over their construction. This would explain why there is a spatial concentration of unwanted facilities in some areas."
A Modified Method Combining Z-Epicanthoplasty and Blepharoplasty to Develop Out-Fold Type Double Eyelids,"The epicanthus can weaken the effect of blepharoplasty, which makes it difficult to form the out-fold type double eyelids preferred by Asian women. The integration of blepharoplasty and Z-epicanthoplasty has become increasingly popular. Although many techniques have been introduced to remove the epicanthus during blepharoplasty, there are still some surgical complications."
Occurrence of Breast Mucinous Carcinoma After Autologous Fat Grating for Breast Augmentation,"Autologous fat grafting is commonly performed in reconstructive breast surgery as well as in aesthetic breast augmentation surgery. Nevertheless, little is known about the interaction between fat grafts and cancer. A 36-year-old patient had undergone bilateral breast augmentation with autologous fat grafting. Two months after surgery, she perceived two small palpable indurations in the right breast. Nine months after the procedure, the lumps grew bigger and lumpectomy was performed. Histologic examination of the specimens showed mucinous carcinoma of the breast. This case raises once again the question about the possible links between breast cancer and fat grafts. The level of evidence is level V."
Simple and accurate optical height sensor for wafer inspection systems,"An accurate method for measuring the wafer surface height is required for wafer inspection systems to adjust the focus of inspection optics quickly and precisely. A method for projecting a laser spot onto the wafer surface obliquely and for detecting its image displacement using a one-dimensional position-sensitive detector is known, and a variety of methods have been proposed for improving the accuracy by compensating the measurement error due to the surface patterns. We have developed a simple and accurate method in which an image of a reticle with eight slits is projected on the wafer surface and its reflected image is detected using an image sensor. The surface height is calculated by averaging the coordinates of the images of the slits in both the two directions in the captured image. Pattern-related measurement error was reduced by applying the coordinates averaging to the multiple-slit-projection method. Accuracy of better than 0.35 μm was achieved for a patterned wafer at the reference height and ±0.1 mm from the reference height in a simple configuration."
Calibration method of laser plane equation for vision measurement adopting objective function of uniform horizontal height of feature points,"A calibration method with an objective function generated from a uniform horizontal height is presented in this work for the laser plane in active vision measurement. A height target is developed with a center mark as the initial point of the uniform height. The height target is located on the horizontal plane of the 3D calibration board so that the horizontal plane is considered as the terminal of the uniform horizontal height. Based on the pinhole model of the camera and the laser plane equation, we model the objective function to find the optimal coefficients of the laser plane equation. The goal of the objective function is the smallest difference of the uniform height and the reconstructed height according to the feature points of the target. The objective function is optimized by the local particle swarm optimization. The calibrated global equation of a laser plane is obtained from the optimal value 1.153 × 103 of the objective function in the experiments. Two projective laser lines of the calibration laser plane cover the original laser lines in the image. The reconstruction errors of the calibration plane are also analyzed in discussions."
Impact of bloodstream infections on catheter colonization during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,"There are concerns about secondary extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) catheter infections in bacteremic patients. We investigated the association between blood stream infection (BSI) and ECMO catheter colonization. From January 2012 to August 2014, 47 adults who received ECMO support were enrolled. The ECMO catheter tip was cultured at the end of the ECMO procedure. The enrolled patients were classified into two groups according to the presence of BSI during ECMO support and analyzed with respect to ECMO catheter colonization. Of 47 cases, BSI during ECMO was identified in 13 patients (27.7 %). ECMO catheter colonization was identified in 6 (46.2 %) patients in the BSI group and 3 (8.8 %) in the non-BSI group. BSI during ECMO support was independently associated with ECMO catheter colonization [odds ratio (OR) 5.55; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.00–30.73; p = 0.049]. The organisms colonizing ECMO catheters in the setting of primary BSI were predominantly Gram-positive cocci and Candida species. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most common colonizing pathogen in the setting of secondary BSI. All the organisms colonizing ECMO catheters were multi-drug resistant organisms, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Candida glabrata, and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. ECMO catheters may become contaminated with multi-drug resistant pathogens in the presence of BSI. Therefore, ECMO should be applied cautiously in septic patients with bacteremia caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens."
Comparison of subcutaneous and intravenous continuous glucose monitoring accuracy in an operating room and an intensive care unit,"Although we have used an 
intravenous continuous glucose monitor for blood glucose management, a previous study reported that a subcutaneous continuous glucose monitor was also reliable for use in critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to compare the subcutaneous and intravenous continuous glucose monitors. This was an observational trial (UMIN-CTR, ID:000013338). We included patients who were admitted to our intensive care units (ICU) after hepato-biliary pancreatic surgery. Continuous blood glucose measurement was performed from the beginning of the operation to ICU discharge using the intravenous continuous monitor STG-55 (Nikkiso, Tokyo, Japan) and the subcutaneous continuous monitor iPro2 (Medtronic Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The STG-55 measured the glucose level in real time, and the iPro2 measured this every 5 min. We compared glucose levels obtained using the two devices every 5 min using a Bland–Altman plot and a regression analyses. A total of 3592 comparative samples in 15 cases were analyzed. The mean glucose level measured using the STG-55 was 139 ± 21 mg/dl, and that measured using the iPro2 was 144 ± 31 mg/dl. A linear regression line had the equation of the form y = 0.225x + 106. The coefficient of determination was 0.11, and the F-test significance level was set as p < 0.01. The mean of the differences was −5.2 mg/dl, with a 95 % agreement limit of −67 to + 57 mg/dL. The percent error was 44 %. In conclusion, the current study suggests that subcutaneous and intravenous continuous glucose monitoring was not highly correlated during either surgery or ICU stay."
Water binding analysis of fat-water emulsions,"Low-field NMR was used for analysis of water binding in fat-in-water emulsions. Bovine fat was used and native potato starch was used as an emulsifying agent. Starch can be applied as an emulsifying agent although the starch content should not be lower than 0.17 g/g of water at fat concentrations in water amounting to 25%. Interactions of bovine fat with chains of starch exceeded the actions of water molecules with the polymer, leading to advantageous conformation changes. Bovine fat restricts the unfavourable influence of starch retrogradation. This, in turn, leads to a slowing of the syneresis process."
Effects of microwave roasting on physicochemical properties of pistachios (Pistaciavera L.),"Effects of 480 and 640 W power levels and 2, 3 and 4 min for roasting of pistachios using microwaves (MW) on the physicochemical properties of pistachios in comparison with an Iranian traditional method of soaking in salty water and drying under hot-air at 135°C for 20 min were investigated. MW roasting of pistachios decreased water activity values, producing a softer nut. Twenty one volatile compounds were identified in roasted pistachios using GC-MS. The highest volatile concentration and sensory odor intensity scores were observed for hot air roasted pistachios and MW at 640 W for 4 min. Roasting reduced the force needed to cut pistachios. Unsaturated fatty acid contents in MW roasted pistachios were higher (82.0%) than in hot-air produced nuts (74.7%). Total phenolic content values increased with roasting time and with the MW power level. Pistachios can be successfully roasted using microwaves as a fast and economical method."
Identification of a novel sugar compound from Korean pine seeds,"Sugar derivatives are critically important in nutritional, pharmaceutical, and some non-food industries. Amino sugars are more important as essential components of many drugs, antibiotics, and biopolymers. Hence, a novel amino sugar compound is worthy of investigation for identification and production. A novel amino sugar compound was identified from crude extracts of Korean pine seed embryos. This new compound was isolated from extracts using traditional purification steps. The pure compound was white in color with a melting point of 145°C. HPLC, TLC, FT-IR, and NMR analyses of the compound indicated a trisaccharide form of amino mannose that was polymerized with β-(1→2) glycosidic bonding. Computer-aided NMR spectral analysis of the trisaccharide of 2-dehydro-2-mannosamine exhibited a 96% match with the 13C-NMR spectrum of the new compound."
The influence of geometric heterogeneity of closed carbon nanotube bundles on benzene adsorption from the gaseous phase-Monte Carlo simulations,"Benzene adsorption from the gaseous phase at 298 K and the thermodynamics of this process using Monte Carlo methods is studied. A series of closed single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) bundles (triangular packing arrangement) with various distance between nanotubes is investigated. Isolated closed nanotube is treated as the reference system. Benzene is considered as a model compound to represent aromatics. Simulation results show the significant effect of the geometric heterogeneity on benzene adsorption as well as the enthalpy and entropy at low surface coverages. For insignificantly separated nanotubes and at low benzene uptakes, the entropy of the adsorbed phase is close to the entropy of solid benzene. Therefore, C6H6 molecules strongly interacting with walls are ordered in quasi-solid structures. At higher surface coverages, the ordering and packing of benzene molecules is liquid-like. The geometry of bundles (mutual position of SWCNTs) significantly influences the position and orientation of adsorbed molecules against the wall."
Early adult learning affects host preferences in the tephritid parasitoid Psyttalia concolor (Hymenoptera: Braconidae),"Parasitic wasps rely on a hierarchy of stimuli to locate their hosts. Olfactory cues from the natal host complex affect parasitoid preferences and can be learned by parasitoids during larval stages and the early adult stage. While the existence of pre-imaginal conditioning has been documented in several braconid aphid parasitoids, no evidence has yet been provided for parasitic wasps attacking Tephritidae. Psyttalia concolor (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a koinobiont larval–pupal endoparasitoid of tephritid flies. In this study, we evaluated the influence of larval and early adult experience on subsequent host seeking in P. concolor females. Parasitoids were reared using Ceratitis capitata or Bactrocera oleae larvae as hosts, and emerging wasp adults were tested for host preferences in two-choice bioassays. P. concolor females preferred to oviposit in, and had higher oviposition success rates on the natal host. When P. concolor females were excised from their host puparia, preventing them from chewing emergence holes, they lost their natal host preference, solidifying the evidence of early adult learning for host selection. This study adds to the growing body of basic knowledge on braconid host-location behavior. From an applied point of view, training procedures for early adult learning has potential for use in mass rearing of parasitoids employed in biological control programs against tephritid flies."
Daytime birth and postbirth behavior of wild Rhinopithecus roxellana in the Qinling Mountains of China,"Reports and quantitative descriptions of wild primate births are rare due to the frequent occurrence of nighttime parturitions. The aim of this study was to describe in detail one daytime birth event in a free-ranging band of Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana), a highly endangered colobine species endemic to China. Using focal-animal sampling, we recorded both the birth event and behavior of the mother and other group members. The partum stage lasted 4 min 10 s. Immediately after parturition, the mother severed the umbilical cord, ingested the placenta, and cleaned the newborn. During the birthing process, the mother received what may possibly be described as birth assistance from one multiparous female within the same one-male unit. Although “aunting” or infant caregiving behavior has previously been reported in coloblines, this is the first putative case of birth assistance in a nonhuman primate."
Economics of collective monitoring: a study of environmentally constrained electricity generators,"This paper investigates the costs of monitoring of a distributed multi-agent economic activity in the presence of constraints on the agents’ joint outputs. If the regulator monitors agents individually she calculates each agent’s optimal contribution to the constrains by solving a constrained welfare-maximisation problem. This will maximise welfare but may be expensive because monitoring cost rises with the number of agents. Alternatively, the regulator could monitor agents collectively, using a detector, or detectors, to observe if each constraint is jointly satisfied. This will ease implementation cost, but lower welfare. We define the welfare difference between each regime of monitoring for a fairly inclusive electricity generation model and formulate some predictions. The behaviour of two generators in a coupled-constrained, three-node case study reproduces these predictions. We find that the welfare loss from collective monitoring can be small if the constraints are tight. We also learn that, under either regime, the imposition of transmission and environmental restrictions may benefit the less efficient generator and shift surplus share towards the emitters, decreasing consumer surplus."
Development of a Numerical Method for Patient-Specific Cerebral Circulation Using 1D–0D Simulation of the Entire Cardiovascular System with SPECT Data,"The detailed flow information in the circle of Willis (CoW) can facilitate a better understanding of disease progression, and provide useful references for disease treatment. We have been developing a one-dimensional–zero-dimensional (1D–0D) simulation method for the entire cardiovascular system to obtain hemodynamics information in the CoW. This paper presents a new method for applying 1D–0D simulation to an individual patient using patient-specific data. The key issue is how to adjust the deviation of physiological parameters, such as peripheral resistance, from literature data when patient-specific geometry is used. In order to overcome this problem, we utilized flow information from single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) data. A numerical method was developed to optimize physiological parameters by adjusting peripheral cerebral resistance to minimize the difference between the resulting flow rate and the SPECT data in the efferent arteries of the CoW. The method was applied to three cases using different sets of patient-specific data in order to investigate the hemodynamics of the CoW. The resulting flow rates in the afferent arteries were compared to those of the phase-contrast magnetic resonance angiography (PC-MRA) data. Utilization of the SPECT data combined with the PC-MRA data showed a good agreement in flow rates in the afferent arteries of the CoW with those of PC-MRA data for all three cases. The results also demonstrated that application of SPECT data alone could provide the information on the ratios of flow distributions among arteries in the CoW."

Does conflict matter? Spatial distribution of disposal sites in Japan,"This study is an empirical investigation of the location of industrial waste disposal sites in Japan. We found some evidence of spatial concentration of industrial waste disposal sites in area with other waste-related facilities. In addition, we found a higher number of industrial waste disposal sites per capita in municipalities that had not experienced conflict relating to the construction of disposal sites. Our results suggest that companies may decide to locate disposal sites in areas in which other waste-related facilities already exist and/or where there is less citizen conflict over their construction. This would explain why there is a spatial concentration of unwanted facilities in some areas."

Ethanolic extract from Rubus coreanus enhanced swimming capacity in mice,"Swimming enhancement effects of ethanol extract from ripe Rubus coreanus (RCE) fruits were investigated in mice. An Ex-RCE group was orally administered 1 g/kg body weight/day of RCE. An Ex-Control group received distilled water for 28 days. Exhaustive swimming times were significantly (p<0.05) prolonged in Ex-RCE mice, compared with Ex-Control mice. Ex-RCE mice had lower lactate and higher glucose levels after exhaustive swimming. Plasma non-esterified fatty acid levels in Ex-RCE mice were significantly (p<0.05) increased during swimming, compared with Ex-Control. Lower plasma triglyceride levels were shown in Ex-RCE mice after swimming. Ex-RCE mice exhibited higher muscle glycogen and lower malondialdehyde levels, compared with Ex-Control mice. RCE is a useful agent for enhancement of the swimming capacity and amelioration of physical fatigue via a decrease in lactate accumulation, and supply of energy sources via glycogen sparing and facilitation of fat use, and reduction of lipid peroxidation levels through swimming."
"Effects of adsorbents on benzo(a)pyrene, sesamol, and sesamolin contents and volatile component profiles in sesame oil","Effects of adsorbent treatments used for reduction of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) levels in volatile profiles and sesamol and sesamolin antioxidant contents in sesame oil were evaluated. Charcoal-based activated carbons with different mesh sizes and celite were used as adsorbents. Treatment with activated carbons led to reductions in BaP contents of sesame oil. A small charcoal-based activated carbon particle size was more effective for removal of BaP. Celite; however, did not show an effect on the BaP content of sesame oil under the experimental conditions. Volatile profiles of sesame oil were not influenced by addition of any adsorbent, and the sesamol and sesamolin contents were reduced by all adsorbents."
Evaluation of anti nutritional factors in fungal fermented cereals,"Cereals and legumes are rich in minerals, but the bioavailability of these minerals is usually low due to the presence of anti-nutritional factors, such as phytate, trypsin inhibitors, and tannin. Reductions in the influence of these factors is necessary to derive the full nutritive value of cereals and grains. Penicillium camemberti was grown on millets (kodo millet and proso millet) and legumes (moth beans and cow peas). Fermented grains were analyzed for the influence of anti-nutritional factors. Fermentation reduced the phytic acid content in proso millets. The tannin contents were reduced in both moth beans and cow peas while there were reductions of 38.3% and 74.3% in alkaloid contents in fermented moth beans and cowpeas. The trypsin inhibitor contents also decreased in all legumes and millets after solid state fermentation."
Autoxidation and photooxidation of triacylglycerols containing conjugated linoleic acids,"Soybean, cottonseed, and corn oils were hydrogenated to obtain triacyglycerols containing conjugated linoleic acids. The oxidative stability of soybean oil, cottonseed oil, and corn oil was less with CLA than without CLA during autoxidation. However, the autoxidative stability of oils increased as the CLA content increased. During photooxidation of oils, the oxidative stability of oils was higher with CLA than without CLA, and the stability of oils increased as the CLA content increased. The mechanisms of autoxidation and photooxidation of oils were probably due to the contents and anti- and prooxidant activities of individual conjugated linoleic acids in bulk oil, and minor compounds present in oils."
A partially purified lipid extracted from Ruditapes philippinarum suppresses cancer cell proliferation,"Anticancer effects of lipids from a clam cultivated in Korea were investigated. Hexane extracts of Ruditapes philippinarum (R. philippinarum) exhibited the highest apoptosis rate of 40.9% at 0.5 mg/mL in PC3 cells. Hexane extracts were further separated and purified using TLC. Final lipid compounds were isolated and identified. Monounsaturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid levels were significantly (p<0.05) increased in the purified lipid (19.71 and 34.63%), compared with the crude extract (12.96 and 15.56%). Partially purified lipid compounds exhibited an anticancer effect in several cancer cell lines, resulting in apoptosis rates in breast, lung, and liver cancer cells of 37.36, 17.78, 26.56%, respectively, at 30 µg/mL. This is the first report of an anticancer effect of a lipid extracted from R. philippinarum cultivated in Korea."
"Evaluation and prediction of metabolite production, antioxidant activities, and survival of Lactobacillus casei 431 in a pomegranate juice supplemented yogurt drink using support vector regression","Changes in physicochemical properties, metabolite production, antioxidant activities, and survival of Lactobacillus casei 431 in a yogurt drink as a function of inulin (0, 0.5, 1, and 2%), pomegranate juice concentrations (0, 3, 8, and 12%) and storage time were determined and predictive models were obtained using support vector regression. High levels of pomegranate juice were the most effective for promotion of antioxidant activity. Acidity and lactic acid amounts decreased with an increasing inulin content. Supplementation with inulin and pomegranate juice showed a positive effect on survival of L. casei. Support vector regression performance associated with polynomial and radial basis kernel functions was evaluated. The former was more efficient than the later."
Physical and chemical characteristics of chufa (Cyperus esculentus L.) oils extracted from chufa tubers grown in the mid-portion of Korea,"Physical and chemical characteristics of chufa oil extracted from chufa tubers were determined. Chufa, originally a weed in tropical and Mediterranean regions, is cultivated in Korea. n-Hexane was chosen as a solvent for extraction of neutral lipids. The extraction yield of crude lipids using n-hexane was 19.96% with a neutral lipid content of 94.6%. The extraction solvents n-hexane, diethyl ether, and chloroform/methanol affected the extraction yield but did not affect the acid, peroxide, and saponification values, and the refractive index of chufa oil. The iodine value and color of chufa oil were affected. The major fatty acids of chufa oil were oleic acid (64.4-66.1%), palmitic acid (15.2-16.0%), and linoleic acid (14.8-15.9%). The characteristics of chufa oil obtained from chufa tubers grown in Korea were not different from those in other regions."
Cell surface properties and biofilm formation of pathogenic bacteria,"Cell surface properties of slime production, cell hydrophobicity (CH), colony spreading, auto-aggregation, and biofilm formation (BF) of pathogens were investigated. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes generally formed strong biofilms and were positive slime producers. The extracellular polymeric substances isolated from agar-grown biofilms of Bacillus cereus and P. aeruginosa contained a high proportion of carbohydrates, proteins, and extracellular DNA. High levels of CH were observed for all pathogens when hydrocarbons were combined with ammonium sulfate (AS). Levels of hydrophobicity based on bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons using nonane with AS were positively correlated with hydrophobic interaction chromatography assay and contact-angle measurement results. BF and CH values of all pathogens, except E. coli O157:H7 and B. cereus, were highly correlated. Levels of pathogen hydrophobicity differed depending on the measurement method. Factors affecting BF were different depending upon the pathogen."
"The effect of Piper betle leaves on lacto-fermentation of idli batter, characterization and applicability of potent isolates in soymilk fermentation","The objectives of this study were to deduce the effect of Piper betle leaves on lactofermentation of the idli batter, characterize the potent lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and elucidate their beneficial properties in soymilk fermentation. Twenty potent LAB isolates (11 bacilli and 9 cocci) showing potent antibacterial activity against food borne pathogens were obtained from the seventy isolates screened. The 20 isolates identified using 16S rRNA and Multiplex PCR, belonged to Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. argentoratensis, Lactobacillus paraplantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Among the 20 isolates, KJBC11, KJBB56, KJBB37, and KJBC67 exhibited high phytase activity in phytate hydrolysis. The isolates, KJBC67, KJBC06, and KJBB56 were used in soymilk fermentation which showed considerable reduction in the polyphenol content and trypsin inhibitory activity. The isolates KJBB37 and KJBC04 showed about 56% DPPH scavenging activity in LAB fermented soymilk compared to unfermented soymilk. Thus, this study provides the beneficial potentials of LAB isolates."
Infusion of catechin into native corn starch granules for drug and nutrient delivery systems,"Hydrophilic nutrients, a water insoluble drug, and amino acids were used as infusion materials for analysis w ith HPLC and a micro-plate reader. Only catechin, gallic a cid, and caffeine infused into native corn starch granules. While catechin remained in the native corn starch granule after several washing steps, infused caffeine and gallic acid were washed out. A release study was also performed using pancreatin α-amylase. Infused catechin was successfully released when native corn starch granules were decomposed. Infusion and maintenance of catechin in native corn starch granules were probably due to a unique chemical structure of the benzene-tetrahydropyran group that affected interactions with starch. However, experiments using epicatechin and rutin indicated that the benzenetetrahydropyran group structure may not have been the only reason for infusion of guest materials. The 3 dimensional structure of the benzene-tetrahydropyran group probably also influenced infusion of materials."
Comparative study of fecal microbiota in patients with type II diabetes after consumption of apple juice for 4 weeks,"The effect of cloudy apple juice on fecal microbiota of type 2 diabetics was studied. Five volunteers consumed apple juice while 5 control volunteers received an isocaloric control beverage daily for 4 weeks. DGGE profile analysis showed high diversity between volunteers that did not change over the intervention period using primers for Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, bifidobacteria, enterococci, and enterobacteria. An exception was observed using lactobacilli primers, perhaps as the result of the dietary influence. Consumption of apple juice was not correlated with changes in DGGE profiles. Quantitative PCR was used to investigate the effect of apple juice on bacterial counts in different subgroups. Apple juice did not lead to significantly (p>0.05) different numbers of total bacteria, enterobacteria, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, or Bacteroidetes, but caused a significant (p<0.05) decrease in numbers of enterococci, and a smaller but also significant decrease in numbers of Firmicutes, when comparing before and after intervention with apple juice."
Protective effects of bioactive phenolics from jujube (Ziziphus jujuba) seeds against H2O2–induced oxidative stress in neuronal PC-12 cells,"Ziziphus jujuba (jujube) seeds were extracted with 60% (v/v) aqueous ethanol assisted by homogenization and sonication followed by fractionation into n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and water. The ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the highest levels of total phenolics (102.05 mg gallic acid equivalents/g fraction), total flavonoids (35.43 mg catechin equivalents/g fraction), and antioxidant capacity (271.67 and 66.02 mg vitamin C equivalents/g fraction in respective ABTS and DPPH assays) among the fractions tested. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the ethyl acetate fraction revealed 12 phenolic compounds: 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, methyldopa, p-coumaric acid, dihydro-p-coumaric acid, rutin, isoquercetin, kaempferol 3-O-rutinoside, 3-O-cis-p-coumaroylalphitolic acid, 2-O-cis-p-coumaroylalphitolic acid, 3-O-trans-p-coumaroylalphitolic acid, 3-O-cis-p-coumaroylmaslinic acid, and 3-O-trans-p-coumaroylmaslinic acid. Phenolic compounds generally increased viability, reduced lactate dehydrogenase release, and attenuated intracellular oxidative stress in PC-12 cells. The results of this study suggest that Z. jujuba seeds may serve as an effective source of antioxidative agents to reduce oxidative stress and enhance neuronal cell viability."
Hepatoprotective effect of Diospyros lotus leaf extract against acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury in mice,"The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of Diospyros lotus leaf extract (DLE) against acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver injury in mice. Administration of DLE significantly attenuated the levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and liver lipid peroxidation in APAP-treated mice. Histopathological examination showed that DLE treatment decreased the incidence of liver lesions in APAP-treated mice. DLE treatment markedly increased superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase activity, and glutathione levels in APAP-treated mice. Furthermore, DLE treatment significantly suppressed the production of proinflammatory factors such as the nitric oxide, IL-6, TNF-α, and iNOS in APAP-treated mice. These results suggest that DLE protects the liver from APAP-induced hepatic injury via antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects."
Beneficial effect of seaweed on high-fat diet-induced oxidative stress and insulin resistance in rats,"Effect of extracts from Capsosiphon fulvescens, Hizikia fusiforme, and Undaria pinnatifida blades on development of oxidative stress and insulin resistance in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were studied. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a normal diet, HFD, and HFD-supplemented with C. fulvescens, H. fusiforme, or U. pinnatifida blades for 8 weeks. Supplementation with C. fulvescens and H. fusiforme extracts significantly (p<0.05) elevated the plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration in HFD-fed rats, compared with controls. The plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substance level was significantly (p<0.05) lower in H. fusiforme and U. pinnatifida blade group rats than in HFD group rats. C. fulvescens, H. fusiforme, and U. pinnatifida blade extracts significantly (p<0.05) attenuated the effects of the HFD on plasma total antioxidant and superoxide dismutase activities, and on development of insulin resistance. Consumption of seaweed extracts increased antioxidant effects and improved insulin resistance in HFD-fed rats."
Water binding analysis of fat-water emulsions,"Low-field NMR was used for analysis of water binding in fat-in-water emulsions. Bovine fat was used and native potato starch was used as an emulsifying agent. Starch can be applied as an emulsifying agent although the starch content should not be lower than 0.17 g/g of water at fat concentrations in water amounting to 25%. Interactions of bovine fat with chains of starch exceeded the actions of water molecules with the polymer, leading to advantageous conformation changes. Bovine fat restricts the unfavourable influence of starch retrogradation. This, in turn, leads to a slowing of the syneresis process."
Effects of microwave roasting on physicochemical properties of pistachios (Pistaciavera L.),"Effects of 480 and 640 W power levels and 2, 3 and 4 min for roasting of pistachios using microwaves (MW) on the physicochemical properties of pistachios in comparison with an Iranian traditional method of soaking in salty water and drying under hot-air at 135°C for 20 min were investigated. MW roasting of pistachios decreased water activity values, producing a softer nut. Twenty one volatile compounds were identified in roasted pistachios using GC-MS. The highest volatile concentration and sensory odor intensity scores were observed for hot air roasted pistachios and MW at 640 W for 4 min. Roasting reduced the force needed to cut pistachios. Unsaturated fatty acid contents in MW roasted pistachios were higher (82.0%) than in hot-air produced nuts (74.7%). Total phenolic content values increased with roasting time and with the MW power level. Pistachios can be successfully roasted using microwaves as a fast and economical method."
Identification of a novel sugar compound from Korean pine seeds,"Sugar derivatives are critically important in nutritional, pharmaceutical, and some non-food industries. Amino sugars are more important as essential components of many drugs, antibiotics, and biopolymers. Hence, a novel amino sugar compound is worthy of investigation for identification and production. A novel amino sugar compound was identified from crude extracts of Korean pine seed embryos. This new compound was isolated from extracts using traditional purification steps. The pure compound was white in color with a melting point of 145°C. HPLC, TLC, FT-IR, and NMR analyses of the compound indicated a trisaccharide form of amino mannose that was polymerized with β-(1→2) glycosidic bonding. Computer-aided NMR spectral analysis of the trisaccharide of 2-dehydro-2-mannosamine exhibited a 96% match with the 13C-NMR spectrum of the new compound."
Top-K Miner: top-K identical frequent itemsets discovery without user support threshold,"Frequent itemsets (FIs) mining is a prime research area in association rule mining. The customary techniques find FIs or its variants on the basis of either support threshold value or by setting two generic parameters, i.e., N (topmost itemsets) and \(K_\mathrm{{max}}\) (size of the itemsets). However, users are unable to mine the absolute desired number of patterns because they tune these approaches with their approximate parameters settings. We proposed a novel technique, top-K Miner that does not require setting of support threshold, N and \(K_\mathrm{{max}}\) values. Top-K Miner requires the user to specify only a single parameter, i.e., K to find the desired number of frequent patterns called identical frequent itemsets (IFIs). Top-K Miner uses a novel candidate production algorithm called join-FI algorithm. This algorithm uses frequent 2-itemsets to yield one or more candidate itemsets of arbitrary size. The join-FI algorithm follows bottom-up recursive technique to construct candidate-itemsets-search tree. Finally, the generated candidate itemsets are manipulated by the Maintain-Top-K_List algorithm to produce Top-K_List of the IFIs. The proposed top-K Miner algorithm significantly outperforms the generic benchmark techniques even when they are running with the ideal parameters settings."
Dynamic socialized Gaussian process models for human behavior prediction in a health social network,"Modeling and predicting human behaviors, such as the level and intensity of physical activity, is a key to preventing the cascade of obesity and helping spread healthy behaviors in a social network. In our conference paper, we have developed a social influence model, named socialized Gaussian process (SGP), for socialized human behavior modeling. Instead of explicitly modeling social influence as individuals’ behaviors influenced by their friends’ previous behaviors, SGP models the dynamic social correlation as the result of social influence. The SGP model naturally incorporates personal behavior factor and social correlation factor (i.e., the homophily principle: Friends tend to perform similar behaviors) into a unified model. And it models the social influence factor (i.e., an individual’s behavior can be affected by his/her friends) implicitly in dynamic social correlation schemes. The detailed experimental evaluation has shown the SGP model achieves better prediction accuracy compared with most of baseline methods. However, a Socialized Random Forest model may perform better at the beginning compared with the SGP model. One of the main reasons is the dynamic social correlation function is purely based on the users’ sequential behaviors without considering other physical activity-related features. To address this issue, we further propose a novel “multi-feature SGP model” (mfSGP) which improves the SGP model by using multiple physical activity-related features in the dynamic social correlation learning. Extensive experimental results illustrate that the mfSGP model clearly outperforms all other models in terms of prediction accuracy and running time."
Three novel indirect indicators for the assessment of papers and authors based on generations of citations,"A new indirect indicator is introduced for the assessment of scientific publications. The proposed indicator (\(fp^{k}\)-index) takes into account both the direct and indirect impact of scientific publications and their age. The indicator builds on the concept of generations of citations and acts as a measure of the accumulated impact of each scientific publication. A number of cases are examined that demonstrate the way the indicator behaves under well defined conditions in a Paper-Citation graph, like when a paper is cited by a highly cited paper, when cycles exist and when self-citations and chords are examined. Two new indicators for the assessment of authors are also proposed (fa-index and fas-index) that utilize the \(fp^{k}\)-index values of the scientific publications included in the Publication Record of an author. Finally, a comparative study of the \(fp^{k}\) and \(fa^{k}\) indices and a list of well known direct (Number of Citations, Mean number of citations, Contemporary h-index) and indirect (PageRank, SCEAS) indicators is presented."
Identification of Small Molecular Inhibitors for Efflux Protein: DrrA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by intracellular bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Development of multidrug resistant strains is one of the major challenges for current TB therapy. The Doxorubicin resistance ATP-binding protein DrrA (DrrA) is an efflux protein. DrrA extrudes the drug molecules from the cytoplasm, which reduces the drug concentration inside the cell and develops resistance to the drugs. The efflux mechanism is initiated by a complex formation between DrrA and DrrB proteins. In the present work inhibitors are identified to inhibit the binding of DrrA with DrrB protein. The structure of DrrA protein is generated, validated and active site studies are taken up using standard in silico protocols. The Virtual screening studies are performed and ADME properties are predicted to identify competitive inhibitors for DrrA protein at DrrB binding site. The study discloses amino acid residues Gln198, Leu200, Glu201, Asp 214, Glu237 and Ile238 are important for binding in the DrrA protein with ligand molecules. These ligand molecules can be treated as potent inhibitors for DrrA protein."
The changes of bridge loads during the long-term period,"The aim of the paper is an analysis of bridge loads changes in the 20th century. The Polish bridge load standards issued in the 20th century are considered here. The two static approaches are adopted on the basis of the model of the real composite of a steel and concrete bridge carrying-deck. The first of them, the traditional simplified Courbon method which was in use up to the 1970s, gives bending moment results. The other one is the analysis by the ABAQUS FEM. The dynamic response of the structure is performed for the set of velocities starting from 10 km/h to 90 km/h. Basing on the obtained results, it is concluded that the load increase is essential for bridge sustainability in all phases i.e. for design, maintenance and optional rebuilding. Having in mind that, in general, the indicative service life of a bridge is intended for 100 years approximately, i.e. for three generations, the prognosis of load changes is crucial. The bridge load effects increase over the past century is estimated at 60% to 85%, it being at least 30%."
The dynamics of narrative writing in primary grade children: writing process factors predict story quality,"In this study of third grade school children, we investigated the association between writing process measures recorded with key stroke logging and the final written product. Moreover, we examined the cognitive predictors of writing process and product measures. Analyses of key strokes showed that while most children spontaneously made local online revisions while writing, few revised previously written text. Children with good reading and spelling abilities made more online revisions than their peers. Two process factors, transcription fluency and online revision activity, contributed to explaining variance in narrative macrostructural quality and story length. As for cognitive predictors, spelling was the only factor that gave a unique contribution to explaining variance in writing process factors. Better spelling was associated with more revisions and faster transcription. The results show that developing writers’ ability to make online revisions in creative writing tasks is related to both the quality of the final written product and to individual literacy skills. More generally, the findings indicate that investigations of the dynamics of the writing process may provide insights into the factors that contribute to creative writing during early stages of literacy."
The object detection logic of latent variable technologies,"Endemic to theoretical and applied psychometrics is a failure to appreciate that the logic at root of each and every latent variable technology is object detection logic. The predictable consequence of a discipline’s losing sight of an organizing logic, is that superficiality, confusion, and mischaracterization are visited upon discussion. In this paper, I elucidate the detection logic that is the foundational, and unifying, logic, of latent variable technology, and discuss and dissolve a number of the more egregious forms of confusion and mischaracterization that, consequent upon its having been disregarded, have come to infect psychometrics."
Vascular Prostheses Based on Nanofibers from Aliphatic Copolyamide,"Tubular grafts based on nanofibers of copolymer of ε-caprolactam and hexamethylendiaminadipate were obtained by the electrospinning method. The strength of materials based on the dry nanofibers was 6.2 MPa with elongation at break of 133%, or 7.5 MPa and 299% in saline, respectively. The pressure value at which liquid started seeping through the tube wall was P = 10 kPa. Absence of cytotoxicity was proved, as well as adhesion and proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells on the surface. Tubes with inner diameter of 1 mm were tested in vivo in rat abdominal aorta. A layer of endothelial cells was shown to form on the inner side of the prosthesis after 30 days. There was no evidence of stenosis or dilatation of the prosthesis after 14 months with observation of endothelial and subendothelial layers."
The effect of stiffener on behavior of reduced beam section connections in steel moment-resisting frames,"Reduced Beam Section (RBS) connections are a new type of connection which have been used in steel moment-resisting frames since the 1994 Northridge earthquake. This study is primarily aimed at analyzing the effects of suitable web stiffeners on preventing the deterioration effect of the hysteresis curve for RBS connections. Results of more than 183 nonlinear finite element analyses on different IPE sections with radius cut, straight cut, and drilled-flange RBS connection showed that different web stiffeners considerably contribute to the enhancement of seismic performance of RBS connections. In this research, the effects of factors such as the geometry and the number of the stiffeners, the distance between the stiffener and column side, and the length and thickness of the stiffener on the seismic performance of RBS connections were also studied."
The relationship between temperature behaviors and section factors of fire spray protection coated composite beams exposed to standard fire,"Concrete-steel composite beams, when they are exposed to high temperatures, it increases the quantity of heat inside the composite beams that restrain temperature rise caused by concretes. As a result, composite beams appear to have better fire resistance efficiency than regular steel beams due to the integrated structure between materials. In the case of composite beams, the temperature rise of steel exposed externally is directly related to the shape of sections and the degree of exposure. In this study, fireproof spray coat, approved as fire resistant construction for composite beams and regular steel beams, are coated in the same thickness and exposed to standard fire conditions. Then, the relationship between temperature history of steel and section factors of composite beams, derived from the fire resistance test result, is compared and analyzed. As a result, we came to a conclusion that the steel temperature measurement results and section factors per material are closely related, and it suggests that a standard approval of fire resistant construction can be widely used, instead of getting approval for each member, if relatively better performance can be predicted by distinct condition of fire resistance efficiency of members."
Maximum-likelihood q-estimator uncovers the role of potassium at neuromuscular junctions,"Recently, we demonstrated the existence of nonextensive behavior in neuromuscular transmission (da Silva et al. in Phys Rev E 84:041925, 2011). In this letter, we first obtain a maximum-likelihood q-estimator to calculate the scale factor (\(\alpha \)) and the q-index of q-Gaussian distributions. Next, we use the indexes to analyze spontaneous miniature end plate potentials in electrophysiological recordings from neuromuscular junctions. These calculations were performed assuming both normal and high extracellular potassium concentrations \([K^{+}]_{o}\). This protocol was used to test the validity of Tsallis statistics under electrophysiological conditions closely resembling physiological stimuli. The analysis shows that q-indexes are distinct depending on the extracellular potassium concentration. Our letter provides a general way to obtain the best estimate of parameters from a q-Gaussian distribution function. It also expands the validity of Tsallis statistics in realistic physiological stimulus conditions. In addition, we discuss the physical and physiological implications of these findings."
Employees’ Vocational Training and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):beyond “Primary Responsibilities”,"This article aims at looking at ethical issues in vocational training. It widely explores the specific role of vocational training among the set of “responsibilities” that a company could have, not only towards it stakeholders, but also towards its own workforce. Underlying the multiple unfair sources of employees’ vocational training- the unequal access to training is one of them - we try to examine the possible combinations between CSR and this human resource practice. Through a critical outlook on CSR, we analyze different levels of CSR and insist on “ethical responsibilities” – a form of responsibility that aims at recognizing the employees as ethical subjects."
"A Literature Review: Modelling Dynamic Portfolio Strategy under Defaultable Assets with Stochastic Rate of Return, Rate of Inflation and Credit Spread Rate","This research aims to find an optimal solution for dynamic portfolio in finite-time horizon under defaultable assets, which means that the assets has a chance to be liquidated in a finite time horizon, e.g corporate bond. Besides investing on those assets, investors will also have benefit in the form of consumption. As a reference in making investment decisions the concept of utility functions and volatility will play a role. Optimal portfolio composition will be obtained by maximizing the total expected discounted utility of consumption in the time span during the investment is executed and also to minimize the risk, the volatility of the investment. Further the reduced form model is applied since the assets prices can be linked with the market risk and the credit risk. The interest rate and the rate of inflation will be allowed as a representation of market risk, while the credit spread will be used as a representation of credit risk. The dynamic of asset prices can be derived analytically by using Ito Calculus in the form of the movement of the three risk factors above. Furthermore, this problem will be solved using the stochastic dynamic programming method by assuming that market is incomplete. Depending on the chosen utility function, the optimal solution of the portfolio composition and the consumption can be found explicitly in the form of feedback control. This is possible since the dynamic of the wealth process of the control variable is linear. To apply dynamic programming as well as to find solutions we use Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE) where the solution can be solved explicitly, especially where the terminal value of the investment target is chosen random. Further, it will be modeled with Monte Carlo simulation and, calibrated using Indonesia data of stock and corporate bond."
Skill Development: A Way to Leverage the Demographic Dividend in India,"The world’s population is ageing fast and it is estimated that the global population aged 65 and above shall reach to 1.3 billion by 2040, which will be more than double of 530 million in 2010. Rapidly ageing population shall result in severe labor shortage across in the global market. The world’s largest economies like Germany, France and US are expected to suffer due to the acute shortage of skilled workers. According to a global study, presently India is one of the largest labor-surplus countries in terms of its working age group (15-64 years) populations worldwide. India is in demographic dividend phase and can generate skilled manpower for employment through effective use of vocational and skill development training. The present study is to examine how to create skilled labor force through effective use of schemes of Government of India, run by different ministries to facilitate its skill development mission target to train 500 million people by 2022."
Pre-strain dependent relaxation behaviour of AA6016 during automotive paint drying processes,"Heat treatable aluminium alloys are widely used in modern car bodies to achieve lightweight cars. Compared to steel, aluminium alloys are more sensitive to creep behaviour under high elastic stresses, since their melting point of about 600 °C is much lower. In order to predict permanent deformations of outer shell panels due to thermal stresses in drying processes and ensure highest quality standards regarding appearance to the customer, interdependencies with production process history must be evaluated. 
In this work, stress relaxation of the aluminium alloy AA6016 in initially T4 temper has been examined within the elastic regime with focus on the dependency of plastic pre-strain during primary creep phase. As a result, pre-strain becomes more important the higher the temperature was set. Hence, the former production process history of aluminium sheet metal parts must be taken into account when viscoelastic deformations are investigated. Based on the test results a pre-strain dependent material model for finite element simulations is pointed out, which can be used for novel deformation analyses of car bodies in automotive paint drying processes that contain aluminium parts out of AA6016."
Characteristic of torsional vibration of mill main drive excited by electromechanical coupling,"In the study of electromechanical coupling vibration of mill main drive system, the influence of electrical system on the mechanical transmission is considered generally, however the research for the mechanism of electromechanical interaction is lacked. In order to research the electromechanical coupling resonance of main drive system on the F3 mill in a plant, the cycloconverter and synchronous motor are modeled and simulated by the MTLAB/SIMULINK firstly, simulation result show that the current harmonic of the cycloconverter can lead to the pulsating torque of motor output. Then the natural characteristics of the mechanical drive system are calculated by ANSYS, the result show that the modal frequency contains the component which is close to the coupling vibration frequency of 42Hz. According to the simulation result of the mechanical and electrical system, the closed loop feedback model including the two systems are built, and the mechanism analysis of electromechanical coupling presents that there is the interaction between the current harmonic of electrical system and the speed of the mechanical drive system. At last, by building and computing the equivalent nonlinear dynamics model of the mechanical drive system, the dynamic characteristics of system changing with the stiffness, damping coefficient and the electromagnetic torque are obtained. Such electromechanical interaction process is suggested to consider in research of mill vibration, which can induce strong coupling vibration behavior in the rolling mill drive system."
Influence of magnetic reluctances of magnetic elements on servo valve torque motors,"The current research of electro-hydraulic servo valves mainly focuses on the vibration, pressure oscillating and source of noise. Unfortunately, literatures relating to the study of the influence of the magnetic reluctances of the magnetic elements are rarely available. This paper aims to analyze the influence of the magnetic reluctances of the magnetic elements on torque motor. Considering these magnetic reluctances ignored in previous literatures, a new mathematical model of servo valve torque motor is developed and proposed based on the fundamental laws of electromagnetism. By using this new mathematical model and the previous models, electromagnetic torque constant and magnetic spring stiffness are evaluated for a given set of torque motor parameters. A computer simulation by using AMESim software is also performed for the same set of torque motor parameters to verify the proposed model. The theoretical results of electromagnetic torque constant and magnetic spring stiffness evaluated by the proposed model render closer agreement with the simulation results than those evaluated by the previous models. In addition, an experimental measurement of the magnetic flux densities in the air-gaps is carried out by using SFL218 servo valve torque motor. Compared with the theoretical results of the magnetic flux densities in the air-gaps evaluated by the previous models, the theoretical results evaluated by the proposed model also show better agreement with the experimental data. The proposed model shows the influence of the magnetic reluctances of the magnetic elements on the servo valve torque motor, and offers modified and analytical expressions to electromagnetic torque constant and magnetic spring stiffness. These modified and analytical expressions could provide guidance more accurately for a linear control design approach and sensitivity analysis on electro-hydraulic servo valves than the previous expressions."
"3-Factor Versus 4-Factor Prothrombin Complex Concentrate for Warfarin Reversal in Severe Bleeding: A Multicenter, Retrospective, Propensity-Matched Pilot Study","Current guidelines recommend 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4PCC) for emergent reversal of bleeding secondary to warfarin. While current research has demonstrated superiority of 4PCC over plasma, direct comparisons with 3-factor PCC (3PCC) are lacking. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of 3PCC and 4PCC. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who received PCC at one of four medical centers. All patients in the 3PCC group were treated at one center that utilizes a fixed, weight-based dosing protocol. After evaluation of all patients meeting inclusion criteria, propensity-score matching was used to adjust for differences in treatment characteristics. There was no difference in the primary outcome of INR ≤ 1.4 between 3PCC and 4PCC in both the unmatched (85.7 vs. 90.6 %; p = 0.37) and matched (84.2 vs. 92.1 %; p = 0.48) analyses. There was a significant difference in goal INR achieved favoring 4PCC (56.3 vs 90.0 %; p < 0.02) when baseline INR > 4.0. A total of three thrombotic events were documented, all in the 4PCC group. We found no difference in the rate of INR reversal in those treated with 3PCC and 4PCC. However, those with a baseline INR > 4.0 may experience more successful INR reversal with 4PCC."
Propofol cardioprotection for on-pump aortocoronary bypass surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (PRO-TECT II): a phase 2 randomized-controlled trial,"The efficacy of myocardial conditioning strategies is compromised in patients with advanced age, diabetes, or low ejection fraction. We conducted a single-centre parallel-arm blinded randomized-controlled trial to determine whether propofol provides perioperative myocardial protection."
"Detection of Helicobacter DNA in different water sources and penguin feces from Greenwich, Dee and Barrientos Islands, Antarctica","Helicobacter spp. colonize the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals and have been associated with gastrointestinal diseases. Antarctic habitats are considered pristine ecosystems, but the increase in human activity could be introducing human bacteria hosted into waters and wildlife. However, Helicobacter spp. occurrence has not been studied in Antarctica. The aim of our study was to detect the Helicobacter DNA in different water sources and penguin feces from Greenwich, Dee and Barrientos Islands during summer of 2012 and 2013. High Helicobacter proportion was observed in water sources amplifying the 16S rRNA (33/40) and 23S rRNA genes (37/40) by semi-nested PCR. Similar results were observed in feces from Gentoo penguins (16S rRNA: 32/39, and 23S rRNA: 28/39) and Chinstrap penguins (16S rRNA: 16/17, and 23S rRNA: 15/17) by PCR. The phylogenetic relationship of 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA sequences from penguin feces was closely related to Helicobacter brantae. Analyses of 16S rRNA sequences showed that the majority of water samples are related to penguin (3/6) and Helicobacter pylori (2/6) sequences, but the 23S rRNA sequences matched with Campylobacter and Arcobacter. These results show for the first time the presence of the genus Helicobacter in different Antarctica water sources and in Gentoo and Chinstrap penguin feces. A few 16S rRNA sequences are very closely related to H. pylori, but specific glmM and ureA
H. pylori genes were not detected. More studies are needed to determine the Helicobacter species present in this ecosystem and to establish the human impact in these Antarctic Islands."
Variants in an Hdac9 intronic enhancer plasmid impact Twist1 expression in vitro,"Skin tumor susceptibility 5 (Skts5) was previously mapped to mouse chromosome 12 through linkage analysis of skin tumor susceptible Mus musculus (NIH/Ola-S) and skin tumor resistant outbred Mus spretus (SPRET/Out-R) mice. Hdac9 was identified as a potential candidate for Skts5 based on conserved non-synonymous sequence variants and expression analyses. Studies by others identified an enhancer in human HDAC9 that correlated with TWIST1 expression. We identified 45 sequence variants between NIH/Ola-S and SPRET/Out-R mice from the orthologous region of the human HDAC9 enhancer. Variants mapping to intron 18 differentially affected luciferase expression in vitro. NIH/Ola-S clones showed an approximate 1.7-fold increased luciferase expression relative to vector alone or the equivalent clones from SPRET/Out-R-R. Furthermore, cells transfected with a portion of the NIH/Ola-S intron induced 2.2-fold increases in Twist1 expression, but the same region from SPRET/Out-R mice resulted in no up-regulation of Twist1. In silico transcription factor analyses identified multiple transcription factors predicted to differentially bind NIH/Ola-S and SPRET/Out-R polymorphic sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies of two transcription factors, Gata3 and Oct1, demonstrated differential binding between NIH/Ola-S and SPRET/Out-R plasmids that corroborated the in silico predictions. Together these studies provide evidence that the murine orthologous region to a human HDAC9 enhancer also acts as a transcriptional enhancer for mouse Twist1. As ectopic sequence variants between NIH/Ola-S and SPRET/Out-R differentially impacted luciferase expression, correlated with Twist1 expression in vitro, and affected Gata3 and Oct1 binding, these variants may explain part of the observed differences in skin tumor susceptibility at Skts5 between NIH/Ola-S and SPRET/Out-R."
An Innovative Option Contract for Allocating Water in Inter-Basin Transfers: the Case of the Tagus-Segura Transfer in Spain,"The Tagus-Segura Transfer (TST), the largest water infrastructure in Spain, connects the Tagus basin’s headwaters and the Segura basin, one of the most water-stressed areas in Europe. The need to increase the minimum environmental flows in the Tagus River and to meet new urban demands has lead to the redefinition of the TST’s management rules, what will cause a reduction of transferable volumes to the Segura basin. After evaluating the effects of this change in the whole Tagus-Segura system, focusing on the availability of irrigation water in the Segura, the environmental flows in the Tagus and the economic impacts on both basins; we propose an innovative two-tranche option contract that could reduce the negative impacts of the modification of the Transfer’s management rule, and represents an institutional innovation with respect to previous inter-basin water trading. We evaluate this contract with respect to spot and non-market scenarios. Results show that the proposed contract would reduce the impact of a change in the transfer’s management rule on water availability in the recipient area."
UV disinfection of Staphylococcus aureus in ballast water: Effect of growth phase on the disinfection kinetics and the mechanization at molecular level,"This work aimed to study the inactivate kinetics of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in artificial seawater by ultraviolet radiation, establish relationships between model parameters and growth phases, and explain the mechanization of UV disinfection by molecular biological detection. Investigations were carried out for the validation of Chick-Watson, Collins-Selleck, Hom and Biphasic models when S. aureus was in stationary phase (t=14 h). The results showed that the Biphasic kinetic model’s R
2 turned out to be the highest one (R
2=0.9892) and RMSE was less than 0.5 (RMSE =0.2699). The Biphasic kinetic model was better fit for ultraviolet disinfection than the other three models under the circumstance of this experiment and chosen to fit the ultraviolet disinfection curves for microorganisms at three growth phases. The sensitivity of microorganisms under ultraviolet radiation was in the following order: in exponential phase > in stationary phase > in lag phase by comparing the indexes of the Biphasic model (k
1 and x). Besides, agarose gel electrophoresis was used in order to directly assess the damage to DNA of microorganisms that were exposed to the different dose of UV irradiation. The results revealed that DNA damage caused by UV radiation was an important reason for the microorganism inactivation and as the UV dose increased, there was greater damage caused in DNA."

Differential gene expression levels might explain association of LAIR2 polymorphisms with pemphigus,"The leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR-1) is a collagen-binding inhibitory receptor important for the regulation of immune responses, expressed on the majority of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). LAIR-2 is a soluble homolog that antagonizes LAIR-1 inhibitory function by binding the same ligands. We sought to investigate whether LAIR1 and LAIR2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are associated with differential mRNA expression levels. We analyzed 14 SNPs of LAIR1 (6) and LAIR2 (8) by mass spectrometry-based genotyping and extracted mRNA from PBMC of 177 healthy subjects, followed by quantitative assays. Four SNPs of LAIR1 and two SNPs of LAIR2 mark differential mRNA levels in healthy individuals. To verify the biological relevance of these findings, we analyzed additional 515 individuals (282 patients and 233 controls) to check if LAIR1 and LAIR2 differential mRNA expression could be related to susceptibility to pemphigus foliaceus (PF), an autoimmune blistering skin disease endemic in Brazil. Two LAIR1 variants (rs56802430
G, OR = 1.52, p = 0.0329; rs11084332 C, OR = 0.57, p = 0.0022) and one LAIR2 (rs2287828
T+, OR = 1.9, p = 0.0097) contribute to differential susceptibility to PF. Furthermore, we demonstrate interactions among four LAIR2 SNPs (rs2042287, rs2287828, rs2277974 and rs114834145). A haplotype harboring these SNPs is strongly associated with higher LAIR2 mRNA levels (4.5-fold, p = 0.0069) and with higher susceptibility to PF (OR = 4.02, p = 0.0008). We suggest that LAIR1 and LAIR2 genetic variants are associated with regulation of gene expression and variable PF susceptibility, and show indirect association of LAIR2 differential mRNA expression with PF pathogenesis. Our data demonstrate how this relatively unknown disease can add invaluable knowledge regarding the role of LAIR1 and LAIR2 in immune responses."
Maximum-likelihood q-estimator uncovers the role of potassium at neuromuscular junctions,"Recently, we demonstrated the existence of nonextensive behavior in neuromuscular transmission (da Silva et al. in Phys Rev E 84:041925, 2011). In this letter, we first obtain a maximum-likelihood q-estimator to calculate the scale factor (\(\alpha \)) and the q-index of q-Gaussian distributions. Next, we use the indexes to analyze spontaneous miniature end plate potentials in electrophysiological recordings from neuromuscular junctions. These calculations were performed assuming both normal and high extracellular potassium concentrations \([K^{+}]_{o}\). This protocol was used to test the validity of Tsallis statistics under electrophysiological conditions closely resembling physiological stimuli. The analysis shows that q-indexes are distinct depending on the extracellular potassium concentration. Our letter provides a general way to obtain the best estimate of parameters from a q-Gaussian distribution function. It also expands the validity of Tsallis statistics in realistic physiological stimulus conditions. In addition, we discuss the physical and physiological implications of these findings."
Expression of the apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) in liver metastasis of colorectal cancer and its correlation with DNA mismatch repair proteins and p53,"Apoptotic signaling is one of the most important processes in the measurement of chemotherapeutic effectiveness. In apoptotic machinery, various pathways and proteins are involved (i.e., mismatch repair proteins, p53). One of the regulatory proteins is ARC, which can inhibit not only the extrinsic but also the intrinsic apoptotic signaling."
iTRAQ proteomic analysis of salinity acclimation proteins in the gill of tropical marbled eel (Anguilla marmorata),"Osmoregulation plays an important role in the migration process of catadromous fish. The osmoregulatory mechanisms of tropical marbled eel (Anguilla marmorata), a typical catadromous fish, did not gain sufficient attention, especially at the molecular level. In order to enrich the protein database of A. marmorata, a proteomic analysis has been carried out by iTRAQ technique. Among 1937 identified proteins in gill of marbled eel, the expression of 1560 proteins (80 %) was quantified. Compared with the protein expression level in the gill of marbled eel in freshwater (salinity of 0 ‰), 336 proteins were up-regulated and 67 proteins were down-regulated in seawater (salinity of 25 ‰); 33 proteins were up-regulated and 32 proteins were down-regulated in brackish water (salinity of 10 ‰). These up-regulated proteins including Na+/K+-ATPase, V-type proton ATPase, sodium–potassium–chloride co-transporter and heat shock protein 90 were enriched in many KEGG-annotated pathways, which are related to different functions of the gill. The up-regulated oxidative phosphorylation and seleno-compound metabolism pathways involve the synthesis and consumption of ATP, which represents extra energy consumption. Another identified pathway is the ribosome pathway in which a large number of up-regulated proteins are involved. It is also more notable that tight junction and cardiac muscle contraction pathways may have correlation with ion transport in gill cells. This is the first report describing the proteome of A. marmorata for acclimating to the change of salinity. These results provide a functional database for migratory fish and point out some possible new interactions on osmoregulation in A. marmorata."
Approximating the Critical Domain Size of Integrodifference Equations,"Integrodifference (IDE) models can be used to determine the critical domain size required for persistence of populations with distinct dispersal and growth phases. Using this modelling framework, we develop a novel spatially implicit approximation to the proportion of individuals lost to unfavourable habitat outside of a finite domain of favourable habitat, which consistently outperforms the most common approximations. We explore how results using this approximation compare to the existing IDE results on the critical domain size for populations in a single patch of good habitat, in a network of patches, in the presence of advection, and in structured populations. We find that the approximation consistently provides results which are in close agreement with those of an IDE model except in the face of strong advective forces, with the advantage of requiring fewer numerical approximations while providing insights into the significance of disperser retention in determining the critical domain size of an IDE."
The effects of light and ethylene and their interaction on the regulation of proanthocyanidin and anthocyanin synthesis in the skins of Vitis vinifera berries,"Several environmental stimulants and hormones can affect phenolic accumulation in grape berries, but the effects of ethylene and light and their interaction have not been completely deciphered. We measured the accumulation of anthocyanins (ATs) and proanthocyanidins (PAs) in berries of a red-wine grape, Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, in four treatments: light exposure with and without ethephon, a commercial growth regulator that quickly converts to ethylene, and box-shading with and without ethephon. Ethephon did not significantly increase the weight and diameter of the berries but altered maturity parameters at 49 days after treatment. Ethephon and light increased the fresh and dry weights of the berry skins, induced the accumulation of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and PAs and up-regulated the transcription of VvLAR1, VvLAR2, VvANR, and VvMYBPA1. Light promoted the accumulation of ATs and the expression of AT biosynthetic genes more effectively than did ethephon. Ethephon and light had interactive effects on grape ripening and the contents of PAs and ATs by the way that light interfered with the effect of exogenous ethephon on endogenous ethylene biosynthesis and the downstream ethylene regulatory pathway. These findings provide new information about the physiological and molecular function of ethylene during berry development and the impact of the interaction between ethylene and light in Vitis vinifera."
Developing a Group Decision Support System for Advertising Media Evaluation: A Case in the Middle East,"The importance of advertising media evaluation as a multifaceted problem is well known by both academics and practitioners. Although previous studies tried to optimize media evaluation, there still are some gaps and problems to address, particularly in areas of flexibility of models/frameworks, decision making quality, tension management, and agility of the evaluation process. Most of previous studies are based on inflexible models/frameworks that have limitations on number of criteria/alternatives they can consider and type of data they can process. A great volume of the work used arbitrary decision making; arbitrary decision making regarding criteria and media importance may reduce effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Furthermore, the academic literature offers little guidance on group decision aggregation, and tension management during decision making is neglected. Media evaluation is a time taking process and any acceleration will reduce pre-campaign costs. The main aim of this paper is to illustrate how a group decision support system (GDSS) can assist media planners to overcome mentioned problems more systematically. For this purpose, we developed a GDSS that is an integration of three well-known multi-criteria decision making techniques. With a real world case study, we illustrate the performance of the proposed GDSS. Results of our quantitative assessments indicate that the GDSS is flexible, allows decision makers to express their opinions, reduces tension among decision makers, and saves time."
Use of stochastic resonance methods for improving laparoscopic surgery performance,"Vibrotactile feedback (VIB) has been utilized in previous research as sensory augmentation to improve performance during minimally invasive surgical tasks. Stochastic resonance (SR), introduced into the human control system as white noise at a subthreshold level, has shown promise to improve the sensitivity of tactile receptors resulting in performance enhancement for sensorimotor tasks. The purpose of this study was to determine whether SR could improve performance (accuracy, speed) in a simulated laparoscopic palpation task."
Conceptual modeling of evolvable local searches in memetic algorithms using linear genetic programming: a case study on capacitated vehicle routing problem,"This paper presents a study on the conceptual modeling of memetic algorithm with evolvable local search in the form of linear programs, self-assembled by linear genetic programming based evolution. In particular, the linear program structure for local search and the associated local search self-assembling process in the lifetime learning process of memetic algorithm are proposed. Results showed that the memetic algorithm with evolvable local search provides a means of creating highly robust, self-configuring and scalable algorithms, thus generating improved or competitive results when benchmarking against several existing adaptive or human-designed state-of-the-art memetic algorithms and meta-heuristics, on a plethora of capacitated vehicle routing problem sets considered."
Examining the effect of Zn dopant on physical properties of nanostructured SnS thin film by using electrodeposition,"Undoped and Zn-doped SnS nanostructures have been successfully synthesized through an electrodeposition process by using SnCl2 and Na2S2O3 as precursors on fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated (FTO) glass substrates with different zinc concentrations. The structure, surface morphology, and the optical properties of the synthesized films are studied. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the SnS nanostructure confirm the orthorhombic structure. Scanning electron microscopy shows thin films with homogeneous and uniform surface as well, by adding Zn ions, morphology of SnS films changed from cubic to rod. Energy dispersive spectroscopy shows presence of Zn in the films. All samples are characterized by UV–Vis reflectance measurement in the wavelength range 500–1200 nm. The energy band gap values, calculated from optical measurement of reflectance, are between 1.46 and 1.49 eV, being suitable for absorbers layers in the photovoltaic applications. Eventually, studying the photocurrent responses of the nanostructures revealed that the Zn-doped SnS nanostructures exhibited better response than the undoped SnS nanostructures."
"Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some novel substituted pyridazin-3(2H)-ones containing 1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety","A series of novel 1,3,4-thiadiazol-4,5-dihydropyridazin-3(2H)-ones with expected antimicrobial activity have been synthesized. The synthetic protocol of the target compounds was accomplished by condensing β-aroylacrylic acid 1 with 2,5-diamino-1,3,4-thiadiazole 2 to afford the aza-Michael adduct 3. Subsequently, the obtained adduct 3 was cyclized to 4,5-dihydropyridazin-3(2H)-ones (4a–e) by reaction with selected hydrazines. Furthermore, adduct 3 was also treated with diethylmalonate and ethylacetoacetate to yield 1,3,4-thiadiazolobutanamides 5 and 6, respectively. The later compounds were further reacted with (2 mol) of the hydrazine derivatives to produce substituted thiadiazolopyridazin-3(2H)-ones (7a–c), (9a–c) and (10a–b)."
Evaluation of silver-doped indium oxide nanoparticles as in vitro α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitors,"Pristine and 2 % silver-doped indium oxide (In2O3) nanoparticles, synthesized by solution combustion method, yielded spherical nanoparticles in the range of 20–30 nm. The nanoparticles were stabilized in cubic bixbyite structure as revealed from X-ray diffraction study. In order to evaluate the potential of these nanoparticles to modulate enzyme activity, α-amylase and α-glucosidase were used as model enzymes. Pristine and 2 % silver-doped In2O3 nanoparticles demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase activities. Pristine In2O3 nanoparticles demonstrated 26.4 % (300 µg/mL) and 65.3 % (300 µg/mL) inhibition against α-amylase and α-glucosidase, respectively. In contrast, silver-doped In2O3 nanoparticles depicted 94.1 % (300 µg/mL) and 99.6 % (0.18 µg/mL) inhibition against α-amylase and α-glucosidase, respectively. In comparison with acarbose, a standard anti-diabetic drug that depicted absolute inhibition of α-glucosidase activity at 300 µg/mL, 2 % silver-doped In2O3 nanoparticles completely inhibited α-glucosidase at a very low concentration (0.18 µg/mL). In view of our results, the activity of α-amylase and α-glucosidase, which are targets for treatment of type 2 diabetes, can be modulated using silver-doped In2O3 nanoparticles in the concentration-dependent manner. Therefore, silver-doped In2O3 has a potential to be used as a prospective starch blocker."
Harvesting of river flow energy for wireless sensor network technology,"River courses play a vital role in preserving unpolluted ecosystems. On the other hand, networks of sensor nodes can be used to measure characteristic parameters in the environment such as temperature, pressure, humidity or the concentration of pollutants. In the framework of the EU FP7 project “GOLDFISH”, technical competences of a consortium of 11 institutions are hence employed in designing, manufacturing, validating and operating wireless sensors nodes for tracking pollution in remote rivers. The sensor network is composed of sensor
 clusters located underwater and gateways on the riverbank with long-distance communication links to the central management and monitoring station. Each sensor node is composed of active electronic devices that have to be constantly powered. Batteries can generally be used for this purpose, but problems may occur when they are to be recharged or replaced, especially in the case of large networks placed in scarcely accessible locations. State-of-the-art energy harvesting technologies can hence constitute a viable powering solution. The possibility to use different small-scale river flow energy harvesting principles is thoroughly studied in this work by the University of Rijeka GOLDFISH team: a miniaturized hydro-generator, a ‘piezoelectric eel’ and a hybrid solution of a rotating shaft plucking a piezoelectric beam. The first two concepts are validated experimentally in a flow channel and in real river conditions. The miniaturized hydro-generator with suitable power management electronics is finally embedded into the wireless sensor node deployed into the river, allowing the GSM transmission of collected data to be successfully performed."
Combined nephrectomy and aortic valve replacement: perioperative decision-making,"Open heart surgery and urologic surgery may be required for patients with coincident diseases. We report a patient who suffered from aortic valve stenosis which was asymptomatic barring atrial fibrillation. He was prescribed warfarin and then developed a large perinephric hematoma. The perioperative considerations focused on whether to conduct aortic valve replacement for this patient and, if such surgery was indicated, the appropriate time to conduct it. Traditionally, severe cardiac disease is addressed first before conducting elective noncardiac surgery; however, this option was not available since the patient already had a perinephric hematoma which could bleed more when subjected to systemic heparinization for cardiopulmonary bypass. Here, we describe the process of perioperative decision-making involving multiple specialities and re-examine several guidelines."
An alternative method to achieve one-lung ventilation by surgical pneumothorax in difficult lung isolation patient: a case report,"It is challenging to establish one-lung ventilation in difficult airway patients. Surgical pneumothorax under spontaneous breathing to obtain well-collapsed lung is a feasible method for thoracic surgery. A 76-year-old man with right empyema was scheduled for decortication. The patient had limited mouth opening due to facial cellulitis extending from the left cheek to neck. Generally, lung isolation is achieved by double-lumen endotracheal tube or bronchial blocker. Double-lumen tube insertion is difficult for patients with limited mouth opening and right-side placement of bronchial blocker usually causes insufficient deflation. We introduce an alternative lung isolation technique by surgical pneumothorax under spontaneous breathing simply with an endotracheal tube placement. This technique has never been applied into the management of difficult one-lung ventilation. By this method, we provide an ideal surgical condition with safer, less time-consuming, and less skill-demanding anesthesia. It would be an alternative choice for management of one-lung ventilation in the difficult lung isolation patient."
Two-phase Taylor-flow reduced order thermal modeling,"The paper presents a novel reduced order model which enables the heat transfer analysis of microchannels consisting of continuously moving microdroplets with constant heat flux on the wall. Due to the low Reynolds number which is typical in microfluidic applications, the hydrodynamics can be described as Taylor-flow. Two-phase Taylor-flow is the basis of many microfluidic applications such as bio-chemical microreactors where segmented zones are required to accurately characterize enzyme reactions. This new model represents a microtube with horizontally alternating and moving phases. The results obtained by the reduced order model match the results of a validated detailed Ansys-Fluent model with 5 % accuracy at the channel wall. The reduced order model accounts for microcirculation and back flow. The proposed reduced order model of the two-phase Taylor-flow is foreseen to be included in system level description of chemical microrectors."
Single-mode—multimode—single-mode and lossy mode resonance-based devices: a comparative study for sensing applications,"In this work, a thin-film consisting of 15 bilayers (estimated thickness: 210 nm) of titanium (IV) oxide and poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) is simultaneously deposited onto two optical fiber structures: a single-mode—multimode—single-mode (SMS) device and a lossy mode resonance (LMR)-based device. The performance of both structures, as refractometers and relative humidity sensors, is studied and compared. In both cases, the sensitivity of the LMR-based device (955 nm/RIU and 3.54 nm/RH %, respectively) highly improves the one of the SMS (142 nm/RIU and 0.3 nm/RH %). These facts can be taken into account when developing sensors based on either SMS or LMR technologies."
Viable pluripotent chick blastodermal cells can be maintained long term in an alkaline defined medium,"Most chicken embryonic cell culture methods call for neutral pH media of different natures, with disregard of the peculiar electrochemical environment in which avian embryos develop, with a 4 pH unit gradient across the thin blastoderm and the vitelline membrane. We report results of a culture system in alkaline media (pH >9) with atmospheric conditions. Blastodermal and blood cells, maintained for 8 wk with minor differentiation in the absence of the standard growth factors, developed a thick, mucoid-like matrix in which a large proportion of the cell mass grew embedded, with no direct contact to cultureware. After up to 8 wk, blastoderm explants and dissociated blastodermal cells, cultured in either M199 or Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) in the absence of supplemental CO2, expressed several pluripotency markers (SSEA1, VASA) and embryoid bodies were formed. The assayed conditions impose an undoubted electrolyte stress on the cells which, notwithstanding, maintained their viability and remained undifferentiated. We hypothesize that a rise in pH and the activation of active cation exchanger like Na+/H+ antiporter could mediate the observed differentiation arrest."
Local theta correspondences between epipelagic supercuspidal representations,"In this paper we study the local theta correspondences between epipelagic supercupsidal representations of a type I classical dual pair \((G,G')\) over p-adic fields. We show that, besides an exceptional case, an epipelagic supercupsidal representation \(\pi \) of \({\widetilde{G}}\) lifts to an epipelagic supercupsidal representation \(\pi '\) of \({\widetilde{G}}'\) if and only if the epipelagic data of \(\pi \) and \(\pi '\) are related by the moment maps."
On-ramping: following women scientists and engineers through their transition from nonacademic to faculty careers,"A popular strategy for increasing women faculty in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) departments is to hire from other universities, but this strategy fails to increase the number of women faculty nationally. This research investigates a new approach to faculty recruitment called “on-ramping,” the process by which women with PhDs leverage their nonacademic careers and enter academia as faculty members. This study follows women scientists and engineers from their non-academic to faculty career and analyzes their experiences transgressing the boundaries of STEM knowledge production sites. We used qualitative methods to collect and analyze semi-structured interviews about the experiences of ten female PhDs who successfully on-ramped into faculty positions with the support of a feminist professional community. Our data revealed four phases of on-ramping that characterized the transition to academia for our participants. Attention to gender in on-ramping also highlights concerns that span the personal and the professional in women scientists and engineers’ lives. By illuminating cultural and political practices in STEM sites of knowledge production and the effects of feminist interventions on women’s experiences of producing knowledge in STEM fields, this study offers a unique perspective that can elucidate the strengths and weaknesses of these sites, especially in regards to gender politics and knowledge production."
"Topical spraying of cefazolin and gentamicin reduces deep sternal wound infections after heart surgery: a multicenter, large volume, retrospective study",The use of topical antimicrobials applied to the sternum during cardiac procedures in combination with intravenous agents to prevent mediastinitis has been reported to yield good results. The objective of this study is to provide optimal method of topical antimicrobials for the prevention of sternal wound infection after cardiac surgery.
Emotional Well-Being Following Religious Conversion Among Women in Northeast Thailand,"Religious conversion can have a profound impact on individual mental health and emotional well-being. These changes may need specific nursing care. In this article, we describe the lived experiences of 21 women who converted from Buddhism to Islam and who live in Isan, the northeast region of Thailand. The data derive from in-depth interviews, natural conversations, and observations. Thematic analysis revealed two dominant themes: women’s sense of happiness in their new faith, and their suffering following from and as a result of their conversion. To provide appropriate care to and prevent mental health problems among Isan women who convert from Buddhism to Islam, and other women in similar contexts, health providers need to enhance their understanding of conversion and to be aware of life experiences that impact on their emotional well-being."
Task success based on contingency fit of managerial culture and embeddedness,"The article extends research on the contingency of fit in international management at the level of managerial tasks. Foreign firms’ managerial tasks are embedded in two environments with different profiles, and different managerial cultures fit them to ensure task success. Study 1 analyzes 18 critical incidents, summarizes Chinese and Japanese managerial cultures, and identifies three types of managerial tasks. We hypothesize that task success depends on the fit between task type and the chosen managerial culture, such that foreign firms can have their operational, local, and people tasks successfully completed using home, host, or integrated managerial cultures respectively. Study 2 tests our hypotheses using 112 critical incidents. The fit pattern at the level of managerial tasks advances the contingency perspective in international management and equips managers with cultural agility to confront international challenges."
Identification of DNA Methyltransferase Genes in Human Pathogenic Bacteria by Comparative Genomics,"DNA methylation plays an important role in gene expression and virulence in some pathogenic bacteria. In this report, we describe DNA methyltransferases (MTases) present in human pathogenic bacteria and compared them with related species, which are not pathogenic or less pathogenic, based in comparative genomics. We performed a search in the KEGG database of the KEGG database orthology groups associated with adenine and cytosine DNA MTase activities (EC: 2.1.1.37, EC: 2.1.1.113 and EC: 2.1.1.72) in 37 human pathogenic species and 18 non/less pathogenic relatives and performed comparisons of the number of these MTases sequences according to their genome size, the DNA MTase type and with their non-less pathogenic relatives. We observed that Helicobacter pylori and Neisseria spp. presented the highest number of MTases while ten different species did not present a predicted DNA MTase. We also detected a significant increase of adenine MTases over cytosine MTases (2.19 vs. 1.06, respectively, p < 0.001). Adenine MTases were the only MTases associated with restriction modification systems and DNA MTases associated with type I restriction modification systems were more numerous than those associated with type III restriction modification systems (0.84 vs. 0.17, p < 0.001); additionally, there was no correlation with the genome size and the total number of DNA MTases, indicating that the number of DNA MTases is related to the particular evolution and lifestyle of specific species, regulating the expression of virulence genes in some pathogenic bacteria."
Efficacy of Hybrid Tetrahydrobenzo[d]thiazole Based Aryl Piperazines D-264 and D-301 at D2 and D3 Receptors,"In elucidating the role of pharmacodynamic efficacy at D3 receptors in therapeutic effectiveness of dopamine receptor agonists, the influence of study system must be understood. Here two compounds with D3 over D2 selectivity developed in our earlier work, D-264 and D-301, are compared in dopamine receptor-mediated G-protein activation in striatal regions of wild-type and D2 receptor knockout mice and in CHO cells expressing D2 or D3 receptors. In caudate-putamen of D2 knockout mice, D-301 was ~3-fold more efficacious than D-264 in activating G-proteins as assessed by [35S]GTPγS binding; in nucleus accumbens, D-301 stimulated G-protein activation whereas D-264 did not. In contrast, the two ligands exerted similar efficacy in both regions of wild-type mice, suggesting both ligands activate D2 receptors with similar efficacy. In D2 and D3 receptor-expressing CHO cells, D-264 and D-301 appeared to act in the [35S]GTPγS assay as full agonists because they produced maximal stimulation equal to dopamine. Competition for [3H]spiperone binding was then performed to determine Ki/EC50 ratios as an index of receptor reserve for each ligand. Action of D-301, but not D-264, showed receptor reserve in D3 but not in D2 receptor-expressing cells, whereas dopamine showed receptor reserve in both cell lines. Gαo1 is highly expressed in brain and is important in D2-like receptor-G protein coupling. Transfection of Gαo1 in D3- but not D2-expressing CHO cells led to receptor reserve for D-264 without altering receptor expression levels. D-301 and dopamine exhibited receptor reserve in D3-expressing cells both with and without transfection of Gαo1. Altogether, these results indicate that D-301 has greater intrinsic efficacy to activate D3 receptors than D-264, whereas the two compounds act on D2 receptors with similar intrinsic efficacy. These findings also suggest caution in interpreting Emax values from functional assays in receptor-transfected cell models without accounting for receptor reserve."
Constrained motion of Hamiltonian systems,"This paper considers dynamical systems described by Hamilton’s equations. It deals with the development of the explicit equations of motion for such systems when constraints are imposed on them. Such explicit equations do not appear to have been obtained hereto. The holonomic and/or nonholonomic constraints imposed can be nonlinear functions of the canonical momenta, the coordinates, and time, and they can be functionally dependent. These explicit equations of motion for constrained systems are obtained through the development of the connection between the Lagrangian concept of virtual displacements and Hamiltonian dynamics. A simple three-step approach for obtaining the explicit equations of motion of constrained Hamiltonian systems is presented. Four examples are provided illustrating the ease and simplicity with which these equations can be obtained by using the proposed three-step approach."
What predicts early volumetric edema increase following stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases?,"A volumetric analysis of pre- and post-radiosurgery (PreSRS and PostSRS) edema in patients with cerebral metastases was performed to determine factors of a predictive model assessing the risk of developing increased edema relatively early after SRS. One-hundred-fourteen metastases in 55 patients were analyzed. Selection for this analysis required an MRI ≤ 30 days before SRS and an MRI ≤ 100 days after SRS. Tumor volumes were calculated on PreSRS, SRS, and PostSRS T1-weighted postgadolinium images while edema volumes were calculating using PreSRS and PostSRS fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MR images. An increase in edema was defined as an increase in measurable edema of at least 5 %. We developed and evaluated a model predicting the relative risk (RR) of increased edema after SRS. Peritumoral edema increased in 18 % (21/114) of the analyzed lesions. Melanoma/renal histology, recursive partitioning analysis class III, and prior WBRT carried RRs of developing postSRS edema increase of 2.45, 2.48, and 3.16, respectively (all P values <0.05). The PreSRS edema/tumor ratio predicted for a RR of 1.007/ratio unit, and steroid dose at time of SRS predicted for a RR of 0.89/mg (all P values <0.05). A predictive model for assessing the RR of increased edema after SRS was developed based from these data and may be useful in identifying patients who might benefit from prophylactic anti-edema therapies before, during, or after SRS. This model could be used as the basis of inclusion criteria for prospective trials investigating novel anti-edema therapies."

Late L2ers can acquire grammatical features that do not occur in their L1: Evidence from the effect of animacy on verb agreement in L1 Chinese,"Second language (L2) learners often have persistent difficulty with agreement between the number of the subject and the number of the verb. This study tested whether deviant L2 verb number agreement reflects maturational constraints on acquiring new grammatical features or resource limitations that impede access to the representations of L2 grammatical features. L1-Chinese undergraduate students at three age of arrival (AoA) levels were tested for online verb agreement accuracy by completing preambles in three animacy combinations: animate–inanimate [AI; e.g., The officer(s) from the station(s)], inanimate–animate [IA; e.g., The letters from the lawyer(s)], and inanimate–inanimate [II; e.g., The poster(s) from the museum(s)]. AI should be less costly to process than IA or II sequences, because animacy supports the subject in AI but competes with the subject for control of agreement in IA sequences, and is neutralized in II. Agreement accuracy was greater overall for AI than for IA or II, and although an AoA-related increase in erroneous agreement after plural subjects occurred for IA and II, there were no AoA effects for AI. Higher scores on memory tasks were associated with greater agreement accuracy, and the memory tasks significantly predicted variance in erroneous agreement when AoA was partialed out. The fact that even late learners can do verb agreement in the case of AI demonstrates that they can acquire new grammatical features. The greater difficulty with agreement in the case of IA or II than of AI, in conjunction with the results for the memory tasks, supports the resource limitation hypothesis."
Physical oceanographic conditions around the S1 mooring site,"We describe physical oceanographic conditions around the S1 biogeochemical mooring site (30°N, 145°E) between February 2010 and July 2013. At the S1 mooring site, there is a clear seasonal variability of the mixed layer depth, wind forcing as well as horizontal kinetic energy in a near-inertial band. Interannual variability of the winter mixed layer was observed. The winter mixed layer depth was shallower in early 2010 and became deeper afterwards. Several mesoscale eddies and typhoons passed by the S1 mooring sites every year. Based on observed events, we suggest that those physical processes possibly affected biogeochemical properties around the S1 mooring site."

Mo(n = 1–10) have been investigated at the PBE1PBE/def2TZVP level of theory. The results show that molybdenum doping has a significant effect on the geometric structures and electronic properties of Au
n
Mo(n = 1–10) clusters. For the lowest energy structures of Au
n
Mo(n = 1–10), the two dimensional to three dimensional transition occurs at cluster size n ≥ 8, and their relative stabilities exhibit odd–even oscillation with the change of Au atom number. It is found that charge in corresponding Au

Mo clusters are enhanced after doping single Mo atom into the corresponding gold clusters. Our results are valuable for the design of magnetic material."
Pre-strain dependent relaxation behaviour of AA6016 during automotive paint drying processes,"Heat treatable aluminium alloys are widely used in modern car bodies to achieve lightweight cars. Compared to steel, aluminium alloys are more sensitive to creep behaviour under high elastic stresses, since their melting point of about 600 °C is much lower. In order to predict permanent deformations of outer shell panels due to thermal stresses in drying processes and ensure highest quality standards regarding appearance to the customer, interdependencies with production process history must be evaluated. 
In this work, stress relaxation of the aluminium alloy AA6016 in initially T4 temper has been examined within the elastic regime with focus on the dependency of plastic pre-strain during primary creep phase. As a result, pre-strain becomes more important the higher the temperature was set. Hence, the former production process history of aluminium sheet metal parts must be taken into account when viscoelastic deformations are investigated. Based on the test results a pre-strain dependent material model for finite element simulations is pointed out, which can be used for novel deformation analyses of car bodies in automotive paint drying processes that contain aluminium parts out of AA6016."
Characteristic of torsional vibration of mill main drive excited by electromechanical coupling,"In the study of electromechanical coupling vibration of mill main drive system, the influence of electrical system on the mechanical transmission is considered generally, however the research for the mechanism of electromechanical interaction is lacked. In order to research the electromechanical coupling resonance of main drive system on the F3 mill in a plant, the cycloconverter and synchronous motor are modeled and simulated by the MTLAB/SIMULINK firstly, simulation result show that the current harmonic of the cycloconverter can lead to the pulsating torque of motor output. Then the natural characteristics of the mechanical drive system are calculated by ANSYS, the result show that the modal frequency contains the component which is close to the coupling vibration frequency of 42Hz. According to the simulation result of the mechanical and electrical system, the closed loop feedback model including the two systems are built, and the mechanism analysis of electromechanical coupling presents that there is the interaction between the current harmonic of electrical system and the speed of the mechanical drive system. At last, by building and computing the equivalent nonlinear dynamics model of the mechanical drive system, the dynamic characteristics of system changing with the stiffness, damping coefficient and the electromagnetic torque are obtained. Such electromechanical interaction process is suggested to consider in research of mill vibration, which can induce strong coupling vibration behavior in the rolling mill drive system."
Influence of magnetic reluctances of magnetic elements on servo valve torque motors,"The current research of electro-hydraulic servo valves mainly focuses on the vibration, pressure oscillating and source of noise. Unfortunately, literatures relating to the study of the influence of the magnetic reluctances of the magnetic elements are rarely available. This paper aims to analyze the influence of the magnetic reluctances of the magnetic elements on torque motor. Considering these magnetic reluctances ignored in previous literatures, a new mathematical model of servo valve torque motor is developed and proposed based on the fundamental laws of electromagnetism. By using this new mathematical model and the previous models, electromagnetic torque constant and magnetic spring stiffness are evaluated for a given set of torque motor parameters. A computer simulation by using AMESim software is also performed for the same set of torque motor parameters to verify the proposed model. The theoretical results of electromagnetic torque constant and magnetic spring stiffness evaluated by the proposed model render closer agreement with the simulation results than those evaluated by the previous models. In addition, an experimental measurement of the magnetic flux densities in the air-gaps is carried out by using SFL218 servo valve torque motor. Compared with the theoretical results of the magnetic flux densities in the air-gaps evaluated by the previous models, the theoretical results evaluated by the proposed model also show better agreement with the experimental data. The proposed model shows the influence of the magnetic reluctances of the magnetic elements on the servo valve torque motor, and offers modified and analytical expressions to electromagnetic torque constant and magnetic spring stiffness. These modified and analytical expressions could provide guidance more accurately for a linear control design approach and sensitivity analysis on electro-hydraulic servo valves than the previous expressions."
"A Literature Review: Modelling Dynamic Portfolio Strategy under Defaultable Assets with Stochastic Rate of Return, Rate of Inflation and Credit Spread Rate","This research aims to find an optimal solution for dynamic portfolio in finite-time horizon under defaultable assets, which means that the assets has a chance to be liquidated in a finite time horizon, e.g corporate bond. Besides investing on those assets, investors will also have benefit in the form of consumption. As a reference in making investment decisions the concept of utility functions and volatility will play a role. Optimal portfolio composition will be obtained by maximizing the total expected discounted utility of consumption in the time span during the investment is executed and also to minimize the risk, the volatility of the investment. Further the reduced form model is applied since the assets prices can be linked with the market risk and the credit risk. The interest rate and the rate of inflation will be allowed as a representation of market risk, while the credit spread will be used as a representation of credit risk. The dynamic of asset prices can be derived analytically by using Ito Calculus in the form of the movement of the three risk factors above. Furthermore, this problem will be solved using the stochastic dynamic programming method by assuming that market is incomplete. Depending on the chosen utility function, the optimal solution of the portfolio composition and the consumption can be found explicitly in the form of feedback control. This is possible since the dynamic of the wealth process of the control variable is linear. To apply dynamic programming as well as to find solutions we use Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE) where the solution can be solved explicitly, especially where the terminal value of the investment target is chosen random. Further, it will be modeled with Monte Carlo simulation and, calibrated using Indonesia data of stock and corporate bond."
Employees’ Vocational Training and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):beyond “Primary Responsibilities”,"This article aims at looking at ethical issues in vocational training. It widely explores the specific role of vocational training among the set of “responsibilities” that a company could have, not only towards it stakeholders, but also towards its own workforce. Underlying the multiple unfair sources of employees’ vocational training- the unequal access to training is one of them - we try to examine the possible combinations between CSR and this human resource practice. Through a critical outlook on CSR, we analyze different levels of CSR and insist on “ethical responsibilities” – a form of responsibility that aims at recognizing the employees as ethical subjects."
Skill Development: A Way to Leverage the Demographic Dividend in India,"The world’s population is ageing fast and it is estimated that the global population aged 65 and above shall reach to 1.3 billion by 2040, which will be more than double of 530 million in 2010. Rapidly ageing population shall result in severe labor shortage across in the global market. The world’s largest economies like Germany, France and US are expected to suffer due to the acute shortage of skilled workers. According to a global study, presently India is one of the largest labor-surplus countries in terms of its working age group (15-64 years) populations worldwide. India is in demographic dividend phase and can generate skilled manpower for employment through effective use of vocational and skill development training. The present study is to examine how to create skilled labor force through effective use of schemes of Government of India, run by different ministries to facilitate its skill development mission target to train 500 million people by 2022."
Local theta correspondences between epipelagic supercuspidal representations,"In this paper we study the local theta correspondences between epipelagic supercupsidal representations of a type I classical dual pair \((G,G')\) over p-adic fields. We show that, besides an exceptional case, an epipelagic supercupsidal representation \(\pi \) of \({\widetilde{G}}\) lifts to an epipelagic supercupsidal representation \(\pi '\) of \({\widetilde{G}}'\) if and only if the epipelagic data of \(\pi \) and \(\pi '\) are related by the moment maps."
"Understanding the ring-opening, chelation and non-chelation reactions between nedaplatin and thiosulfate: a DFT study based on NBO, ETS-NOCV and QTAIM","The current work investigates a DFT-based in silico study on the mechanism of reaction between the anticancer drug nedaplatin [Pt(NH3)2(Gly-κ2O,O′)] (Gly = –OCCH2COO–) and the rescue agent thiosulfate (S2O3
2−) in molar ratios 1:1 and 1:2, in neutral- and proton-assisted pathways. The first step produces stable (κS or κO) intermediates via ring opening of Gly. The second, rate-limiting step consists of three competing reactions: (1) κ2S,O-chelate formation by S2O3
2− or HS2O3
− (2) Pt-bis(thiosulfate) formation by the elimination of Gly ligand and (3) Pt-bis(thiosulfate) formation by the elimination of one NH3
trans to sulfur owing to strong trans-labilizing thiosulfate ligand. Results show that non-chelation reaction involving uptake of the second thiosulfate is kinetically more favorable than the corresponding κ2S,O-chelate formation. Further, the kinetic barrier of NH3 loss reaction is found to be very close to that of Gly loss. However, in solution phase, the ammine loss reaction is slower than the glycolate loss. The possibility of the formation of four-membered binuclear μ-thiosulfate bridge [Pt2(μ-S2O3)2(NH3)4] has also been considered. The proposed reaction paths have been substantiated through computation of structural, thermodynamic and kinetic parameters involved in the gas and solution phase, and also by topological analysis based on quantum theory of atoms in molecules of Bader and the ETS-NOCV energy decomposition scheme."
Novel approach for predicting partition coefficients of linear perfluorinated compounds,"A new approach for predicting octanol–water partition coefficients (Log P) of linear perfluorinated compounds is described, making use of the limited experimental data available, previous observations and the consistent similarities observed between the experimental and calculated (with electronic structure methods and using EPI Suite) slopes of the linear plots of Log P values with the number of carbon atoms (N = 2–11). Eight families of linear organic compounds were investigated: carboxylic acids, perfluorinated carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids and perfluorinated sulfonic acids, together with their corresponding conjugate bases."
A comment on ‘resolving spurious regressions and serially correlated errors’,"In order to diminish size distortions of the t test in a time series linear specification, Agiakloglou (Agiakloglou in Empir Econ, 45(3):1361–1366, 2013) proposed to (1) include the first lag of the dependent variable as a regressor or (2) estimate it using the first differences of the variables. He provided finite-sample evidence to support his proposal. In this paper, we extend the Monte Carlo experiment to different data-generating processes and calculate the asymptotic behavior of the modified specifications. We show that including the lag of the dependent variable as a regressor reduces size distortions when the variables are driftless unit roots, but this approach does not hold under the presence of long memory, nonlinearities, or structural breaks."
"Topical spraying of cefazolin and gentamicin reduces deep sternal wound infections after heart surgery: a multicenter, large volume, retrospective study",The use of topical antimicrobials applied to the sternum during cardiac procedures in combination with intravenous agents to prevent mediastinitis has been reported to yield good results. The objective of this study is to provide optimal method of topical antimicrobials for the prevention of sternal wound infection after cardiac surgery.
Emotional Well-Being Following Religious Conversion Among Women in Northeast Thailand,"Religious conversion can have a profound impact on individual mental health and emotional well-being. These changes may need specific nursing care. In this article, we describe the lived experiences of 21 women who converted from Buddhism to Islam and who live in Isan, the northeast region of Thailand. The data derive from in-depth interviews, natural conversations, and observations. Thematic analysis revealed two dominant themes: women’s sense of happiness in their new faith, and their suffering following from and as a result of their conversion. To provide appropriate care to and prevent mental health problems among Isan women who convert from Buddhism to Islam, and other women in similar contexts, health providers need to enhance their understanding of conversion and to be aware of life experiences that impact on their emotional well-being."
Differences in Problems Paying Medical Bills between African Americans and Whites from 2007 and 2009: the Underlying Role of Health Status,"Although the proportion of people reporting problems paying medical bills has declined in the aftermath of the Great Recession, it is unclear if this decline has been caused by self-rationing of care, particularly among disadvantaged groups. We examined African American-White differences in problems paying medical bills prevalence along with factors which may account for observed differences."
Airway management for patients with ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament of the cervical spine,"Ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament (OALL), also called Forestier’s disease or diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, is characterized by anterior bridging osteophytes of unknown etiology. OALL may cause dysphagia, dyspnea, dysphonia, and acute airway obstruction. We report difficulty in tracheal intubation during anesthesia induction in two OALL patients. In an 82-year-old man, anterior bridging osteophytes (of the cervical region) were observed on preoperative lateral radiograph after several attempts of tracheal intubation for the operation of the anterior fusion of cervical spine. During the same procedure in another 69-year-old man, fiberoptic-assisted awake intubation was extremely difficult because of posterior hypopharyngeal wall protuberance by osteophytes of cervical spine; although tracheal intubation for anesthesia was uneventful on two previous occasions over the months. OALL is usually asymptomatic, but it has been found in 12 % of autopsies and may exaggerate with age. Dysphagia, difficulties with tracheal and/or gastric intubation, acute respiratory compromise, and sleep apnea result from the presence of cervical osteophytes. Anesthesiologists should be aware that tracheal intubation for such patients may be difficult, and thus the preoperative evaluation and airway management need careful consideration."

"Synergistic killing of human small cell lung cancer cells by the Bcl-2-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor disruptor BIRD-2 and the BH3-mimetic ABT-263","Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has an annual mortality approaching that of breast and prostate cancer. Although sensitive to initial chemotherapy, SCLC rapidly develops resistance, leading to less effective second-line therapies. SCLC cells often overexpress Bcl-2, which protects cells from apoptosis both by sequestering pro-apoptotic family members and by modulating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)-mediated calcium signaling. BH3-mimetic agents such as ABT-263 disrupt the former activity but have limited activity in SCLC patients. Here we report for the first time that Bcl-2-IP3 receptor disruptor-2 (BIRD-2), a decoy peptide that binds to the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 and prevents Bcl-2 interaction with IP3Rs, induces cell death in a wide range of SCLC lines, including ABT-263-resistant lines. BIRD-2-induced death of SCLC cells appears to be a form of caspase-independent apoptosis mediated by calpain activation. By targeting different regions of the Bcl-2 protein and different mechanisms of action, BIRD-2 and ABT-263 induce cell death synergistically. Based on these findings, we propose that targeting the Bcl-2–IP3R interaction be pursued as a novel therapeutic strategy for SCLC, either by developing BIRD-2 itself as a therapeutic agent or by developing small-molecule inhibitors that mimic BIRD-2."
Role of two sequence motifs of mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor in its survival-promoting activity,"Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is a prosurvival protein that protects the cells when applied intracellularly in vitro or extracellularly in vivo. Its protective mechanisms are poorly known. Here we studied the role of two short sequence motifs within the carboxy-(C) terminal domain of MANF in its neuroprotective activity: the CKGC sequence (a CXXC motif) that could be involved in redox reactions, and the C-terminal RTDL sequence, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal. We mutated these motifs and analyzed the antiapoptotic effect and intracellular localization of these mutants of MANF when overexpressed in cultured sympathetic or sensory neurons. As an in vivo model for studying the effect of these mutants after their extracellular application, we used the rat model of cerebral ischemia. Even though we found no evidence for oxidoreductase activity of MANF, the mutation of CXXC motif completely abolished its protective effect, showing that this motif is crucial for both MANF’s intracellular and extracellular activity. The RTDL motif was not needed for the neuroprotective activity of MANF after its extracellular application in the stroke model in vivo. However, in vitro the deletion of RTDL motif inactivated MANF in the sympathetic neurons where the mutant protein localized to Golgi, but not in the sensory neurons where the mutant localized to the ER, showing that intracellular MANF protects these peripheral neurons in vitro only when localized to the ER."
C2238/αANP modulates apolipoprotein E through Egr-1/miR199a in vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro,"Subjects carrying the T2238C ANP gene variant have a higher risk to suffer a stroke or myocardial infarction. The mechanisms through which T2238C/αANP exerts detrimental vascular effects need to be fully clarified. In the present work we aimed at exploring the impact of C2238/αANP (mutant form) on atherosclerosis-related pathways. As a first step, an atherosclerosis gene expression macroarray analysis was performed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) exposed to either T2238/αANP (wild type) or C2238/αANP. The major finding was that apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene expression was significantly downregulated by C2238/αANP and it was upregulated by T2238/αANP. We subsequently found that C2238/αANP induces ApoE downregulation through type C natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR-C)-dependent mechanisms involving the upregulation of miR199a-3p and miR199a-5p and the downregulation of DNAJA4. In fact, NPR-C knockdown rescued ApoE level. Upregulation of miR199a by NPR-C was mediated by a reactive oxygen species-dependent increase of the early growth response protein-1 (Egr-1) transcription factor. In fact, Egr-1 knockdown abolished the impact of C2238/αANP on ApoE and miR199a. Of note, downregulation of ApoE by C2238/αANP was associated with a significant increase in inflammation, apoptosis and necrosis that was completely rescued by the exogenous administration of recombinant ApoE. In conclusion, our study dissected a novel mechanism of vascular damage exerted by C2238/αANP that is mediated by ApoE downregulation. We provide the first demonstration that C2238/αANP downregulates ApoE in VSMCs through NPR-C-dependent activation of Egr-1 and the consequent upregulation of miR199a. Restoring ApoE levels could represent a potential therapeutic strategy to counteract the harmful effects of C2238/αANP."
Lorentz Invariance Violation: Modification of the Compton Scattering and the GZK Cutoff and Other Effects,"This paper deals with the violation of Lorentz symmetry. The approach is based on Compton scattering which becomes modified due to a modified dispersion relation arising from a minimum spacetime cut off as in modern Quantum Gravity approaches. With this amendment, we find that two high-energy rays of different energies develop a time-lag. This time separation becomes prominent when the energies of the considered photons is ≥ 1GeV. Extending our approach to gamma rays of cosmic origin we predict that they undergo innumerable such scattering processes before reaching us. Therefore, it accounts for the time-lag phenomena of gamma ray bursts (GRB)’s which have been claimed to be observed. Also, we find that resorting to the modified Snyder-Sidharth Hamiltonian it is possible to extend the GZK cut off beyond its normal limit, 1020
eV. Some observations of ultra high energy cosmic rays support this. This extends the limits of special theory of relativity."
The Ki-67 labeling index and lymphatic/venous permeation predict the metastatic potential of rectal neuroendocrine tumors,"Endoscopic resection has been used to treat small rectal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). However, the indication for additional surgery after endoscopic resection is unclear. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for rectal NET metastasis and to determine the indication for additional surgery."
"Feasibility of robotic inguinal hernia repair, a single-institution experience","With the growth of the discipline of laparoscopic surgery, technology has been further developed to facilitate the performance of minimally invasive hernia repair. Most of the published literature regarding robotic inguinal hernia repair has been performed by urologists who have dealt with this entity in a concomitant way during radical prostatectomies. General surgeons, who perform the vast majority of inguinal herniorrhaphies worldwide, have yet to describe the role of robotic inguinal hernia repair. Here, we describe our initial experience and create the foundation for future research questions regarding robotic inguinal hernia repair."
"Born–Jordan Pseudodifferential Calculus, Bopp Operators and Deformation Quantization","There has recently been a resurgence of interest in Born–Jordan quantization, which historically preceded Weyl’s prescription. Both mathematicians and physicists have found that this forgotten quantization scheme is actually not only of great mathematical interest, but also has unexpected application in operator theory, signal processing, and time-frequency analysis. In the present paper we discuss the applications to deformation quantization, which in its traditional form relies on Weyl quantization. Introducing the notion of “Bopp operator” which we have used in previous work, this allows us to obtain interesting new results in the spectral theory of deformation quantization."
Dual hesitant fuzzy rough set and its application,"In this paper, we propose a general framework for the study of dual hesitant fuzzy rough sets integrating rough set theory with dual hesitant fuzzy set theory in which both constructive and axiomatic approaches are considered. In a constructive approach, by using a dual hesitant fuzzy relation, lower and upper dual hesitant fuzzy rough approximation operators with respect to a dual hesitant fuzzy approximation space are first defined and some properties of this model are further discussed. Adopting an axiomatic approach, dual hesitant fuzzy rough approximation operators are defined by axioms. And different axiom sets of dual hesitant fuzzy set-theoretic operators guarantee the existence of different types of dual hesitant fuzzy relations producing the same operators. We then give an approach of decision-making in uncertainty environment by using the dual hesitant fuzzy rough sets. Finally, a practical application in medical diagnosis is provided to illustrate the validity of this approach."
Granular classifiers and their design through refinement of information granules,"In this study, we focus on the design and refinements of granular pattern classifiers, namely classifiers, which deal with a collection of information granules formed in a certain feature space. The development of this category of classifiers is realized as a two-phase design process. First, information granules occupying some regions of the feature space are formed through invoking mechanisms of clustering or fuzzy clustering. As a result, regions in the feature space are built, which are densely occupied by the patterns predominantly belonging to the same class. We offer a detailed way of assessing the character and quality of information granules and their information (classification-oriented) content. The resulting description is utilized in the realization of the classification mechanism being considered at the second phase of the design of the granular classifier. The mapping from the collection of information granules to class assignment (classification) involves matching of a pattern to be classified to individual information granules and aggregating them by considering the information content of the corresponding granules. In the study, a number of descriptors capturing information content and aggregation functions are analyzed. To improve the performance of the granular classifier, a refinement of information granules is carried out, in which highly heterogeneous information granules (viz. those containing patterns belonging to various classes) are refined (split, specialized), and their refined versions are afterwards used in the buildup of the classifier. A series of experiments involving both synthetic data as well as those publicly available is reported and analyzed, illustrating the main advantages of granular classifiers and their design procedure."
Prospective cohort study of ultrasound-ultrasound and ultrasound-MR enterography agreement in the evaluation of pediatric small bowel Crohn disease,There is a paucity of published literature describing ultrasound (US)-US and US-MR enterography (MRE) inter-radiologist agreement in pediatric small bowel Crohn disease.
Identification of lysine K18 acetylation on histone H3 peptide using gold nanoparticles’ aggregation behaviour,"Acetylation of histones, the major protein component of eukaryotic chromosomes, contributes to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and is also involved in cancer development. A recent study revealed the correlation between tumour formation and acetylation level of lysine K18 on histone H3. In this study, we developed two colorimetric in vitro assays using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for identification of lysine K18 acetylation on histone H3 peptide. In assay I, citrate ion-capped AuNP without further modification was employed. Simply mixing the K18 peptide with AuNP solution leads to distinct particle aggregation, relative to that by non-acetylated or lysine K14 acetylated control peptides. In assay II, an AuNP–peptide–antibody composite was synthesized and used as both the sensing probe and the transducing element. By mixing the sample peptides with the composite solution followed by PBS screening, different aggregation behaviours were observed between the K18 acetylated target peptide and the control sequences. Both assays are capable of identifying the acetylated peptides, and also differentiating the distinctive acetylation positions that differ merely by a distance of three amino acids."
Effects of Styrene-metabolizing Enzyme Polymorphisms and Lifestyle Behaviors on Blood Styrene and Urinary Metabolite Levels in Workers Chronically Exposed to Styrene,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic polymorphisms of CYP2E1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 and lifestyle habits (smoking, drinking, and exercise) modulate the levels of urinary styrene metabolites such as mandelic acid (MA) and phenylglyoxylic acid (PGA) after occupational exposure to styrene. We recruited 79 male workers who had received chronic exposure in styrene fiberglass-reinforced plastic manufacturing factories. We found that serum albumin was significantly correlated with blood styrene/ambient styrene (BS/AS), urinary styrene (US)/AS, and US/BS ratios as well as urinary metabolites, that total protein correlated with US/MA and US/PGA ratios, and that low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol significantly correlated with US/BS, US/MA, and US/PGA ratios. Multiple logistic regression analyses using styrene-metabolizing enzyme genotypes and lifestyle habits as dependent variables and blood and urine styrene concentrations and urine styrene metabolite levels as independent variables revealed that CYP2E1*5 was associated with the MA/US ratio and GSTM1 with US/BS, that a smoking habit was associated with US/AS and MA/US ratios and MA and PGA levels, and that regular exercise was correlated with PGA/US. In conclusion, the results suggested that genetic polymorphisms of styrene-metabolizing enzymes, lifestyle behaviors, and albumin and LDL-cholesterol serving as homeostasis factors together are involved in styrene metabolism."
Endosulfan Induces CYP1A1 Expression Mediated through Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Signal Transduction by Protein Kinase C,"CYP1A1 is a phase I xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme whose expression is mainly driven by AhR. Endosulfan is an organochlorine pesticide used agriculturally for a wide range of crops. In this study, we investigated the effect of endosulfan on CYP1A1 expression and regulation. Endosulfan significantly increased CYP1A1 enzyme activity as well as mRNA and protein levels. In addition, endosulfan markedly induced XRE transcriptional activity. CH-223191, an AhR antagonist, blocked the endosulfan-induced increase in CYP1A1 mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, endosulfan did not induce CYP1A1 gene expression in AhR-deficient mutant cells. Furthermore, endosulfan enhanced the phosphorylation of calcium calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) and protein kinase C (PKC). In conclusion, endosulfaninduced up-regulation of CYP1A1 is associated with AhR activation, which may be mediated by PKC-dependent pathways."
Comparative analysis of growth characteristics of Sprague Dawley rats obtained from different sources,"Genetic background in animal models is an intrinsic research variable in biomedical research. Although inbred strains offer genetic uniformity, the outbred stocks, known for genetic variability are often used to develop animal models of human disease. The genetic variability is considered to be even higher when outbred stocks are obtained from different sources. In order to examine the degree of variability of an outbred stock obtained from various sources, Sprague Dawley (SD) rat lines obtained from two sources were evaluated for their growth characteristics. The SD rats from Charles River laboratories (CRL) and Harlan Laboratories (HAR) were monitored for weight gain from the age of 6 weeks to 24 weeks. Food intake was monitored between 13 and 24 weeks. Body composition, organ weights, tibial lengths and blood parameters were measured. There was no difference observed in food intake per 100 gram body weight at most of the time points. CRL rats showed higher body fat mass (49.6%), higher gross liver weights (22.2%), lower testicular weights (30.8%) and lower cholesterol levels (25.4%) than HAR rats. Phenotypic differences may be attributed to genetic heterogeneity of the SD outbred stock between the two sources and represent a significant research variable impacting studies especially related to metabolic diseases. Therefore, in order the minimize research variables for those studies where genetic diversity is not a basis for experimental design, the use of single source genetically uniform inbred animal models is highly recommended over the use of outbred stocks."
Effects of lutein or lutein in combination with vitamin C on mRNA expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes and status of the antioxidant system in SD rats,"This study was conducted to investigate the effects of lutein alone or in combination with vitamin C on the antioxidant defense system in rats. A total of 18 eight-week-old male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to three groups for 4 weeks: control (CON), lutein (LUT, 50 mg lutein/kg BW) and lutein plus vitamin C (LVC, 50 mg lutein/kg BW+1,000 mg vitamin C/kg BW). No differences in body weight, relative live weight or plasma biochemical profiles were observed among treatment groups. In the hepatic antioxidant defense systems, the mRNA expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the LUT and LVC groups was significantly (P<0.05) higher than that in the CON group, whereas the mRNA level of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) was not affected by the administration of antioxidants. SOD and GST activities in the LUT and LVC groups were significantly higher (P<0.05) than those in the CON group, whereas GPX, CAT and lipid peroxidation did not differ among groups. In addition, the LVC group showed a significant (P<0.05) increase in plasma and hepatic total antioxidant power (TAP) relative to the CON group. Overall, administration of lutein in combination with vitamin C improved the status of the total antioxidant defense system in SD rats."
Beneficial effects of ethanol extracts of Red Liriope platyphylla on vascular dysfunction in the aorta of spontaneously hypertensive rats,"Some biological effects of Red Liriope platyphylla (RLP) on various chronic diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes and obesity were suggested after a report of the production from Liriope platyphylla (L. platyphylla, LP) roots using a steaming process. To examine the beneficial effects of ethanol extracts RLP (EEtRLP) on the vascular dysfunction of hypertension, alterations in key factors related to vascular regulation and antioxidant conditions were investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) after EEtRLP treatment for 2 weeks. High levels of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity were detected in 500 or 1,000 mg/mL EEtRLP. Although no significant improvement of systolic blood pressure or aortic wall thickness were observed in the EEtRLP treated group, the expression level of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 increased significantly after EEtRLP treatment. Moreover, the concentration of aldosterone and K ion in serum rapidly recovered in the EEtRLP treated group relative to the vehicle treated group. Furthermore, the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were significantly increased in the EEtRLP treated group relative to the vehicle treated group, while the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and NOx in the serum of the same group were recovered to the level of Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. Overall, the results presented herein provide novel evidence that EEtRLP treatment may improve vascular dysfunction in the aorta of the SHR through up regulation of the antioxidant state and down regulation of aldosterone and K ion concentration. These results also suggest that EEtRLP may be a potential candidate for treatment of various chronic diseases showing vascular dysfunction."
Effects of pentoxifylline administration on histomorphological parameters of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat testes,"The effect of pentoxifylline (PTX) administration on histomorphological parameters of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) in male rat testes were evaluated. We randomly divided 40 male rats into the following four groups: group 1: control or normal glycemic (NG) rats; group 2 or NG rats that received only normal saline (NS), (NG+NS); group 3 or diabetic rats which were not treated by PTX (DM+vehicle solution (NS)); and group 4 which comprised diabetic rats treated with 50 mg/kg of PTX (DM+PTX). Type 1 DM was induced by intraperitoneal injection of STZ (55 mg/kg). Rats were held for 30 days after which the experimental group received PTX twice daily (25 mg/kg) or NS. After 14 days of treatment by PTX or NS, the left testes from all rats were extracted and prpared for histological study. Apoptotic cells, blood vessel density, and spermatogenesis were evaluated. Data were analyzed by ANOVA test. PTX-treated-diabetic rats showed a significant decrease in number of apoptotic cells and decrease in blood vessel density compared to the DM+NS rats. A significant increase in spermatogenesis was observed in the PTX-treated diabetic group, compared to the DM+NS groups. It was concluded that PTX administration to STZ-induced type 1 DM rats affected apoptotic cell number positively. Moreover, blood vessel density significantly decreased and improvements were observed in spermatogenesis."
"Trends in Bariatric Surgery: Procedure Selection, Revisional Surgeries, and Readmissions","There are limited data quantifying national trends, post-operative readmissions, and revisional surgeries for bariatric procedures. We hypothesized that there is a trend away from Roux en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric bands (LAGB) in favor of vertical sleeve gastrectomies (VSG). We hypothesized that VSG was associated with fewer revisions and readmissions, and that demographics and comorbidities were associated with surgery received."
High precision optical fiber alignment using tube laser bending,"In this paper, we present a method to align optical fibers within 0.2 μm of the optimal position, using tube laser bending and in situ measuring of the coupling efficiency. For near-UV wavelengths, passive alignment of the fibers with respect to the waveguides on photonic integrated circuit chips does not suffice. In prior research, it was shown that permanent position adjustments to an optical fiber by tube laser bending meets the accuracy requirements for this application. This iterative alignment can be done after any assembly steps. A method was developed previously that selects the optimal laser power and laser spot position on the tube, to minimize the number of iterations required to reach the target position. In this paper, that method is extended to the case where the absolute position of the fiber tip cannot be measured. By exploiting the thermal expansion motion at a relatively low laser power, the fiber tip can be moved without permanent deformation (only elastic strain) of the tube. An algorithm has been developed to search for the optimal fiber position, by actively measuring and maximizing the coupling efficiency. This search is performed before each bending step. Experiments have shown that it is possible to align the fiber with an accuracy of 0.2 μm using this approach."
Properties of ScxAl1-xN (x = 0.27) thin films on sapphire and silicon substrates upon high temperature loading,"Scandium Aluminum Nitride thin films (ScxAl1-xN) are attracting more and more attention for micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) because of significantly increased piezoelectric constants compared to pure AlN. This work provides a comprehensive study of thermal annealing effects on ScxAl1-xN (x = 27 %) films synthesized via DC magnetron sputter deposition at nominally unheated Silicon and Sapphire substrates. Compared to the “as deposited” state increasing c-axis orientation and crystalline quality upon annealing up to 1000 °C of films with mixed crystallographic orientation is observed via X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy based analyses. Also the piezoelectric coefficient d
33 of ScxAl1-xN on Si shows increasing values at enhanced annealing temperatures. However, the improved piezoelectric properties are accompanied by both increased leakage currents and loss tangent values."
Molina’s Hog-nosed Skunk as prey of the Great Horned Owl: predation or opportunist scavenging?,"This note reports the observation of an adult Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) holding a Molina’s Hog-nosed Skunk (Conepatus chinga) in its claws. We assumed that it is a case of opportunistic predation because the skunk is larger than this owl’s regular preys. However, we could not exclude the possibility of opportunistic scavenging, despite this being an uncommon behavior for the Great Horned Owl. This is the first report of a Molina’s Hog-nosed Skunk preyed by a Great Horned Owl, an unusually large prey to an owl that preys mainly upon small mammals (e.g. rodents). Aso, it is an uncommon report of consumption of mammal carnivores by owls in South America."
Dangerous traps: Anhingas mistake anthropogenic debris for prey fish at an urban site in South-eastern Brazil,"Impacts of anthropogenic inedible debris on seabirds have been well documented, but on inland waterbirds this kind of pollution remains poorly recorded. Herein we report 21 instances of inedible objects stuck in the bill of Anhinga (Anhinga anhinga), a fish-eating waterbird which has the cutting edges of the mandible serrated. Disturbance and harm by pieces of plastic, rope, and cotton stuck in the bill were recorded. Debris caused drag and prevented the birds from fishing. Birds with small pieces of material stuck on their bills were still able to fish, but their hunting success decreased. When the debris was large and stuck on the bill for long, the birds possibly starved and some of them died. The time spent to clean up the bill was related to the type of material, ranging from 1 to 17 days. Our records illustrate the deleterious effect that anthropogenic debris has on the life of a Neotropical aquatic inland bird."
Study on the Structural Evolution During Non Isothermal Aging of an Al–Cu–Mg–Si Alloy by Means of Thermal Analysis,"In the present paper, the precipitation sequences that take place in an Al–Cu–Mg–Si alloy have been identified by means of dilatometry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). While the dilatometric curves shows nine dilatometric anomalies, the DSC scans present seven effects. By comparing these two methods, the dilatometric anomalies have been linked to the precipitation and dissolution of GP and GPB zones, β″, θ′ and Q′ precipitates. The effect of the different precipitation reactions on the dilatometric behavior of the studied alloy has been explained by the depletion of the Al matrix from alloying elements, and the differences between specific volumes of the developed precipitates and the matrix. The occurrence of these precipitation reactions has been confirmed by measuring the corresponding activation energies and X-ray diffraction analysis. The results obtained using the aforementioned techniques in this research are in good agreement with several previous works found in literature."
Prospectively measured lifestyle factors and BMI explain differences in health-related quality of life between colorectal cancer patients with and without comorbid diabetes,"This study aimed to assess the longitudinal association between lifestyle factors, body mass index (BMI), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among colorectal cancer patients with (CRCDM+) and without diabetes (CRCDM−)."
Self-identification and management of hand-foot syndrome (HFS): effect of a structured teaching program on patients receiving capecitabine-based chemotherapy for colon cancer,"Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of 5–fluorouracil and is commonly used oral chemotherapeutic drugs for advanced gastric and colorectal cancer. However, hand-foot syndrome (HFS) has high incidence, and once developed, the symptoms significantly impair quality of life (QOL), leading to a reduction in the dosage or discontinuation of the treatment. Effective health education should be offered to patients to promote self-identification and management on how to recognize HFS and use self-management techniques at the very beginning of chemotherapy."
Characteristics of the Energetic Igniters Through Integrating Al/NiO Nanolaminates on Cr Film Bridge,"The energetic igniters through integrating Al/NiO nanolaminates on Cr film bridges have been investigated in this study. The microstructures demonstrate well-defined geometry and sharp interfaces. The depth profiles of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of Al/NiO nanolaminates annealed at 550 °C with a bilayer thickness of 250 nm show that the interdiffusion between the Al layer and NiO layer has happened and the annealing temperature cannot provide enough energy to make the diffusion process much more complete. The electrical explosion characteristics employing a capacitor discharge firing set at the optimized charging voltage of 40 V show that the flame duration time is about 700 μs, and an excellent explosion performance is obtained for (Al/NiO)n/Cr igniters with a bilayer thickness of 1000 nm."
Speaker Identification in a Shouted Talking Environment Based on Novel Third-Order Circular Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models,"It is well known that speaker identification yields very high performance in a neutral talking environment; on the other hand, the performance has been sharply declined in a shouted talking environment. This work aims at proposing, implementing, and evaluating novel third-order circular suprasegmental hidden Markov models (CSPHMM3s) to improve the low performance of text-independent speaker identification in a shouted talking environment. CSPHMM3s possess combined characteristics of: Circular Hidden Markov models, third-order hidden Markov models (HMM3s), and suprasegmental hidden Markov models (SPHMMs). Our results show that CSPHMM3s are superior to each of: first-order left-to-right suprasegmental hidden Markov models (LTRSPHMM1s), second-order left-to-right suprasegmental hidden Markov models (LTRSPHMM2s), third-order left-to-right suprasegmental hidden Markov models (LTRSPHMM3s), first-order circular suprasegmental hidden Markov models (CSPHMM1s), and second-order circular suprasegmental hidden Markov models (CSPHMM2s) in a shouted talking environment. Using our collected speech database, average speaker identification performance in a shouted talking environment based on LTRSPHMM1s, LTRSPHMM2s, LTRSPHMM3s, CSPHMM1s, CSPHMM2s, and CSPHMM3s is 74.6, 78.4, 81.7, 78.7, 83.4, and 85.8 %, respectively. Speaker identification performance that has been achieved based on CSPHMM3s is close to that attained based on subjective assessment by human listeners."
The impact of deformation on vortex development in a baroclinic moist atmosphere,"A mathematical relation between deformation and vertical vorticity tendency is built by introducing the frontogenesis function and the complete vertical vorticity equation, which is derived by virtue of moist potential vorticity. From the mathematical relation, it is shown that properly configured atmospheric conditions can make deformation exert a positive contribution to vortex development at rates comparable to other favorable factors. The effect of deformation on vortex development is not only related to the deformation itself, but also depends on the current thermodynamic and dynamic structures of the atmosphere, such as the convective stability, moist baroclinicity and vertical wind shear (or horizontal vorticity). A diagnostic study of a heavy-rainfall case that occurred during 20–22 July 2012 shows that deformation has the most remarkable effect on the increase in vertical vorticity during the rapid development stage of the low vortex during its whole life cycle. This feature is mainly due to the existence of an approximate neutral layer (about 700 hPa) in the atmosphere where the convective stability tends to be zero. The neutral layer makes the effect of deformation on the vertical vorticity increase significantly during the vortex development stage, and thus drives the vertical vorticity to increase."
Dynamic responses of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration to global temperature changes between 1850 and 2010,"Changes in Earth’s temperature have significant impacts on the global carbon cycle that vary at different time scales, yet to quantify such impacts with a simple scheme is traditionally deemed difficult. Here, we show that, by incorporating a temperature sensitivity parameter (1.64 ppm yr-1 °C-1) into a simple linear carbon-cycle model, we can accurately characterize the dynamic responses of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration to anthropogenic carbon emissions and global temperature changes between 1850 and 2010 (r
2 > 0.96 and the root-mean-square error < 1 ppm for the period from 1960 onward). Analytical analysis also indicates that the multiplication of the parameter with the response time of the atmospheric carbon reservoir (~12 year) approximates the long-term temperature sensitivity of global atmospheric CO2 concentration (~15 ppm °C-1), generally consistent with previous estimates based on reconstructed CO2 and climate records over the Little Ice Age. Our results suggest that recent increases in global surface temperatures, which accelerate the release of carbon from the surface reservoirs into the atmosphere, have partially offset surface carbon uptakes enhanced by the elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and slowed the net rate of atmospheric CO2 sequestration by global land and oceans by ~30% since the 1960s. The linear modeling framework outlined in this paper thus provides a useful tool to diagnose the observed atmospheric CO2 dynamics and monitor their future changes."
Evaluation of the tropical variability from the Beijing Climate Center’s real-time operational global Ocean Data Assimilation System,"The second-generation Global Ocean Data Assimilation System of the Beijing Climate Center (BCC GODAS2.0) has been run daily in a pre-operational mode. It spans the period 1990 to the present day. The goal of this paper is to introduce the main components and to evaluate BCC GODAS2.0 for the user community. BCC GODAS2.0 consists of an observational data preprocess, ocean data quality control system, a three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) data assimilation, and global ocean circulation model [Modular Ocean Model 4 (MOM4)]. MOM4 is driven by six-hourly fluxes from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. Satellite altimetry data, SST, and in-situ temperature and salinity data are assimilated in real time. The monthly results from the BCC GODAS2.0 reanalysis are compared and assessed with observations for 1990–2011. The climatology of the mixed layer depth of BCC GODAS2.0 is generally in agreement with that ofWorld Ocean Atlas 2001. The modeled sea level variations in the tropical Pacific are consistent with observations from satellite altimetry on interannual to decadal time scales. Performances in predicting variations in the SST using BCC GODAS2.0 are evaluated. The standard deviation of the SST in BCC GODAS2.0 agrees well with observations in the tropical Pacific. BCC GODAS2.0 is able to capture the main features of El Ni˜no Modoki I and Modoki II, which have different impacts on rainfall in southern China. In addition, the relationships between the Indian Ocean and the two types of El Ni˜no Modoki are also reproduced."
Implementation of a one-dimensional enthalpy sea-ice model in a simple pycnocline prediction model for sea-ice data assimilation studies,"To further explore enthalpy-based sea-ice assimilation, a one-dimensional (1D) enthalpy sea-ice model is implemented into a simple pycnocline prediction model. The 1D enthalpy sea-ice model includes the physical processes such as brine expulsion, flushing, and salt diffusion. After being coupled with the atmosphere and ocean components, the enthalpy sea-ice model can be integrated stably and serves as an important modulator of model variability. Results from a twin experiment show that the sea-ice data assimilation in the enthalpy space can produce smaller root-mean-square errors of model variables than the traditional scheme that assimilates the observations of ice concentration, especially for slow-varying states. This study provides some insights into the improvement of sea-ice data assimilation in a coupled general circulation model."
Trends of regional precipitation and their control mechanisms during 1979–2013,"Trends in precipitation are critical to water resources. Considerable uncertainty remains concerning the trends of regional precipitation in response to global warming and their controlling mechanisms. Here, we use an interannual difference method to derive trends of regional precipitation from GPCP (Global Precipitation Climatology Project) data and MERRA (Modern- Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications) reanalysis in the near-global domain of 60°S–60°N during a major global warming period of 1979–2013. We find that trends of regional annual precipitation are primarily driven by changes in the top 30% heavy precipitation events, which in turn are controlled by changes in precipitable water in response to global warming, i.e., by thermodynamic processes. Significant drying trends are found in most parts of the U.S. and eastern Canada, the Middle East, and eastern South America, while significant increases in precipitation occur in northern Australia, southern Africa, western India and western China. In addition, as the climate warms there are extensive enhancements and expansions of the three major tropical precipitation centers–the Maritime Continent, Central America, and tropical Africa–leading to the observed widening of Hadley cells and a significant strengthening of the global hydrological cycle."
Application of an artificial neural network for a direct estimation of atmospheric instability from a next-generation imager,"Atmospheric instability information derived from satellites plays an important role in short-term weather forecasting, especially the forecasting of severe convective storms. For the next generation of weather satellites for Korea’s multi-purpose geostationary satellite program, a new imaging instrument has been developed. Although this imaging instrument is not designed to perform full sounding missions and its capability is limited, its multi-spectral infrared channels provide information on vertical sounding. To take full advantage of the observation data from the much improved spatiotemporal resolution of the imager, the feasibility of an artificial neural network approach for the derivation of the atmospheric instability is investigated. The multi-layer perceptron model with a feed-forward and back-propagation training algorithm shows quite a sensitive response to the selection of the training dataset and model architecture. Through an extensive performance test with a carefully selected training dataset of 7197 independent profiles, the model architectures are selected to be 12, 5000, and 0.3 for the number of hidden nodes, number of epochs, and learning rate, respectively. The selected model gives a mean absolute error, RMSE, and correlation coefficient of 330 J kg-1, 420 J kg-1, and 0.9, respectively. The feasibility is further demonstrated via application of the model to real observation data from a similar instrument that has comparable observation channels with the planned imager."
A microscale model for air pollutant dispersion simulation in urban areas: Presentation of the model and performance over a single building,"A microscale air pollutant dispersion model system is developed for emergency response purposes. The model includes a diagnostic wind field model to simulate the wind field and a random-walk air pollutant dispersion model to simulate the pollutant concentration through consideration of the influence of urban buildings. Numerical experiments are designed to evaluate the model’s performance, using CEDVAL (Compilation of Experimental Data for Validation of Microscale Dispersion Models) wind tunnel experiment data, including wind fields and air pollutant dispersion around a single building. The results show that the wind model can reproduce the vortexes triggered by urban buildings and the dispersion model simulates the pollutant concentration around buildings well. Typically, the simulation errors come from the determination of the key zones around a building or building cluster. This model has the potential for multiple applications; for example, the prediction of air pollutant dispersion and the evaluation of environmental impacts in emergency situations; urban planning scenarios; and the assessment of microscale air quality in urban areas."
A solely radiance-based spectral angular distribution model and its application in deriving clear-sky spectral fluxes over tropical oceans,"The radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere plays a critical role in climate research. Compared to the broadband flux, the spectrally resolved outgoing longwave radiation or flux (OLR), with rich atmospheric information in different bands, has obvious advantages in the evaluation of GCMs. Unlike methods that need auxiliary measurements and information, here we take atmospheric infrared sounder (AIRS) observations as an example to build a self-consistent algorithm by an angular distribution model (ADM), based solely on radiance observations, to estimate clear-sky spectrally resolved fluxes over tropical oceans. As the key step for such an ADM, scene type estimations are obtained from radiance and brightness temperature in selected AIRS channels. Then, broadband OLR as well as synthetic spectral fluxes are derived by the spectral ADM and validated using both synthetic spectra and CERES (Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System) observations. In most situations, the mean OLR differences between the spectral ADM products and the CERES observations are within ±2 W m-2, which is less than 1% of the typical mean clear-sky OLR over tropical oceans. The whole algorithm described in this study can be easily extended to other similar hyperspectral radiance measurements."
Influence of soil moisture in eastern China on the East Asian summer monsoon,"The sensitivity of the East Asian summer monsoon to soil moisture anomalies over China was investigated based on ensembles of seasonal simulations (March–September) using the NCEP GCM coupled with the Simplified Simple Biosphere Model (NCEP GCM/SSiB). After a control experiment with free-running soil moisture, two ensembles were performed in which the soil moisture over the vast region from the lower and middle reaches of the Yangtze River valley to North China (YRNC) was double and half that in the control, with the maximum less than the field capacity. The simulation results showed significant sensitivity of the East Asian summer monsoon to wet soil in YRNC. The wetter soil was associated with increased surface latent heat flux and reduced surface sensible heat flux. In turn, these changes resulted in a wetter and colder local land surface and reduced land–sea temperature gradients, corresponding to a weakened East Asian monsoon circulation in an anomalous anticyclone over southeastern China, and a strengthened East Asian trough southward over Northeast China. Consequently, less precipitation appeared over southeastern China and North China and more rainfall over Northeast China. The weakened monsoon circulation and strengthened East Asian trough was accompanied by the convergence of abnormal northerly and southerly flow over the Yangtze River valley, resulting in more rainfall in this region. In the drier soil experiments, less precipitation appeared over YRNC. The East Asian monsoon circulation seems to show little sensitivity to dry soil anomalies in NCEP GCM/SSiB."
Turning the Question Around: Do Colleges Fail to Meet Students’ Expectations?,"Research often focuses on how students fail to meet college expectations, but it rarely asks how colleges fail to meet students’ expectations. This study examines students’ expectations of college and their institutional confidence—their level of certainty that college will meet their expectations. Drawing on 65 pilot interviews and a survey of 757 students in eight community colleges and two private occupational colleges, we find that students have three expectations about college. However, students do not express confidence that college will meet these expectations. Students expect college to provide: (1) dependable progress to credentials, (2) relevant courses, and (3) job contacts. Factor analyses confirm that ten survey items load onto the three components of institutional confidence expressed in the interviews. Using structural equation modeling, we investigate how institutional confidence varies by college program and its relationship to students’ overall college evaluations. Within 2-year colleges, we find that students in two occupational programs express more confidence that college provides relevant courses and employer contacts than students in BA transfer programs. Further, we find that students’ institutional confidence that college provides relevant courses mediates much of the relationship between college program and students’ overall college evaluation. We speculate about ways college programs may improve students’ institutional confidence and their evaluation of college."
Comparing Two Inquiry Professional Development Interventions in Science on Primary Students’ Questioning and Other Inquiry Behaviours,"Developing students’ skills to pose and respond to questions and actively engage in inquiry behaviours enables students to problem solve and critically engage with learning and society. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of providing teachers with an intervention in inquiry pedagogy alongside inquiry science curriculum in comparison to an intervention in non-inquiry pedagogy alongside inquiry science curriculum on student questioning and other inquiry behaviours. Teacher participants in the comparison condition received training in four inquiry-based science units and in collaborative strategic reading. The experimental group, the community of inquiry (COI) condition, received training in facilitating a COI in addition to training in the same four inquiry-based science units. This study involved 227 students and 18 teachers in 9 primary schools across Brisbane, Australia. The teachers were randomly allocated by school to one of the two conditions. The study followed the students across years 6 and 7 and students’ discourse during small group activities was recorded, transcribed and coded for verbal inquiry behaviours. In the second year of the study, students in the COI condition demonstrated a significantly higher frequency of procedural and substantive higher-order thinking questions and other inquiry behaviours than those in the comparison condition. Implementing a COI within an inquiry science curriculum develops students’ questioning and science inquiry behaviours and allows teachers to foster inquiry skills predicated by the Australian Science Curriculum. Provision of inquiry science curriculum resources alone is not sufficient to promote the questioning and other verbal inquiry behaviours predicated by the Australian Science Curriculum."
Budesonide Loaded PLGA Nanoparticles for Targeting the Inflamed Intestinal Mucosa—Pharmaceutical Characterization and Fluorescence Imaging,The purpose of this study was to evaluate the specifically targeted efficiency of budesonide loaded PLGA nanoparticles for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

"The Role of Lake Expansion in Altering the Wetland Landscape of the Prairie Pothole Region, United States","Interannual variation in lake extent is well documented in the Prairie Pothole Region, but the role of surface-water expansion, including lake expansion, in merging with and subsuming wetlands across the landscape has been minimally considered. We examined how the expansion of surface-water extent, in particular, the expansion of lakes across parts of the Prairie Pothole Region can alter landscape-level hydrologic connectivity among substantial numbers of previously surficially disconnected wetlands. Temporally static wetland, lake, and stream datasets were fused with temporally varying Landsat-derived surface-water extent maps (1990–2011) to quantify changes in surface-water connectivity. Under deluge conditions, lakes were found to create significantly larger complexes of surficially-connected wetlands relative to non-lake surface-water connections (e.g., only wetlands or wetlands and streams). Analysis of three specific lakes showed that lakes can merge with and subsume wetlands located kilometers to tens of kilometers from the National Wetland Inventory defined lake perimeter. As climate across the Prairie Pothole Region is highly variable, understanding historic patterns of surface-water expansion and contraction under drought-to-deluge conditions will be integral to predicting future effects of climate change on wetland function, loss and influence on other aquatic systems, including downstream waters."
Twists of Plücker Coordinates as Dimer Partition Functions,"The homogeneous coordinate ring of the Grassmannian Grk,n has a cluster structure defined in terms of planar diagrams known as Postnikov diagrams. The cluster corresponding to such a diagram consists entirely of Plücker coordinates. We introduce a twist map on Grk,n, related to the Berenstein–Fomin–Zelevinsky-twist, and give an explicit Laurent expansion for the twist of an arbitrary Plücker coordinate in terms of the cluster variables associated with a fixed Postnikov diagram. The expansion arises as a (scaled) dimer partition function of a weighted version of the bipartite graph dual to the Postnikov diagram, modified by a boundary condition determined by the Plücker coordinate. We also relate the twist map to a maximal green sequence."
De novo characterization of the liver transcriptome of javelin goby Synechogobius hasta and analysis of its transcriptomic profile following waterborne copper exposure,"Previous studies have investigated the physiological responses to chronic copper (Cu) exposure in the liver of Synechogobius hasta; however, little information is available on the underlying molecular mechanisms. In an effort to better understand the mechanisms of Cu toxicity and to illuminate global gene expression patterns modulated by Cu exposure, we obtained the liver transcriptome information of S. hasta by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology and also investigated the differential expression of genes following waterborne Cu exposure. Using the Illumina sequencing platform, as many as 60,217 unigenes were generated, with 815 bp of average length and 1298 bp of unigene N50 after filtering and assembly. For functional annotation analysis, 34,860, 31,526, 31,576, 25,808, 11,542, and 21,721 unigenes were annotated to the NR, NT, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, COG, and GO databases, respectively, and total annotation unigenes were 37,764. After 30 days of exposure to 55 μg Cu/l, a total of 292 and 1076 genes were significantly up- and down-regulated, respectively. By KEGG analysis, 660 had a specific pathway annotation. Subsequent bioinformatics analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly related to lipid metabolism, immune system, apoptosis, and signal transduction, suggesting that these signaling pathways may be regulated by Cu exposure. The present study provides comprehensive sequence information for subsequent gene expression studies regarding S. hasta, and the transcriptome profiling after Cu exposure is also expected to improve our understanding of the molecular toxicology of Cu."
"Environmental flow in the River Ondas basin in Bahia, Brazilian Cerrado","This paper aimed to estimate the environmental flow of a water basin located in the Brazilian Cerrado using the bidimensional model River2D. The study was carried out in a stretch of the lower portion of the River Ondas in the western part of the state of Bahia, Brazil. To carry out the ecohydrological modeling, the following were used: topobathymetry, hydraulic characterization, the streamflows with the probability of non-exceedances (Q50, Q60, Q70, Q80, Q90, and Q95), and the Habitat Suitability Index for species of the genus Hypostomus. In the River2D, the weighted usable areas (WUAs) pertaining to the streamflows associated with different non-exceedances were simulated for the later construction of optimization and identification matrices of the streamflows that maximize the habitat area throughout the year. For juvenile Hypostomus, WUA increased as streamflow increased, with higher values associated with Q50. For adult specimens, lower WUA values were observed associated with Q50, while higher values were associated with Q95, which shows a preference for lower streamflows. The environmental flows found for the stretch of the River Ondas varied over the course of the year. The lowest environmental flows were observed in September (30.31 m3 s−1) and October (29.98 m3 s−1), while the highest were observed in February (44.22 m3 s−1) and March (43.16 m3 s−1). The environmental flow regime obtained restricts the water availability in the basin, for the purpose of water capture, which shows the importance of ecohydrological studies in forming a basis for water resource management actions."
Artificial neural network for multifunctional areas,"The issues related to the appropriate planning of the territory are particularly pronounced in highly inhabited areas (urban areas), where in addition to protecting the environment, it is important to consider an anthropogenic (urban) development placed in the context of sustainable growth. This work aims at mathematically simulating the changes in the land use, by implementing an artificial neural network (ANN) model. More specifically, it will analyze how the increase of urban areas will develop and whether this development would impact on areas with particular socioeconomic and environmental value, defined as multifunctional areas. The simulation is applied to the Chianti Area, located in the province of Florence, in Italy. Chianti is an area with a unique landscape, and its territorial planning requires a careful examination of the territory in which it is inserted."
Heterospecific competition and attraction in grassland bird communities differ with habitat quality,"The behavioral basis for habitat selection has been intensively studied, but comparatively little attention has been paid to how the resultant species assemblages are formed or affected. Further, how habitat quality interacts with behavior during habitat selection needs greater exploration. We sought to identify some of the behavioral interactions influencing the development of bird assemblages in agricultural habitats, which we consider a structurally simple model system. We performed point counts in non-cultivated meadows, intensive agriculture, and non-intensive agriculture areas in the 2011 and 2012 breeding seasons in which we particularly focussed on Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna), Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla), Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), and Vesper Sparrow (Pooecetus gramineus). Using presence-absence matrices and EcoSim software on 2011 census data, we determined where competition was likely to occur, and which species were competing. In 2012, we experimentally tested these relationships by introducing artificial competitors onto sites. We implemented a before-after control-impact study by comparing presence-absence data from 2011 to 2012 and using multinomial logistic regression. We found grassland bird assemblages are structured by interspecific competition or attraction. The experimental introduction of Grasshopper Sparrows resulted in several presence/absence changes, which differed based on habitat quality, by conspecifics and four heterospecifics (especially Bobolinks). We speculate that the response to competitors is actually determined by the relative quality of each habitat type for each species."
"Distributional patterns of endemic, native and alien species along a roadside elevation gradient in Tenerife, Canary Islands","Invasion by alien plant species may be rapid and aggressive, causing erosion of local biodiversity. This is particularly true for islands, where natural and anthropogenic corridors promote the rapid spread of invasive plants. Although evidence shows that corridors may facilitate plant invasions, the question of how their importance in the spread of alien species varies along environmental gradients deserves more attention. Here, we addressed this issue by examining diversity patterns (species richness of endemic, native and alien species) along and across roads, along an elevation gradient from sea-level up to 2050 m a.s.l. in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain), at multiple spatial scales. Species richness was assessed using a multi-scale sampling design consisting of 59 T-transects of 150 m × 2 m, along three major roads each placed over the whole elevation gradient. Each transect was composed of three sections of five plots each: Section 1 was located on the road edges, Section 2 at intermediate distance, and Section 3 far from the road edge, the latter representing the “native community” less affected by road-specific disturbance. The effect of elevation and distance from roadsides was evaluated for the three groups of species (endemic, native and alien species), using parametric and non-parametric regression analyses as well as additive diversity partitioning. Differences among roads explained the majority of the variation in alien species richness and composition. Patterns in alien species richness were also affected by elevation, with a decline in richness with increasing elevation and no alien species recorded at high elevations. Elevation was the most important factor determining patterns in endemic and native species. These findings confirm that climate filtering reflected in varying patterns along elevational gradients is an important determinant of the richness of alien species (which are not adapted to high elevations), while anthropogenic pressures may explain the richness of alien species at low elevation."
Litter quality and temperature modulate microbial diversity effects on decomposition in model experiments,"The consequences of decline in biodiversity for ecosystem functioning is a major concern in soil ecology. Recent research efforts have been mostly focused on terrestrial plants, while, despite their importance in ecosystems, little is known about soil microbial communities. This work aims at investigating the effects of fungal and bacterial species richness on the dynamics of leaf litter decomposition. Synthetic microbial communities with species richness ranging from 1 to 64 were assembled in laboratory microcosms and used in three factorial experiments of decomposition. Thereafter, the functionality of the different microcosms was determined by measuring their capability to decompose materials with different chemical properties, including two species of litter (Quercus ilex L. and Hedera helix L.), cellulose strips and woody sticks. Incubation was done in microcosms at two temperatures (12°C and 24°C) for 120 days. The number of microbial species inoculated in the microcosms positively affected decomposition rates of Q. ilex and H. helix litters, while relationships found for cellulose and wood were not statistically significant. Diversity effect was greater at higher incubation temperature. We found lower variability of decay rates in microcosms with higher inoculated species richness of microbial communities. Our study pointed out that the relationships between inoculum microbial diversity and litter decomposition is dependent on temperature and litter quality. Therefore, the loss of microbial species may adversely affects ecosystem functionality under specific environmental conditions."
The effect of stand-level habitat characteristics on breeding bird assemblages in Hungarian temperate mixed forests,"The effects of stand structure, tree species composition, proportion of habitat types and land use history on breeding bird assemblages in temperate mixed forests in Western Hungary were studied. The species richness, the abundance and the composition of the whole breeding bird assemblage and of some groups formed on the basis of nesting site and rarity were examined. Stand structural variables had the highest impact on the breeding bird assemblage, while tree species composition, the varying proportion of vegetation types and land use history had no significant effect. In the case of the species richness, the abundance and the composition of the whole assemblage, the most important variables were the mean diameter of trees, the vegetation cover of the forest floor and the dead wood volume. The explained variance in the linear models of different groups varied between 20% and 60%, and the relative importance of these three variables also differed considerably. These results indicate that forest management may considerably influence the diversity and the composition of birds, as all the structural elements affecting birds deeply depend on it. Within the shelterwood management system, the elongation of the rotation and regeneration periods, and the relatively high proportion of retention tree groups after harvest could contribute to the conservation of forest birds. Our results also showed that for the forest bird communities, both the prevalence of big trees and the presence of a dense understory layer are important. Management regimes which apply continuous forest cover might be more appropriate for providing these structural elements simultaneously on small spatial scales, and for the maintenance of a more diverse bird community, thus healthier forest ecosystems."
"Interplay of temperature and woody cover shapes herb communities along an elevational gradient in a temperate forest in Beijing, China","Abiotic and biotic factors have the potential to alter herb communities, however, few studies consider feedback between them. This study explores how variation of species interaction and climatic conditions associated with changes in altitude affect herb community composition. We sampled accumulated temperatures of growth duration (June-November) (ATGD), maximum summer temperatures (MST) and herb community composition (herb height, abundance, richness) on non-gaps and forest-gaps site across an elevational gradient. A significant negative relationship was detected between MST and herb richness. The temperature of non-gaps was cooler than that of forest gaps, and overstory cover positively correlated with herb abundance. However, the ATGD exhibited a negative relationship with overstory cover, in that overstory cover decreased with ATGD. We suggested that temperature has a profound effect on height and richness of herb communities, while the overstory cover is moderating the effect of temperature on herb community structure and influence the abundance of herb community. Conversely, decreases in ATGD weakened the relative importance of overstory cover. We concluded that the interaction of temperature and overstory cover shapes the morphology, abundance and richness of herb communities."
Resource partitioning and niche segregation in a steppe bird assemblage,"Niche theory predicts that coexisting species will partition resources to limit the effects of interspecific competition. We examined microhabitat partitioning in six sets of steppe birds associated to agroecosystems in central Spain (female and male Great Bustards Otis tarda, female and male Little Bustards Tetrax tetrax, Red-legged Partridges Alectoris rufa and Eurasian Stone-curlews Burhinus oedicnemus) to estimate realized niche breadth, overlap and segregation. Principal Components Analysis on data from used and random microhabitat locations produced two axes we retained for analysis related with two key factors: cover-visibility and food availability. Non-parametric kernel density functions were calculated for each of the PCA axes and species (or sexes), and niche overlap estimated as the area shared between species’ density functions. Null models were run to evaluate overlap significance. In analyses of microhabitat selection by the six sets of birds, 13 out of 15 pairs had significant resource partitioning and niche segregation, except for the pairs partridge and female Great Bustard and the two sexes of Great Bustard. Eurasian Stone-curlew showed wider trophic niche breadth, although segregated from the other species, probably because of its higher invertebrate requirements. Great and Little Bustards segregated in both niche axes, selecting microhabitat according to their body size. Accessibility to food resources and shelter seems to be similar for partridges and female Great Bustards, overlapping in their selection, which may indicate the existence of segregation in other niche factors (e.g., feeding habits). Great Bustard males showed niche overlap with females. Little Bustard males showed feeding microhabitat selection patterns similar to those of females, although they preferred more open microhabitats to meet their sexual display requirements. The entire assemblage had significantly less overlap than expected by chance, suggesting that differential microhabitat selection and realized niche partitioning may explain coexistence in steppe bird communities. Our results suggest that the maintenance of different microhabitat structure should be a priority in the management of agricultural environments."
The Role of Arabidopsis Glutathione Transferase F9 Gene Under Oxidative Stress in Seedlings,"Arabidopsis thaliana contains 54 soluble glutathione transferases (GSTs, EC 2.5.1.18), which are thought to play major roles in oxidative stress responses, but little is known about the function of individual isoenzymes. The role of AtGST phi 9 (GSTF9) in the salt- and salicylic acid response was investigated using 2-week-old Atgstf9 and wild type (Wt) plants. Atgstf9 mutants accumulated more ascorbic acid (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) and had decreased glutathione peroxidase (GPOX) activity under control conditions. Treatment of 2-week-old seedlings with 10−7 M salicylic acid (SA) for 48 h resulted in elevated H202 level and enhanced GST activity in Atgstf9 plants, 10−7 M SA treatment enhanced the malondialdehyde and dehydroascorbate contents compared to Wt. 50 and 150 mM NaCl increased the GST activity, AsA and GSH accumulation in Atgstf9 seedlings more pronounced than in Wt plants. We found that the Atgstf9 mutants had altered redox homeostasis under control and stress conditions, in which elevated AsA and GSH levels and modified GST and GPOX activities may play significant role. The half-cell potential values calculated from the concentration of GSH and GSSG indicate that this GST isoenzyme has an important role in the salt stress response."
Paraoxonase 1 activity and polymorphisms in multiple sclerosis patients,"The pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) includes also the vascular abnormalities. Recent reports on changes in venous cerebrospinal outflow and the investigation of immunomodulatory properties of several vascular mediators on the molecular level have added new information to hypotheses on vascular pathology as determining factor in the pathophysiology of MS. We assessed changes in serum paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activities in MS patients and polymorphism of PON1 as a risk factor for MS. The main role of serum PON1 is hydrolysis of lipid peroxides and protection of low-density lipoprotein particles from oxidation. These events could play a role in lowering the risk of atherogenesis and vascular complications development in MS. There are controversial results about association of two main polymorphisms in paraoxonase coding region (PON1 55L/M, PON1 192Q/R) and risk of MS in different populations. Our results support studies that PON1 polymorphisms are probably not a risk factor of MS development."
Formation of radial symmetric needle-like rosette leaves in Arabidopsis,"In the bodies of seed plants, lateral organs of the shoot, for example cotyledons, leaves, and floral organs, are determinate and exhibit localized planer growth resulting in breaking of radial symmetry and asymmetric development. Localized planer growth in the leaf generates the leaf blade, the principle site of photosynthesis in most plants. Development of flat and expanded lamina is an important physiological process. In these processes, a few kind of meristems cooperate with regulating leaf development. In this work, with transfer sense ASL11, sense ASL38 and antisense ASL15 under 35S promoter to to Arabidopsis (Col-0), we found a series of radial symmetric needle-like rosette leaves. By analyzing the anatomical and the epidermal cell features, our data suggests that in these malformed leaf blades, a few meristem tissues all can be suppressed or accelerated, and normal leaf blade morphology disappears. Pro ASL11:GUS expression further suggests that this process may be triggered by misexpression of a few transcription factors (Tfs)."
"Screening for fibrinolytic filamentous fungi and enzymatic properties of the most potent producer, Aspergillus brasiliensis AUMC 9735","A potential screening programme for fibrinolytic filamentous fungi in the Egyptian environment was done for the first time. The proteolytic activity was positive in 38.5% of isolates, whilst only thirty-four of them were able to produce fibrinolytic enzymes. The two most potent isolates were identified as Aspergillus brasiliensis AUMC 9735 and Aspergillus flavus AUMC 9736. Under submerged culture conditions, the two strains were able to excrete fibrinolytic enzymes, reaching a maximum at 5 and 9 days, respectively. Maximal enzyme productivity by both strains was achieved by lactose and sucrose, respectively. All tested nitrogen sources were stimulatory for enzyme production by both strains, except for ammonium acetate in the case of A. brasiliensis AUMC 9735. Purification of A. brasiliensis AUMC 9735 enzyme increased its specific activity to 83.5-fold with a recovery of 9.1% and molecular weight of 40 kDa. Maximal activity was recorded at pH 8 (stability at pH 6-11). The purified enzyme showed higher thermostability than most fibrinolytic enzymes of filamentous fungi with the midpoint temperature (Tm) value at 60.4°C and the half-life times (t1/2) at 50-80°C being 672.1-6.5 min. Interestingly, the enzyme exhibited a good storage and solvent stability at 4°C for 60 days. Enzyme activity was totally lost in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and was restored after addition of Mg2+ cations suggesting that the enzyme is a metalloprotease and Mg2+ acts as a cofactor. This work reveals the potential of A. brasiliensis and many other fungal strains as an unconventional and unexplored production alternative to already known thrombolytic agents. The value of Egyptian environment as a reservoir of filamentous fungal species with promising biotechnological value could also be highlighted."
Aquatic insects of a lowland rainforest in Papua New Guinea: assemblage structure in relation to habitat type,"Papua New Guinea is one of the most valuable tropical regions but ecological research of its freshwater in¬vertebrates has been lacking. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the species richness, diversity and structure of aquatic insect assemblages in different habitats in the Wanang River catchment in a well-preserved lowland rainforest. Assemblage structure was studied on two spatial scales — in different habitats (river, streams and stagnant pools) and in three mesohabitats in the river (slow and fast sections and submerged wood). The results show that headwater streams had the highest morphospecies diversity, while the river had the highest insect abundance. Slow and fast sections of the river differed both in terms of insect abundance and diversity. Furthermore, a number of unique wood-associated species was found on submerged wood. The most notable feature of the assemblage structure was scarcity of shredders and dominance of predators. However, predatory beetles, bugs and dragonfly larvae exhibited contrasting habitat preferences. This study shows that Papua New Guinean lowland rainforests host diverse and distinctly structured freshwater insect assemblages."

Femtosecond laser-induced confined microexplosion: tool for creation high-pressure phases,"New material phases formed under non-equilibrium conditions at pressures above 100 GPa and temperatures exceeding 104K, the conditions of the warm dense matter (WDM), have become accessible using micro-explosions triggered by ultra-short sub-1 ps pulses tightly focused into micro-volume with cross sections comparable with the wavelength of light. Laser-induced micro-explosions convert a material in a focal volume into a non-equilibrium disordered plasma state confined inside the bulk of pristine crystal. Ultra-high quenching rates overcome kinetic barriers to the formation of new metastable high pressure phases, which are preserved in the surrounding pristine crystal for following recovery and exploitation. Direct laser writing was used to pattern large areas by closely packed arrays of the microexplosion modified sites for structural characterisation of the minute volumes of nano-materials with transmission electron microscopy, diffraction and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The method of ultrafast-laser induced confined microexplosion is demonstrated for modification and creation of new phases in case of bcc-Al inside sapphire, valence change of Fe-ions in olivine, formation of new tetragonal bt8 and st12 phases of silicon, Ge and O separation in GeO2 glass and molecular oxygen formation inside voids at the site of microexplosion inside glasses."
Practical issues related to uterine pathology: in situ and invasive cervical glandular lesions and their benign mimics: emphasis on cytology–histology correlation and interpretive pitfalls,"In situ and invasive neoplastic glandular lesions of the uterine have cytologic correlates that must be distinguished from a variety of benign and reactive conditions. Careful study of the cytologic features allows discrimination in the majority of cases; however, the designation of ‘atypical glandular cells’ is reserved for equivocal cases that cannot be readily resolved. In this article, the cytologic features of endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ and invasive endocervical adenocarcinoma will be presented, highlighting their correlation to the well-known histologic features. Variants of the usual type of endocervical neoplasms that have important clinical and differential diagnostic features, including mucinous adenocarcinoma and clear-cell carcinoma, will be discussed. There are a number of common cytologic mimics of endocervical neoplasms, including tubal metaplasia, directly sampled (abraded) endometrium, and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion involving endocervical glands. The cytologic features of these entities and their differentiation from endocervical neoplasia will be explored. Finally, the role of ancillary studies such as human papillomavirus testing in the management of glandular lesions of the cervix will be integrated into the discussion."

How to deal with unbelievable assertions,"We tackle the problem that arises when an agent receives unbelievable information. Information is unbelievable if it conflicts with the agent’s convictions, that is, what the agent considers knowledge. We propose two solutions based on modifying the information so that it is no longer unbelievable. In one solution, the source and the receiver of the information cooperatively resolve the conflict. For this purpose we introduce a dialogue protocol in which the receiver explains what is wrong with the information by using logical interpolation, and the source produces a new assertion accordingly. If such cooperation is not possible, we propose an alternative solution in which the receiver revises the new piece of information by its own convictions to make it acceptable."
Whooping cough dynamics in Chile (1932–2010): disease temporal fluctuations across a north-south gradient,"The spatial-temporal dynamics of Bordetella pertussis remains as a highly interesting case in infectious disease epidemiology.

Design of the Recovery Trajectory for JAXA Venus Orbiter Akatsuki,"Akatsuki (“dawn” in Japanese) is the JAXA Venus orbiter that was scheduled to enter orbit around Venus on Dec. 7th, 2010. Following the failure of the main engine during the orbit insertion maneuver, the spacecraft escaped Venus on a 200-day orbit around the Sun, only to return in early 2017. This paper presents the design and implementation of the recovery trajectory, which involves perihelion maneuvers to re-encounter Venus in late 2015. Relying only on the onboard propellant, the trajectory rescued the mission by (1) anticipating the beginning of the science phase within the nominal lifetime of the spacecraft, and (2) halving the Δv requirements for the orbit insertion maneuver. Several trajectories are designed with an innovative use of a technique called non-tangent V-Infinity Leveraging Transfers (VILTs). Candidate solutions are then recomputed in higher fidelity models, and one solution is finally selected for its low Δv requirements and for programmatic reasons. The results of the perihelion maneuver campaign are also presented."

Agreement between routine electronic hospital discharge and Scottish Stroke Care Audit (SSCA) data in identifying stroke in the Scottish population,"In Scotland all non-obstetric, non-psychiatric acute inpatient and day case stays are recorded by an administrative hospital discharge database, the Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR01). The Scottish Stroke Care Audit (SSCA) collects data from all hospitals managing acute stroke in Scotland to support and improve quality of stroke care. The aim was to assess whether there were discrepancies between these data sources for admissions from 2010 to 2011."
Incorporating shared savings programs into primary care: from theory to practice,"In several countries, health care policies gear toward strengthening the position of primary care physicians. Primary care physicians are increasingly expected to take accountability for overall spending and quality. Yet traditional models of paying physicians do not provide adequate incentives for taking on this new role. Under a so-called shared savings program physicians are instead incentivized to take accountability for spending and quality, as the program lets them share in cost savings when quality targets are met. We provide a structured approach to designing a shared savings program for primary care, and apply this approach to the design of a shared savings program for a Dutch chain of primary care providers, which is currently being piloted."
Differences in medical schools’ regional retention of physicians by school type and year of establishment: effect of new schools built under government policy,Physician maldistribution is an ongoing concern globally. The extent of medical schools retaining graduates within their geographical areas has rarely been explored in Japan or in other countries. This study aimed to investigate whether the proportion of medical school graduates practicing in the vicinity of medical school (retention rate) differs by the year of the school’s establishment and by the school’s funding source.
On finite dimensional Jacobian algebras,"We show that Jacobian algebras arising from every tagged triangulation of a sphere with n-punctures, with \(n\ge 5\), are finite dimensional algebras. We consider also a family of cyclically oriented quivers and we prove that, for any primitive potential, the associated Jacobian algebra is finite dimensional."
Algorithm of computing verbal relationships for generating Vietnamese paragraph of summarization from the logical expression of discourse representation structure,"This paper presents an important phase of our new approach for summarizing the given Vietnamese paragraph. The central of this phase is an algorithm for computing verbal relationships in the process of generating the Vietnamese paragraph from the logical expression of discourse representation structure (DRS), which is the first-order logic expressions without explicit quantifiers, and represents the meaning as well as reflects the potential contexts of a given discourse or a sequence of sentences. By defining elements to describe the appropriate information in each predicate of the logical expression (or can be called “DRS-conditions”), the algorithm is based on in turn considering three consecutive predicates in a logical expression for determining: the relationship between the first and second sentence, the relationship between the second and third sentence, and the priority when comparing these two relationships. The evaluation achieves two given criteria: the semantic completeness of summarization, and the natural quality of new reduced paragraph."
Classification of follicular lymphoma: the effect of computer aid on pathologists grading,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is one of the most common lymphoid malignancies in the western world. FL cases are stratified into three histological grades based on the average centroblast count per high power field (HPF).

Although this is the current clinical practice, it suffers from high inter- and intra-observer variability and is vulnerable to sampling bias."
Numerical solutions of a mathematical model of blood flow in the deforming porous channel using radial basis function collocation method,"In this paper, a mathematical model 
describing blood flow in the deforming porous channel is solved numerically. The blood flow is considered as a micropolar fluid flow. The governing system of nonlinear partial differential equations is reduced to a nonlinear system of ordinary boundary value problem by using some suitable similar transformations. An efficient numerical technique based on the integration radial basis function process, IRBF, coupled with collocation method is performed to approximate the solution of the boundary value problem. Numerical results are presented through the figures and tables to demonstrate efficiency, accuracy, and convergence of the method. Moreover, the effects of various embedded model parameters such as expansion ratio, slip coefficient and others on flow velocity profiles have been explained graphically."

Dielectric properties of 0.95(Mg0.98Zn0.02)TiO3–0.05CaTiO3 ceramic sintered by calcium borosilicate glass ceramic doping,"The effect of calcium borosilicate (CBS) glass ceramic on the phase formation, the microstructures and the microwave dielectric properties of 0.95(Mg0.98Zn0.02)TiO3–0.05CaTiO3 (MZCT) ceramics prepared via the conventional solid-state reaction route were investigated. It has been found that (Mg0.98Zn0.02)TiO3 and CaTiO3 are the main phases and a second phase (Mg0.98Zn0.02)Ti2O5 appeared in MZCT ceramics doped with CBS glass. As the content of CBS glass increased, the second phase (Mg0.98Zn0.02)Ti2O5 further enhanced. Appropriate CBS glass addition could effectively facilitate sintering of the ceramics, and well-densified microwave ceramics with uniform grains could be obtained under 1240 °C.

"Effects of resource pulses on nutrient availability, ecosystem productivity, and temporal variability following a stochastic disturbance in eutrophic glacial lakes","Hypoxia in shallow lakes represents a stochastic disturbance that may elicit a resource pulse through fish decomposition, altering nutrient availability and temporal variability of ecosystem productivity. We measured nutrient availability, primary and secondary production, and temporal variability from April through September in no, moderate, and high carrion lakes following winter 2007–2008 and used a repeated-measures ANOVA and impact trend-by-time analyses to evaluate how increasing levels of fish carrion influence recipient ecosystems. Lakes with carrion had higher nutrient concentrations, pH, turbidity, chlorophyll-a, and zooplankton and benthic invertebrates and less periphyton compared to no carrion lakes. Phytoplankton was positively related to carrion biomass but the association diminished through time suggesting recovery from the initial nutrient pulse. In contrast, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, turbidity, and macroinvertebrates were positively related to carrion biomass and the slope increased throughout the summer suggesting an increasing pulse effect through time. Initially, zooplankton density was negatively related to carrion biomass but then became positively related to carrion biomass. Regression slope between zooplankton and carrion biomass peaked in June before decreasing in late summer, suggesting recovery from the pulse. Combined, our results suggest that nutrients released during fish decomposition following stochastic disturbances represent an important pulse in eutrophic lakes that further enriches productivity."
General Decay Rate for Nonlinear Thermoviscoelastic System with a Weak Damping and Nonlinear Source Term,"In this paper, we consider a nonlinear system of thermoviscoelastic with a nonlinear boundary damping and nonlinear source, in a bounded domain Ω, under appropriate assumptions imposed on relaxation function and with certain initial data, we establish the general decay rate of the solution energy, from which the usual exponential and polynomial decay are only special cases. This work generalizes and improves earlier results in the literature."
The EU and The Human Right to Water and Sanitation: Normative Coherence as the Key to Transformative Development,"The year 2015 is supposed to be a seminal moment in the international sustainable development agenda. World leaders are negotiating the Sustainable Development Goals Agenda and the European Union has declared 2015 to be the ‘European Year for Development’. The Post-2015 agenda is supposed to be characterized by more ‘transformative’ development strategies. Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) is considered to be an important tool for the establishment of ‘transformative’ development. This article examines EU development programmes in the field of water. It contends that even though the EU is a world leader in global water and sanitation programmes, its approach to development is not coherent with transformative change because these strategies employ PCD as a technical policy tool. Instead, the article contends that transformative development requires ‘normative coherence for development’ defined as coherence between strategies in development and non-development policy arenas and core democratic norms, such as human rights."
A Perfect Post-2015 Partner? Analysing EU’s Development and Trade Agendas for Global Development Partnership,"This article discusses the EU’s commitment to the achievement of international development goals from a policy coherence perspective. In particular, it looks at the ways in which the Union has contributed to the targets of global partnership for development (MDG-8) with its own initiatives on development financing and international trade with poorer countries. The article utilises the MDG-8 and its targets as a reference for policy coherence and takes stock of their implementation by the EU. In addition, it discusses prospects for the EU’s role in the post-2015 period in this regard. The article argues that the EU’s implementation of the MDG-8 has been insufficient and uneven. It also highlights the need for an impartial frame of reference for PCD based on concrete indicators. This would also help the EU to reinforce its approach to PCD and to act as a global partner."
"The European Union and Policy Coherence for Development: Reforms, Results, Resistance","This article discusses the trajectory of policy coherence for development (PCD) in the European Union (EU). In particular, it argues that the strong focus on institutional mechanisms, conceived as a way of overcoming different types of resistance, has had the effect that results achieved have by no means been commensurate with the expectations raised by the various reforms launched over the years. EU Member States have paid lip service to the importance of PCD without translating commitments into more coherent (national and supranational) policies. Moroever, an analysis of the Impact Assessment (IA) – one of the key mechanisms to promote PCD at EU level – prepared for the reform of the EU’s agricultural and fisheries policies in 2011–2013 shows how bureaucratic arrangements have substantially failed to clarify the real impact of EU policies on (different types of) developing countries. The conclusion is that successful promotion of PCD is more than just having the right arguments and ensuring sufficient technical support, but is first and foremost a political undertaking."
Application of the double kernel density approach to the multivariate analysis of attributeless event point datasets,"Attributeless event point datasets (AEPDs) are datasets composed of discrete events or observations defined by their geographical location only and lacking any other additional attributes. Examples of such datasets include spotted criminal events, road accidents and residential locations of disease patients. A commonly used approach to the analysis of such datasets involves their aggregation into predefined areal units, such as neighborhoods or census tracts. However, this approach does not perform effectively when the events of interests are geographically localized and the number of areal units available for aggregation is small. An alternative approach to the analysis of AEPDs is based on double kernel density (DKD) smoothing, according to which events of interest are transformed into continuous density surfaces and then normalized by the density of the entire population from which the events of interest are drawn. In the present study, the applicability of the DKD approach to multivariate analysis is tested for estimation consistency, sensitivity to the number of input observations and potential bias attributed to the spatial dependency of neighboring observations. Our analysis indicates that the DKD approach provides reasonably stable and consistent estimates, if the following three preconditions are met: (a) the kernel estimation parameters are properly defined, (b) the number of reference points, used for transformation of continuous DKD surfaces into discrete observations, is sufficiently large, and (c) the spatial dependency of neighboring observations is taken into account using spatial analysis tools."
"Primary intracranial soft tissue sarcomas in children, adolescents, and young adults: single institution experience and review of the literature","There is a paucity of literature reporting the outcome of intracranial sarcomas (IS) in children, adolescents, and young adults (CAYA). A multimodal therapeutic approach is commonly used, with no well-established treatment consensus. We conducted a retrospective review of CAYA with IS, treated at our institution, to determine their clinical findings, treatments, and outcomes. Immunohistochemistry (PDGFRA and EGFR) and DNA sequencing were performed on 5 tumor samples. A literature review of IS was also conducted. We reviewed 13 patients (median age, 7 years) with a primary diagnosis of IS between 1990 and 2015. Diagnoses included unclassified sarcoma (n = 9), chondrosarcoma (n = 2), and rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 2). Five patients underwent upfront gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor. The 5-drug regimen (vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and ifosfamide) was the most common treatment used. Nine patients died due to progression or recurrence (n = 8) or secondary malignancy (n = 1). The median follow-up period of the 4 surviving patients was 1.69 years (range 1.44–5.17 years). The 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 21 and 44 %, respectively. BRAF, TP53, KRAS, KIT, ERBB2, MET, RET, ATM, and EGFR mutations were detected in 4 of the 5 tissue samples. All 5 samples were immunopositive for PDGFRA, and only 2 were positive for EGFR. IS remain a therapeutic challenge due to high progression and recurrence rates. Collaborative multi-institutional studies are warranted to delineate a treatment consensus and investigate tumor biology to improve the disease outcome."
Histological and Histochemical Observations on Mast Cell and Glands in Chronic Tonsillitis,"Mast cell take active part in immune system of body, clinical manifestations are closely related to hypersensitivity. Reactions and potent biological mediators released by these cells are responsible for different clinical manifestation like allergic reaction. Frequent and important sites of these allergic reactions occur in—upper aero digestive tract, nasal, pharyngeal and respiratory allergies. The study aims to demonstrate different types of heparin in mast cells having role in tonsillitis. Present work is to study distribution and histochemical nature of mast cells in human palatine tonsil in patients suffering from chronic tonsillitis. 20 cases were studied during the study. Diagnosis was done on clinical criteria—Anterior pillar flushing. Expulsion of cheesy material from the tonsillar crypts on pressing with tongue depressor. Palpable jugulodigastric group of lymph nodes. Dissected Tonsillar material fixed into fixative—staining done. For qualitative histological observation Harris Haemotoxylene with eosin used as counter stain. Normal Histological study of mast cell like size, shape, granules were done. Distribution of mast cells in different parts of Tonsillar Tissue was observed. Histochemical study of mast cells to determine nature of reactive substance was done. Tonsil contains mucous glands, no granular tissue in present study of chronic inflammatory reactions feasible in form of fibrosis, lymphatic infiltration in epithelium. Morphology of mast cells with toluidine blue at pH 2 and 4.4 gave better picture. Mast cells had varied shape and size in different places and points of same field of focus, oval, elongated, fusiform, pleomorphic in shape. Nucleus is central ill-defined masked by granules. Cytoplasm contains mast cell granules that stained blue with Alcian blue stain, purple to bluish purple with toluidine blue. Distribution of mast cells in present study: Mast cells were found at all places mostly concentrated at capsules. Lamina propria-1–2/hpf, capsule-4–5/hpf, connective tissue septa-1–2/hpf. Histochemical Feature- In present study, histochemical study remained confined to connective tissue septa of mast cells and biochemical nature of Heparin contained in it. In present work, the identification of mast cells is based on metachromatic reactions of its granules with acidified toluidine blue at pH 2 and buffered toluidine blue at pH 4.4 to identify mast cell granules containing higher and lower sulphates of heparin."
Adrenal congestion preceding adrenal hemorrhage on CT imaging: a case series,"Adrenal hemorrhage is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening condition, particularly in cases of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage causing primary adrenal insufficiency. It is difficult to diagnose clinically, particularly in critically ill patients, given its non-specific symptoms and signs, which include abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, weakness, hypotension, and altered conscious state. Non-traumatic adrenal hemorrhage has been observed to occur in times of physiological stress, such as post-surgery, sepsis, burns, and hypotension. This is hypothesized to be due to a combination of increased arterial blood flow to the adrenal glands, the paucity of draining adrenal venules and adrenal vein thrombosis, leading to intra-glandular vascular congestion and subsequent hemorrhage."
Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the liver in assessing chronic liver disease: effects of the presence and the degree of ascites on ADC values,The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between the liver and spleen apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of patients with chronic liver disease and the presence and the degree of ascites.
Spectroelectrochemical study of salicylate in alkaline medium,"An extensive comprehension of the salicylate electro-oxidation process is an important matter to allow the design of efficient techniques for the treatment of domestic and industrial sewage using advanced oxidation processes, as well as for its detection as an environmental pollutant in rivers, lakes, and watersheds. In this work, the oxidation of salicylate is studied in alkaline medium using cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and cyclic voltabsorptometry (DCVA). Moreover, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to characterize the reaction products formed during the electrolysis on chronoamperometric measurements. The time-derivative cyclic voltabsorptomogram was obtained at a characteristic wavelength to allow the comparison with its cyclic voltammogram. The oxidation peak obtained from the cyclic voltammetry corresponds to a decarboxylation process involving an electron and generating phenoxy radicals, which are stabilized by dimerization. The monitoring by DCVA showed the formation of an electrolysis product identified as 2,2′ –biphenyldiol, which allowed the proposition of an EC reaction mechanism composed by one electrochemical step followed by a chemical one."
"CT differentiation between tubo-ovarian and appendiceal origin of right lower quadrant abscess: CT, clinical, and laboratory correlation","To investigate which clinical, laboratory, and CT findings potentially facilitate the differential diagnosis between tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) and periappendicular abscess (PAA), we retrospectively reviewed abdominal CT examinations and medical records for all women who presented to our medical center with unilateral right pelvic abscess formation who underwent CT evaluation from 2004–2014. A wide spectrum of clinical data and imaging findings were recorded. CT diagnoses were made in consensus by two experienced body radiologists blinded to the final diagnosis. Findings associated with the infections were compared using the chi-square (χ2) or the Fisher exact test. Ninety-one patients were included; 58 with PAA (mean age 46 years) and 33 with TOA (mean age 37 years). Pain on cervical motion (67 %) and vaginal discharge (21 %) were significantly more common in TOA; other clinical signs were similar. The presence of right ovarian vein entering the mass on CT had 100 % specificity and 94 % sensitivity to TOA. Distended right fallopian tube (79 %), mass posterior to mesovarium (76 %), contralateral pelvic fat stranding (55 %), and thickening of sacrouterine ligaments (55 %) were significantly more common in TOA. Positive ""arrowhead sign"" (91 %), mesenteric lymphadenopathy (85 %), small bowel wall thickening (55 %), fluid in the right paracolic gutter (50 %), and cecal wall thickening (48 %) were significantly more common in PAA;internal gas was revealed only in PAA (33 %). Distinct CT features can increase diagnostic certainty regarding the origin of right lower quadrant abscess in women."
Characteristics of the Energetic Igniters Through Integrating Al/NiO Nanolaminates on Cr Film Bridge,"The energetic igniters through integrating Al/NiO nanolaminates on Cr film bridges have been investigated in this study. The microstructures demonstrate well-defined geometry and sharp interfaces. The depth profiles of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of Al/NiO nanolaminates annealed at 550 °C with a bilayer thickness of 250 nm show that the interdiffusion between the Al layer and NiO layer has happened and the annealing temperature cannot provide enough energy to make the diffusion process much more complete. The electrical explosion characteristics employing a capacitor discharge firing set at the optimized charging voltage of 40 V show that the flame duration time is about 700 μs, and an excellent explosion performance is obtained for (Al/NiO)n/Cr igniters with a bilayer thickness of 1000 nm."
Speaker Identification in a Shouted Talking Environment Based on Novel Third-Order Circular Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models,"It is well known that speaker identification yields very high performance in a neutral talking environment; on the other hand, the performance has been sharply declined in a shouted talking environment. This work aims at proposing, implementing, and evaluating novel third-order circular suprasegmental hidden Markov models (CSPHMM3s) to improve the low performance of text-independent speaker identification in a shouted talking environment. CSPHMM3s possess combined characteristics of: Circular Hidden Markov models, third-order hidden Markov models (HMM3s), and suprasegmental hidden Markov models (SPHMMs). Our results show that CSPHMM3s are superior to each of: first-order left-to-right suprasegmental hidden Markov models (LTRSPHMM1s), second-order left-to-right suprasegmental hidden Markov models (LTRSPHMM2s), third-order left-to-right suprasegmental hidden Markov models (LTRSPHMM3s), first-order circular suprasegmental hidden Markov models (CSPHMM1s), and second-order circular suprasegmental hidden Markov models (CSPHMM2s) in a shouted talking environment. Using our collected speech database, average speaker identification performance in a shouted talking environment based on LTRSPHMM1s, LTRSPHMM2s, LTRSPHMM3s, CSPHMM1s, CSPHMM2s, and CSPHMM3s is 74.6, 78.4, 81.7, 78.7, 83.4, and 85.8 %, respectively. Speaker identification performance that has been achieved based on CSPHMM3s is close to that attained based on subjective assessment by human listeners."

Self-identification and management of hand-foot syndrome (HFS): effect of a structured teaching program on patients receiving capecitabine-based chemotherapy for colon cancer,"Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of 5–fluorouracil and is commonly used oral chemotherapeutic drugs for advanced gastric and colorectal cancer. However, hand-foot syndrome (HFS) has high incidence, and once developed, the symptoms significantly impair quality of life (QOL), leading to a reduction in the dosage or discontinuation of the treatment. Effective health education should be offered to patients to promote self-identification and management on how to recognize HFS and use self-management techniques at the very beginning of chemotherapy."
Use of a Computerized Reading and Writing Teaching Program for Families of Students with Intellectual Disabilities,"Family can be an important educational agent if it has the tools to teach its members. This study investigated the effectiveness of a computerized reading and writing teaching program applied with students with intellectual disabilities in their own residences, having their family members as monitors. The program included positive teaching techniques, such as ongoing feedback and gradual progression according to the student’s performance. The teaching tasks included matching dictated with printed words and pictures and also constructing printed words from constituent letters and syllables. All students began the program with less than 20 % correct responses in naming words on pretest trials. The posttest results showed an average of 89.3 % of correct responses for teaching words and 52 % correct responses for generalization words. These results indicate that in-home implementation of this program by families can be a promising teaching approach for students with intellectual disabilities."

Differential association of lead on length by zinc status in two-year old Mexican children,"Blood lead levels have decreased in Mexico since leaded fuel was banned in 1997, but other sources remain, including the use of lead-glazed ceramics for food storage and preparation. Zinc deficiency is present in almost 30 % of children aged 1–2 years. Previous studies have documented negative associations of both lead exposure and zinc deficiency with stature, but have not considered the joint effects. Given that the prevalence of stunting in pre-school aged children was 13.6 % in 2012, the aim of this study was to evaluate if the relationship between blood lead and child stature was modified by zinc status."
The beneficial effects of TAVI in mitral insufficiency,"Previous studies have suggested that concomitant mitral regurgitation (MR) is a risk factor for acute transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) failure, but may improve afterwards. Aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, clinical meaning and modifications of MR in patients undergoing TAVI."
Resolved lower limb muscle tone abnormalities in children with HIV encephalopathy receiving standard antiretroviral therapy,This short report arose from a follow-up study of children previously diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalopathy and spastic diplegia and is among the first to describe that increased lower limb muscle tone in children with a confirmed HIV encephalopathy diagnosis may resolve over time in some cases.

MDR-1 and MRP-1 activity in peripheral blood leukocytes of rheumatoid arthritis patients,"Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic disease leading to decreased quality of life with a rather variable response rate to Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs. Methotrexate (MTX) is the gold standard therapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis. The Multidrug resistance Related Protein and Multi Drug Resistance protein 1, also called P-glycoprotein-170 transporters can alter the intracellular concentration of different drugs. Methotrexate is an MRP1 substrate and thus the functional activity of MRP1 might have a clinical impact on the efficiency of the Methotrexate-therapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Antagonist of the neurokinin-1 receptor curbs neuroinflammation in ex vivo and in vitro models of Lyme neuroborreliosis,"Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) can affect both the peripheral (PNS) and the central nervous systems (CNS); it is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. The neuropeptide substance P (SP) is an important mediator of both neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier dysfunction, through its NK1 receptor. Increased levels of SP have been shown to correlate with cell death. The present study used both ex vivo and in vitro models of experimentation to determine if the inflammatory mediator production and concomitant cell death caused by exposure of neural tissues and cells to B. burgdorferi could be attenuated by treatment with a NK1 receptor antagonist."
Modulation of post-stroke degenerative and regenerative processes and subacute protection by site-targeted inhibition of the alternative pathway of complement,"Complement promotes neuroinflammation and injury in models of stroke. However, complement is also being increasingly implicated in repair and regeneration after central nervous system (CNS) injury, and some complement deficiencies have been shown to provide acute, but not subacute, protection after murine stroke. Here, we investigate the dual role of complement in injury and repair after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion."
Ligand engagement of Toll-like receptors regulates their expression in cortical microglia and astrocytes,"Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation on microglia and astrocytes are key elements in neuroinflammation which accompanies a number of neurological disorders. While TLR activation on glia is well-established to up-regulate pro-inflammatory mediator expression, much less is known about how ligand engagement of one TLR may affect expression of other TLRs on microglia and astrocytes."
Acid-sensing ion channel 1a contributes to the effect of extracellular acidosis on NLRP1 inflammasome activation in cortical neurons,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are cation channels which were activated by extracellular acidosis and involved in various physiological and pathological processes in the nervous system. Inflammasome is a key component of the innate immune response in host against harmful and irritable stimuli. As the first discovered molecular platform, NLRP1 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 1) inflammasome is expressed in neurons and implicated in many nervous system diseases such as brain injury, nociception and epilepsy. However, little is known about the effect of ASICs on NLRP1 inflammasome activation under acidosis."

Both are associated with a grave impact on the health related outcomes in this pandemic. This study aimed at determining the prevalence, factors associated and effect on quality of life of DPC among HIV positive patients."
"Spatial modeling of urban sprawl around Greater Bhubaneswar city, India","In developing countries, where urbanization rates are high, urban sprawl is a significant contributor of the land use change. However, characterizing sprawl has become a contentious issue with numerous arguments both for and against the phenomenon. Meanwhile, effective metrics to characterize sprawl in India are required to characterize this. We have attempted to capture urban sprawl over the landscape and hence adopt landscape metrics, entropy and principal component analysis for characterizing sprawling process. The measurement and monitoring of land-use changes in these areas are crucial to government officials and city planners who urgently need updated information for planning and management purposes. This paper examines the use of landscape metrics and entropy in the measurement and monitoring of urban sprawl by the integration of remote sensing and GIS techniques. The advantages of the entropy method are its simplicity and easy integration with GIS. The measurement of entropy is devised based on locational factors-distances from central business district and reveal spatial patterns of urban sprawl. The entropy space can be conveniently used to differentiate various kinds of urban growth patterns. The application of the method in the Bhubaneswar Metropolitan Area, one of the fastest growing and planned cities in India, has demonstrated that it is very useful and effective for the monitoring of urban sprawl. It provides a useful tool for the quantitative measurement that is much needed for rapidly growing regions in identifying the spatial dynamics, variations and changes of urban sprawl patterns."

Non-attendance of mammographic screening: the roles of age and municipality in a population-based Swedish sample,"Inequality in health and health care is increasing in Sweden. Contributing to widening gaps are various factors that can be assessed by determinants, such as age, educational level, occupation, living area and country of birth. A health care service that can be used as an indicator of health inequality in Sweden is mammographic screening. The non-attendance rate is between 13 and 31 %, while the average is about 20 %. This study aims to shed light on three associations: between municipality and non-attendance, between age and non-attendance, and the interaction of municipality of residence and age in relation to non-attendance."
"The \((k,\ell )\)-Rainbow Index of Random Graphs","A tree in an edge-colored graph G is said to be a rainbow tree if no two edges on the tree share the same color. Given two positive integers k, \(\ell \) with \(k\ge 3\), the \((k,\ell )\)
-rainbow index
\(rx_{k,\ell }(G)\) of G is the minimum number of colors needed in an edge-coloring of G such that for any set S of k vertices of G, there exist \(\ell \) internally disjoint rainbow trees connecting S. This concept was introduced by Chartrand et. al., and there have been very few known results about it. In this paper, we establish a sharp threshold function for \(rx_{k,\ell }(G_{n,p})\le k\) and \(rx_{k,\ell }(G_{n,M})\le k,\) respectively, where \(G_{n,p}\) and \(G_{n,M}\) are the usually defined random graphs."
Association between pulmonary function and peak oxygen uptake in elderly: the Generation 100 study,"Although reduced function of the respiratory system limits peak oxygen uptake in diseases affecting the lungs or airways, the healthy respiratory system is thought to have a spare capacity for oxygen transport and uptake, and is not considered a limiting factor for peak oxygen uptake in healthy people. However, lung function declines with age and could theoretically limit peak oxygen uptake in elderly. We examined the association between peak oxygen uptake and lung function indices in an elderly population with the hypothesis that lung function indices would be associated with VO2peak up to a threshold value situated above the lower limits of normal lung function for our population."

The matching energy of G is defined as the sum \(\sum_{i=1}^{n}|\mu_{i}|\). Let \(K_{n-1,1}^{k}\) be the graph obtained from \(K_{1}\cup K_{n-1}\) by adding k edges between \(V(K_{1})\) and \(V(K_{n-1})\). In this paper, we show that \(K_{n-1,1}^{k}\) has the maximum matching energy among the connected graphs with order n and edge connectivity k."
Tectonic effect for establishing a semi-dynamic datum in Southwest Taiwan,"To accommodate the effects of crustal deformation in the current national static geodetic datum (Taiwan Geodetic Datum 1997 (TWD97)) in SW Taiwan, 221 campaign-mode global positioning system (GPS) stations from 2002 to 2010 were used in this study to generate a surface horizontal velocity model for establishing a semi-dynamic datum in SW Taiwan. An interpolation method, Kriging, and a tectonic block model, DEFNODE, were used to construct the surface horizontal velocity model. Forty-four continuous GPS stations were used to examine the performance of the semi-dynamic datum through exterior validation. The average values of the residual errors obtained using the Kriging method for the north and east components are ±1.9 and ±2.2 mm/year, respectively, whereas those obtained using the block model are ±2.0 and ±2.9 mm/year, respectively. The distribution of residuals greater than 5 mm/year for both models generally corresponds to a high strain rate area derived using the horizontal velocity field. In addition, these residuals may result from deep-seated landslide and active folding or mud diapir in a mudstone area. Similar exterior checking results obtained using the Kriging interpolation method and block model for SW Taiwan indicate a high station density and a relatively satisfactory station spatial coverage. However, the block model is superior to the Kriging method due to the consideration of characteristics of the geological structure in the block model. In addition, result from traditional coordinate transformation was used to compare with the semi-dynamic datum. The results indicate that a semi-dynamic datum is a feasible solution for maintaining the accuracy of TWD97 at an appropriate level over time in Taiwan."
"Sustainability in the Face of Institutional Adversity: Market Turbulence, Network Embeddedness, and Innovative Orientation","Drawing from research on strategic choice, this study investigates the relationship between market turbulence and firms’ sustainable behavior, in the context of sustainability-related institutional adversity. It argues that the relationship between market turbulence and sustainability is mediated by network embeddedness, and this mediating role in turn is moderated by a firm’s innovative orientation. Data collected from a sample of Ontario restaurants inform predictions about firms’ propensity to adopt local wines in their portfolios, despite the limited market and normative support that these wines receive compared with imported wines. The study shows that market turbulence enhances sustainable firm behavior, through the development of strong network relationships. Furthermore, the mediating effect of network embeddedness is particularly salient among firms that exhibit a stronger innovative orientation. These findings reveal how and when turbulent market conditions can contribute to a firm’s sustainable behaviors in the presence of limited institutional support for such behaviors."
Utilization of Waste and Under-utilized Pongamia pinnata Seed Oil for Acquiring Maximal Process to Get Ameliorate Yield of Biodiesel Through Response Surface Methodology,"The aim of this study was to use the under-utilized vegetable seed oil and produce high and better yield of biodiesel. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used, based on central composite rotatable design (CCRD), to optimize four trans-esterification reaction variables for getting high yield: catalyst concentration (CC; 0.25–1.0 %), reaction temperature (RT; 45–65 °C), CH3OH-to-oil molar ratio (6:1–12:1) and reaction time (30–90 min). The 24 full factorial CCRD design was applied, using four different parameters at five levels, each lead to 30 experiments to produce Pongamia pinnata oil-methyl esters (POMEs). The molar ratio of CH3OH to oil and RT were the most significant (p < 0.01) factors affecting the yield of POMEs. A linear relationship was recorded between the observed and predicted values (R
2 = 0.9744). Using multiple regression analysis a quadratic polynomial equation was recognized for methyl ester yield (MEY). The quadratic term of CC showed a significant (p < 0.0001) impact on esters yield. The interaction terms of CH3OH to oil molar ratio and CC with reaction time exhibited a +ve effect on the MEY (p < 0.05). The optimum reaction conditions for trans-esterification of oils were 6.1 CH3OH to oil ratio, 1.0 % CC, 65 °C RT and 1:30 h reaction time, resulting in Pongamia oil MEY of 94.88 %. The RSM was found to be a suitable technique for optimizing trans-esterification process and produced fuel was within the ranges of ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards."
Study of the Effects of Process Parameters on Electroforced Sedimentation in Solid–Liquid Separation Using Response Surface Methodology,"Electroforced sedimentation (EFS) is a well-known technique for enhancing the solid content of the final sludge cake. However, the parameters affecting the performance of EFS and quality of the resulting sludge cake, as well as the removed water, are not sufficiently studied. In this research, a mixture of zinc oxide (representing sludge) and polyacrylamide (dewatering aid) were used as experimental materials. The process parameters of electroforced sedimentation were optimized using a design of experiment software (Design Expert
® Version 7.0.0) with a face-centered central composite design (FCCCD) under response surface methodology. An optimization study was carried out for the output response (sedimentation velocity) based on three process factors and an empirical model was developed. The optimized values for current density, total solid volume per unit cross-sectional area and polyacrylamide dose for the highest sedimentation velocity (0.0199 cm/min) were 6.0 A/m2, 7.74 mm and 1.53 % (based on the weight of zinc oxide), respectively. The overall model was significant with Prob > F value of 0.0117 and R
2 value of 0.8911 while the most significant parameter was observed to be the current density with a Prob > F value of 0.0004. Validation experiments were conducted to confirm and measure the accuracy of the models for the three set of parameters including optimum parameters. The error was within the limit of prediction accuracy, and the sedimentation velocity was enhanced by the addition of 1.53 % PAM as dewatering aid. Thus, it was concluded that EFS can be applied successfully for materials having permanent charge."
Utilization of Solid Wastes from Tanneries as Possible Protein Source for Feed Applications: Acute and Sub-acute Toxicological Studies to Assess Safety of Products Prepared from Delimed Tannery Fleshings,Delimed tannery fleshing (DTF) hydrolysates—obtained through acid hydrolysis and fermentation—have the potential for use in poultry and fish feed owing to their protein content and inherent biofunctionalities like antioxidant and antibacterial properties. The objective was to establish the safety of DTF hydrolysates for a possible use as feed supplement.
"Partial substitution of barley for corn: effect on “Hamra” lamb growth performance, carcass and meat characteristics","The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of two kinds of given diets on growth, on some carcass characteristics and on the major meat nutrients of local Algerian sheep breed. The investigated sheep breed called “Hamra” is one of the most famous breeds in Algeria. Among one 106 animals, 40 lambs were selected according to their age, similar livestock characteristics and body weight. The samples were divided into two equal groups: control and experimental lambs according to their live weight; 24.63 ± 0.47 and 24.35 ± 0.64 kg, respectively. Both groups were fed with two varieties of concentrate diets: corn diet based for the first group of control lambs (n = 20) and corn substituted by barley (Variety Saïda 183) for the second experimental group lambs (n = 20). Both diets were supplemented with 200 g straw of barley/animal/ration. The chemical analysis of diets showed an elevated crude fibre content in the commercial concentrate. However, the experimental concentrate contained higher amounts of calcium. After 59 days of fattening, no significant difference was found among the two studied groups on the growth performance (p > 0.05), showing the same final body weight. In contrast, a significant difference was found (p ≤ 0.001) in relation to the cost of the given diet. This could affect the price of the produced meat. At 37.85 ± 0.78 kg live weight, 10 lambs fed with experimental concentrate were slaughtered. The dressing percentage was 46.65 %, with 2.49 % of carcass shrink. Furthermore, an interesting percentage of total muscle was obtained (63.73 %) with a good carcass conformation scoring 9.56. Compared to other breed sheep, Hamra carcass could be considered as the most valuable one economically."
The online knapsack problem with incremental capacity,"We consider an online knapsack problem with incremental capacity. In each time period, a set of items, each with a specific weight and value, is revealed and, without knowledge of future items, it has to be decided which of these items to accept. Additionally, the knapsack capacity is not fully available from the start but increases by a constant amount in each time period. The goal is to maximize the overall value of the accepted items. This setting extends the basic online knapsack problem by introducing a dynamic instead of a static knapsack capacity and is applicable to classic problems such as resource allocation or one-way trading. In contrast to the basic online knapsack problem, for which no competitive algorithms exist, the setting of incremental capacity facilitates the development of competitive algorithms for a bounded time horizon. We provide a competitive analysis of deterministic and randomized online algorithms for the online knapsack problem with incremental capacity and present lower bounds on the competitive ratio achievable by online algorithms for the problem. Most of these lower bounds match the competitive ratios achieved by our online algorithms exactly or differ only by a constant factor."
Spiritual Themes and Challenges in Global Health,"Although the importance of spirituality is increasingly recognized in clinical medicine, spirituality is rarely mentioned in the practice, literature, or training programs of global health. To understand the role of spirituality in global health practice and identify factors that influence and limit its expression, I initiated conversations and informal interviews with more than 300 global health leaders, students, and practitioners during 2010-2014. Four spiritual themes or challenges emerged: compassion at a distance; dichotomous thinking; conspiracy of silence; and compulsion to save the world. Practitioners expressed strong interest in bringing spirituality more fully into global health discourse, which could help the field realize its potential."
Composite time-consistent multi-period risk measure and its application in optimal portfolio selection,"Through the composition of two real-valued functions, we propose a new class of multi-period risk measure which is time consistent. The new multi-period risk measure is monotonous and convex when the two real-valued functions satisfy monotonicity and convexity. Based on this generic framework, we construct a specific class of time-consistent multi-period risk measure by considering the lower partial moment between the realized wealth and the target wealth at individual periods. With the new multi-period risk measure as the objective function, we formulate a multi-period portfolio selection model by considering transaction costs at individual investment periods. Furthermore, this stochastic programming model is transformed into a deterministic programming problem using the scenario tree technology. Finally, we show through empirical tests and comparisons the rationality, practicality and efficiency of our new multi-period risk measure and the corresponding portfolio selection model."
The Long-Term Cost to the UK NHS and Social Services of Different Durations of IV Thiamine (Vitamin B1) for Chronic Alcohol Misusers with Symptoms of Wernicke’s Encephalopathy Presenting at the Emergency Department,"Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE) is an acute neuropsychiatric condition caused by depleted intracellular thiamine, most commonly arising in chronic alcohol misusers, who may present to emergency departments (EDs) for a variety of reasons. Guidelines recommend a minimum 5-day course of intravenous (IV) thiamine in at-risk patients unless WE can be excluded."
US Perspectives in the Management of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis: Patient and Physician Results from the Population-Based Multinational Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (MAPP) Survey,"The Multinational Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (MAPP), a population-based survey of patients, dermatologists, and rheumatologists, was conducted for better understanding of the unmet needs of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients."
Dielectric-Loaded Plasma Filled Helix Traveling Wave Tube Analysis Based on the Linearized Field Theory,"A linear relativistic field theory of a plasma-loaded helix traveling wave tube is presented. The configuration consist of a solid electron beam propagating through a tape helix enclosed within a loss-free wall in which the gap between the helix and the outer wall is filled with a dielectric. The dispersion relation is derived for azimuthally symmetric modes. The effects of dielectric constant, plasma density, axial guide field, and electron beam density on the phase velocity and growth rate were considered numerically. Numerical results indicate that the phase velocity and growth rate increase in the presence of the plasma. Further the growth rate and frequency are maximum at the special value of the dielectric constant. The growth rate increases with axial guide field and remains relatively constant at strong magnetic field, however the growth rate increases considerably by incrementing the electron beam density."
Inhibited proliferation of human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells by xanthinol nicotinate,"Vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation is a key event in the development of hypertension, instant restenosis and other cardiac disorders. Inhibition of this proliferation could lead to better prevention and treatment of these diseases. This study was designed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of different concentrations of xanthinol nicotinate (XN) on human umbilical artery smooth muscle cell (HUASMC) proliferation in vitro. HUASMCs were cultured by the tissue adherent method, passaged three times, and then identified by immunohistochemistry. HUASMCs were then treated with different concentrations of XN (0, 2.76, 27.6 or 276 µM), and a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to detect the inhibition of HUASMC proliferation. The levels of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) mRNA and protein (PDGFR-β) were detected on the cell membrane of these treated HUASMCs using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. After culturing and passaging three times, 90 % of the cultured cells were identified as HUASMCs by immunohistochemistry. HUASMC proliferation was inhibited by XN in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Furthermore, XN dose-dependently decreased the PDGFR mRNA and PDGFR-β levels on the cell membranes of HUASMCs (P < 0.05). Thus, the results suggest that XN could become a potent therapeutic agent for regulating VSMC-associated vascular disease such as cardiovascular disease and restenosis after angioplasty."
"On the Ontology of Spacetime: Substantivalism, Relationism, Eternalism, and Emergence","I present a discussion of some issues in the ontology of spacetime. After a characterisation of the controversies among relationists, substantivalists, eternalists, and presentists, I offer a new argument for rejecting presentism, the doctrine that only present objects exist. Then, I outline and defend a form of spacetime realism that I call event substantivalism. I propose an ontological theory for the emergence of spacetime from more basic entities (timeless and spaceless ‘events’). Finally, I argue that a relational theory of pre-geometric entities can give rise to substantival spacetime in such a way that relationism and substantivalism are not necessarily opposed positions, but rather complementary. In an appendix I give axiomatic formulations of my ontological views."
De novo characterization of the liver transcriptome of javelin goby Synechogobius hasta and analysis of its transcriptomic profile following waterborne copper exposure,"Previous studies have investigated the physiological responses to chronic copper (Cu) exposure in the liver of Synechogobius hasta; however, little information is available on the underlying molecular mechanisms. In an effort to better understand the mechanisms of Cu toxicity and to illuminate global gene expression patterns modulated by Cu exposure, we obtained the liver transcriptome information of S. hasta by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology and also investigated the differential expression of genes following waterborne Cu exposure. Using the Illumina sequencing platform, as many as 60,217 unigenes were generated, with 815 bp of average length and 1298 bp of unigene N50 after filtering and assembly. For functional annotation analysis, 34,860, 31,526, 31,576, 25,808, 11,542, and 21,721 unigenes were annotated to the NR, NT, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, COG, and GO databases, respectively, and total annotation unigenes were 37,764. After 30 days of exposure to 55 μg Cu/l, a total of 292 and 1076 genes were significantly up- and down-regulated, respectively. By KEGG analysis, 660 had a specific pathway annotation. Subsequent bioinformatics analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly related to lipid metabolism, immune system, apoptosis, and signal transduction, suggesting that these signaling pathways may be regulated by Cu exposure. The present study provides comprehensive sequence information for subsequent gene expression studies regarding S. hasta, and the transcriptome profiling after Cu exposure is also expected to improve our understanding of the molecular toxicology of Cu."
Closed-form solutions of the Wheeler–DeWitt equation in a scalar-vector field cosmological model by Lie symmetries,"We apply as selection rule to determine the unknown functions of a cosmological model the existence of Lie point symmetries for the Wheeler–DeWitt equation of quantum gravity. Our cosmological setting consists of a flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker metric having the scale factor a(t), a scalar field with potential function \(V(\phi )\) minimally coupled to gravity and a vector field of its kinetic energy is coupled with the scalar field by a coupling function \(f(\phi )\). Then, the Lie symmetries of this dynamical system are investigated by utilizing the behavior of the corresponding minisuperspace under the infinitesimal generator of the desired symmetries. It is shown that by applying the Lie symmetry condition the form of the coupling function and also the scalar field potential function may be explicitly determined so that we are able to solve the Wheeler–DeWitt equation. Finally, we show how we can use the Lie symmetries in order to construct conservation laws and exact solutions for the field equations."
Cancellation for the multilinear Hilbert transform,"For any natural number k, consider the k-linear Hilbert transform"
Hugoniot equation of state of olivine and its geodynamic implications,"Large olivine samples were hot-pressed synthesized for shock wave experiments. The shock wave experiments were carried out at pressure range between 11 and 42 GPa. Shock data on olivine sample yielded a linear relationship between shock wave velocity D and particle velocity u described by D=3.56(±0.13)+2.57(±0.12)u. The shock temperature is determined by an energy relationship which is approximately 790°C at pressure 28 GPa. Due to low temperature and short experimental duration, we suggest that no phase change occurred in our sample below 30 GPa and olivine persisted well beyond its equilibrium boundary in metastable phase. The densities of metastable olivine are in agreement with the results of static compression. At the depth shallower than 410 km, the densities of metastable olivine are higher than those of the PREM model, facilitating cold slab to sink into the mantle transition zone. However, in entire mantle transition zone, the shock densities are lower than those of the PREM model, hampering cold slab to flow across the “660 km” phase boundary."
CRCT1 regulated by microRNA-520 g inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in esophageal squamous cell cancer,"Cysteine-rich C-terminal 1 (CRCT1) is encoded by the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC), a gene cluster that was recently linked to esophageal cancer. However, the role of CRCT1 in esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. In the present study, we show that CRCT1 is downregulated in ESCC in association with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. Restoring CRCT1 in ESCC cells by lentivirus-mediated gene transfer inhibited cell proliferation and xenograft tumor formation. CRCT1 overexpression promoted ESCC cell apoptosis and upregulated the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. CRCT1 expression was inversely correlated with the levels of microRNA-520 g (miR-520 g) in ESCC tissues, and CRCT1 was identified as a direct target gene of miR-520 g in ESCC cells. Consistent with the effects of CRCT1 overexpression, knockdown of miR-520 g inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in ESCC cells. Our results suggest that CRCT1 functions as a tumor suppressor gene in ESCC and is regulated by miR-520 g, providing potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of ESCC."
Glucose-regulated protein 94 mediates metastasis by CCT8 and the JNK pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Cancer metastasis is a major obstacle in clinical cancer therapy. The mechanisms underlying the metastasis of HCC remain unclear. Glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94) is a key protein involved in mediating cancer progression, and it is highly expressed in HCC specimens. However, the role of GRP94 in cancer metastasis is unclear. A specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was employed to knock down GRP94 gene expression in HCC cell lines. Wound-healing migration, transwell migration, and invasion assays were performed to determine the migration and invasive ability of HCC cells. We demonstrated that silencing GRP94 inhibited HCC cell wound healing, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, our findings indicated that GRP94 knockdown might attenuate HCC cell metastasis by inhibiting CCT8/c-Jun/EMT signaling. Our study indicated that silencing GRP94 significantly reduced the migration and invasion abilities of HCC cells. Moreover, depleting GRP94 inhibited cell migration and invasion by downregulating CCT8/c-Jun signaling. Thus, our data suggest that the GRP94/CCT8/c-Jun/EMT signaling cascade might be a new therapeutic target for HCC."
MiR-214 suppressed ovarian cancer and negatively regulated semaphorin 4D,"Ovarian cancer is one of the most common human malignancies in women. MiR-214 and semaphorin 4D (sema 4D) were found to be abhorrently expressed and involved in the progress of several kinds of malignant cancers. This study is aimed to investigate the cellular role of miR-214 and demonstrate that miR-214 negatively regulated sema 4D in ovarian cancer cells. The data showed that miR-214 expression was consistently lower in ovarian cancer tissues and cells than those in the normal controls. Over-expression of miR-214 in ovarian cancer SKOV-3 cells inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. It was suggested that miR-214 functioned as the tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that miR-214 possibly regulated sema 4D by binding the sema 4D messenger RNA (mRNA) 3′-untranslated region (UTR). Sema 4D mRNA and protein levels were up-regulated in ovarian cancer tissues and SKOV-3 cells. Up-regulation of miR-214 in SKOV-3 cell line suppressed the sema 4D expression in both protein and nucleic acid levels. While, down-regulation of miR-214 in SKOV-3 cells would increase sema 4D protein and nucleic acid expression levels. The effects of miR-214 up- and down-regulation on luciferase activities of wild-type (WT) sema 4D 3′-UTR were completely removed upon introduction of mutation in 3′-UTR of WT sema 4D. Therefore, the data also demonstrated that sema 4D was the direct target of miR-214 and was negatively regulated by miR-214 in ovarian cancer cells."
WRKY6 restricts Piriformospora indica-stimulated and phosphate-induced root development in Arabidopsis,"Arabidopsis root growth is stimulated by Piriformospora indica, phosphate limitation and inactivation of the WRKY6 transcription factor. Combinations of these factors induce unexpected alterations in root and shoot growth, root architecture and root gene expression profiles."
Cortical neuron activation induced by electromagnetic stimulation: a quantitative analysis via modelling and simulation,"Previous simulation works concerned with the mechanism of non-invasive neuromodulation has isolated many of the factors that can influence stimulation potency, but an inclusive account of the interplay between these factors on realistic neurons is still lacking. To give a comprehensive investigation on the stimulation-evoked neuronal activation, we developed a simulation scheme which incorporates highly detailed physiological and morphological properties of pyramidal cells. The model was implemented on a multitude of neurons; their thresholds and corresponding activation points with respect to various field directions and pulse waveforms were recorded. The results showed that the simulated thresholds had a minor anisotropy and reached minimum when the field direction was parallel to the dendritic-somatic axis; the layer 5 pyramidal cells always had lower thresholds but substantial variances were also observed within layers; reducing pulse length could magnify the threshold values as well as the variance; tortuosity and arborization of axonal segments could obstruct action potential initiation. The dependence of the initiation sites on both the orientation and the duration of the stimulus implies that the cellular excitability might represent the result of the competition between various firing-capable axonal components, each with a unique susceptibility determined by the local geometry. Moreover, the measurements obtained in simulation intimately resemble recordings in physiological and clinical studies, which seems to suggest that, with minimum simplification of the neuron model, the cable theory-based simulation approach can have sufficient verisimilitude to give quantitatively accurate evaluation of cell activities in response to the externally applied field."
The Effect of Strontium on the Strength of Layers of Double Oxide Film Defects,"The change in the strength of layers of oxide film (bifilm) defects when held in Al-0.05 and 0.1 wt pct melts was evaluated indirectly by comparing the porosity, average pore roundness, and pore number density results obtained from a reduced pressure test of the commercial purity and Sr-containing Al melts subjected to different holding and vibration regimes. Any changes in the composition of the pores were also studied using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The results showed that the Al2O3 layers of a newly formed oxide film defect, when held in Al-0.05 or 0.1 wt pct Sr melt, transformed gradually into an Sr-containing oxide. This transformation caused the strength of the oxide layers to increase and the rate of the expansion of its atmosphere and removal of the defect from the melt to decrease. This might influence the increase in the porosity of Sr-modified Al castings."
An Approach to Assess the Safety of ADS-B-based Unmanned Aerial Systems: Data Integrity as a Safety Issue,"The increasing demand for the use of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in various social and economic applications has pressed aviation authorities to draw up rules and regulations in order to allow such aircraft to fly in non-segregated airspace. However, issues related to the safety of air traffic operations arise when considering the possibility of both manned and unmanned aircraft coexisting. Thus, surveillance plays a key role in monitoring and controlling air traffic in new scenarios. The positional information provided by the Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B), originally designed to improve situational awareness for pilots and support controllers in air traffic management, interacts with the Sense and Avoid Systems (S&AS) of the UAS in order to avoid exposure to events of loss of minima separation distances and collisions. As positional information is essential to UASs control systems operation, parameters such as accuracy and integrity reflect the correctness and trustworthiness of this information. This paper presents a qualitative approach to assess safety when using ADS-B systems integrated with UASs in aeronautical operations considering the influence of data integrity as a safety-related parameter. In addition, the possibility of using a methodology previously applied on manned systems for assessing safety on UASs is discussed. A new testing platform (PIpE-SEC) is presented as a possible approach for this safety evaluation."
"Quick Fabrication and Thermoelectric Properties 
of Cu12Sb4S13 Tetrahedrite","Tetrahedrites, comprised mainly of earth-abundant and environment-friendly elements, copper and sulfur, may pave the way to many new and low-cost thermoelectric energy generation opportunities. However, the preparation of tetrahedrites is time- and energy-consuming. In this paper, we study the melting process and the effect of the annealing time on the microstructure and thermoelectric properties of the Cu12Sb4S13 tetrahedrite, in an effort to shorten the synthesis (melting and annealing) time. Our results show that the Cu12Sb4S13 tetrahedrite phase forms in the melt during cooling. Shortening the melting time does not affect the formation of Cu12Sb4S13. The cooled ingot consists of the principal phase of Cu12Sb4S13 and two secondary phases, Cu3SbS4 and CuSbS2. It is found that prolonged annealing cannot eliminate the impurity phases in Cu12Sb4S13 tetrahedrite, has a small effect on the electrical resistivity, and a negligible effect on the Seebeck coefficient and the thermal conductivity of the tetrahedrite. All our samples have a ZT above 0.47 at 600 K and the maximum ZT obtained was 0.52 when the sample was annealed for 1 day. Based on our experimental results, the time for preparing the Cu12Sb4S13 tetrahedrite can be considerably shortened."
"Effect of Capping on Electrical and Optical Properties 
of GaN Layers Grown by HVPE","Gallium nitride, grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy and capped with a thin AlGaN layer, was studied by photoluminescence (PL) methods. The concentration of free electrons in GaN was found from the time-resolved PL data, and the concentrations of point defects were estimated from the steady-state PL measurements. The intensity of PL from GaN decreases moderately after capping it with Si-doped AlGaN, and it decreases dramatically after capping with Mg-doped AlGaN. At the same time, the concentration of free electrons and the concentrations of main radiative defects in GaN are not affected by the AlGaN capping. We demonstrate that PL is a powerful tool for nondestructive characterization of semiconductor layers buried under overlying device structures."
Duodenal-Jejunal Bypass Preferentially Elevates Serum Taurine-Conjugated Bile Acids and Alters Gut Microbiota in a Diabetic Rat Model,"Bile acids (BAs) have emerged as important signaling molecules in regulating metabolism and are closely related to gut microbiota. Bariatric surgery elevates serum BAs and affects gut microbiota universally. However, the specific profiles of postsurgical BA components and gut microbiota are still controversial. The aim of this study is to investigate the serum profiles of BA components and gut microbiota after duodenal-jejunal bypass (DJB)."
"Trends in Bariatric Surgery: Procedure Selection, Revisional Surgeries, and Readmissions","There are limited data quantifying national trends, post-operative readmissions, and revisional surgeries for bariatric procedures. We hypothesized that there is a trend away from Roux en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric bands (LAGB) in favor of vertical sleeve gastrectomies (VSG). We hypothesized that VSG was associated with fewer revisions and readmissions, and that demographics and comorbidities were associated with surgery received."
Dielectric properties of 0.95(Mg0.98Zn0.02)TiO3–0.05CaTiO3 ceramic sintered by calcium borosilicate glass ceramic doping,"The effect of calcium borosilicate (CBS) glass ceramic on the phase formation, the microstructures and the microwave dielectric properties of 0.95(Mg0.98Zn0.02)TiO3–0.05CaTiO3 (MZCT) ceramics prepared via the conventional solid-state reaction route were investigated. It has been found that (Mg0.98Zn0.02)TiO3 and CaTiO3 are the main phases and a second phase (Mg0.98Zn0.02)Ti2O5 appeared in MZCT ceramics doped with CBS glass. As the content of CBS glass increased, the second phase (Mg0.98Zn0.02)Ti2O5 further enhanced. Appropriate CBS glass addition could effectively facilitate sintering of the ceramics, and well-densified microwave ceramics with uniform grains could be obtained under 1240 °C. An extremely high Q × f of 59,200 GHz together with an ε

r
 of 21.42 and a τ

 value of −2.1 ppm/°C could be found for 0.95(Mg0.98Zn0.02)TiO3–0.05CaTiO3 specimen with 4 wt% CBS glass addition sintered at 1240 °C for 2 h. This study shows that appropriate addition of CBS glass could effectively decrease the sintering temperature of MZCT ceramics without deteriorating the ceramic performance."

In-liquid characterization of in-plane and high order out-of-plane modes of AlN-based square microplates,"We report on the characterization of in-plane and out-of-plane modes of vibration for various piezoelectric, aluminium nitride-actuated, square microplates with optimized excitation electrodes. We combined electrical and optical techniques to fully characterize the modes of vibration in different media, with special attention to the modes with the highest quality factor in liquid. An electronic speckle pattern interferometry technique was used for a full 3D detection of the movement of the microplates, allowing a precise identification of the modal shape, even under liquid immersion. The electrical characterization was carried out with an impedance analyser. Quality factors as high as 15,000 were obtained in vacuum, for an in-plane mode at 3.93 MHz, and as high as 144 in isopropanol, for a high order out-of-plane mode at 3.63 MHz."
Properties of ScxAl1-xN (x = 0.27) thin films on sapphire and silicon substrates upon high temperature loading,"Scandium Aluminum Nitride thin films (ScxAl1-xN) are attracting more and more attention for micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) because of significantly increased piezoelectric constants compared to pure AlN. This work provides a comprehensive study of thermal annealing effects on ScxAl1-xN (x = 27 %) films synthesized via DC magnetron sputter deposition at nominally unheated Silicon and Sapphire substrates. Compared to the “as deposited” state increasing c-axis orientation and crystalline quality upon annealing up to 1000 °C of films with mixed crystallographic orientation is observed via X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy based analyses. Also the piezoelectric coefficient d
33 of ScxAl1-xN on Si shows increasing values at enhanced annealing temperatures. However, the improved piezoelectric properties are accompanied by both increased leakage currents and loss tangent values."
Novel nano polymeric system containing biosynthesized core shell silver/silica nanoparticles for functionalization of cellulosic based material,"An innovative strategy for functional finishing of cellulosic based materials is based on the incorporation of a thin layer of surface modifying systems (SMS) in the form of stimuli-sensitive nanogels containing combining metal nanoparticles and silica. The silver–silica core–shell nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by simple one pot chemical method. Silica/silver nanoparticles have been synthesized using low concentration of dextran as reducing and stabilizing agent and using ascorbic acid as antioxidant agent. The core–shell NPs were characterized for their structural, morphological, compositional and optical behaviour using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Stimuli-responsive nanogel was prepared by copolymerization of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) with pullulan, results in a nanogel that is responsive to both temperature and pH, the nano-particulate hydrogel of poly-NiPAAm-pullulan copolymer was synthesized using surfactant-free emulsion method. The prepared nano-particles were used during the preparation steps of the pullulan nanogel to obtain nanogel/combining metal/silica NPs to produce a composite materials. The nanoparticle size in dry (collapsed) state is estimated at 250 nm by SEM and TEM, and effect of temperature and pH on gel-nanoparticles was investigated by DLS and UV–vis spectrophotometry. The incorporation of the nanoparticles to cellulosic material was done by a simple pad dry-cure procedure from aqueous nanoparticle dispersion that contained a cross-linking agent. This application method provided sufficient integrity to coating by maintaining the responsiveness of surface modifying system. The stimuli responsiveness of modified cellulosic materials has been confirmed in terms of regulating its water uptake in dependence of pH and temperature."

"Faith-Based Hospitals and Variation in Psychiatric Inpatient Length of Stay in California, 2002–2011","We examined current treatment patterns at faith-based hospitals. Psychiatric discharges from all community-based hospitals in California were obtained for 2002–2011 and a Behavioral Model of Health Services Utilization approach used to study hospital religious affiliation and length of stay (LOS). During 10 years there were 1,976,893 psychiatric inpatient discharges, of which 14.3 % were from faith-based nonprofit hospitals (eighteen Catholic, seven Seventh-day Adventist, and one Jewish hospital). Modest differences in patient characteristics and shorter LOS (7.5 vs. 8.3 days) were observed between faith-based and other hospitals. Multivariable negative binomial regression found shorter LOS at faith-based nonprofit hospitals (coefficient = −0.1169, p < 0.001, Wald χ
2 = 55) and greater LOS at all nonprofits (coefficient = 1.5909, p < 0.001, Wald χ

Turning the Question Around: Do Colleges Fail to Meet Students’ Expectations?,"Research often focuses on how students fail to meet college expectations, but it rarely asks how colleges fail to meet students’ expectations. This study examines students’ expectations of college and their institutional confidence—their level of certainty that college will meet their expectations. Drawing on 65 pilot interviews and a survey of 757 students in eight community colleges and two private occupational colleges, we find that students have three expectations about college. However, students do not express confidence that college will meet these expectations. Students expect college to provide: (1) dependable progress to credentials, (2) relevant courses, and (3) job contacts. Factor analyses confirm that ten survey items load onto the three components of institutional confidence expressed in the interviews. Using structural equation modeling, we investigate how institutional confidence varies by college program and its relationship to students’ overall college evaluations. Within 2-year colleges, we find that students in two occupational programs express more confidence that college provides relevant courses and employer contacts than students in BA transfer programs. Further, we find that students’ institutional confidence that college provides relevant courses mediates much of the relationship between college program and students’ overall college evaluation. We speculate about ways college programs may improve students’ institutional confidence and their evaluation of college."
Comparing Two Inquiry Professional Development Interventions in Science on Primary Students’ Questioning and Other Inquiry Behaviours,"Developing students’ skills to pose and respond to questions and actively engage in inquiry behaviours enables students to problem solve and critically engage with learning and society. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of providing teachers with an intervention in inquiry pedagogy alongside inquiry science curriculum in comparison to an intervention in non-inquiry pedagogy alongside inquiry science curriculum on student questioning and other inquiry behaviours. Teacher participants in the comparison condition received training in four inquiry-based science units and in collaborative strategic reading. The experimental group, the community of inquiry (COI) condition, received training in facilitating a COI in addition to training in the same four inquiry-based science units. This study involved 227 students and 18 teachers in 9 primary schools across Brisbane, Australia. The teachers were randomly allocated by school to one of the two conditions. The study followed the students across years 6 and 7 and students’ discourse during small group activities was recorded, transcribed and coded for verbal inquiry behaviours. In the second year of the study, students in the COI condition demonstrated a significantly higher frequency of procedural and substantive higher-order thinking questions and other inquiry behaviours than those in the comparison condition. Implementing a COI within an inquiry science curriculum develops students’ questioning and science inquiry behaviours and allows teachers to foster inquiry skills predicated by the Australian Science Curriculum. Provision of inquiry science curriculum resources alone is not sufficient to promote the questioning and other verbal inquiry behaviours predicated by the Australian Science Curriculum."
Oral History Reveals Landscape Ecology in Ecuadorian Amazonia: Time Categories and Ethnobotany among Waorani People1,"Oral History Reveals Landscape Ecology in Ecuadorian Amazonia: Time Categories and Ethnobotany among Waorani People. Waorani oral history in Ecuadorian Amazonia reveals that traditional ecological knowledge contributes to the understanding of the natural environment of this human group. When the Waorani interpret the landscape, they identify certain elements that stand out for their cultural and practical value, as these are products of past and present settlements. The oral history and management practices, by two family clusters settled at the riverbanks of the Nushiño River, contributed to assembling an analytical tool called “Waorani time categories.” These four time categories were analyzed with floristic composition based on a matrix formed by 522 plant species collected at 12 forest patches, which either had or lacked social history. The aim of this research was to examine how Waorani oral history records the ecological dynamics of some Amazonian forest patches. The use of multivariate statistical methods made establishing differences in plant diversity, evenness, and richness between managed and unmanaged forests plots possible, thus revealing human impact at specific places in Amazonia. This research confirms that it is important to intertwine social history and landscape ecology in ethnobotany with quantitative statistical interpretation, because it permits the association of a human group with a particular forest."
Shimura lifting of modular forms of weight 3/2,"We show that there is the Shimura lifting map of \(\mathbf {M}_{3/2}(N,\chi _{0})\) to \(\mathbf {M}_{2}(N/2,\chi _{0}^{2})\) for any natural number N divisible by 4 and for any odd Dirichlet character \(\chi _{0}\), which was already proved in the case of higher weight (Tsuyumine, Tsukuba J Math 23:465–483, 1999). As the application, we show that the lift of the weighted average of theta series of quadratic forms of an odd number of variables in a class, is an Eisenstein series of integral weight."
"A comparison of the structure and bonding in the aliphatic boronic R–B(OH)2 and borinic R–BH(OH) acids (R=H; NH2, OH, and F): a computational investigation","Boronic acids, R–B(OH)2, play an important role in synthetic, biological, medicinal, and materials chemistry. This investigation compares the structure and bonding surrounding the boron atoms in the simple aliphatic boronic acids, R–B(OH)2 (R=H; NH2, OH, and F), and the analogous borinic acids, R–BH(OH). Geometry optimizations were performed using second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) with the Dunning–Woon aug-cc-pVTZ, aug-cc-pVQZ, and aug-cc-pV5Z basis sets; single-point CCSD(FC)/aug-cc-pVTZ//MP2(FC)/aug-cc-pVTZ level calculations were used to generate a QCI density for natural bond orbital analyses of the bonding. The optimized boron–oxygen bond lengths for the X–B–Ot–H trans-branch of the endo-exo form of the boronic acids and for the X–B–O–H cis-branch of the boronic and borinic acids (X=N, O, and F, respectively) decrease as the electronegativity of X increases. The boron–oxygen bond lengths are generally longer in the endo-exo or anti forms of the boronic acids than in the corresponding borinic acids. NBO analyses suggest the boron–oxygen bond in H2BOH is a double bond; the boron–oxygen bonding in the remaining boronic and borinic acids in this study has a significant contribution from dative pπ–pπ bonding. Values for Δ\({\text{H}}_{298}^{0}\) for the highly balanced reaction, R–B(OH)2 + R–BH2 → 2 R–BH(OH), suggest that the bonding surrounding the boron atom is stronger in the borinic acid than in the corresponding boronic acid."
A phase I clinical trial of the effect of belinostat on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin,Belinostat is a potent small molecule inhibitor that exerts its antitumor effect through inhibition of histone deacetylase. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin (as a reference drug metabolized by CYP2C9) in the presence and absence of belinostat.
Association of Internalized and Social Network Level HIV Stigma With High-Risk Condomless Sex Among HIV-Positive African American Men,"We examined whether internalized HIV stigma and perceived HIV stigma from social network members (alters), including the most popular and most similar alter, predicted condomless intercourse with negative or unknown HIV status partners among 125 African American HIV-positive men. In a prospective, observational study, participants were administered surveys at baseline and months 6 and 12, with measures including sexual behavior, internalized HIV stigma, and an egocentric social network assessment that included several measures of perceived HIV stigma among alters. In longitudinal multivariable models comparing the relative predictive value of internalized stigma versus various measures of alter stigma, significant predictors of having had condomless intercourse included greater internalized HIV stigma (in all models), the perception that a popular (well-connected) alter or alter most like the participant agrees with an HIV stigma belief, and the interaction of network density with having any alter that agrees with a stigma belief. The interaction indicated that the protective effect of greater density (connectedness between alters) in terms of reduced risk behavior dissipated in the presence of perceived alter stigma. These findings call for interventions that help people living with HIV to cope with their diagnosis and reduce stigma, and inform the targets of social network-based and peer-driven HIV prevention interventions."

Physics-inspired motion planning for information-theoretic target detection using multiple aerial robots,"This paper presents a motion-planning strategy for multiple, mobile sensor platforms using visual sensors with a finite field of view. Visual sensors are used to collect position measurements of potential targets within the search domain. Measurements are assimilated into a multi-target Bayesian likelihood ratio tracker that recursively produces a probability density function over the possible target positions. Vehicles are dynamically routed using a controller based on a concept from artificial physics, where vehicle motion depends on the target probability at their location as well as the distance to nearby agents. In this paradigm, the inverse log-likelihood ratio represents temperature, i.e., high likelihood corresponds to cold temperature and low likelihood corresponds to high temperature. Vehicles move at a temperature-dependent speed along the negative gradient of the temperature surface while interacting locally with other agents via a Lennard-Jones potential in order to emergently transition between the three states of matter—solid, liquid, and gas. We show that the gradient-following behavior corresponds to locally maximizing the mutual information between the measurements and the target state. The performance of the algorithm is experimentally demonstrated for visual measurements in a motion capture facility using quadrotor sensor platforms equipped with downward facing cameras."
"Dynamic mechanical, mechanical and thermal analysis of CPI/NBR blends: effect of blend composition and crosslink density","Blends of cis-polyisoprene (CPI) and nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) in different volume ratio were prepared to see the effect of composition on different properties. Structure characterization has been done through X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope. Scanning electron micrographs confirm homogeneous nature of all the blends. The dynamic mechanical analyzer was used to measure damping, storage modulus, glass transition temperature and mechanical properties (Young’s modulus and tensile strength) of these blends. Activation energy and fragility were determined for the non-Arrhenius (fragile) behavior of viscosity using Vogel–Fulchuer–Tammann (VFT) equation. Thermal conductivity has been analyzed through thermal constant analyzer. Results indicate that all the measured properties are dependent on blend composition and crosslink density."
A cross-layer QoS management framework for ZigBee cluster-tree networks,"Wireless sensor networks show great potential to successfully address the timeliness and energy-efficiency requirements of different cyber-physical system applications. Generally, these requirements span several layers of the stack and demand an on-line mechanism capable of efficiently tuning several parameters, in order to better support highly dynamic traffic characteristics. This work presents a cross-layer QoS management framework for ZigBee cluster-tree networks. The proposed framework carries out an on-line control of a set of parameters ranging from the MAC sub-layer to the network layer, improving the successful transmission probability and minimizing the memory requirements and queuing delays through an efficient bandwidth allocation at the network clusters. Through extensive simulations in a real datacenter monitoring application scenario, we show that the proposed framework improves the successful transmission probability by 10 %, and reduces the end-to-end delay by 94 %."
On finite dimensional Jacobian algebras,"We show that Jacobian algebras arising from every tagged triangulation of a sphere with n-punctures, with \(n\ge 5\), are finite dimensional algebras. We consider also a family of cyclically oriented quivers and we prove that, for any primitive potential, the associated Jacobian algebra is finite dimensional."

"Spatial modeling of urban sprawl around Greater Bhubaneswar city, India","In developing countries, where urbanization rates are high, urban sprawl is a significant contributor of the land use change. However, characterizing sprawl has become a contentious issue with numerous arguments both for and against the phenomenon. Meanwhile, effective metrics to characterize sprawl in India are required to characterize this. We have attempted to capture urban sprawl over the landscape and hence adopt landscape metrics, entropy and principal component analysis for characterizing sprawling process. The measurement and monitoring of land-use changes in these areas are crucial to government officials and city planners who urgently need updated information for planning and management purposes. This paper examines the use of landscape metrics and entropy in the measurement and monitoring of urban sprawl by the integration of remote sensing and GIS techniques. The advantages of the entropy method are its simplicity and easy integration with GIS. The measurement of entropy is devised based on locational factors-distances from central business district and reveal spatial patterns of urban sprawl. The entropy space can be conveniently used to differentiate various kinds of urban growth patterns. The application of the method in the Bhubaneswar Metropolitan Area, one of the fastest growing and planned cities in India, has demonstrated that it is very useful and effective for the monitoring of urban sprawl. It provides a useful tool for the quantitative measurement that is much needed for rapidly growing regions in identifying the spatial dynamics, variations and changes of urban sprawl patterns."
Dual hesitant fuzzy rough set and its application,"In this paper, we propose a general framework for the study of dual hesitant fuzzy rough sets integrating rough set theory with dual hesitant fuzzy set theory in which both constructive and axiomatic approaches are considered. In a constructive approach, by using a dual hesitant fuzzy relation, lower and upper dual hesitant fuzzy rough approximation operators with respect to a dual hesitant fuzzy approximation space are first defined and some properties of this model are further discussed. Adopting an axiomatic approach, dual hesitant fuzzy rough approximation operators are defined by axioms. And different axiom sets of dual hesitant fuzzy set-theoretic operators guarantee the existence of different types of dual hesitant fuzzy relations producing the same operators. We then give an approach of decision-making in uncertainty environment by using the dual hesitant fuzzy rough sets. Finally, a practical application in medical diagnosis is provided to illustrate the validity of this approach."
Granular classifiers and their design through refinement of information granules,"In this study, we focus on the design and refinements of granular pattern classifiers, namely classifiers, which deal with a collection of information granules formed in a certain feature space. The development of this category of classifiers is realized as a two-phase design process. First, information granules occupying some regions of the feature space are formed through invoking mechanisms of clustering or fuzzy clustering. As a result, regions in the feature space are built, which are densely occupied by the patterns predominantly belonging to the same class. We offer a detailed way of assessing the character and quality of information granules and their information (classification-oriented) content. The resulting description is utilized in the realization of the classification mechanism being considered at the second phase of the design of the granular classifier. The mapping from the collection of information granules to class assignment (classification) involves matching of a pattern to be classified to individual information granules and aggregating them by considering the information content of the corresponding granules. In the study, a number of descriptors capturing information content and aggregation functions are analyzed. To improve the performance of the granular classifier, a refinement of information granules is carried out, in which highly heterogeneous information granules (viz. those containing patterns belonging to various classes) are refined (split, specialized), and their refined versions are afterwards used in the buildup of the classifier. A series of experiments involving both synthetic data as well as those publicly available is reported and analyzed, illustrating the main advantages of granular classifiers and their design procedure."
"Taphonomic analysis of Saurichthys from two stratigraphic horizons in the Middle Triassic of Monte San Giorgio, Switzerland","Excavations of Middle Triassic strata at Monte San Giorgio (Switzerland–Italy) have famously recovered a range of reptiles whose affinities, morphology and preservation have been extensively described. The locality has also yielded a contemporaneous and equally diverse fish fauna that has yet to be described to the same degree. To address this imbalance, a taphonomic study was undertaken using the actinopterygian Saurichthys, a relatively abundant taxon found in the Besano Formation (latest Anisian–earliest Ladinian) and Cassina Beds of the Meride Formation (early Ladinian). Specimens from each horizon were scored for articulation and completeness across ten anatomical units, the resulting datasets being used to determine a taphonomic model and investigate preservational variation through time. Saurichthys showing moderate to high articulation and high completeness occur in both horizons but states of low articulation and moderate completeness are only present in the Besano Formation. The same feature is apparent in corresponding unit plots, suggesting different environmental conditions were present during deposition of each horizon, specifically those that reduced articulation and completeness during a prolonged residence on the sediment surface."
"Born–Jordan Pseudodifferential Calculus, Bopp Operators and Deformation Quantization","There has recently been a resurgence of interest in Born–Jordan quantization, which historically preceded Weyl’s prescription. Both mathematicians and physicists have found that this forgotten quantization scheme is actually not only of great mathematical interest, but also has unexpected application in operator theory, signal processing, and time-frequency analysis. In the present paper we discuss the applications to deformation quantization, which in its traditional form relies on Weyl quantization. Introducing the notion of “Bopp operator” which we have used in previous work, this allows us to obtain interesting new results in the spectral theory of deformation quantization."
Lorentz Invariance Violation: Modification of the Compton Scattering and the GZK Cutoff and Other Effects,"This paper deals with the violation of Lorentz symmetry. The approach is based on Compton scattering which becomes modified due to a modified dispersion relation arising from a minimum spacetime cut off as in modern Quantum Gravity approaches. With this amendment, we find that two high-energy rays of different energies develop a time-lag. This time separation becomes prominent when the energies of the considered photons is ≥ 1GeV. Extending our approach to gamma rays of cosmic origin we predict that they undergo innumerable such scattering processes before reaching us. Therefore, it accounts for the time-lag phenomena of gamma ray bursts (GRB)’s which have been claimed to be observed. Also, we find that resorting to the modified Snyder-Sidharth Hamiltonian it is possible to extend the GZK cut off beyond its normal limit, 1020
eV. Some observations of ultra high energy cosmic rays support this. This extends the limits of special theory of relativity."
Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using Lantana camara flower extract and its application,"Search of new pigment for the green synthesis of nanoparticles has emerged new scope for the chemist. In this report, we describe the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using notorious weed, Lantana camara L. flower extract. The AgNPs were characterized by visual, UV–visible spectrophotometer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering and X-ray diffraction (XRD). UV–visible spectroscopy showed surface plasmon resonance at 470 nm clearly reveals the formation of AgNPs. TEM analysis confirmed that the AgNPs are spherical and 33 ± 5 nm average sized. XRD analysis reveals the formation of pure silver metal with face-centered cubic symmetry and confirms crystalline nature. The AgNPs showed significant antioxidant efficacy at different time intervals against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and photocatalytic activities by the degradation of the methylene blue. From the results obtained, it is suggested that surface-modified AgNPs could be used effectively in future biotechnology concerns."
Preparation of α-Co(OH)2 monolayer nanosheets by an intercalation agent-free exfoliation process,"In this work, α-Co(OH)2 monolayer nanosheets were prepared by an intercalation agent-free route utilizing a precipitation reaction between epoxide and aqueous complexes of cobalt ions ([Co(H2O)6]2+). The protonation and the following ring-opening reaction of epoxide promoted the hydrolysis of [Co(H2O)6]2+, leading to the formation of α-Co(OH)2 nanosheets. The obtained nanosheets were then exfoliated to monolayer nanosheets in formamide under ultrasonic vibration. A possible exfoliation mechanism is proposed for the exfoliating process of α-Co(OH)2 nanosheets. The water molecules incorporated in the layered structure of α-Co(OH)2 are considered to be the key medium for the layer exfoliation. It seems that the water molecules coordinated with the cobalt ions weakened the interlayer interaction. Therefore, the extraction of water molecules by formamide readily broke the interlayer connection in α-Co(OH)2, resulting in the exfoliation of nanosheets."
TERT promoter mutations are a rare event in gastrointestinal stromal tumors,"Recently, the impact of telomere dysregulation on malignant progression has been reported in many cancers. A few studies have examined TERT promoter mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Irregular telomerase activation can be maintained by TERT hot spot alterations and alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) characterized by inactivation of either the alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) or death domain–associated protein (DAXX). To elucidate the clinicopathological impact of telomere dysregulation in GISTs, we examined 92 cases of GISTs for TERT promoter hot spot mutations along with immunohistochemical analysis of ATRX and DAXX expression, and compared these findings with the clinicopathological features. Univariate clinicopathological analysis revealed that tumor site, smaller tumor size, presence of necrosis, higher mitotic rate (>5/50 high-power fields) and risk classification were prognostic factors for either disease-free survival or overall survival. Two of 92 informative cases (2.2 %) were found to have heterozygous TERT promoter mutations (C228T), and these mutations occurred in a low-risk and a high-risk tumor, respectively. On immunohistochemical analysis for ATRX and DAXX, 16 (17.4 %) and 3 (3.3 %) of 92 cases showed loss of expression of ATRX and DAXX, respectively. Loss of expression of ATRX and DAXX were mutually exclusive except for one case. TERT promoter mutations were also mutually exclusive of the ALT phenotype. Telomere dysregulation was not associated with patient survival; however, telomere dysregulation was frequently observed in tumors of extra-gastric origin, which have an adverse outcome compared to those of gastric origin."
The arthroscopical and radiological corelation of lever sign test for the diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament rupture,"The aim of the current study was to evaluate the sensitivity of the lever sign test and the widely used basic tests of the Lachman, anterior drawer and pivot shift tests, both under anaesthesia and without anaesthesia, according to the gold standard diagnostic arthroscopic results in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The study included 117 patients, diagnosed with ACL tear which was definitively determined during an arthroscopic surgical procedure applied. Before anaesthesia and while under anaesthesia, the Lachman, anterior drawer, pivot shift and lever sign tests were applied to all patients. Evaluation was made of MR images for each patient and documented. The patients comprised 96 males and 21 females, witha mean age of 25.8 ± 5.9 years (range, 17–45 years). Total tear was determined in 82 cases, anteromedial (AM) bundle in 14, posterolateral (PL) bundle in 13 and elongation in 8. Pre-anaesthesia positivity was found in lever sign at 94.2 %, Lachman at 80.5 %, pivot shift at 62.3 % and anterior drawer at 60.1 %. These rates were determined after anaesthesia as lever sign 98.4 %, Lachman 88.7 %, pivot shift 88.3 % and anterior drawer 84.2 %. The lever sign test can be easily applied clinically and it seems to have higher sensitivity than the Lachman test which is the basis of classic information, it should be included in routine clinical practice. In the light of the results of this study, further studies are required to review the accepted view that the Lachmann test is the most reliable test."
"Reproductive factors, tumor estrogen receptor status and contralateral breast cancer risk: results from the WECARE study","Several reproductive factors are known to be associated with risk of breast cancer; however, relationships between these factors with risk of second primary asynchronous contralateral breast cancer (CBC) have not been widely studied. The Women’s Environmental, Cancer, and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study is a population-based case-control study of 1521 CBC cases and 2212 individually matched controls with unilateral breast cancer. Using multivariable conditional logistic regression models, we examined associations between reproductive factors and CBC risk, and whether associations differed by estrogen receptor (ER) status and menopausal status of the first breast cancer. Older age at menarche was inversely associated with CBC risk (≥14 vs. ≤11 years risk ratio (RR) = 0.82, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.65–1.03, P
trend = 0.02). Among parous women, an increasing number of full-term pregnancies (FTP) was inversely associated with risk (≥4 vs. 1 FTP RR = 0.60, 95 % CI 0.41–0.88, P
trend = 0.005). Ever breast-feeding was inversely associated with CBC risk only among women with ER-negative first tumors (ever vs. never breast-fed RR = 0.69, 95 % CI 0.48–1.00, P
heterogeneity = 0.05). Older age at first FTP was inversely associated with CBC risk among women with ER-negative first tumors (≥30 vs. <20 years old RR = 0.66, 95 % CI 0.35–1.27, P
trend = 0.03), but suggestively positively associated with risk among women with ER-positive first tumors (P
heterogeneity = 0.03). Young age at menarche and low parity, both risk factors for first primary breast cancer, were also associated with overall CBC risk. Reductions in risk associated with breast-feeding were limited to women with ER-negative first tumors, who are at higher CBC risk than women with ER-positive primaries."
Subjective and objective assessment of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy,"Numbness and pain are currently evaluated using subjective methods such as the visual analog scale (VAS). However, because assessment of pain can vary greatly depending on the mood and physical state of the patient at the time of assessment, it is best to evaluate pain objectively. pain vision PS-2100 (PV) is an analytical instrument that was designed to quantitatively and objectively assess sense perception and nociception in patients. The present study examined the correlation of subjective and objective assessment of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (PN) using VAS and PV, respectively. The mean VAS and PV scores of PN were 20.5 (range 0–100) and 27.9 (range 0–416), respectively. The partial correlation coefficient was 0.274 (p = 0.0003). No strong correlation was observed between the results and a weak correlation was observed between VAS and PV."
On the existence of impulsive neutral evolution differential inclusions with infinite delay,"In this paper, we use a fixed point principle regarding a condensing mapping with some measure of noncompactness. We assume there is no compactness assumption, and we give sufficient conditions for the existence of mild solutions to some classes of impulsive neutral evolution differential inclusions with infinite delay. A concrete example is presented in the end to illustrate the abstract theorem."
Institutional landscapes affecting small-scale fishing in Southern Sri Lanka - legal pluralism and its socio-economic effects,"This paper demonstrates the variety of institutional arrangements affecting small-scale fishing in southern Sri Lanka, highlighting legal pluralism and focusing particularly on its consequences for livelihoods and resource conservation. Evidence derives from two landing centres in Hambantota District, and is grouped according to three institutional types: norms, community working rules and state working rules. The authors argue that these institutions play differential roles in providing access to fishing, preventing conflict, structuring fishing operations, reducing risks and conserving resources. Interactions between state and community legal systems consist of four types - indifference, competition, accommodation and mutual support. Institutional effectiveness is threatened most where implementation is poor or rules are in direct competition."
"Porcine methionine sulfoxide reductase B3: molecular cloning, tissue-specific expression profiles, and polymorphisms associated with ear size in Sus scrofa","In Sus scrofa, methionine sulfoxide reductase B3 (MSRB3) is a crucial candidate gene for ear size, and an important conformational trait of pig breeds. However, challenges in MSRB3 cDNA amplification have prevented further identification of MSRB3 allelic variants influencing pig ear size."
Efficient differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to arterial and venous endothelial cells under feeder- and serum-free conditions,"Heterogeneity of endothelial cells (ECs) is a hallmark of the vascular system which may impact the development and management of vascular disorders. Despite the tremendous progress in differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) towards endothelial lineage, differentiation into arterial and venous endothelial phenotypes remains elusive. Additionally, current differentiation strategies are hampered by inefficiency, lack of reproducibility, and use of animal-derived products."
The matching energy of graphs with given edge connectivity,"Let G be a simple graph of order n and \(\mu_{1},\mu_{2},\ldots,\mu_{n}\) the roots of its matching polynomial. The matching energy of G is defined as the sum \(\sum_{i=1}^{n}|\mu_{i}|\). Let \(K_{n-1,1}^{k}\) be the graph obtained from \(K_{1}\cup K_{n-1}\) by adding k edges between \(V(K_{1})\) and \(V(K_{n-1})\). In this paper, we show that \(K_{n-1,1}^{k}\) has the maximum matching energy among the connected graphs with order n and edge connectivity k."
Association between BDNF levels and suicidal behaviour: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Suicidal behaviour is a complex phenomenon with a multitude of risk factors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein crucial to nervous system function, may be involved in suicide risk. The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate and summarize the literature examining the relationship between BDNF levels and suicidal behaviour."
"Higher education, reservation and scheduled castes: exploring institutional habitus of professional engineering colleges in Kerala","This paper seeks to unravel the institutional context of the educational experience of scheduled caste engineering students in Kerala, a federal state in India. Though much has been debated about equity of access in the domain of reservation policies in higher education while studying the caste question and educational equity, process and outcome dimensions continue to be understudied. By presenting ethnographic accounts of the educational experience of fourteen scheduled caste engineering students, we explain how different institutional cultures result in different experiences for students of similar educational and familial backgrounds. Our analysis suggests that the notion of institutional habitus better captures the impact of institutions on marginalised students. The paper concludes with a call for further research to explore the institutional habitus of different higher education institutions. The authors hope that such research would help in formulation of new policies and practices to facilitate institutional transformation and contribute to improved quality and equity of higher education in India."

Alkaline-sulfite pretreatment and use of surfactants during enzymatic hydrolysis to enhance ethanol production from sugarcane bagasse,"Sugarcane bagasse is a by-product from the sugar and ethanol industry which contains approximately 70 % of its dry mass composed by polysaccharides. To convert these polysaccharides into fuel ethanol it is necessary a pretreatment step to increase the enzymatic digestibility of the recalcitrant raw material. In this work, sugarcane bagasse was pretreated by an alkaline-sulfite chemithermomechanical process for increasing its enzymatic digestibility. Na2SO3 and NaOH ratios were fixed at 2:1, and three increasing chemical loads, varying from 4 to 8 % m/m Na2SO3, were used to prepare the pretreated materials. The increase in the alkaline-sulfite load decreased the lignin content in the pretreated material up to 35.5 % at the highest chemical load. The pretreated samples presented enhanced glucose yields during enzymatic hydrolysis as a function of the pretreatment severity. The maximum glucose yield (64 %) was observed for the samples pretreated with the highest chemical load. The use of 2.5 g l−1 Tween 20 in the hydrolysis step further increased the glucose yield to 75 %. Semi-simultaneous hydrolysis and fermentation of the pretreated materials indicated that the ethanol yield was also enhanced as a function of the pretreatment severity. The maximum ethanol yield was 56 ± 2 % for the sample pretreated with the highest chemical load. For the sample pretreated with the lowest chemical load (2 % m/m NaOH and 4 % m/m Na2SO3), adding Tween 20 during the hydrolysis process increased the ethanol yield from 25 ± 3 to 39.5 ± 1 %."
Chungpihongsim radish (Raphanus sativus L. cv. Chungpihongsim) ameliorates ethanol-induced gastric injury in rats,"We evaluated whether crude juice extract of chungpihongsim radish (Raphanus sativus L. cv. Chungpihongsim) (CH radish), with its characteristic red flesh and white skin, ameliorated ethanol-induced gastric injury in rats. Animals were divided into five groups: normal control, a group given CH radish extract (1000 mg/kg) only, two groups orally administered CH radish extract (500 and 1000 mg/kg, respectively, daily for 2 weeks) with ethanol treatment (5 mL/kg) 24 h after final administration of CH radish extract, and a group treated with ethanol alone. Tissues of stomach were collected after sacrifice, and the gastric mucosal injury index using hemorrhagic lesions were measured. Lipid peroxidation was evaluated based on malondialdehyde concentration. The radical-scavenging enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were also measured. Rats treated with CH radish extract (500 or 1000 mg/kg) for 2 weeks experienced no change in body weight. Pretreatment with the extract at both doses significantly ameliorated ethanol-induced hemorrhagic lesions in the gastric mucosa (p < 0.05), decreased malondialdehyde concentration (p < 0.05), and increased the levels of SOD (p < 0.05) and CAT (p < 0.05), compared to ethanol-alone treatment. These findings suggest that pretreatment with CH radish extract reduces ethanol-induced damage in the gastric mucosa, mediated partly by a decrease in lipid peroxidation and an increase in the cytoprotective radical-scavenging enzymes SOD and CAT."
Dedifferentiated Chondrosarcoma of the Larynx,"Primary dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma occurring in the larynx is a rare head and neck malignancy. The cases reported in the literature suggest male gender predilection and variable clinical outcomes ranging from disease-free survival to disease-related death. Although a calcified matrix is suggestive of chondrosarcoma, the dedifferentiated component is not readily appreciated on conventional imaging modalities and thorough tissue sampling is necessary for confirming the diagnosis. Histologically, there is an abrupt transition from a well-differentiated chondrosarcoma to a high-grade spindle cell component, which can show focal heterologous differentiation. These features are exemplified in this sine qua non radiology–pathology correlation article."
"Public Debt, Productive Public Spending and Endogenous Growth","We analyse the effects of public debt in a basic endogenous growth model with productive public spending. We demonstrate that a discretionary policy in general violates the intertemporal government budget constraint along a balanced growth path. A balanced government budget gives a unique saddle point stable growth path. With a rule-based policy, two saddle point stable balanced growth paths can occur, depending on the intertemporal elasticity of substitution of consumption and on the primary surplus policy. Higher debt goes along with smaller long-run growth and we derive a condition such that a deficit-financed increase in public spending raises the growth rate."
Artificially Low Interest Rates as Export Promotion Policy,"We reconsider the effects of a policy that sets an artificially low interest rate. Such a policy involves a combination of an interest rate ceiling and a rationing rule that assigns a priority-lending status to export sectors over domestic service sectors. We demonstrate that the policy works as an export-promotion policy, and improves national income. Furthermore, under some conditions, the policy expands the domestic service sector, despite the reduced amount of funds owing to the rationing rule. Finally, the artificially low interest rate improves national welfare."
Child Benefit Payments and Household Wealth Accumulation,"Using the life-cycle/permanent income hypothesis, we theoretically and empirically assess the impact of child benefit payments on household wealth accumulation. Consistent with the predictions of the model, we find that higher cumulative benefits received increase current assets, higher future benefit payments lower asset holding, and that these effects systematically vary over the life cycle. We find different wealth responses to child benefit payments for liquidity constrained and unconstrained households, as predicted by the model."
Deciphering the In Vivo Performance of a Monoclonal Antibody to Neutralize Its Soluble Target at the Site of Action in a Mouse Collagen-Induced Arthritis Model,Study the disposition and target-neutralization capability of an anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) monoclonal antibody (mAb) at the joint in a mouse collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model.
Budesonide Loaded PLGA Nanoparticles for Targeting the Inflamed Intestinal Mucosa—Pharmaceutical Characterization and Fluorescence Imaging,The purpose of this study was to evaluate the specifically targeted efficiency of budesonide loaded PLGA nanoparticles for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Experimental investigation on synchronized optical code division multiple access transmission,"In this paper an experimental study on the performance of our previously reported optical CDMA co-channel interference reduction is presented, where an end-to-end synchronized CDMA network, implementing a point-to-point fiber-optic link, is modeled in the laboratory test bed. For the first time, the experimental and simulation results on bit-error rates of various prime code families using this laboratory based optical link are presented and compared both in the presence and absence of our previously reported MAI cancellation scheme. Also, to reduce the simulation time during the transmission and verify our results, we have modeled this system in the OptiSystem software. Our experimental results clearly validate all simulations results that we have reported previously."
One-step implementation of a Toffoli gate of separated superconducting qubits via quantum Zeno dynamics,"Based on the quantum Zeno dynamics, a scheme is presented to implement a Toffoli gate of three separated superconducting qubits (SQs) by one step. Three separated SQs are connected by two resonators. The scheme is insensitive to the resonator decay because the Zeno subspace does not include the state of the resonators being excited. Numerical simulations indicate that the scheme is robust to the fluctuation of the parameters and the Toffoli gate can be implemented with high fidelity."
A rigorous finite volume model to simulate subaerial and submarine landslide-generated waves,"This paper presents a new landslide-generated wave (LGW) model based on incompressible Euler equations with Savage-Hutter assumptions. A two-layer model is developed including a layer of granular-type flow beneath a layer of an inviscid fluid. Landslide is modeled as a two-phase Coulomb mixture. A well-balanced second-order finite volume formulation is applied to solve the model equations. Wet/dry transitions are treated properly using a modified non-linear method. The numerical model is validated using two sets of experimental data on subaerial and submarine LGWs. Impulsive wave characteristics and landslide deformations are estimated with a computational error less than 5 %. Then, the model is applied to investigate the effects of landslide deformations on water surface fluctuations in comparison with a simpler model considering a rigid landslide. The model results confirm the importance of both rheological behavior and two-phase nature of landslide in proper estimation of generated wave properties and formation patterns. Rigid slide modeling often overestimates the characteristics of induced waves. With a proper rheological model for landslide, the numerical prediction of LGWs gets more than 30 % closer to experimental measurements. Single-phase landslide results in relative errors up to about 30 % for maximum positive and about 70 % for maximum negative wave amplitudes. Two-phase constitutive structure of landslide has also strong effects on landslide deformations, velocities, elongations, and traveling distances. The complex behaviors of landslide and LGW of the experimental data are analyzed and described with the aid of the robust and accurate finite volume model. This can provide benchmark data for testing other numerical methods and models."
Application of a process-based shallow landslide hazard model over a broad area in Central Italy,"Process-based models are widely used for rainfall-induced shallow landslide forecasting. Previous studies have successfully applied the U.S. Geological Survey’s Transient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-Based Regional Slope-Stability (TRIGRS) model (Baum et al. 2002) to compute infiltration-driven changes in the hillslopes’ factor of safety on small scales (i.e., tens of square kilometers). Soil data input for such models are difficult to obtain across larger regions. This work describes a novel methodology for the application of TRIGRS over broad areas with relatively uniform hydrogeological properties. The study area is a 550-km2 region in Central Italy covered by post-orogenic Quaternary sediments. Due to the lack of field data, we assigned mechanical and hydrological property values through a statistical analysis based on literature review of soils matching the local lithologies. We calibrated the model using rainfall data from 25 historical rainfall events that triggered landslides. We compared the variation of pressure head and factor of safety with the landslide occurrence to identify the best fitting input conditions. Using calibrated inputs and a soil depth model, we ran TRIGRS for the study area. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, comparing the model’s output with a shallow landslide inventory, shows that TRIGRS effectively simulated the instability conditions in the post-orogenic complex during historical rainfall scenarios. The implication of this work is that rainfall-induced landslides over large regions may be predicted by a deterministic model, even where data on geotechnical and hydraulic properties as well as temporal changes in topography or subsurface conditions are not available."
Letter from the new editor-in-chief: my perspective for future development,
Is VEGF a marker of severity of scrub typhus infection?,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors have been reported as severity markers of septicemia. Scrub typhus (ST) results in multi-organ dysfunction but the role of VEGF has not been evaluated. We report VEGF and its receptors in ST and its correlation with severity, outcome and laboratory findings. Thirty patients with ST diagnosed by solid phase immune chromatographic assay and Weil–Felix tests were included. Their clinical details, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), SOFA and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores and laboratory findings were noted. VEGF, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 were done by ELISA at admission and repeated at 1 month. Outcome was defined at 1 month. Serum VEGF and VEGF-R1 levels were significantly higher and VEGFR2 was significantly lower in the ST patients compared to the controls. These levels significantly improved at 1 month. VEGF level correlated with SOFA score (p = 0.05) and SGPT (p = 0.04). VEGFR1 correlated with hemoglobin (p = 0.04), platelet count (p = 0.03), serum CK (p = 0.001), weakness (p = 0.04) and mRS score (p = 0.04). VEGFR2 did not correlate with any clinical or laboratory parameters. All the patients recovered with doxycycline. Serum VEGF and VEGFR1 levels increased in ST and suggest disease severity but do not predict outcome."
"Emergy analysis of a silvo-pastoral system, a case study in southern Portugal","The Mediterranean silvo-pastoral system known as Montado, in Portugal, is a complex land use system composed of an open tree stratum in various densities and an herbaceous layer, used for livestock grazing. Livestock also profit from the acorns, and the grazing contributes to avoid shrub encroachment. In the last 20 years, subsidies from the European Union have greatly promoted cattle rearing in this system and the introduction of heavy breeds, at the expense of sheep, goats or the native cattle breeds. The balance of the traditional system is thus threatened, and a precise assessment of the balance between the different components of the system, therefore is highly needed. The goal of this study was to gain a better understanding of a Montado farm system with cattle rearing as the major economic activity by applying the emergy evaluation method to calculate indices of yield, investment, environmental loading and sustainability. By integrating different ecosystem components, the emergy evaluation method allows a comprehensive evaluation of this complex and multifunctional system at the scale of an individual farm. This method provides a set of indices that can help us understand the system and design management strategies that maximize emergy flow in the farm. In this paper, we apply the emergy evaluation method to a Montado farm with cattle rearing, as a way to gain a better understanding of this system at the farm scale. The value for the transformity of veal (2.66E+06 sej J−1) is slightly higher, when compared to other systems producing protein. That means that the investment of nature and man in this product was higher and it requires a premium price on the market. The renewability for Holm Oaks Farm (49 %), lower than for other similar systems, supports the assumption that this is a farm in which, comparing with others, the number of purchased inputs in relation to renewable inputs provided by nature, is higher. The Emergy Investment Ratio is 0.91 for cattle rearing compared to a value of 0.49 for cork and 0.43 for firewood harvesting, making it clear that cattle rearing is a more labor demanding activity comparing with extractive activities as cork and firewood harvesting."
Tracing Jomon and Yayoi ancestries in Japan using ALDH2 and JC virus genotype distributions,"According to the dual structure model, the modern Japanese ethnic population consists of a mixture of the Jomon people, who have existed in Japan since at least the New Stone Age, and the Yayoi people, who migrated to western Japan from China around the year 300 bc Some reports show that the Yayoi are linked to a mutation of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene (ALDH2)."
Influence of ICU-bed availability on ICU admission decisions,"The potential influence of bed availability on triage to intensive care unit (ICU) admission is among the factors that may influence the ideal ratio of ICU beds to population: thus, high bed availability (HBA) may result in the admission of patients too well or too sick to benefit, whereas bed scarcity may result in refusal of patients likely to benefit from ICU admission."
Stride-related rein tension patterns in walk and trot in the ridden horse,"The use of tack (equipment such as saddles and reins) and especially of bits because of rein tension resulting in pressure in the mouth is questioned because of welfare concerns. We hypothesised that rein tension patterns in walk and trot reflect general gait kinematics, but are also determined by individual horse and rider effects. Six professional riders rode three familiar horses in walk and trot. Horses were equipped with rein tension meters logged by inertial measurement unit technique. Left and right rein tension data were synchronized with the gait."
Roles of palmitoylation and the KIKK membrane-targeting motif in leukemogenesis by oncogenic KRAS4A,"We have previously shown that palmitoylation is essential for NRAS leukemogenesis, suggesting that targeting RAS palmitoylation may be an effective therapy for NRAS-related cancers. For KRAS-driven cancer, although much research has been focused on the KRAS4B splice variant, which does not undergo palmitoylation, KRAS4A has recently been shown to play an essential role in the development of carcinogen-induced lung cancer in mice and to be widely expressed in human cancers. However, the role of palmitoylation in KRAS4A tumorigenesis is not clear."
Psychological distress and associated factors among prisoners in North West Ethiopia: cross-sectional study,"Currently, mental health is an important public health problem and the leading cause of disability worldwide. Studies have shown that, mental illnesses are more common among the prison population than the general population. However, still there is no accurate count of persons with mental disorder who are incarcerated in Ethiopia and information about prisoners’ health conditions is scarce. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of psychological distress among prisoner inmates found in prisons of Northwest, Ethiopia."
Auditory encoding abnormalities in children with autism spectrum disorder suggest delayed development of auditory cortex,"Findings of auditory abnormalities in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) include delayed superior temporal gyrus auditory responses, pre- and post-stimulus superior temporal gyrus (STG) auditory oscillatory abnormalities, and atypical hemispheric lateralization. These abnormalities are likely associated with abnormal brain maturation. To better understand changes in brain activity as a function of age, the present study investigated associations between age and STG auditory time-domain and time-frequency neural activity."
Efficient differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to arterial and venous endothelial cells under feeder- and serum-free conditions,"Heterogeneity of endothelial cells (ECs) is a hallmark of the vascular system which may impact the development and management of vascular disorders. Despite the tremendous progress in differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) towards endothelial lineage, differentiation into arterial and venous endothelial phenotypes remains elusive. Additionally, current differentiation strategies are hampered by inefficiency, lack of reproducibility, and use of animal-derived products."
A method for genotyping elite breeding stocks of leaf chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) by assaying mapped microsatellite marker loci,"Leaf chicory (Cichorium intybus subsp. intybus var. foliosum L.) is a diploid plant species (2n = 18) of the Asteraceae family. The term “chicory” specifies at least two types of cultivated plants: a leafy vegetable, which is highly differentiated with respect to several cultural types, and a root crop, whose current industrial utilization primarily addresses the extraction of inulin or the production of a coffee substitute. The populations grown are generally represented by local varieties (i.e., landraces) with high variation and adaptation to the natural and anthropological environment where they originated, and have been yearly selected and multiplied by farmers. Currently, molecular genetics and biotechnology are widely utilized in marker-assisted breeding programs in this species. In particular, molecular markers are becoming essential tools for developing parental lines with traits of interest and for assessing the specific combining ability of these lines to breed F1 hybrids."
Association between BDNF levels and suicidal behaviour: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Suicidal behaviour is a complex phenomenon with a multitude of risk factors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein crucial to nervous system function, may be involved in suicide risk. The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate and summarize the literature examining the relationship between BDNF levels and suicidal behaviour."
Factors associated with development of gastrointestinal problems in patients with scleroderma: a systematic review,"Up to 90 % of people with scleroderma have gastrointestinal (GI) problems such as constipation, bloating, diarrhea, and malabsorption. These problems significantly impair quality of life. Our objective was to determine the risk factors for gastrointestinal issues in people with scleroderma."
Lactobacilli with probiotic potential in the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster),"Recent research suggests integration of the intestinal 
microbiota in gut-brain communication which could lead to new approaches to treat neurological disorders. The highly social prairie voles are an excellent model system to study the effects of environmental factors on social behavior. For future studies on the role of probiotics in ameliorating disorders with social withdrawal symptoms, we report the characterization of intestinal Lactobacillus isolates with probiotic potential from voles."
Fitness cost in field and laboratory Aedes aegypti populations associated with resistance to the insecticide temephos,"The continued use of chemical insecticides in the context of the National Program of Dengue Control in Brazil has generated a high selective pressure on the natural populations of Aedes aegypti, leading to their resistance to these compounds in the field. Fitness costs have been described as adaptive consequences of resistance. This study evaluated the biological and reproductive performance of A. aegypti strains and a field population resistant to temephos, the main larvicide used for controlling mosquitoes."
Engineering transcription factors to improve tolerance against alkane biofuels in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Biologically produced alkanes can be used as ‘drop in’ to existing transportation infrastructure as alkanes are important components of gasoline and jet fuels. Despite the reported microbial production of alkanes, the toxicity of alkanes to microbial hosts could pose a bottleneck for high productivity. In this study, we aimed to improve the tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a model eukaryotic host of industrial significance, to alkane biofuels."
The impact of a single-nucleotide mutation of bgl2 on cellulase induction in a Trichoderma reesei mutant,"The filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei (anamorph of Hypocrea jecorina) produces increased cellulase expression when grown on cellulose or its derivatives as a sole carbon source. It has been believed that β-glucosidases of T. reesei not only metabolize cellobiose but also contribute in the production of inducers of cellulase gene expression by their transglycosylation activity. The cellulase hyper-producing mutant PC-3-7 developed in Japan has enhanced cellulase production ability when cellobiose is used as the inducer. The comparative genomics analysis of PC-3-7 and its parent revealed a single-nucleotide mutation within the bgl2 gene encoding intracellular β-glucosidase II (BGLII/Cel1a), giving rise to an amino acid substitution in PC-3-7, which could potentially account for the enhanced cellulase expression when these strains are cultivated on cellulose and cellobiose."
Two patients with small chromosome 22q11.21 alterations and central nervous system abnormalities,Central nervous system features have been rarely described to be associated with the small deletion or duplication of chromosome 22q11.21.
Copy number variants prioritization after array-CGH analysis – a cohort of 1000 patients,"Array-based comparative genomic hybridization has been assumed to be the first genetic test offered to detect genomic imbalances in patients with unexplained intellectual disability with or without dysmorphisms, multiple congenital anomalies, learning difficulties and autism spectrum disorders."
The Karnataka Anemia Project 2 — design and evaluation of a community-based parental intervention to improve childhood anemia cure rates: study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial,"Childhood anemia is highly prevalent worldwide. Improving the hemoglobin level of preschool age children could yield substantial benefits in cognitive and psychosocial development and overall health. While evidence-based recommendations for reducing childhood anemia in high anemia prevalence countries are available, there is no experimental evidence of community centered education and counseling programs, as a route to improved acceptance of iron supplements, demonstrating beneficial effects on anemia outcomes. We report on the evaluation protocol of a complex educational intervention led by the community lay health worker (LHW) and delivered to mothers of 12–59-month-old anemic children living in and visiting village day care centers in a large district of southern India."
Biliary reconstruction with or without an intraductal removable stent in liver transplantation: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"The incidence of biliary complications following liver transplantation (LT) remains high, ranging from 10 to 50 % of patients, especially when the diameter of the bile duct is smaller than 7 mm. Biliary reconstruction is most often performed by duct-to-duct anastomosis. In a preliminary study (n = 20), we previously reported a technique of biliary reconstruction using an intraductal stent tube followed by its endoscopic removal and showed both the feasibility and safety of this innovative procedure. The next step is to validate the potential benefit of this procedure in a randomized controlled trial."
"Porcine methionine sulfoxide reductase B3: molecular cloning, tissue-specific expression profiles, and polymorphisms associated with ear size in Sus scrofa","In Sus scrofa, methionine sulfoxide reductase B3 (MSRB3) is a crucial candidate gene for ear size, and an important conformational trait of pig breeds. However, challenges in MSRB3 cDNA amplification have prevented further identification of MSRB3 allelic variants influencing pig ear size."
Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of OTC use of simvastatin 10 mg for the primary prevention of myocardial infarction in Iranian men,"Several clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown the advantageous effects of statins in populations with different levels of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Considering the increasing cardiovascular risk among the Iranian population, the cost-effectiveness of the use of simvastatin 10 mg, as an Over-The-Counter (OTC) drug, for the primary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) was evaluated in this modeling study, from the payer's perspective. The target population is a hypothetical cohort of 45-year CVD healthy men with an average (15 %) 10-year CVD risk."
On the existence of impulsive neutral evolution differential inclusions with infinite delay,"In this paper, we use a fixed point principle regarding a condensing mapping with some measure of noncompactness. We assume there is no compactness assumption, and we give sufficient conditions for the existence of mild solutions to some classes of impulsive neutral evolution differential inclusions with infinite delay. A concrete example is presented in the end to illustrate the abstract theorem."
"Prediction of extubation failure in newborns, infants and children: brief report of a prospective (blinded) cohort study at a tertiary care paediatric centre in India","Extubation failure (EF), defined as need for re-intubation within 24–72 h, is multifactorial. Factors predicting EF in adults generally are not useful in children."
"Reproductive factors, tumor estrogen receptor status and contralateral breast cancer risk: results from the WECARE study","Several reproductive factors are known to be associated with risk of breast cancer; however, relationships between these factors with risk of second primary asynchronous contralateral breast cancer (CBC) have not been widely studied. The Women’s Environmental, Cancer, and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study is a population-based case-control study of 1521 CBC cases and 2212 individually matched controls with unilateral breast cancer. Using multivariable conditional logistic regression models, we examined associations between reproductive factors and CBC risk, and whether associations differed by estrogen receptor (ER) status and menopausal status of the first breast cancer. Older age at menarche was inversely associated with CBC risk (≥14 vs. ≤11 years risk ratio (RR) = 0.82, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.65–1.03, P
trend = 0.02). Among parous women, an increasing number of full-term pregnancies (FTP) was inversely associated with risk (≥4 vs. 1 FTP RR = 0.60, 95 % CI 0.41–0.88, P
trend = 0.005). Ever breast-feeding was inversely associated with CBC risk only among women with ER-negative first tumors (ever vs. never breast-fed RR = 0.69, 95 % CI 0.48–1.00, P
heterogeneity = 0.05). Older age at first FTP was inversely associated with CBC risk among women with ER-negative first tumors (≥30 vs. <20 years old RR = 0.66, 95 % CI 0.35–1.27, P
trend = 0.03), but suggestively positively associated with risk among women with ER-positive first tumors (P
heterogeneity = 0.03). Young age at menarche and low parity, both risk factors for first primary breast cancer, were also associated with overall CBC risk. Reductions in risk associated with breast-feeding were limited to women with ER-negative first tumors, who are at higher CBC risk than women with ER-positive primaries."
Subjective and objective assessment of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy,"Numbness and pain are currently evaluated using subjective methods such as the visual analog scale (VAS). However, because assessment of pain can vary greatly depending on the mood and physical state of the patient at the time of assessment, it is best to evaluate pain objectively. pain vision PS-2100 (PV) is an analytical instrument that was designed to quantitatively and objectively assess sense perception and nociception in patients. The present study examined the correlation of subjective and objective assessment of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (PN) using VAS and PV, respectively. The mean VAS and PV scores of PN were 20.5 (range 0–100) and 27.9 (range 0–416), respectively. The partial correlation coefficient was 0.274 (p = 0.0003). No strong correlation was observed between the results and a weak correlation was observed between VAS and PV."
TERT promoter mutations are a rare event in gastrointestinal stromal tumors,"Recently, the impact of telomere dysregulation on malignant progression has been reported in many cancers. A few studies have examined TERT promoter mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Irregular telomerase activation can be maintained by TERT hot spot alterations and alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) characterized by inactivation of either the alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) or death domain–associated protein (DAXX). To elucidate the clinicopathological impact of telomere dysregulation in GISTs, we examined 92 cases of GISTs for TERT promoter hot spot mutations along with immunohistochemical analysis of ATRX and DAXX expression, and compared these findings with the clinicopathological features. Univariate clinicopathological analysis revealed that tumor site, smaller tumor size, presence of necrosis, higher mitotic rate (>5/50 high-power fields) and risk classification were prognostic factors for either disease-free survival or overall survival. Two of 92 informative cases (2.2 %) were found to have heterozygous TERT promoter mutations (C228T), and these mutations occurred in a low-risk and a high-risk tumor, respectively. On immunohistochemical analysis for ATRX and DAXX, 16 (17.4 %) and 3 (3.3 %) of 92 cases showed loss of expression of ATRX and DAXX, respectively. Loss of expression of ATRX and DAXX were mutually exclusive except for one case. TERT promoter mutations were also mutually exclusive of the ALT phenotype. Telomere dysregulation was not associated with patient survival; however, telomere dysregulation was frequently observed in tumors of extra-gastric origin, which have an adverse outcome compared to those of gastric origin."
The arthroscopical and radiological corelation of lever sign test for the diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament rupture,"The aim of the current study was to evaluate the sensitivity of the lever sign test and the widely used basic tests of the Lachman, anterior drawer and pivot shift tests, both under anaesthesia and without anaesthesia, according to the gold standard diagnostic arthroscopic results in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The study included 117 patients, diagnosed with ACL tear which was definitively determined during an arthroscopic surgical procedure applied. Before anaesthesia and while under anaesthesia, the Lachman, anterior drawer, pivot shift and lever sign tests were applied to all patients. Evaluation was made of MR images for each patient and documented. The patients comprised 96 males and 21 females, witha mean age of 25.8 ± 5.9 years (range, 17–45 years). Total tear was determined in 82 cases, anteromedial (AM) bundle in 14, posterolateral (PL) bundle in 13 and elongation in 8. Pre-anaesthesia positivity was found in lever sign at 94.2 %, Lachman at 80.5 %, pivot shift at 62.3 % and anterior drawer at 60.1 %. These rates were determined after anaesthesia as lever sign 98.4 %, Lachman 88.7 %, pivot shift 88.3 % and anterior drawer 84.2 %. The lever sign test can be easily applied clinically and it seems to have higher sensitivity than the Lachman test which is the basis of classic information, it should be included in routine clinical practice. In the light of the results of this study, further studies are required to review the accepted view that the Lachmann test is the most reliable test."
Strong convergence theorems for multivalued mappings in a geodesic space with curvature bounded above,"We prove two strong convergence results of the Ishikawa iteration for a multivalued quasi-nonexpansive mapping in a complete geodesic space with curvature bounded above. Our results improve significantly the recent results of Panyanak (Fixed Point Theory Appl. 2014:1, 2014) in the sense that many restrictions in his results are weakened. In particular, we can conclude that the convergence result of the Mann iteration which cannot be deduced from Panyanak’s results."
A comparative study on the convergence rate of some iteration methods involving contractive mappings,"We compare the rate of convergence for some iteration methods for contractions. We conclude that the coefficients involved in these methods have an important role to play in determining the speed of the convergence. By using Matlab software, we provide numerical examples to illustrate the results. Also, we compare mathematical and computer-calculating insights in the examples to explain the reason of the existence of the old difference between the points of view."
Design of a controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of Supportive Parenting (‘Stevig Ouderschap’): an intervention to empower parents at increased risk of parenting problems by providing early home visits,"In the Netherlands, 15 % of all families with children under the age of 13 years deal with significant parenting problems. Severe parenting problems may lead to adverse physical, cognitive, and psychosocial outcomes for children, both in the short and long run. The intervention Supportive Parenting (in Dutch: “Stevig Ouderschap”) is a preventive program, which aims to reduce the risk of (developing) parenting problems among parents at risk of these problems. The intervention consists of six additional home visits by a Youth Health Care nurse during the first 18 months after childbirth and is focusing on the following elements of parental empowerment: activating social networks, increasing parenting skills and supporting parent(s)/caregiver(s) in getting grip on their own life."
Determinants of course completions in vocational education and training: evidence from Australia,"Completion rates in Australian vocational education and training (VET) are notoriously low. While there are conventional reasons such as issues with course, health, institutional factors, financial and family problems and dissatisfaction with the training experience, more VET specific explanations have included that students may discontinue their studies when they have obtained the specific skills they were seeking or they have gained employment. This present study seeks to examine whether the original intention of students at the time of enrollment along with satisfaction and the benefit that could be obtained from completion have any bearing on completion patterns."
Foot burns and diabetes: a retrospective study,"Diabetes in conjunction with a foot burn can compound the challenges in wound healing; however, the impact of diabetes on outcomes of patients with foot burns has not been examined."
Institutional landscapes affecting small-scale fishing in Southern Sri Lanka - legal pluralism and its socio-economic effects,"This paper demonstrates the variety of institutional arrangements affecting small-scale fishing in southern Sri Lanka, highlighting legal pluralism and focusing particularly on its consequences for livelihoods and resource conservation. Evidence derives from two landing centres in Hambantota District, and is grouped according to three institutional types: norms, community working rules and state working rules. The authors argue that these institutions play differential roles in providing access to fishing, preventing conflict, structuring fishing operations, reducing risks and conserving resources. Interactions between state and community legal systems consist of four types - indifference, competition, accommodation and mutual support. Institutional effectiveness is threatened most where implementation is poor or rules are in direct competition."
Association of brain injury and neonatal cytokine response during therapeutic hypothermia in newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy,Cytokines have been proposed as mediators of neonatal brain injury via neuroinflammatory pathways triggered by hypoxia-ischemia. Limited data are available on cytokine profiles in larger cohorts of newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) undergoing therapeutic hypothermia (TH).
Prediction of metabolic syndrome by a high intake of energy-dense nutrient-poor snacks in Iranian children and adolescents,Our aim was to investigate the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and energy-dense nutrient-poor solid snacks intakes during 3.6 y of follow-up among children and adolescents.
Strength and size relationships of the quadriceps and hamstrings with special reference to reciprocal muscle balance,"This study examined the association of muscle size and strength for the quadriceps and hamstrings, the relationship between the size of these muscles, and whether the H:Q size ratio influenced reciprocal strength balance—widely regarded as a risk factor for hamstrings injury."
"The blueberry (iron nodule) from the Shark Bay area, Western Australia and its implication to the genetic environments of iron nodules on Mars","Fist-sized iron nodules, extensively found on the ground of Western Australia, were investigated by element analysis (XRF, ICP-MS and ICP-AES), electron microscopes, X-ray diffraction and Mössbauser spectroscopy. Loosely-packed pisoidic structures of a few to >10 mm in size were observed in the cross-section of nodules. Chemically, the nodules are majorly made of O, Si, Fe and Al, and share similar REE pattern with the loess sourced Greatford concretions from New Zealand. Angular quartz particles, nano-sized goethite and hematite are found to be the major mineral phases. Other minerals, such as detrital zircon, barite and Ce-containing particles can also be observed but of very low abundance. No detectable carbonate or amorphous silica implies that these nodules have experienced little underground fluid alteration. The quartz particles showing particularly three sections of fractal size-distributions, together with their extensive broken features and conchoidal fractures, strongly suggest in situ fragmentation of the host rock with minimum later dynamic sorting. These observations indicate the genetic environment of those nodules is always close to the surface of the tectonically stable ground since their formation. Because of the similarity of climatic and geological features, the genesis and preservation environment of these nodules in Western Australia may provide clues on the formation of Martian iron concretions"
A reciprocating motion-driven rotation mechanism for the ATP synthase,"The ATP synthase (having a typical subunit composition of α3β3γδεab2c8-15) employs an intriguing rotary mechanism for the generation of ATP from ADP and Pi, using energy stored in a transmembrane proton gradient. The conventional rotary model, although being generally accepted, remains difficult to explain certain experimental observations. Here we propose an alternative rotary model for the ATP synthase such that what rotates is the catalytic α3β3 cylinder rather than the central stalk and the membrane-embedded c-ring. Specifically, the membrane translocation of protons would induce a cycled conformational change in the c-ring, leading to a reciprocating motion of the attached central stalk, which in turn drives the unidirectional rotation of the α3β3 cylinder. Such a reciprocating motion-driven rotation mechanism is somehow analogous to the working mechanism of a retractable click ballpoint pen. Our new model not only explains the experimental observations that have been difficult to reconcile with the conventional model but also avoids its theoretical illogicality."
Genome-wide analysis and expression profiling of the phospholipase D gene family in Gossypium arboreum,"The plant phospholipase D (PLD) plays versatile functions in multiple aspects of plant growth, development, and stress responses. However, until now, our knowledge concerning the PLD gene family members and their expression patterns in cotton has been limited. In this study, we performed for the first time the genome-wide analysis and expression profiling of PLD gene family in Gossypium arboretum, and finally, a total of 19 non-redundant PLD genes (GaPLDs) were identified. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, they were divided into six well-supported clades (α, β/γ, δ, ε, ζ and φ). Most of the GaPLD genes within the same clade showed the similar exon-intron organization and highly conserved motif structures. Additionally, the chromosomal distribution pattern revealed that GaPLD genes were unevenly distributed across 10 of the 13 cotton chromosomes. Segmental duplication is the major contributor to the expansion of GaPLD gene family and estimated to have occurred from 19.61 to 20.44 million years ago when a recent large-scale genome duplication occurred in cotton. Moreover, the expression profiling provides the functional divergence of GaPLD genes in cotton and provides some new light on the molecular mechanisms of GaPLDα1 and GaPLDδ2 in fiber development."
"Nothing New in Ecumenia? Hare, Hybrid Expressivism and de dicto Beliefs","One important trend in the debate over expressivism and cognitivism is the emergence of ‘hybrid’ or ‘ecumenical’ theories. According to such theories, moral sentences express both beliefs, as cognitivism has it, and desire-like states, as expressivism has it. One may wonder, though, whether the hybrid move is as novel as its advocates seem to take it to be—or whether it simply leads us back to the conceptions of early expressivists, such as Charles Stevenson or Richard Hare. Michael Ridge has recently argued that we ought not to see Hare as a hybrid expressivist because Hare’s approach allows for moral sentences that do not express any descriptive beliefs at all. Yet, Ridge’s reading has been challenged by John Eriksson, who even goes as far as to claim that modern hybrid expressivists should follow in Hare’s footsteps because it is Hare’s framework that actually provides a solution to the so-called ‘Frege-Geach problem’. In the present paper, I first want to show that we can defend Eriksson’s reading with regard to the official version of Hare’s theory. I will, secondly, argue that, in line with what we may take to be Ridge’s critical perspective on Hare, this official version faces serious difficulties, resulting from the possibility of unknown speaker standards. Thirdly, I will demonstrate that a modern reconstruction of Hare in terms of what I will refer to as ‘de dicto beliefs’, though in principle possible, will not allow us to solve the ‘Frege-Geach problem’."
Piccolo paralogs and orthologs display conserved patterns of alternative splicing within the C2A and C2B domains,"Piccolo is an organizational component of the presynaptic active zone, a specialized region of nerve terminals where synaptic vesicles fuse and release their neurotransmitter contents. Alternative splicing (AS) of the mouse Piccolo gene (PCLO) produces two primary splice isoforms: isoform-1 that includes two C2 domains (C2A and C2B) and isoform-2 with only C2A. Genome-wide association studies have identified variations located in or near the C2A domain of human Piccolo that predispose individuals to affective disorders and in rare cases leads to altered brain development. In zebrafish a genome duplication event led to the generation of PCLO-a and PCLO-b: gene paralogs that display strikingly similar genomic organization with other PCLO orthologs. Given this conservation in genomic structure, it is likely that AS patterns of zebrafish PCLO paralogs are similar to mammalian PCLO. We used a RT-PCR strategy to identify four zebrafish isoforms generated from zebrafish PCLO-a and PCLO-b that are equivalent to mouse Piccolo isoform-1 and isoform-2. Additionally, we identified an exon skipping event that leads to exclusion of a 27 nucleotide exon in both zebrafish Piccolo-a and Piccolo-b. Elimination of this exon in mammalian Piccolo alters the calcium binding property of the C2A domain. We also measured transcriptional levels of mouse and zebrafish Piccolo splice variants and demonstrate that despite similarities in AS, there are quantitative differences in gene expression. Our results indicate that AS of Piccolo is similar across diverse taxa and further support the use of zebrafish to study the role of Piccolo in neurodevelopment and synaptic signaling."
Linking short tandem repeat polymorphisms with cytosine modifications in human lymphoblastoid cell lines,"Inter-individual variation in cytosine modifications has been linked to complex traits in humans. Cytosine modification variation is partially controlled by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), known as modified cytosine quantitative trait loci (mQTL). However, little is known about the role of short tandem repeat polymorphisms (STRPs), a class of structural genetic variants, in regulating cytosine modifications. Utilizing the published data on the International HapMap Project lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), we assessed the relationships between 721 STRPs and the modification levels of 283,540 autosomal CpG sites. Our findings suggest that, in contrast to the predominant cis-acting mode for SNP-based mQTL, STRPs are associated with cytosine modification levels in both cis-acting (local) and trans-acting (distant) modes. In local scans within the ±1 Mb windows of target CpGs, 21, 9, and 21 cis-acting STRP-based mQTL were detected in CEU (Caucasian residents from Utah, USA), YRI (Yoruba people from Ibadan, Nigeria), and the combined samples, respectively. In contrast, 139,420, 76,817, and 121,866 trans-acting STRP-based mQTL were identified in CEU, YRI, and the combined samples, respectively. A substantial proportion of CpG sites detected with local STRP-based mQTL were not associated with SNP-based mQTL, suggesting that STRPs represent an independent class of mQTL. Functionally, genetic variants neighboring CpG-associated STRPs are enriched with genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci for a variety of complex traits and diseases, including cancers, based on the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) GWAS Catalog. Therefore, elucidating these STRP-based mQTL in addition to SNP-based mQTL can provide novel insights into the genetic architectures of complex traits."
Predicting long-term wear performance of hard-on-hard bearing couples: effect of cup orientation,"Wear is the major cause of implant failure, resulting in expensive revision surgeries of total hip arthroplasty. Therefore, understanding of wear mechanism and its progression is crucial to improve the physiological performance of implants. This paper presents a three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) wear modeling approach to estimate evolution of wear in hard-on-hard bearing components with the effect of cup abduction angle. Three bearing couples were considered, and they were PCD-on-PCD, Al2O3-on-Al2O3 and Si3N4-on-Si3N4, while the cup abduction angle varied from 35° to 70° with an increment of 5°. By adopting actual physiological hip gait loading and rotational movement for normal walking cycle in FE modeling, the contact pressure and the sliding distance were calculated to predict wear. A femoral head of 32 mm in diameter was considered, while a constant frictional contact at the inference between head and cup was used. During simulation, the geometry of cup surface was updated at a reasonable interval of gait cycles to consider the effect of wear. Wear was simulated for up to 20 million cycles which is an equivalent of 20 years of implant’s life in human body. Simulation results showed that compared to other two bearing couples, the predicted linear and volumetric wear in PCD-on-PCD couple exhibited the least wear evolution for all cup angles considered. The increase in abduction angle from 35° to 70° decreases the volumetric wear by 28 % for all three bearing couples, due to the reduction in sliding distance. Steep cup angle, e.g., 70° for Al2O3 and Si3N4 bearing couples, encountered edge contact, which leads to more wear. Further, wear results were discussed and analyzed with respect to in vitro and/or clinical studies available in the literature to justify the efficacy of wear modeling."
Surface deformation and reaction force estimation of liver tissue based on a novel nonlinear mass–spring–damper viscoelastic model,"Rheological soft tissue models play an important role in designing control methods for modern teleoperation systems. In the meanwhile, these models are also essential for creating a realistic virtual environment for surgical training. The implementation of model-based control in teleoperation has been a frequently discussed topic in the past decades, offering solutions for the loss of stability caused by time delay, 
which is one of the major issues in long-distance force control. In this paper, mass–spring–damper soft tissue models are investigated, showing that the widely used linear models do not represent realistic behavior under surgical manipulations. A novel, nonlinear model is proposed, where mechanical parameters are estimated using curve fitting methods. Theoretical reaction force curves are estimated using the proposed model, and the results are verified using measurement results from uniaxial indentation. The model is extended with force estimation by nonuniform surface deformation, where the surface deformation function is approximated according to visual data. Results show that using the proposed nonlinear model, a good estimation of reaction force can be achieved within the range of 0–4 mm, provided that the tissue deformation shape function is appropriately approximated."
On normalized compression distance and large malware,"Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) is a popular tool that uses compression algorithms to cluster and classify data in a wide range of applications. Existing discussions of NCD’s theoretical merit rely on certain theoretical properties of compression algorithms. However, we demonstrate that many popular compression algorithms do not seem to satisfy these theoretical properties. We explore the relationship between some of these properties and file size, demonstrate that this theoretical problem is actually a practical problem for classifying malware with large file sizes, and propose some variants of NCD that mitigate this problem."
Effect of Ni and Mn on the Creep Behaviour of 9–10 %Cr Steels with Low N and High B,"Creep behavior and microstructure of two 9–10 %Cr–3 %Co martensitic steels with high B and low N was examined. A 10 %Cr steel with low Ni and Mn additives exhibits superior creep resistance and no creep strength breakdown appears at 650 °C. In this steel a dispersion of boundary M23C6 carbides and Laves phase remains nearly unchanged under creep condition and no significant coarsening of lath structure takes place. In contrast, a 9 %Cr steel containing 0.4 wt% Mn and 0.24 %Ni exhibits the creep strength breakdown and relatively low long-term creep strength. In this steel the boundary particles are susceptible to significant coarsening under long-term creep. As a result, the tempered martensite lath structure (TMLS) tends to transform to subgrain structure; significant subgrain growth is observed. No distinct difference in effect of creep and long-term aging on a dispersion of M(C,N) carbonitrides was revealed between two steels."
Experimental Qualification of Mechanical and Electrical Sub-systems of a Complex Mechanism Against Fatigue Failure,"Absorber rod drive mechanisms (ARDM) play an important role in ensuring safety of a reactor by rapid insertion of an absorber rod during abnormal conditions. Various components/sub-systems of ARDMs, both mechanical and electrical, are subjected to different cyclic loadings during service life. Thus, qualifying these systems against fatigue is an important step for gaining confidence in their safe operation for the design life. ASME in Sec. III, Div. 1, Appendices (Para II—1500) provides guidelines for the experimental evaluation of the capability of components to withstand cyclic loading. These rules are developed for static components like pressure vessels. Since no such rules are available for moving components like mechanisms, the same were adopted for the ARDMs, with an understanding that the effect of inertia loads of a moving component are to be accounted in the experiments. In application of these rules to a complex mechanisms such as ARDM, various special cases arise which are not addressed explicitly in the code. The paper describes the intelligent adoption of the fatigue life rules given in ASME to various special cases and their extension to electrical systems. The paper also outlines the experiments carried out for qualifying the ARDM against fatigue."
Nonlinear material behaviour and failure of closed-cell polymer foams,"Classical strength criteria, like the von Mises criterion, are used to postulate the failure of ductile materials like steel or brass. It is known that for the application of foams in modern lightweight structures extended criteria are required, since foams are sensitive to hydrostatic stress. This observation on the macroscale can be explained by the deformation mechanisms of one single foam cell. Under hydrostatic stress, the deformation of the cell causes a non-uniform stress state of the cell walls. To understand the mechanism on the microlevel, a finite element model on the basis of a tetrakaidecahedron as unit cell was implemented. Utilising a strain energy-based homogenisation concept, the effective properties of the foam can be obtained. To adapt the geometric properties of the model to the real microstructure of the foam, results of a computer tomography image analysis were used by considering several imperfections in the cell geometry. For the analysis of the stress state on the microlevel, different load cases were applied to the unit cell. By means of these simulations, the geometrically nonlinear stress–strain curves on the macrolevel were deduced. Furthermore, the analysis of the finite element model provides an insight into the deformation mechanism on the microscale and allows the prediction of failure as well. Finally, the predicted failure points are represented in the Burzyński plane and compared with experimental results. The current paper focuses on the hard foam ROHACELL\({^{\circledR}}\) IG-series (industrial grade), which is a closed-cell PMI foam produced by Evonik Industries AG, Germany."
Sensitivity of regions of irregular and chaotic vibrations of an asymmetric rotor supported on journal bearings to structural parameters,"Rotating elements supported on journal bearings are widely encountered structures in engineering practice. Most commonly, these are asymmetrically manufactured and loaded rigid rotors transmitting torque and carrying transverse as well as axial forces. Nowadays, despite high operational demands and high rotational velocities, such systems are still expected to exhibit stable working, even in the presence of small assembly deviations, light unbalance or external disturbances. The surrounding environment of a rotating machine may interact with it by kinematic excitation from vibrating foundation. This, in turn, may lead to hazardous response and the onset of irregular and chaotic motion of the rotor. The subject of the study is to find and analyze regions of the occurrence of such vibrations in the system of a rigid rotor supported in journal bearings. The bearings themselves are assumed to be non-perfectly mounted in the housing, i.e., their sleeves are inserted in rings possessing some viscoelastic properties. These properties are treated as variable parameters, and the aim is to move the regions of irregular and chaotic vibration outside the operational regime (angular velocity). The adjustability of the viscoelastic parameters may be realized by incorporation of smart materials such as piezoelectric or magnetorheological ones. The considered system is an asymmetric rigid rotor supported on two journal bearings subject to a steady kinematic excitation. The system is described by eight coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations of motion. Results of the examinations prove that by selecting an appropriate magnitude of damping and stiffness of the bearing mountings, it is possible to enlarge the region of stable operation of the rotating system and thus secure its safety. This, however, does not mean the elimination of chaotic response at all, but only a shift of it outside the range of operational rotation speed."
Utility of ultrasound in noninvasive preoperative workup of neonatal brachial plexus palsy,Ultrasound has been utilized in the evaluation of compressive and traumatic peripheral nerve pathology.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in infants less than 12-month old,"There is a lack of literature on children compared to adults regarding the long-term effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), specifically in infants. The aim of the present study was to analyze the efficacy and safety of SWL in infants and also evaluate its potential adverse effects in the mid-term. Between May 1999 and December 2013, 36 infants with 39 renal units underwent SWL treatment for kidney stones with an electrohydraulic lithotripter (Dornier MPL 9000/ELMED Multimed Classic). All children were less than 12-month old. The mid-term effects of SWL were examined at the last follow-up by measuring arterial blood pressure, random blood glucose level and ipsilateral kidney size. Evaluation of treatment and its consequences was based on clinical examination, blood tests and conventional imaging (plain abdominal radiography and ultrasound). Overall stone-free rate was 84.6 % after 3-month follow-up without any major complications. Mid-term follow-up was available in 20 of 36 children with a mean follow-up of 3.2 ± 2.8 years (range 0.5–15.3). None of the infants were found to develop new onset of hypertension or diabetes. All treated infant kidneys’ sizes were in the normal percentile range. SWL for management of infant kidney stones is effective and safe in the mid-term."
Posttraumatic stress disorder among low-income women exposed to perinatal intimate partner violence,"Women exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) and other forms of lifetime trauma may be at risk for negative mental health outcomes including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The purpose of this study was to examine potential predictors of PTSD among low-income women exposed to perinatal IPV. This study analyzed baseline cross-sectional data from 239 low-income pregnant women in the USA who participated in a nurse home visitation intervention between 2006 and 2012 after reporting recent IPV. PTSD was assessed with the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) in which participants answer questions about the most disturbing traumatic event (MDTE) in their lifetime that affected them the week before the interview. In total, 40 % of the women were identified as having PTSD (DTS ≥40). PTSD prevalence significantly increased with age to nearly 80 % of women ages 30 and older (n = 23). Age was also the strongest predictor of PTSD (p < 0.001). Most participants (65 %) identified non-IPV-related traumas as their MDTEs. Psychological (94 %), physical (82 %), and sexual (44 %) violence were not significantly associated with PTSD status. Despite recent exposure to IPV, most participants identified other traumatic events as more disturbing than IPV-related trauma. Further, the risk for PTSD increased with age, suggesting that the cumulative effect of trauma, which may include IPV, increases the risk for PTSD over a lifetime. Implementing comprehensive screening for trauma during prenatal care may lead to the early identification and treatment of PTSD during pregnancy in a community setting."
Interest in a Twitter-delivered weight loss program among women of childbearing age,"Weight management through the childbearing years is important, yet few women have access to efficacious weight loss programs. Online social network-delivered programs may increase reach and thus impact. The aim of this study was to gauge interest in a Twitter-based weight loss intervention among women of childbearing age and the feasibility of recruitment via Twitter. We recruited English-speaking women aged 18–45 years (N = 63) from Twitter to complete an anonymous online survey including open-ended questions about program advantages and concerns. Forty percent of participants were obese and 83 % were trying to lose weight. Eighty-one percent were interested in a Twitter-delivered weight loss program. Interest was high in all subgroups (62–100 %). Participants (59 %) cited program advantages, including convenience, support/accountability, and privacy. Concerns (59 %) included questions about privacy, support/accountability, engagement, efficacy, and technology barriers. Research is needed to develop and evaluate social media-delivered interventions, and to develop methods for recruiting participants directly from Twitter."
Pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma: outcomes and survival predictors in 2504 surgical patients,"To evaluate outcomes and predictors of survival of pediatric thyroid carcinoma, specifically papillary thyroid carcinoma."
Does experimental paradoxical sleep deprivation (EPSD) is an appropriate model for evaluation of cardiovascular complications of obstructive sleep apnea?,Some of the previous studies have used animal model of paradoxical sleep deprivation for investigation of sleep loss complications. The present study is designed to examine the effectiveness and reliability of this model for investigation and assessment of some cardiovascular complications of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.
Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the stomach: clinical features and CT findings,The purpose of the study is to investigate the computed tomographic characteristic and clinical findings of gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma (G-NEC) to increase awareness of this disease.
The electrochemical properties of Ni3C carbide,"The electrochemical properties of Ni3C was studied. In acidic sulfate solutions, the carbide is characterized by high overpotential of its oxidation as compared with nickel. In the case of carbide oxidation, the anodic reaction orders with respect to anions are low, indicating a weak dependence of the rate of the anodic process on the solution composition. Significant differences in the kinetics of the anodic processes indicate different mechanisms of the oxidation of nickel and its carbide. The rate and kinetic parameters of the hydrogen evolution reaction are comparable on Ni and Ni3C. In neutral and alkaline solutions, the metal and carbide samples were similar in their electrochemical characteristics. The anodically grown oxide film is thinner on nickel carbide than on nickel metal, and the oxide formed on the carbide is more readily reduced under cathodic polarization. This film is also more resistant to the pitting attack than the oxide film on nickel metal."
Predicting South Korean University Students’ Happiness through Social Support and Efficacy Beliefs,"This study investigated the adversity and coping experiences of 198 South Korean university students and takes a cultural lens in understanding how social and individual factors shape their happiness. Hierarchical linear regression analyses suggest that Korean students’ perceptions of social support significantly predicted their happiness, particularly in their closer social circles. Additionally, their happiness was significantly shaped by their beliefs in their abilities to overcome difficult experiences, but not by their beliefs in maintaining their relationships. Findings demonstrate the importance of better preparing close family and friends to recognize and respond to warning signs, as well as exploring ways to build students’ internal coping assets within family and peer group settings."
Plant growth-promoting Bacillus suppress Brevicoryne brassicae field infestation and trigger density-dependent and density-independent natural enemy responses,"Soil-dwelling plant growth-promoting (PGP) Bacillus lives in intimate
 associations with plants; some species offer direct benefits via plant growth promotion while others confer protection against various pathogens. However, the roles of PGP Bacillus as elicitors of plant defences against agricultural pests and as a component of integrated pest management systems remain virtually unexplored. The effects of three major ubiquitous gram-positive rhizobacteria; Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens were studied individually and in admixture on (i) calabrese (sprouting broccoli, Brassica oleracea) vegetative and reproductive growth parameters and (ii) the population dynamics of the specialist cosmopolitan pest, cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae) infestation, and its important natural enemies; the braconid endoparasitoid (Diaeretiella
rapae), ladybird beetle (Coccinella septempunctata) and syrphid fly (all species). We found that all Bacillus treatments efficiently suppressed B. brassicae field populations in varying magnitudes. B. cereus and B. subtilis significantly increased the rates of parasitism by D. rapae, however, none of the other treated plants lured natural enemies, which responded in a density-dependent manner. Although the mixed Bacillus treatment significantly reduced root weight ratio, none of the Bacillus spp. treatments produced significant effects on calabrese growth. Taken together, PGP Bacillus may offer multiple plant benefits through suppressed pest infestation and increased percent parasitism in the field, with potential applications in integrated pest management."
"Protocol: a ‘One health’ two year follow-up, mixed methods study on antibiotic resistance, focusing children under 5 and their environment in rural India","Antibiotic resistance has been referred to as ‘the greatest malice of the 21st century’ and a global action plan was adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2015. There is a wealth of independent studies regarding antibiotics and resistant bacteria in humans, animals and their environment, however, integrated studies are lacking, particularly ones that simultaneously also take into consideration the health related behaviour of participants and healthcare providers. Such, ‘One health’ studies are difficult to implement, because of the complex teamwork that they entail. This paper describes the protocol of a study that investigates ‘One health’ issues regarding antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance in children and their environment in Indian villages."
Photodynamic inactivation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and biofilms by hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether,"The worldwide increase in bacterial antibiotic resistance has led to a search for alternative antibacterial therapies. A promising approach to killing antibiotic-resistant bacteria is photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy, which uses light in combination with a photosensitizer to induce a phototoxic reaction. We evaluated the photodynamic inactivation (PDI) efficiency of hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) on antibiotic-resistant bacteria and biofilms. HMME exhibited no significant dark toxicity and provided dose-dependent inactivation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and biofilms. After incubation with 100-μM HMME and irradiation with 72-J cm−2 white light, 4.19–7.59 log10 reductions in survival were achieved in planktonic suspension. Antibiotic-resistant strains were as susceptible to PDI in biofilms as in planktonic suspensions, but the inactivation of bacterial cells in biofilms was attenuated. In addition, gram-positive bacterial strains and biofilms were more susceptible than gram-negative strains and biofilms to the PDI effect of HMME. Thus, HMME is a promising photosensitizer for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, especially gram-positive bacteria."
"Engineering geomorphological characterisation of the Vajont Slide, Italy, and a new interpretation of the chronology and evolution of the landslide","Although the 1963 Vajont Slide in Italy has been extensively studied for over 50 years, its regional geological and geomorphological context has been neglected. In this paper, we use field observations and remote sensing data to elucidate the interaction between endogenic and exogenic processes that brought the north slope of Monte Toc to failure. We present the first detailed pre- and post-failure engineering geomorphology maps of the slide area. The maps delineate two main landslide blocks, several sub-blocks, compressional and extensional zones, and secondary failures in the deposit. The maps provide new insights into the kinematics, dynamics and evolution of the slide. Finally, we discuss the origin of Vajont Gorge and a prehistoric failure that occurred at the same location as the 1963 slide. We propose, as part of a newly developed multi-stage landscape evolution sequence, that the prehistoric failure was a deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (sackung) that initiated during deglaciation and continued to slowly move until the catastrophic failure in 1963. We argue that the gorge was created by these deep-seated slow movements."
Characterization and in vitro properties of potential probiotic Bifidobacterium strains isolated from breast-fed infant feces,"Probiotics are live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts, confer health benefits on the host. In this study, 13 strains of Bifidobacterium were isolated from three samples of breast-fed infant feces. The isolates were identified based on conservative gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. In vitro tests included survival under simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions, aggregation, hydrophobicity, intestinal epithelial cell adhesion, antimicrobial activity, and antibiotic resistance according to international guidelines for probiotics. The results suggest that B. bifidum, B. adolescentis, and B. breve had high adhesive ability compared with B. longum and B. catenulatum/B. pseudocatenulatum group strains. In particular, B. bifidum IF3-211 has a highest adhesion index (8273 ± 247 and 18,009 ± 1476 adhering bacteria per 100 HT-29 and Caco-2 cells, respectively), far higher than the two reference strains, B. lactis Bb12 and B. longum BBMN68. B. adolescentis IF1-11 showed highest autoaggregation (82.52 ± 0.24 %) and coaggregation (45.59 ± 4.16 %) with L. monocytogenes among isolates. In conclusion, B. bifidum IF3-211 and B. adolescentis IF1-11 showed promising characteristics as probiotic candidates that have good potential for application in food industry."
Topology optimization of PCLD on plates for minimizing sound radiation at low frequency resonance,"Topology optimization of passive constrained layer damping (PCLD) treatment patched on thin plates with respect to sound radiation at low frequency resonance is investigated. An extended solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) model is described using an interface finite element model for viscoelastic layer. Then the given FE mesh for base structure can remain the same during the optimization process. The objective function, radiated sound power, is simplified by using sound radiation mode and modal strain energy method, the merit of which is the complex dynamic equations of the composite plate need not to be solved and only modal analyses for the associated undamped modal equations are required. Numerical and experimental results show that significant reductions of the sound power are achieved. Two optimal topologies of the PCLD patches are analyzed. It’s shown that to minimize the sound radiation power at low frequency, not only the structural damping but also the volume velocity should be concerned."
Effects of interfacial conditions on shape optimization of cementless hip stem: an investigation based on a hybrid framework,"The typical biomechanical failure mechanisms associated with cementless Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) are initial micromotion, stress shielding and interface stresses. While the former is a short-term load-induced failure criterion affiliated with the post-surgery rehabilitation period, the other two mechanisms are relatively longer term phenomena. At immediate post-operative stage, biologic fixation through bone ingrowth is yet to occur and implant stability is determined by the initial micromotion. However, by the time the other failure mechanisms become prominent, sufficient bone ingrowth already prevails and consequently, the implant-bone interface characteristic changes. Therefore, any preclinical simulation aimed at designing femoral implants needs to account for this dual interfacial behaviour while dealing with these failure objectives. The present study implements a hybrid framework comprised of neural network (NN), genetic algorithm (GA) and finite element (FE) analysis for a multi-criteria 3-D shape optimization of cementless femoral implant by addressing the dual interfacial behaviour. Bonded interfacial condition was used to analyse the effects of stress shielding and interface stresses, whereas a set of contact models were used to develop an NN for faster prediction of the initial micromotion based on implant geometry. The final trade-off implant models were analysed and subsequently, compared with a generic design of femoral implant."
An age-dependent alteration of the respiratory exchange ratio in the db/db mouse,"The leptin receptor-deficient db/db mouse is a rodent model of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Diabetes in db/db mice shows an age-dependent progression, with early insulin resistance followed by an insulin secretory defect resulting in profound hyperglycemia. However, there is insufficient data on age-dependent changes of energy metabolism in db/db mice. We demonstrated an age-dependent decrease in the respiratory exchange ratio (RER), calculated by a ratio of VO2/VCO2, in db/db mice. The RER determined by indirect calorimetry, was 1.03 in db/db mice under 6 weeks of age, which were similar to those in heterozygote (db/+) and wild-type (+/+) mice. However, RER decreased from approximately 0.9 to 0.8 by 10 weeks of age and subsequently returned to approximately 0.9 at 22 weeks of age. The changes in RER were concurrent with the alterations in body weight and blood glucose level. However, other metabolic indicators such as glucose tolerance, changes in body fat mass, and urinary glucose levels, did not change with age. The results suggested that the energy source utilized in db/db mice changed with the age-related progression of diabetes."
Comparative analysis of anti-Helicobacter pylori activities of FEMY-R7 composed of Laminaria japonica and Oenothera biennis extracts in mice and humans,"Helicobacter pylori-eliminating effects of FEMY-R7, composed of Laminaria japonica and Oenothera biennis extracts, were investigated in mice and humans. Male C57BL/6 mice were infected with the bacteria by intragastric inoculation (1×109 CFU/mouse) 3 times at 2-day intervals, and simultaneously, orally treated twice a day with total 20, 64 or 200 mg/kg/day FEMY-R7 for 2 weeks. In Campylobcter-like organism (CLO)-detection tests on gastric mucosa and feces, FEMY-R7 reduced the urease-positive reactivity in a dose-dependent manner; i.e., the positivity ratios were decreased to 70, 20, and 10% for gastric mocosa and to 80, 50, and 20% for feces. In a clinical sudy, human subjects, confirmed to be infected with Helicobacter pylori, were orally administered twice a day with capsules containing total 100, 320 or 1,000 mg/man/day FEMY-R7 (matching doses for 20, 64 or 200 mg/kg/day, respectively, in mice from a body surface area-based dose translation) for 8 weeks. FEMY-R7 decreased the positivity ratios in feces to 70, 40, and 30%, respectively. In bacterial culture, H. pylori was identified from the CLO-positive stools of mice and humans. The bacterial identification ratios exhibited a good correlation between the matching doses in mice and humans. It is suggested that FEMY-R7 could be a promising functional food without tolerance as an adjunct to reduce the dosage of antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent H. pylori infection."
Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid administration increased biomechanical bone strength of rats’ vertebral body,"The aim of this study is to assess the effects of different glucocorticoid administration protocols on biomechanical properties of the first lumbar vertebral body in rats. We divided 40 male rats into the following groups: control, dexamethasone (7 mg/week), dexamethasone (0.7 mg/week), methylprednisolone (7 mg/kg/week), methylprednisolone (5 mg/kg twice weekly), dexamethasone (7 mg/kg three times per week), dexamethasone (0.7 mg/kg three times per week, and low-level laser treated rats. Lumbar vertebrae in rats were exposed to the pulsed laser. We conducted a biomechanical test to examine the mechanical properties of vertebral body in rats’ lumbar bone. Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid administration protocols did not impair the biomechanical properties of rats’ vertebral bodies compared to control and laser-treated rats. Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid administration caused an anabolic effect on the vertebral bodies."
The relaxing effect of Poncirus fructus and its flavonoid content on porcine coronary artery,"Coronary artery disease is a common occurrence in human, and causes enormous social cost. Poncirus fructus (PF), the dried immature fruits of Poncirus trifoliata Rafinesquem, is used in the treatment of womb contraction and dyspepsia, as a prokinetic, and in improving blood circulation. This study was performed to investigate the effects of PF and some of its flavonoids components on the coronary from the pig. The arterial ring was suspended by a pair of stainless steel stirrups in an organ bath. The end of the upper stirrup was connected to an isometric force transducer. A dose-dependent induction of relaxation was observed by both water and 70% ethanol extracts of PF in the porcine coronary artery precontracted with U46619 (100 nM), a stable analogue of the potent vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2. The 70% ethanol extract showed more efficacy than the water extract. Pretreatment of the artery with L-NAME (100 μM), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, resulted in a significant reduction in the relaxation induced by PF extract. In addition, ODQ (10 μM), a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor, also significantly reduced the effects of PF extracts. Hesperidin, a flavonoid present in PF, induced very weak relaxation of the porcine coronary artery at a high concentration (100μ,M), while its aglycone, hesperetin, demonstrated a dose-dependent relaxation. In conclusion, PF extracts induced relaxation in the porcine coronary artery, partially through the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway, and the aglycones of flavonoids might be also involved in the relaxation of the same artery."
Effectiveness of the combinational treatment of Laminaria japonica and Cistanche tubulosa extracts in hair growth,"Since scalp hair loss has increased recently even in young people, seriously affecting individual’s quality of life, the hair growth-stimulating effects of Laminaria japonica extract (LJE) and Cistanche tubulosa extract (CTE) were investigated. After confirming anagen phase of follicles under shaving, male C57BL/6 mice were dermally applied with 3% Minoxidil or orally administered with the combinations of LJE and CTE for 21 days. Minoxidil promoted the hair regrowth and increased γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities. In addition, Minoxidil up-regulated epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. Co-administration of LJE and CTE at 54 mg/kg LJE plus 162 mg/kg CTE exerted synergistic promoting effects on the hair regrowth, comparable to 3% Minoxidil. LJE preferentially enhanced ALP activity, while CTE increased both γ-GTP and ALP activities as well as EGF and VEGF expressions. In vivo air pouch inflammation model, carrageenan-induced vascular exudation and increased nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 concentrations in the exudates were synergistically suppressed by co-administration of LJE and CTE. In addition, inflammatory cell infiltration was substantially inhibited by the combinational treatment. The results suggest that combinational oral treatment with LJE and CTE in appropriate doses and ratios prevent hair loss and improve alopecia, which might be in part mediated by their anti-inflammatory activities."
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha deficiency impairs host defense against Streptococcus pneumoniae,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen that is involved in community-acquired pneumonia. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that activates immune responses against infection, invasion, injury, or inflammation. To study the role of TNF-α during S. pneumoniae infection, a murine pneumococcal pneumonia model was used. We intranasally infected C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) and TNF-α knockout (KO) mice with S. pneumoniae D39 serotype 2. In TNF-α KO mice, continuous and distinct loss of body weight, and low survival rates were observed. Bacterial counts in the lungs and blood of TNF-α KO mice were significantly higher than those in WT mice. Histopathological lesions in the spleen of TNF-α KO mice were more severe than those in WT mice. In TNF-α KO mice, severe depletion of white pulp was observed and the number of apoptotic cells was significantly increased. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), IL-12p70 and IL-10 levels in serum were significantly increased in TNF-α KO mice. TNF-α is clearly involved in the regulation of S. pneumoniae infections. Early death and low survival rates of TNF-α KO mice were likely caused by a combination of impaired bacterial clearance and damage to the spleen. Our findings suggest that TNF-α plays a critical role in protecting the host from systemic S. pneumoniae infection."
Hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of gallotannin-enriched extract isolated from Galla Rhois in ICR mice,"To evaluate the hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of Galla Rhois (GR) toward the liver and kidney of ICR mice, alterations in related markers including body weight, organ weight, urine composition, liver pathology and kidney pathology were analyzed after oral administration of 250, 500 and 1,000 mg/kg body weight/day of gallotannin-enriched extract of GR (GEGR) for 14 days. GEGR contained 68.7±2.5% of gallotannin, 25.3±0.9% of gallic acid and 4.4±0.1% of methyl gallate. Also, the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of lipid peroxidation, was decreased with 19% in the serum of high dose GEGR (HGEGR)-treated mice. The body and organ weight, clinical phenotypes, urine parameters and mice mortality did not differ among GEGR-treated groups and the vehicle-treated group. Furthermore, no significant increase was observed in alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and the serum creatinine (Cr) in the GEGR-treated group relative to the vehicle- treated group. Moreover, the specific pathological features induced by most toxic compounds such as CCI4 were not observed upon liver and kidney histological analysis. Overall, the results of the present study suggest that GEGR does not induce any specific toxicity in liver and kidney organs of ICR at doses of 1,000 mg/kg body weight/day, indicating that this is no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL)."
Near-Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy for Protein Content in Soybean Flour and Screening of Germplasm Across Different Countries,"Maintaining high protein content in soybean seeds is critical in view of the premium offered for protein content in soymeal in international market. Besides, quality of several soy-based products depends upon crude protein content of the initial raw material used. Determination of protein content in soybean seeds through wet chemistry involves use of chemicals and is time-consuming and labour-intensive. In the present investigation, a calibration model for determination of protein content in ground soyflour using non-destructive method of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRs) was developed. A set of samples with wide variation in protein content as measured through wet chemistry were scanned by NIRs between 1100 and 2100 nm at 2-nm interval. High determination coefficient (R
2) and low values for root-mean-square error as well as standard error of prediction of cross-validation confirmed the utility of model for prediction of future samples. For external validation, a set of genotypes from different genetic background were tested and were predicted with good accuracy. Lower values of standard error of calibration and prediction were observed than reported previously for whole seeds. Subsequently, 1210 soybean accessions from 18 countries were screened through NIRS. Average protein content of soybean accessions from different countries varied significantly. Genotypes identified for high protein content from different countries may be used for development of genotypes containing further high protein content."
A Study on Subchronic Inhalation Toxicity of 1-Chloropropane,"This study was conducted to measure toxicity of 1-chloropropane (CAS No. : 540-54-5). According to the OECD Test Guideline 413 (Subchronic inhalation toxicity: 90-day study), SD rats were exposed to 0, 310, 1,250, and 5,000 ppm of 1-chloropropane for 6 h/day, 5 day/week for 13 weeks via whole-body inhalation. Mortality, clinical signs, body weights, food consumption, motor activity, ophthalmoscopy, hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, organ weights, gross and histopathological findings were compared between control and all tested groups. No mortality or remarkable clinical signs were examined during the study. No gross lesions or adverse effects on body weight, food consumption, motor activity, ophthalmoscopy, urinalysis, hematology, organ weights were observed in any of male or female rats in all tested groups. In serum biochemistry, glucose was significantly decreased in males of 1,250 and 5,000 ppm groups compared to control group in dose-dependent relationship. In histopathological examination, vacuolation of acinar cells was observed in pancreas of all male and female groups exposed to 1-chloropropane. In conclusion, no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be below 310 ppm/6 h/day, 5 day/week for rats."
Acute and 28-Day Subacute Toxicity Studies of Hexane Extracts of the Roots of Lithospermum erythrorhizon in Sprague-Dawley Rats,"Lithospermum erythrorhizon has long been used as a traditional oriental medicine. In this study, the acute and 28-day subacute oral dose toxicity studies of hexane extracts of the roots of L. erythrorhizon (LEH) were performed in Sprague-Dawley rats. In the acute toxicity study, LEH was administered once orally to 5 male and 5 female rats at dose levels of 500, 1,000, and 2,000 mg/kg. Mortality, clinical signs, and body weight changes were monitored for 14 days. Salivation, soft stool, soiled perineal region, compound-colored stool, chromaturia and a decrease in body weight were observed in the extract-treated groups, and no deaths occurred during the study. Therefore, the approximate lethal dose (ALD) of LEH in male and female rats was higher than 2,000 mg/kg. In the subacute toxicity study, LEH was administered orally to male and female rats for 28 days at dose levels of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day. There was no LEH-related toxic effect in the body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, hematology, clinical chemistry and organ weights. Compound-colored (black) stool, chromaturia and increased protein, ketone bodies, bilirubin and occult blood in urine were observed in the male and female rats treated with the test substance. In addition, the necropsy revealed dark red discoloration of the kidneys, and the histopathological examination showed presence of red brown pigment or increased hyaline droplets in the renal tubules of the renal cortex. However, there were no test substance-related toxic effects in the hematology and clinical chemistry, and no morphological changes were observed in the histopathological examination of the kidneys. Therefore, it was determined that there was no significant toxicity because the changes observed were caused by the intrinsic color of the test substance. These results suggest that the no-observed-adverseeffect Level (NOAEL) of LEH is greater than 400 mg/kg/day in both sexes."
>Antioxidant Activity and Anti-wrinkle Effects of Aceriphyllum rossii Leaf Ethanol Extract,"We evaluated the antioxidant activity and anti-wrinkle effects of Aceriphyllum rossii leaf ethanol extract (ARLEE) in vitro using human dermal fibroblasts. The total polyphenol and flavonoid contents of ARLEE were 578.6 and 206.3 mg/g, respectively. At a concentration of 250 µg/mL, the electron-donating ability of ARLEE was 87.1%. In comparison with the vehicle, ARLEE treatment at 100 µg/mL significantly increased type I procollagen synthesis (p < 0.01) by 50.7%. In vitro ARLEE treatment (10 mg/mL) inhibited collagenase and elastase activity by 97.1% and 99.2%, respectively. Compared with the control, ascorbic acid treatment at 100 µg/mL significantly decreased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 protein expression (p < 0.01) by 37.0%. ARLEE treatment at 50 µg/mL significantly decreased MMP-1 protein expression (p < 0.01) by 46.1%. Ascorbic acid and ARLEE treatments at 100 µg/mL significantly decreased MMP-1 mRNA expression (p < 0.01) by 26.1% and 36.1%, respectively. From these results, we conclude that ARLEE has excellent antioxidant activity and even better anti-wrinkle effects than ascorbic acid in human dermal fibroblasts. These results suggest that ARLEE could be used in functional cosmetics for the prevention or alleviation of skin wrinkles induced by ultraviolet rays."
Treatment of BG-1 Ovarian Cancer Cells Expressing Estrogen Receptors with Lambda-cyhalothrin and Cypermethrin Caused a Partial Estrogenicity Via an Estrogen Receptor-dependent Pathway,"Synthetic pyrethroids (SPs) are the most common pesticides which are recently used for indoor pest control. The widespread use of SPs has resulted in the increased exposure to wild animals and humans. Recently, some SPs are suspected as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and have been assessed for their potential estrogenicity by adopting various analyzing assays. In this study, we examined the estrogenic effects of lambda-cyhalothrin (LC) and cypermethrin (CP), the most commonly used pesticides in Korea, using BG-1 ovarian cancer cells expressing estrogen receptors (ERs). To evaluate the estrogenic activities of two SPs, LC and CP, we employed MTT assay and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in LC or CP treated BG-1 ovarian cancer cells. In MTT assay, LC (10−6 M) and CP (10−5 M) significantly induced the growth of BG-1 cancer cells. LC or CP-induced cell growth was antagonized by addition of ICI 182,720 (10−8 M), an ER antagonist, suggesting that this effect appears to be mediated by an ER-dependent manner. Moreover, RT-PCR results showed that transcriptional level of cyclin D1, a cell cycle-regulating gene, was significantly up-regulated by LC and CP, while these effects were reversed by co-treatment of ICI 182,780. However, p21, a cyclin D-ckd-4 inhibitor gene, was not altered by LC or CP. Moreover, ERα expression was not significantly changed by LC and CP, while downregulated by E2. Finally, in xenografted mouse model transplanted with human BG-1 ovarian cancer cells, E2 significantly increased the tumor volume compare to a negative control, but LC did not. Taken together, these results suggest that LC and CP may possess estrogenic potentials by stimulating the growth of BG-1 ovarian cancer cells via partially ER signaling pathway associated with cell cycle as did E2, but this estrogenic effect was not found in in vivo mouse model."
Effect of Hfe Deficiency on Memory Capacity and Motor Coordination after Manganese Exposure by Drinking Water in Mice,"Excess manganese (Mn) is neurotoxic. Increased manganese stores in the brain are associated with a number of behavioral problems, including motor dysfunction, memory loss and psychiatric disorders. We previously showed that the transport and neurotoxicity of manganese after intranasal instillation of the metal are altered in Hfe-deficient mice, a mouse model of the iron overload disorder hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). However, it is not fully understood whether loss of Hfe function modifies Mn neurotoxicity after ingestion. To investigate the role of Hfe in oral Mn toxicity, we exposed Hfe-knockout (Hfe-/-) and their control wild-type (Hfe+/+) mice to MnCl2 in drinking water (5 mg/mL) for 5 weeks. Motor coordination and spatial memory capacity were determined by the rotarod test and the Barnes maze test, respectively. Brain and liver metal levels were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Compared with the water-drinking group, mice drinking Mn significantly increased Mn concentrations in the liver and brain of both genotypes. Mn exposure decreased iron levels in the liver, but not in the brain. Neither Mn nor Hfe deficiency altered tissue concentrations of copper or zinc. The rotarod test showed that Mn exposure decreased motor skills in Hfe+/+ mice, but not in Hfe-/- mice (p = 0.023). In the Barns maze test, latency to find the target hole was not altered in Mn-exposed Hfe+/+ compared with water-drinking Hfe+/+ mice. However, Mn-exposed Hfe-/- mice spent more time to find the target hole than Mn-drinking Hfe+/+ mice (p = 0.028). These data indicate that loss of Hfe function impairs spatial memory upon Mn exposure in drinking water. Our results suggest that individuals with hemochromatosis could be more vulnerable to memory deficits induced by Mn ingestion from our environment. The pathophysiological role of HFE in manganese neurotoxicity should be carefully examined in patients with HFE-associated hemochromatosis and other iron overload disorders."
Insights into the role of seaweed Kappaphycus alvarezii sap towards phytohormone signalling and regulating defence responsive genes in Lycopersicon esculentum,"Seaweeds, an integral part of marine coastal environment, are an important food, industrial raw materials and biostimulants for crop growth due to the presence of a number of plant growth stimulants. The sap of an economically important seaweed Kappaphycus alvarezii (K-sap) is gaining momentum for sustainable intensification of agricultural productivity. In the present study, the phytohormone levels and transcript regulation of defence-related genes were studied in tomato seedlings in response to K-sap application alone and in combination with the fungus Macrophomina phaseolina, the causal agent of charcoal rot in tomato. The application of K-sap alone and in combination with fungus M. phaseolina significantly increased the concentration of ABA, IAA, SA and zeatin hormones. The enhanced transcript of pathogenesis related genes (PR-1b1, PR-3 and PR-5) was observed in response to application of K-sap alone and in combination with fungus M. phaseolina in tomato. The transcription factor, Pti4 and mitogen-activated kinase pathway gene, MPK2 also showed transcript accumulation on combined treatment of Macrophomina and K-sap. This is the first report highlighting the differential regulation of defence-related genes in accordance with phytohormone levels on application of seaweed sap."
Mass spectrometry-based analyses showing the effects of secretor and blood group status on salivary N-glycosylation,"The carbohydrate portions of salivary glycoproteins play important roles, including mediating bacterial and leukocyte adhesion. Salivary glycosylation is complex. Many of its glycoproteins present ABO and Lewis blood group determinants. An individual’s genetic complement and secretor status govern the expression of blood group antigens. We queried the extent to which salivary glycosylation varies 
according to blood group and secretor status. First, we screened submandibular/sublingual and parotid salivas collected as ductal secretions for reactivity with a panel of 16 lectins. We selected three lectins that reacted with the largest number of glycoproteins and one that recognized uncommon lactosamine-containing structures. Ductal salivas representing a secretor with complex blood group expression and a nonsecretor with a simple pattern were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gel slices were trypsin digested and the glycopeptides were individually separated on each of the four lectins. The bound fractions were de-N-glycosylated. LC–MS/MS identified the original glycosylation sites, the peptide sequences, and the parent proteins."
Structural analysis of hanging wall and footwall blocks within the Río Guanajibo fold-and-thrust belt in Southwest Puerto Rico,"The Río Guanajibo fold-and-thrust belt (RGFT), composed of Cretaceous serpentinite and volcano-sedimentary rocks, represents the deformation front of a contractional event in SW Puerto Rico during the Paleogene. Previous studies inferred structural and stratigraphic relationships from poorly exposed outcrops. New road cuts exposed the Yauco (YF) and El Rayo Formations (ERF) providing insights on the deformation of the hanging wall and footwall. We described the nature and orientation of faults and folds and analyzed the kinematic indicators to characterize the deformation. The YF occurs in the hanging wall and shows a sequence of folded, medium-bedded mudstone and thinly bedded shale and sandstone. Major folds strike NW–SE and are gentle with steeply inclined axial planes and sub-horizontal fold axes. Minor folds are open with moderately inclined axial planes and gently to moderately inclined SE-plunging fold axes. NW–SE striking reverse and thrust faults cut layers and show movement to the SW. Steep left-lateral faults strike NW–SE and NE–SW, and smaller right-lateral strike-slip faults strike NNE–SSW. At the footwall, the ERF consists of bioclastic limestone and polymictic orthoconglomerates and paraconglomerates. Reverse and strike-slip faults cut along lithological contacts. Results suggest that the hanging wall and footwall accommodated strain along preexisting weaknesses, which are dependent on lithology and sedimentary structures. The kinematic analysis suggests that shortening in the NE–SW direction was partitioned between folding and interlayer shortening, accommodated by flexural slip, and reverse and left-lateral faults that resulted from contraction. The RGFT represents the Paleogene back arc deformation of a bivergent thrust system."

Context-dependent effects of abandonment vs. grazing on functional composition and diversity of sub-Mediterranean grasslands,"Though the interplay of grazing intensity and the availability of resources is a key driver in grassland composition, very few studies focused on trait changes after abandonment along productivity gradients. Through a comparative approach, we aimed to assess the context-dependent effects of long-term grazing cessation on functional composition and diversity in sub-Mediterranean grasslands. We hypothesized that variability of topography, soil and vegetation structure on a fine scale drives the trait-based dynamics after long-term abandonment, also influencing the patterns of functional diversity. On a calcareous mountain ridge of central Italy, we collected data on species cover and traits, site characteristics, soil depth and vegetation structure in 0.5 m × 0.5 m plots located in extensively grazed pastures and in grasslands abandoned since the early 1970s. We analysed patterns of species and traits in relation to environmental variables and management type, and trends in functional diversity (FD, Rao’s quadratic entropy) along a productivity gradient. We found that grazing cessation reduced the overall FD and that the direction of species and trait response after long-term grazing cessation were affected, on a fine scale, by the soil depth / productivity gradient. In dryer conditions, species and functional responses were less affected by abandonment, and were devoted to resistance to both stress and disturbance. In abandoned pastures we detected a significant decrease in FD with increasing productivity, leading to a shift from functional strategies devoted to grazing avoidance and tolerance to those devoted to competition for light and resource acquisition. This trend was related to the filtering effect of coarse tall grasses, which spread in highly productive conditions. In grazed grasslands, we detected an overall increasing trend of FD with increasing productivity, confirming the key role of extensive grazing in maintaining high levels of FD."
Wild boar rooting intensity determines shifts in understorey composition and functional traits,"In recent decades, the European populations of wild boar have grown substantially, as has the impact of this species, owing above all to its rooting activity. Our aim was to investigate the relationships between vascular plant understorey and wild boar rooting intensity. The questions we addressed are: does rooting intensity influence understorey species composition and diversity? Which functional traits are associated with different levels of rooting? We performed a comparative analysis of plant communities in areas with contrasting levels of rooting intensity within a Mediterranean deciduous lowland forest in central Italy. Besides comparing species composition and diversity, we tested the association between species traits and rooting levels through fourth-corner analysis. We found that contrasting levels of rooting were associated to different understorey species composition and evenness, while we observed no significant difference in species richness. In contrast with our expectations, sites with lower rooting returned i) lower evenness values and ii) a higher proportion of species characterized by traits related to resistance or response to herbivory, i.e., spinescence, clonality, endozoochory, underground storage organs, and low height values. Our findings suggest that current vegetation patterns partly depend on the legacy effect of past rooting disturbance, since the areas currently subjected to low rooting intensity were likely to be intensely rooted in the past. These areas may have developed a marked dominance of clonal thorny species that, in turn, inhibited further feeding activities by wild boar."
Characteristics and Biodiversity of Endophytic Phosphorus- and Potassium-Solubilizing Bacteria in Moso Bamboo (Phyllostachys Edulis),"Endophytic phosphorus- and potassium-solubilizing bacteria were screened from the root, rhizome, stem, and leaves of Moso Bamboo, and their diversity was analyzed using their 16S rDNA sequences. Twenty endophytic phosphorus and potassium-solubilizing bacteria were screened from 82 bamboo plants, among which the CT-B09-2, WYS-A01-1 and JL-B06 had higher activities in decomposing organophos-phates. The three species showed a decomposition diameter/colony diameter (D/d) of 5.05, 4.19 and 2.95, respectively, and a solubilizing activity of 81.77 mg/L, 77.85 mg/L and 63.69 mg/L, respectively. JL-B06, WYS-A01-1 and CT-B09-2 had higher activities in decomposing inorganic phosphorus, with a decomposition diameter/colony diameter (D/d) of 2.34, 2.12 and 1.82, respectively, and a solubilizing activity of 30.58 mg/L, 38.89 mg/L and 48.35 mg/L, respectively. CT-B21, WYS-A03-1 and JL-B06 had higher activities in decomposing potassium, with a decomposition diameter/colony diameter (D/d) of 3.37, 4.84 and 4.33, respectively, and a solubilizing activity of 2.81 mg/L, 2.54 mg/L and 2.46 mg/L, respectively. The 16S rDNA sequence analysis showed that the 20 phosphorus- and potassium-solubilizing bacteria belong to 14 species from 10 genera, and mainly consist of Alcaligenes spp., Enterobacter spp. and Bacillus spp. Our results demonstrate the abundant diversity of endophytic phosphorus- and potassium-solubilizing bacteria in Moso Bamboo."

Local and regional scale biodiversity patterns of forest snail assemblages in Tuscany (central Italy),"The land mollusc faunas of three forest areas of Tuscany (central Italy) were sampled to test the effect of geographical and environmental factors on the structure of biodiversity. A total of 60 sites were surveyed in the years 2009-2011, recording species richness and abundance of snails in 400 m2 plots randomly selected in beech and oak woods. Sampling strategy relied on a combination of visual search and litter analysis. Environmental variables (topsoil pH and altitude) and UTM coordinates were recorded to detect relationships with species richness and number of individuals per plot. Abundance data were analyzed using non-metric multidimensional scaling and canonical correspondence analysis; faunal similarity within and between areas was computed by the Bray Curtis index and snail assemblages of the two forest types were compared. A total of 55 species were recorded, with low values of local richness and abundance per site compared to other forest sites in central and northern Europe. Total richness was similar in the three areas, but composition and local richness varied significantly between them. Geographical factors explained the highest percentage of variance, while habitat type, altitude and pH only accounted for a minor part. Internal similarity was greater than between-area similarity in two out of three areas. Beech forests had richer and more heterogeneous faunas, but lower levels of abundance than oak woods. The results are discussed in terms of historical biogeography and local environmental conditions, and compared with those from similar surveys across Europe."
Long-term density fluctuations and microhabitat use of sympatric Apodemus flavicollis and Myodes glareolus in central Italy,"The role and importance of interspecific competition for rodent communities have been much debated issues, with some early authors suggesting that these are important, and several recent articles suggesting the contrary. In this paper, we studied, for 14 years at a mountainous locality in central Italy, the coexistence dynamics of a two-species system (Apodemus flavicollis, Myodes glareolus) within a 1.44 ha trapping grid, by Capture-Mark-Recapture. Overall, we captured over 1000 rodents during the study period, with annual abundance ranging 2-7 individuals × ha−1. However, the density of the two species varied substantially across years and between sectors of the study plot. Thus, the distributions of the two species on the scale of the study grid were not related to one another. Density of a given species did not affect the percentage of lactating females in either A. flavicollis or M. glareolus. Individual traps differed in their rate of capture such that about 40% of traps were associated more with a particular species. Considering the spatial distribution of traps, we determined that three areas were associated with high probability of capture for only one of the two study species, two of these areas being associated to A. flavicollis and one to M. glareolus. Our analyses suggest that interspecific competition may be present at the local micro-scale, as explained by the fact that in the great majority of the cases in which a given trap was highly successful in capturing one species, it was also very unsuccessful in capturing the other species. However, manipulation experiments are needed to confirm that suggestion."
Metabolic Response to Subacute and Subchronic Iron Overload in a Rat Model,"One of the common causes of iron overload is excessive iron intake in cases of iron-poor anemia, where iron saccharate complex (ISC) is routinely used to optimize erythropoiesis. However, non-standardized ISC administration could entail the risk of iron overload. To induce iron overload, Wistar rats were intra-peritoneally injected with subacute (0.2 mg kg−1) and subchronic (0.1 mg kg−1) overdoses of ISC for 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. Iron status was displayed by an increase in transferrin saturation (up to 332%) and serum and liver iron burden (up to 19.3 μmol L−1 and 13.2 umol g−1 wet tissue, respectively) together with a drop in total and unsaturated iron binding capacities “TIBC., UIBC” as surrogate markers of transferrin activity. Iron-induced leukocytosis (up to 140%), along with the decline in serum transferrin markers (up to 43%), respectively, mark positive and negative acute phase reactions. Chemical stress was demonstrated by a significant rise (p>0.05) in indices of the hemogram (erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocytes) and stress metabolites [corticosterone (CORT) and lactate]. Yet, potential causes of the unexpected decline in serum activities of ALT, AST and LDH (p>0.05) might include decreased hepatocellular enzyme production and/or inhibition or reduction of the enzyme activities. The current findings highlight the toxic role of elevated serum and liver iron in initiating erythropoiesis and acute phase reactions, modifying iron status and animal organ function, changing energy metabolism and bringing about accelerated glycolysis and impaired lactate clearance supposedly by decreasing anaerobic threshold and causing premature entering to the anaerobic system."

These areas may have developed a marked dominance of clonal thorny species that, in turn, inhibited further feeding activities by wild boar."
Humped-back shaped response of plant species richness to increasing shrub encroachment in calcareous grasslands,"In the present study, we examined the effect of shrub encroachment in temperate semi-natural grasslands on plant species diversity. We tested the hypothesis that an initial shrub encroachment leads to enhanced habitat heterogeneity and thereby to a higher diversity. In a calcareous grassland near Göttingen (Germany) we analysed the effect of shrub encroachment on the species richness in 30, 100 m2 plots each with 10 subplots of 1m2 size. The 30 main plots belonged to six different shrub encroachment classes. A descriptive correlative gradient analysis of shrub invaded grasslands and their species number of flowering plants was performed. Within the 30 plots of different shrub encroachment a total of 203 plant species were recorded. The mean α1-diversity (level of subplots), mean α2-diversity (level of plots) as well as the α3-diversity (level of shrub encroachment classes) have their highest values at medium shrub invaded sites. This finding is in line with our hypothesis of a hump-back relation between shrub encroachment and species richness, and can be explained by the increased habitat heterogeneity. However, Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) emphasized the importance of the present vegetation composition for species richness. The dominance of highly competitive, clonal-growing grass species is accompanied by low diversity swards with a lower facilitation of shrub establishment. Species accumulation curves highlight the benefit of shrub encroachment for γ-(landscape-) diversity. This result emphasises the importance of habitat heterogeneity for biodiversity and, therefore, nature conservation."
The influence of coyote on Canada lynx populations assessed at two different spatial scales,"Previous studies have suggested that the attenuation of Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) cyclic dynamics with decreasing latitude may be the consequence of a reduced specialization on the lynx’s primary prey, snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus). However, intraguild competitive interactions remain largely unexplored in situations where the temporal dynamics of food resources is pronounced, and lynx populations in the south of their distribution may be negatively affected by interspecific competition with other carnivores. In this paper, we used spectral analysis of fur harvest data collected at the state (US) and province (Canada) level to explore the spatial gradient of cyclic dynamics in lynx. Although some patterns were consistent with the ‘diet specialization’ hypothesis, we found that temporal variance of cycling propensity peaked at mid-latitudes, where transient, non-cyclic periods, coexisted with regular 10-year cycles. In these mid-latitude zones, non-cyclic periods did not coincide with loss of snowshoe hare cycling as demonstrated by historical records, and were not more frequent in recent decades as could be expected under a ‘climatic forcing’ scenario. Instead, we show that non-cyclic periods tended to coincide with periods of high coyote (Canis latrans) abundance and periods when coyotes apparently tracked snowshoe hare abundance as suggested by significant 10-year cycles lagging one or two years behind hare peaks. We used landscape-scale (trapline) fur harvest returns from five provinces in Canada to further probe the importance of interspecific competition in Canada lynx population dynamics. Accounting for coyote distribution and abundance did not bring additional explanatory and predictive power to models based solely on environmental and autecological predictors, suggesting that competition with coyote is not a force driving population abundance and cyclicity among lynx. We discuss the possible factors behind the apparent lack of consistency across spatial scales and recommend that further studies examine species interactions at a smaller (local) scale."

Comparison between natural and impacted Alpine lakes six years after hydropower exploitation has ceased,"Many lakes in mountain regions have been used for hydropower generation since the 1950s. It has been estimated that as many as 79% of the rivers in the Alps have been affected by the presence of hydropower plants. In this context, the shutting down of hydropower plants on a group of Alpine lakes represented a good opportunity to study the ecological impact on them. We selected nine lakes that had been affected and nine that had not, and analysed the differences in environment, littoral diatoms and zoobenthos, phytoplankton, Zooplankton, and fish. Results showed that benthic biota-diatoms and zoobenthos- were the most affected by water-level drawdown during winter months. Even six years after the end of hydroelectric operations, diatom species richness and diversity were lower in impacted lakes. Assemblage structure was different for both diatoms and zoobenthos. Phytoplankton and Zooplankton were similar in impacted and unaffected lakes in terms of both species richness (and diversity) and assemblage structure. The degree of impact on fish was unclear because illegal stocking of lakes with allochthonous fish species had taken place. This study showed that compared to limnetic biota, littoral communities were the most affected by the decrease in water volume every winter. Six years after the end of hydroelectric operations, diatoms, and to lesser extent zoobenthos, were still different compared to those in natural (unaffected) lakes. Planktic communities seem to be either more resistant to the disturbances, or else able to recover more quickly to their former condition."
"Molecular dynamics simulation and docking studies on novel mutants (T11V, T12P and D364S) of the nucleotide-binding domain of human heat shock 70 kDa protein","The aim of investigating protein interaction between Homo sapiens adenovirus and heat shock 70 kDa protein (Hsp70) is to study a potentially synergistic interaction that would enhance the anti-apoptotic mechanisms, hence increasing the virus replication rate and improve the killing efficiency of tumour cells in cancer therapy. Currently, the protein interaction between Hsp70 and E1A 32 kDa of human adenovirus C serotype 5 (Ad5) is still unknown. Mutant models (T11V, T12P and D364S) were built, simulated and their interactions with Ad5 were studied. The E1A 32 kDa of human Ad5 motif (PNLVP) showed the lowest binding energy and intermolecular energy values with the novel T11V mutant at −8.26 kcal/mol and −11.21 kcal/mol. The protein-ligand complex models revealed that the T11V mutant had the strongest and most stable interaction with the PNLVP motif among all the four protein-ligand complex structures. This knowledge would assist future in vivo investigations of this protein-ligand complex structure in cancer treatment research."
Short-horned grasshopper subfamilies feed at different rates on big bluestem and switchgrass cultivars,"Grasshopper species belonging to subfamilies Melanoplinae, Gomphocerinae and Oedipodinae were tested for their feeding rate on three types of grass. All grasshopper species were offered Shawnee and Kanlow cultivars of switchgrass, Panicum virgatum L. and big bluestem, Andropogon gerardii Vitman. The grasshoppers, Melanoplus femurrubrum and Melanoplus differentialis were also tested for their feeding on turgid or wilted leaves of the Shawnee cultivar of switchgrass. We found that M. differentialis consumed more switchgrass compared to big bluestem while M. femurrubrum and Arphia xanthoptera consumed the most Shawnee switchgrass. The M. differentialis consumed more turgid grass compared to wilted switchgrass. The feeding performances show differences among grasshopper species even in the same subfamily and suggest that Melanoplinae grasshoppers may become destructive pests of switchgrass planted for biofuel production."
Comparison of the anatomical arrangement of the branches arising from the descending aorta in rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus f. domestica) and European hare (Lepus europaeus),"The aim of the study was to describe the possible anatomical variations in origin of the branches arising from the descending aorta in rabbit and hare. The study was carried out on ten adult rabbits and ten adult European hares. The study was carried out using the corrosion technique. After the euthanasia, the vascular network was perfused with saline. Spofacryl Dental © was used as a casting medium. After polymerisation of the medium, the maceration was carried out in KOH solution. We found high variability in origin of the branches arising from the descending aorta in both species. The variations in the level of the origin of the celiac artery, cranial mesenteric artery, renal arteries, ovarian arteries, testicular arteries and caudal mesenteric artery were present between both species and within the same species. In some individuals of both species, variations in the level and the arrangement of the origin of the dorsal intercostal arteries, lumbar arteries and median sacral artery were present. According to our results, it can be concluded that the anatomical arrangement of branches of descending aorta shows a higher number of variations in domesticated rabbit in comparison with the hare."
Cholangiocarcinoma Heterogeneity Revealed by Multigene Mutational Profiling: Clinical and Prognostic Relevance in Surgically Resected Patients,"Cholangiocarcinoma can be classified in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PCC). Moreover, PCC includes two different forms: extrahepatic (EH) PCC, which arises from the perihilar EH large ducts, and intrahepatic (IH) PCC, in which a significant liver mass invades the perihilar bile ducts. In this study, we investigated the molecular profile and molecular prognostic factors in EH-PCC, IH-PCC, and ICC submitted to curative surgery."
"Practical issues related to uterine pathology: staging, frozen section, artifacts, and Lynch syndrome","This review covers three areas in endometrial tumor pathology: International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging, the use of frozen section, and Lynch syndrome. The section on FIGO staging will emphasize problems that practicing pathologists often confront, such as measuring the depth of myometrial invasion, assessing for the presence of cervical stromal invasion, detecting low-volume lymph node metastases, and recognizing synchronous endometrial and ovarian tumors and artifacts. The frozen section portion of this review will focus on the performance characteristics of intraoperative examination of the uterus to determine tumor grade and depth of myometrial invasion, including suggestions for alternative methods. The last portion of this review will provide an overview of Lynch syndrome and a discussion of the rationale and methods of screening for Lynch syndrome."
Practical issues in uterine pathology from banal to bewildering: the remarkable spectrum of smooth muscle neoplasia,"Among mesenchymal tumors of the uterus, smooth muscle neoplasms are most common. The wide morphologic spectrum, especially within the category of leiomyomas, is responsible for diagnostic problems more frequently with leiomyosarcoma (including mitotically active, apoplectic, and leiomyoma with bizarre nuclei) but also with endometrial stromal tumors. In the former scenario, clinical information, gross appearance as well as strict utilization of morphologic criteria including cytologic atypia, mitotic activity, and tumor cell necrosis are clues in establishing the correct diagnosis. It is important to keep in mind that mitotic rate thresholds vary for the different subtypes of leiomyosarcoma. Of note, p16 should be used with caution in supporting a diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma as it is often positive in leiomyomas with bizarre nuclei and leiomyomas with apoplectic change (in the latter most frequently and more intense near areas of necrosis). MED12 mutations have also a very limited role in this differential diagnosis. Endometrial stromal tumors are by far, less common than smooth muscle tumors, but can be confused with leiomyosarcomas if they are associated with an undifferentiated uterine sarcoma and the low-grade component is overlooked or they have a myxoid/fibroblastic morphology. The differential diagnosis may be confounded if the latter is associated with a high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. It is important to highlight that CD10 is not a reliable marker in these differentials and should be used as a part of a panel of antibodies that also includes desmin and h-caldesmon. Two other recently categorized tumors in the uterus that merit special mention are PEComa and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor as they enter in the differential diagnosis of smooth muscle tumors. PEComa may be part of the tuberous sclerosis syndrome and may show either a predominantly epithelioid or spindle morphology or combination thereof. Rarely, it may contain melanin pigment. There is variable positivity for HMB-45, MelanA, MiTF, and CathepsinK, and some tumors have been shown to express TFE-3 especially when associated with ""clear cell"" morphology. Patients with adverse outcome have tumors with ≥2 of the following features: ≥5 cm, infiltration, high-grade cytologic features, mitotic rate ≥1/50 high-power fields, necrosis, or lymphovascular invasion. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is important to recognize as it often mimics myxoid smooth muscle tumors, either benign or malignant. The presence of an associated lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate should alert to that possibility and ALK studies (immunostain or FISH) are helpful in establishing this diagnosis. These tumors can behave in a malignant manner if large, associated with abundant myxoid change, brisk mitotic rate or show tumor cell necrosis."
Deltex1 is inhibited by the Notch–Hairy/E(Spl) signaling pathway and induces neuronal and glial differentiation,"Notch signaling has been conserved throughout evolution and plays a fundamental role in various neural developmental processes and the pathogenesis of several human cancers and genetic disorders. However, how Notch signaling regulates various cellular processes remains unclear. Although Deltex proteins have been identified as cytoplasmic downstream elements of the Notch signaling pathway, few studies have been reported on their physiological role."
Moving pathogen genomics out of the lab and into the clinic: what will it take?,"Pathogen genomic analysis is a potentially transformative new approach to the clinical and public-health management of infectious diseases. Health systems investing in this technology will need to build infrastructure and develop policies that ensure genomic information can be generated, shared and acted upon in a timely manner."
Practical issues related to uterine pathology: endometrial stromal tumors,"Uterine mesenchymal tumors continue to be a challenge to diagnose due to their non-specific clinical presentation, often non-distinctive gross appearance, varied (and many times overlapping) morphologic appearance, and unsuspected pitfalls in immunohistochemical expression. This review will focus on endometrial stromal tumors and those features that help in their distinction. In particular, a practical approach to the diagnosis of endometrial stromal neoplasia will be covered including recognition as a stromal process in a biopsy/curettage and distinction from a highly cellular leiomyoma. In addition, distinction of a stromal nodule from a low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LGESS) and stromal sarcoma with limited infiltration in a hysterectomy specimen will be covered. The salient features that help distinguish a LGESS from a uterine tumor resembling ovarian sex-cord tumor as well as high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma, the latter a tumor recently reintroduced in the WHO classification will also be discussed. Finally, a practical approach to the diagnosis of undifferentiated uterine sarcoma (UUS) will be presented."

Cytotoxicity and Genotoxicity in Human Embryonic Kidney Cells Exposed to Surface Modify Chitosan Nanoparticles Loaded with Curcumin,"The rapid progress in the development and scientific investments of modified nanoparticles are due to their owed activity to various diseased conditions for which they are prepared. But the toxicity which they cause cannot be overlooked. The present study demonstrates the development of phosphatidylserine (PS)-coated chitosan (CS) nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with curcumin (CU), which was then investigated against human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) for its cytotoxic and genotoxic effect in rats. The CU-loaded CNPs (CNPs-CU) have been prepared by ionic gelation method, later which were grafted with PS. CNPs-CU and PS-CNPs-CU have been evaluated for their size, poly dispersity index, amount of drug entrapped, and in vitro CU release. CNPs-CU has an average size 167.6 ± 3.53 nm and polydispersity index (PDI) 0.115 ± 0.014, whereas PS-CNPs-CU shows average size 220 ± 3.67 nm and PDI 0.148 ± 0.019. Surface morphology of prepared NPs was confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). There was no major difference in cell viability between PS-CNPs-CU and CNPs-CU when they were exposed to HEK 293 cells at all equivalent concentrations. A series of genotoxic studies were conducted, which revealed the non-genotoxicity potential of the developed complexes. These results demonstrated that PS-CNPs-CU may be useful as potential delivery system."
Postoperative elevation of CA15-3 due to pernicious anemia in a patient without evidence of breast cancer recurrence,"Cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) is considered as a marker for breast cancer recurrence. However, we encountered a case where the patient showed postoperative elevation of the CA15-3 level due to pernicious anemia without evidence of breast cancer recurrence. The patient was a 60-year-old postmenopausal woman. She had undergone partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for her T1 left breast cancer. SLNB had indicated no lymph node metastases. The tumor was positive for hormone receptors and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Therefore, an aromatase inhibitor and external beam irradiation had been administered as adjuvant therapy. However, the CA15-3 level was found to be elevated at 6 months postoperatively. Although imaging studies did not indicate breast cancer recurrence, CA15-3 levels continued to increase. Based on the findings of blood tests and gastroendoscopy, a diagnosis of pernicious anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency was finally confirmed at 2 years and 6 months postoperatively. The CA15-3 level returned to normal after vitamin B12 administration. The possibility of pernicious anemia should be considered in cases of postoperative elevated CA15-3 levels with no evidence of recurrence in patients with early breast cancer."

Barn owl feathers as biomonitors of mercury: sources of variation in sampling procedures,"Given their central role in mercury (Hg) excretion and suitability as reservoirs, bird feathers are useful Hg biomonitors. Nevertheless, the interpretation of Hg concentrations is still questioned as a result of a poor knowledge of feather physiology and mechanisms affecting Hg deposition. Given the constraints of feather availability to ecotoxicological studies, we tested the effect of intra-individual differences in Hg concentrations according to feather type (body vs. flight feathers), position in the wing and size (mass and length) in order to understand how these factors could affect Hg estimates. We measured Hg concentration of 154 feathers from 28 un-moulted barn owls (Tyto alba), collected dead on roadsides. Median Hg concentration was 0.45 (0.076–4.5) mg kg−1 in body feathers, 0.44 (0.040–4.9) mg kg−1 in primary and 0.60 (0.042–4.7) mg kg−1 in secondary feathers, and we found a poor effect of feather type on intra-individual Hg levels. We also found a negative effect of wing feather mass on Hg concentration but not of feather length and of its position in the wing. We hypothesize that differences in feather growth rate may be the main driver of between-feather differences in Hg concentrations, which can have implications in the interpretation of Hg concentrations in feathers. Finally, we recommend that, whenever possible, several feathers from the same individual should be analysed. The five innermost primaries have lowest mean deviations to both between-feather and intra-individual mean Hg concentration and thus should be selected under restrictive sampling scenarios."
The ring phenomenon of diluted blood droplets,"Bloodstain pattern analysis is occasionally required in practical forensic casework. Misinterpretations may occur in cases in which diluted bloodstains are formed either within the course of the crime or during cleaning attempts after the original crime. The resulting pale or diluted aspect of the bloodstains may also be produced by passive serum separation. To differentiate between diluted and non-diluted stains and the artifacts of pure serum separation, dripping experiments were performed using droplets of multiple sizes and dilutions dripped onto common indoor and fabric surfaces. In addition, pools of blood of different volumes were applied to solid surfaces with different inclinations to determine the conditions and properties of serum separation. This study yielded morphological characteristics that enable differentiation between stains of diluted and non-diluted blood: a prominent ring phenomenon indicates dilution with water. To elucidate the underlying physical mechanism of particle distribution within a blood stain, photomicrographs were taken during the drying process. The so-called contact line pinning effect was identified as the formation mechanism of this ring phenomenon. Serum separation was highly dependent on the applied blood volume, the ambient temperature, the time elapsed since the initial deposition, and the degree of floor inclination."
Functional and structural responses of bacterial and fungal communities from paddy fields following long-term rice cultivation,"Rice paddy soils undergo pedogenesis driven by periodic flooding and drainage cycles that lead to accumulation of organic matter and the stratification of nutrients and oxygen in the soil profile. Here, we examined the effects of continuous rice cultivation on microbial community structures, enzyme activities, and chemical properties for paddy soils along a chronosequence representing 0–700 years of rice cropping in China."
Sorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to soils enhanced by heavy metals: perspective of molecular interactions,Combined pollution by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals are commonly found in industrial soils. This study aims to investigate the effect of the coexistence of heavy metals on the sorption of PAHs to soils. We focused specifically on the relationship of the sorption capacity with the estimation of the binding energy between PAHs and heavy metals.
Interleukin 10-expressing B cells inhibit tumor-infiltrating T cell function and correlate with T cell Tim-3 expression in renal cell carcinoma,"Renal cell carcinoma is among the leading causes of cancer-related death and was found to induce IL-10. We started by focusing on IL-10-secreting cells in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in renal cell carcinoma patients and observed that both CD3+ T cells and CD19+ B cells contributed to an elevated IL-10 expression. We then focused on IL-10-expressing B cells, and found that compared to non-IL-10-producing B cells, the IL-10-expressing B cells had significantly lower levels of CD19 and CD20 expression, a lack of IgM and IgD expression, while the level of CD27 was elevated. Moreover, culturing under unstimulated conditions resulted in higher antibody production by these IL-10-producing B cells than their peripheral blood counterparts, which strongly suggested that they are plasmablast-differentiating cells. Both IgA and IgG subtypes were found but IgA had a higher relative abundance in the tumor-infiltrating fraction. We then observed inverse correlations between the frequency of IL-10-producing B cells and pro-inflammatory cytokine-producing T cells and T cell proliferation. The expression of T cell exhaustion marker Tim-3, however, was upregulated in patients with high frequencies of IL-10-producing B cells. Moreover, supernatant from tumor B cells suppressed T cell inflammation. In addition, frequencies of IL-10-producing tumor-infiltrating B cells were inversely correlated with resected tumor size, and were higher in later stage tumors. Together, our data demonstrated that IL-10-producing B cells had plasmablast-differentiating phenotype, and could contribute to T cell immunosuppression in renal cell carcinoma."
LKB1/AMPK inhibits TGF-β1 production and the TGF-β signaling pathway in breast cancer cells,"Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a fuel gauge that maintains energy homeostasis in both normal and cancerous cells, and has emerged as a tumor suppressor. The present study aims to delineate the functional relationship between AMPK and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). Our results showed that expression of liver kinase B1 (LKB1), an upstream kinase of AMPK, impeded TGF-β-induced Smad phosphorylation and their transcriptional activity in breast cancer cells, whereas knockdown of LKB1 or AMPKα1 subunit by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) enhanced the effect of TGF-β. Furthermore, AMPK activation reduced the promoter activity of TGF-β1. In accordance, type 2 diabetic patients taking metformin displayed a trend of reduction of serum TGF-β1, as compared with those without metformin. A significant reduction of serum TGF-β1 was found in mice after treatment with metformin. These results suggest that AMPK inhibits the transcription of TGF-β1, leading to reduction of its concentration in serum. Finally, metformin suppressed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of mammary epithelial cells. Taken together, our study demonstrates that AMPK exerts multiple actions on TGF-β signaling and supports that AMPK can serve as a therapeutic drug target for breast cancer."
Expression of microRNA-452 via adenoviral vector inhibits non-small cell lung cancer cells proliferation and metastasis,"The microRNA miR-452 has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor. However, the cellular mechanism and potential application of miR-452-mediated cancer suppression remain great unknown. This study aims to identify how miR-452 acts in regulating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) proliferation and metastasis. Expression of miR-452 via adenoviral (Ad) vector inhibits the proliferation, invasion, and migration of NSCLC cells A549 or H460. Our data also shows that miR-452 down-regulates the expression of Bmi-1 as well as pro-survival or anti-apoptosis regulators Survivin, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2. By such gene interference, miR-452 modulates NSCLC cell epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and further disrupts their migration and invasion. Moreover, miR-452 blocks the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway, which is also required for EMT process. These data reveal that miR-452 treatment could be a novel target or strategy for NSCLC treatment."
Age-related changes in neurochemical components and retinal projections of rat intergeniculate leaflet,"Aging leads to several anatomical and functional deficits in circadian timing system. In previous works, we observed morphological alterations with age in hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei, one central component of this system. However, there are few data regarding aging effects on other central components of this system, such as thalamic intergeniculate leaflet (IGL). In this context, we studied possible age-related alterations in neurochemical components and retinal projections of rat IGL. For this goal, young (3 months), adult (13 months), and aged (23 months) Wistar rats were submitted to an intraocular injection of neural tracer, cholera toxin subunit b (CTb), 5 days before a tissue fixation process by paraformaldehyde perfusion. Optical density measurements and cell count were performed at digital pictures of brain tissue slices processed by immunostaining for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), enkephalin (ENK), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and CTb, characteristic markers of IGL and its retinal terminals. We found a significant age-related loss in NPY immunoreactive neurons, but not in immunoreactivity to GAD and ENK. We also found a decline of retinal projections to IGL with age. We conclude aging impairs both a photic environmental clue afferent to IGL and a neurochemical expression which has an important modulatory circadian function, providing strong anatomical correlates to functional deficits of the aged biological clock."
Efficacy of cervical and ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials in evaluation of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of posterior semicircular canal,"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) constitutes a major proportion of the population with peripheral vestibulopathies. Although the freely floating otoconia within the semicircular canals is responsible for the symptoms of BPPV, the source of the otoconia debris is mainly believed to be the otolith organs. Therefore, the pathology in either or both the otolith organs appears a logical proposition. Cervical and ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP and oVEMP), being the tests for functional integrity of the otolith organs, appear promising for investigating otolith involvement in BPPV. While recent evidences are suggestive of equivocal findings for cVEMP, there are only a few studies on oVEMP. Additionally, both these potentials have never been explored in the same set of individuals with BPPV. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the functional integrity of the otolith organs through cVEMP and oVEMP in individuals with posterior canal BPPV. Thirty-one individuals with unilateral posterior canal BPPV and 31 age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent 500 Hz tone-burst-evoked cVEMP and oVEMP. The results demonstrated no significant group difference on any of the cVEMP parameters (p > 0.05). A similar trend was noticed for the latency-related parameters of oVEMP. However, the peak-to-peak amplitude was significantly smaller in the affected ears of individuals with BPPV than their unaffected ears and the ears of healthy controls (p < 0.05). The BPPV group showed significantly higher inter-aural amplitude difference ratio than the healthy controls (p < 0.05). Further, the sensitivity and specificity of oVEMP were also found to be far superior to those of cVEMP. Thus, the outcome of the present study revealed involvement of utricle rather than saccule in posterior canal BPPV, and therefore, oVEMP appears to be better suited to clinical investigation than cVEMP in individuals with posterior canal BPPV."

Percutaneous Isolated Hepatic Perfusion for the Treatment of Unresectable Liver Malignancies,"Liver malignancies are a major burden of disease worldwide. The long-term prognosis for patients with unresectable tumors remains poor, despite advances in systemic chemotherapy, targeted agents, and minimally invasive therapies such as ablation, chemoembolization, and radioembolization. Thus, the demand for new and better treatments for malignant liver tumors remains high. Surgical isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) has been shown to be effective in patients with various hepatic malignancies, but is complex, associated with high complication rates and not repeatable. Percutaneous isolated liver perfusion (PHP) is a novel minimally invasive, repeatable, and safer alternative to IHP. PHP is rapidly gaining interest and the number of procedures performed in Europe now exceeds 200.
 This review discusses the indications, technique and patient management of PHP and provides an overview of the available data."
An improved and robust biometrics-based three factor authentication scheme for multiserver environments,"The rapid advancement in communication technologies enables remote users to acquire a number of online services. All such online services are provided remotely facilitating the users to freely move any where with out disruption of the services. In order to ensure seamless and secure services to the remote user such services espouse authentication protocols. A number of authentication protocols are readily available to achieve security and privacy in remote client server architecture. Most of these schemes are tailored for single server architecture. In such scenario, if a user wants to attain the services provided by more than one servers he has to register with each server. In recent times, multiserver authentication has got much attention, where a user can register once and then can acquire services provided by multiple servers. Very recently, Lu et al. proposed a biometric, smart card and password-based three factor authentication scheme usable for multiserver environments. Furthermore, Lu et al. identified their scheme to resist known attacks. However, the analysis in this paper ascertains that Lu et al.’s scheme is vulnerable to impersonation attack. An adversary registered to the system just after knowing the public identity of a user can impersonate himself as the latter. Then we propose an improvement over Lu et al.’s scheme. Our improvement is more robust than the existing schemes. The security of proposed scheme is substantiated formally along with informal security discussion, while same is also validated using a popular automated tool ProVerif. The analysis confirms that proposed scheme achieves mutual authentication and is robust against known attacks. In addition, the proposed scheme does not incur any extra computation as compared with Lu et al.’s scheme."
Efficient designs for Bayesian networks with sub-tree bounds,"We present upper and lower bounds for information measures, and use these to find the optimal design of experiments for Bayesian networks. The bounds are inspired by properties of the junction tree algorithm, which is commonly used for calculating conditional probabilities in graphical models like Bayesian networks. We demonstrate methods for iteratively improving the upper and lower bounds until they are sufficiently tight. We illustrate properties of the algorithm by tutorial examples in the case where we want to ensure optimality and for the case where the goal is an approximate solution with a guarantee. We further use the bounds to accelerate established algorithms for constructing useful designs. An example with petroleum fields in the North Sea is studied, where the design problem is related to exploration drilling campaigns. All of our examples consider binary random variables, but the theory can also be applied to other discrete or continuous distributions."
Biosecurity and food security—effective mechanisms for public-private partnerships,"Maintaining Australia’s status as a major food exporter requires ongoing protection of its cropping industries from exotic pests and diseases. The number of pests classified as high priority threats to Australia’s plant industries now stands at over 300 (Plant Health Australia Annual Report 2014). It is often stated that Australia’s geographic isolation provides a natural barrier from many exotic pests that could damage plant production industries and the unique natural environment. Isolation, however, is not enough given that pests can enter through natural means or by being brought into the country with the increasing movements of people and goods. In an increasingly globalised world economy, Australia relies on a rigorous biosecurity system operated in partnership between governments and industry to mitigate risks from exotic pests. Steadily increasing trade volumes and passenger travel, global movements of serious pests, particularly into neighbouring countries, and the emergence of new and variant species of pests, will continue to test already stretched biosecurity capabilities. Plant Health Australia (PHA) provides the centrepiece of a unique system that manages the national preparedness and response for exotic plant pest incursions in Australia. PHA is a public company that facilitates decision making and funding for effective responses to emergency plant pests. PHA also independently advocates and adds value to, Australia’s national biosecurity system. Utilising the Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed (EPPRD), a legal agreement that brings together governments and industries in formal response arrangements, PHA ensures that national incursion responses are timely, science based, transparent and effective, with the aim of maintaining supply of quality clean food."
Approximating behavioral equivalence for scaling solutions of I-DIDs,"Interactive dynamic influence diagram (I-DID) is a recognized graphical framework for sequential multiagent decision making under uncertainty. I-DIDs concisely represent the problem of how an individual agent should act in an uncertain environment shared with others of unknown types. I-DIDs face the challenge of solving a large number of models that are ascribed to other agents. A known method for solving I-DIDs is to group models of other agents that are behaviorally equivalent. Identifying model equivalence requires solving models and comparing their solutions generally represented as policy trees. Because the trees grow exponentially with the number of decision time steps, comparing entire policy trees becomes intractable, thereby limiting the scalability of previous I-DID techniques. In this article, our specific approaches focus on utilizing partial policy trees for comparison and determining the distance between updated beliefs at the leaves of the trees. We propose a principled way to determine how much of the policy trees to consider, which trades off solution quality for efficiency. We further improve on this technique by allowing the partial policy trees to have paths of differing lengths. We evaluate these approaches in multiple problem domains and demonstrate significantly improved scalability over previous approaches."
Integrals for functions with values in a partially ordered vector space,"We consider integration of functions with values in a partially ordered vector space, and two notions of extension of the space of integrable functions. Applying both extensions to the space of real valued simple functions on a measure space leads to the classical space of integrable functions."
A new Strategy to Improve Drug Delivery to the Maxillary Sinuses: The Frequency Sweep Acoustic Airflow,Enhancement of intranasal sinus deposition involves nebulization of a drug superimposed by an acoustic airflow. We investigated the impact of fixed frequency versus frequency sweep acoustic airflow on the improvement of aerosolized drug penetration into maxillary sinuses.
Forgiveness Education for Fourth Grade Students in Turkey,"Research has indicated that living in an environment involving poverty and violence can have negative effects on young children. Forgiveness may be an important predictor of well-being among these children. Forgiveness education programs aim to heal these by increasing forgiveness, hope, and by being prosocial while decreasing anger and depression, which appear after deep hurt. The main aim of the study was to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of a forgiveness education program in classroom settings with fourth-grade Turkish students living in an impoverished environment. Two studies were conducted to evaluate the forgiveness education program, based on Enright’s process model of forgiveness. In the first study, students from impoverished backgrounds were found to exhibit significantly greater anger and depression than students representing an average socioeconomic status. In the second study, with 122 fourth-grade students (N = 74 experimental, 48 control) in five primary schools, the forgiveness education program was implemented by school teachers with support from psychologists. Analysis reveals a significant increase in forgiveness and hope and a decrease in anger in the first posttest for the experimental group compared with the control group, although follow-up results indicate no significant differences between the two groups. Significant findings and the forgiveness education program are discussed."
Scientific collaboration between ‘old’ and ‘new’ member states: Did joining the European Union make a difference?,"This paper provides new insights on the effects of the enlargement of the European Union (EU) and European integration by investigating the issue of scientific collaboration within the new EU member states vis-à-vis the old EU member states. The question addressed is whether the EU membership following the two enlargement waves 2004 and 2007 has significantly increased the co-publication intensity of the new member states with other member countries. The empirical results based on data collected from the Web of Science database and Difference-in-Difference estimations point towards a conclusion that joining the EU indeed has had an additional positive impact on the co-publication intensity between the new and old member states and, in particular, within the new member states themselves. These results give tentative support for the successfulness of the EU’s science policies in achieving a common ‘internal market’ in research. We also find evidence for early anticipation effects of the consecutive EU accession."
Assessing laptop use in higher education: The Laptop Use Scale,"The laptop computer is considered one of the most used and important technological devices in higher education, yet limited systematic research has been conducted to develop a measure of laptop use in college and university. The purpose of the following study was to develop a research-based, theoretically grounded scale to assess student use of laptops inside and outside higher education classrooms. The Laptop Use Scale addressed four key areas: in-class academic use, in-class non-academic use, outside of class academic use, and outside of class non-academic use. Tested on 156 higher education students using laptops computers, the Laptop Use Scale showed acceptable internal reliability and good validity (face, content, construct, and convergent validity). It is argued that this scale can help assess and calibrate pedagogical strategies used to integrate laptops into higher education classrooms. Suggestions for future research on assessing student use of laptops are offered including a focus on multi-tasking behavior."
Can privacy concerns for insurance of connected cars be compensated?,"Internet-of-things technologies enable service providers such as insurance companies to collect vast amounts of privacy-sensitive data on car drivers. This paper studies whether and how privacy concerns of car owners can be compensated by offering monetary benefits. We study the case of usage based car insurance services for which the insurance fee is adapted to measured mileage and driving behaviour. A conjoint experiment shows that consumers prefer their current insurance products to usage based car insurance. However, when offered a minor financial compensation, they are willing to give up their privacy to car insurers. Consumers find privacy of behaviour and action more valuable than privacy of location and space. The study is a first to compare different forms of privacy in the acceptance of connected car services. Hereby, we contribute to more fine-grained understanding of privacy concerns in the acceptance of digital services, which will become more important in the upcoming Internet-of-things era."
Dynamics of the 3/1 planetary mean-motion resonance: an application to the HD60532 b-c planetary system,"In this paper, we use a semi-analytical approach to analyze the global structure of the phase space of the planar planetary 3/1 mean-motion resonance. The case where the outer planet is more massive than its inner companion is considered. We show that the resonant dynamics can be described using two fundamental parameters, the total angular momentum and the spacing parameter. The topology of the Hamiltonian function describing the resonant behaviour is investigated on a large domain of the phase space without time-expensive numerical integrations of the equations of motion, and without any restriction on the magnitude of the planetary eccentricities. The families of the Apsidal Corotation Resonances (ACR) parameterized by the planetary mass ratio are obtained and their stability is analyzed. The main dynamical features in the domains around the ACR are also investigated in detail by means of spectral analysis techniques, which allow us to detect the regions of different regimes of motion of resonant systems. The construction of dynamical maps for various values of the total angular momentum shows the evolution of domains of stable motion with the eccentricities, identifying possible configurations suitable for exoplanetary systems."
Secular dynamics of S-type planetary orbits in binary star systems: applicability domains of first- and second-order theories,"We analyse the secular dynamics of planets on S-type coplanar orbits in tight binary systems, based on first- and second-order analytical models, and compare their predictions with full N-body simulations. The perturbation parameter adopted for the development of these models depends on the masses of the stars and on the semimajor axis ratio between the planet and the binary. We show that each model has both advantages and limitations. While the first-order analytical model is algebraically simple and easy to implement, it is only applicable in regions of the parameter space where the perturbations are sufficiently small. The second-order model, although more complex, has a larger range of validity and must be taken into account for dynamical studies of some real exoplanetary systems such as \(\gamma \) Cephei and HD 41004A. However, in some extreme cases, neither of these analytical models yields quantitatively correct results, requiring either higher-order theories or direct numerical simulations. Finally, we determine the limits of applicability of each analytical model in the parameter space of the system, giving an important visual aid to decode which secular theory should be adopted for any given planetary system in a close binary."
A new sparse representation-based object segmentation framework,"In this paper, a novel sparse representation-based object segmentation model is proposed. The model follows from a new energy function that combines the level-set-based sparse representation and the independent component-based shape representation within a unified framework. Before the optimization of the proposed energy, a set of training shapes is firstly projected into the shape space spanned by the independent components. For an arbitrary input shape similar to some of the elements in the training set, the minimization of the energy will automatically recover a sparse shape combination according to the neighbors in the projected shape space to guide the variational image segmentation. We test our model on both public datasets and real applications, and the experimental results show the superior segmentation capabilities of the proposed model."
The impact of cut-off lows on ozone in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere over Changchun from ozonesonde observations,"In situ measurements of the vertical structure of ozone were made in Changchun (43.53°N, 125.13°E), China, by the Institute of Atmosphere Physics, in the summers of 2010–13. Analysis of the 89 validated ozone profiles shows the variation of ozone concentration in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) caused by cut-off lows (COLs) over Changchun. During the COL events, an increase of the ozone concentration and a lower height of the tropopause are observed. Backward simulations with a trajectory model show that the ozone-rich airmass brought by the COL is from Siberia. A case study proves that stratosphere–troposphere exchange (STE) occurs in the COL. The ozone-rich air mass transported from the stratosphere to the troposphere first becomes unstable, then loses its high ozone concentration. This process usually happens during the decay stage of COLs. In order to understand the influence of COLs on the ozone in the UTLS, statistical analysis of the ozone profiles within COLs, and other profiles, are employed. The results indicate that the ozone concentrations of the in-COL profiles are significantly higher than those of the other profiles between ±4 km around the tropopause. The COLs induce an increase in UTLS column ozone by 32% on average. Meanwhile, the COLs depress the lapse-rate tropopause (LRT)/dynamical tropopause height by 1.4/1.7 km and cause the atmosphere above the tropopause to be less stable. The influence of COLs is durable because the increased ozone concentration lasts at least one day after the COL has passed over Changchun. Furthermore, the relative coefficient between LRT height and lower stratosphere (LS) column ozone is -0.62, which implies a positive correlation between COL strength and LS ozone concentration."
Temporal statistical downscaling of precipitation and temperature forecasts using a stochastic weather generator,"Statistical downscaling is based on the fact that the large-scale climatic state and regional/local physiographic features control the regional climate. In the present paper, a stochastic weather generator is applied to seasonal precipitation and temperature forecasts produced by the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI). In conjunction with the GLM (generalized linear modeling) weather generator, a resampling scheme is used to translate the uncertainty in the seasonal forecasts (the IRI format only specifies probabilities for three categories: below normal, near normal, and above normal) into the corresponding uncertainty for the daily weather statistics. The method is able to generate potentially useful shifts in the probability distributions of seasonally aggregated precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature, as well as more meaningful daily weather statistics for crop yields, such as the number of dry days and the amount of precipitation on wet days. The approach is extended to the case of climate change scenarios, treating a hypothetical return to a previously observed drier regime in the Pampas."
Energy-Efficient 8-Point DCT Approximations: Theory and Hardware Architectures,"Due to its remarkable energy compaction properties, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is employed in a multitude of compression standards, such as JPEG and H.265/HEVC. Several low-complexity integer approximations for the DCT have been proposed for both 1D and 2D signal analyses. The increasing demand for low-complexity, energy-efficient methods requires algorithms with even lower computational costs. In this paper, new 8-point DCT approximations with very low arithmetic complexity are presented. The new transforms are proposed based on pruning state-of-the-art DCT approximations. The proposed algorithms were assessed in terms of arithmetic complexity, energy retention capability, and image compression performance. In addition, a metric combining performance and computational complexity measures was proposed. Results showed good performance and extremely low computational complexity. Introduced algorithms were mapped into systolic-array digital architectures and physically realized as digital prototype circuits using FPGA technology and mapped to 45 nm CMOS technology. All hardware-related metrics showed low resource consumption of the proposed pruned approximate transforms. The best proposed transform according to the introduced metric presents a reduction in power consumption of 21–25 %."
A Survey of VLSI Implementations of Tree Search Algorithms for MIMO Detection,"Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection algorithms have received considerable research interest in recent years, as a result of the increasing need for high data-rate communications. Detection techniques range from the low-complexity linear detectors to the maximum likelihood detector, which scales exponentially with the number of transmit antennas. In between these two extremes are the tree search (TS) algorithms, such as the popular sphere decoder, which have emerged as attractive choices for implementing MIMO detection, due to their excellent performance-complexity trade-offs. In this paper, we survey some of the state-of-the-art VLSI implementations of TS algorithms and compare their results using various metrics such as the throughput and power consumption. We also present notable contributions that have been made in the last three decades in implementing TS algorithms for MIMO detection, especially with respect to achieving low-complexity, high-throughput designs. Finally, a number of design considerations and trade-offs for implementing MIMO detectors in hardware are presented."
Roots in Operator and Banach Algebras,"We show that several known facts concerning roots of matrices generalize to operator algebras and Banach algebras. We show for example that the so-called Newton, binomial, Visser, and Halley iterative methods converge to the root in Banach and operator algebras under various mild hypotheses. We also show that the ‘sign’ and ‘geometric mean’ of matrices generalize to Banach and operator algebras, and we investigate their properties. We also establish some other facts about roots in this setting."
Existence of a Steady Flow of Stokes Fluid Past a Linear Elastic Structure Using Fictitious Domain,"We use fictitious domain method with penalization for the Stokes equation in order to obtain approximate solutions in a fixed larger domain including the domain occupied by the structure. The coefficients of the fluid problem, excepting the penalizing term, are independent of the deformation of the structure. It is easy to check the inf-sup condition and the coercivity of the Stokes problem in the fixed domain. Subtracting the structure equations from the fictitious fluid equations in the structure domain, we obtain a weak formulation in a fixed domain, where the continuity of the stress at the interface does not appear explicitly. Existence of a solution is proved when the structure displacement is generated by a finite number of modes."
Encoding Curved Tetrahedra in Face Holonomies: Phase Space of Shapes from Group-Valued Moment Maps,We present a generalization of Minkowski’s classic theorem on the reconstruction of tetrahedra from algebraic data to homogeneously curved spaces. Euclidean notions such as the normal vector to a face are replaced by Levi–Civita holonomies around each of the tetrahedron’s faces. This allows the reconstruction of both spherical and hyperbolic tetrahedra within a unified framework. A new type of hyperbolic simplex is introduced in order for all the sectors encoded in the algebraic data to be covered. Generalizing the phase space of shapes associated to flat tetrahedra leads to group-valued moment maps and quasi-Poisson spaces. These discrete geometries provide a natural arena for considering the quantization of gravity including a cosmological constant. This becomes manifest in light of their relation with the spin-network states of loop quantum gravity. This work therefore provides a bottom-up justification for the emergence of deformed gauge symmetries and quantum groups in covariant loop quantum gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant.
Boundary controllability of incompressible Euler fluids with Boussinesq heat effects,"This paper deals with the boundary controllability of inviscid incompressible fluids for which thermal effects are important. They will be modeled through the so-called Boussinesq approximation. In the zero heat diffusion case, by adapting and extending some ideas from J.-M. Coron and O. Glass, we establish the simultaneous global exact controllability of the velocity field and the temperature for 2D and 3D flows. When the heat diffusion coefficient is positive, we present some additional results concerning exact controllability for the velocity field and local null controllability of the temperature."
Comments on “Fuzzy multicriteria decision making method based on the improved accuracy function for interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets” by Ridvan Sahin,"In the above paper, the author proposed an improved accuracy function, and then by using the function, a multicriteria fuzzy decision-making method is established. However, the application example given in the above cited reference is inappropriate to show the accuracy function’s advantages. In this short letter, we redefine a set of data; the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated with the use of the presented data."
Effect of Microstructure on the Electrochemical Behavior of Ti-10 Mass% Mn Alloys in High Chloride Solution,"The effect of microstructure on the corrosion of heat-treated Ti-10 mass% Mn alloys was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 10% NaCl solution of pH 0.5 at 97 °C. Sample of solution heat treatment (ST) had a single β phase, and samples subjected to the aging heat treatment at 600 °C had α phase precipitation in β phases. The EIS measurements showed that the corrosion resistance of the aging heat-treated samples showed lower values than ST sample, however, much higher values than pure Ti. Thus, Mn was effective to increase the corrosion resistance of Ti alloys. Laser micrographs of heat-treated samples indicated that α phase was selectively corroded and made the pit after the corrosion test. The transmission electron microscope (TEM)-energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry (EDXS) analyses showed that the Mn content was 9 mass% in the β phase and 0.7 mass% in α phase. Hence, it was understood that less-Mn α phase was selectively corroded in the corrosion test. However, as compared with pure Ti, the aging heat-treated samples showed much higher resistance against the corrosion by the 0.7 mass% Mn in α phase. Finally, it was concluded that it was possible to keep the high corrosion resistance for heat-treated Ti-10 mass% Mn alloy by controlling the microstructure of α phase."
Influence of Skin Pass Design and Aging Phenomena on Steel Sheets Surface Characteristics,"This paper studies the behavior of non-alloy sheet steel in very low plastic deformation. The steel was subjected to temper rolling (skin pass) with different ratios till 5%. 
The sheet steel also was subjected to aging after temper rolling. The tensile curves were plotted and their characteristics were determined. The work-hardening coefficient (n) was determined after temper rolling directly and after aging to judge the general behavior of sheets. The microstructure observation was carried out o notice the surface stretcher strains (kinks). Lüder’s bands were observed in aged steel sheets leading to high surface roughness. The surface roughness was measured after temper rolling or aging to judge the surface quality."
Partial Load: A Key Factor Resulting in the Failure of Gear in the Wind Turbine Gearbox,"Gearbox is a critical component in the wind turbine system which can transfer wind energy into wind power to replace some fossil energy in order to reduce the environmental pollution. A 1.5-MW wind turbine gearbox failed after about 5 years of service; however, the design life of the gearbox is 20 years. In this paper, the failure mechanism of the gearbox was investigated based on standard failure analysis procedures and finite element (FE) simulation. The failure of gear could be attributed to fatigue fracture, because typical macroscopic features—beach marks and ratcheting marks—could be observed on the fracture surface. Furthermore, contact fatigue caused the formation of pits on the failed working tooth flank, even brought some microcracks. It should be emphasized that fatigue pitting mainly concentrated at the left end of the failed gear. Based on the physical, chemical analysis, and FE simulation, the failure of gear should be essentially ascribed to abnormal load rather than the material defects. Finally, based on the failure characteristics, partial load should be responsible for the failure of the gear in the wind turbine gearbox."
Optimization of a Lower Hitch Link for a Heavy Duty Tractor Using Finite Element Method,"Links play an important role in hitching of implement to a tractor. They must withstand forces that are transmitted between tractor and implement. In modern heavy duty tractors, some type of lower link mounted force transducer is used to measure draft force. Therefore, the lower link needs to have such dimensions that stresses developed by draft force be well below of its material yield strength to safeguard any permanent set, in the meantime, avoiding high material as well as manufacturing costs might encounter due to the unnecessary large dimensions of the link. In this study, the lower link of a three-point hitch of new heavy duty ITM1500 tractor developed in Iran Tractor Manufacturing Co., was analyzed with regards to both static and dynamic conditions using finite element method. The 3-D link was modeled in Solid Works environment while Cosmos Works software was used for finite element analysis. Finally, optimum dimensions of the lower link was found with respect to available raw material and draft forces involved."

"The Jebel Ohier deposit—a newly discovered porphyry copper–gold system in the Neoproterozoic Arabian–Nubian Shield, Red Sea Hills, NE Sudan","Ongoing exploration in the Red Sea Hills of NE Sudan has led to the identification of a large alteration–mineralization system within a relatively undeformed Neoproterozoic intrusive–extrusive succession centered on Jebel Ohier. The style of mineralization, presence of an extensive stockwork vein network within a zoned potassic-propylitic-argillic-advanced argillic-altered system, a mineralization assemblage comprising magnetite-pyrite-chalcopyrite-bornite (±gold, silver and tellurides), and the recurrence of fertile mafic to intermediate magmatism in a developing convergent plate setting all point to a porphyry copper–gold association, analogous to major porphyry Cu–Au–Mo deposits in Phanerozoic supra-subduction settings such as the SW Pacific. Preliminary U–Pb age dating yielded a maximum constraint of c. 730 Ma for the emplacement of the stockwork system into a significantly older (c. 800 Ma) volcanic edifice. The mineralization formed prior to regional deformation and accretion of the host terrane to a stable continental margin at by c. 700 Ma, thus ensuring preservation of the deposit. The Jebel Ohier deposit is interpreted as a relatively well-preserved, rare example of a Neoproterozoic porphyry Cu–Au system and the first porphyry Cu–Au deposit to be identified in the Arabian–Nubian Shield."
Impact of AlN Spacer on Analog Performance 	of Lattice-Matched AlInN/AlN/GaN MOSHEMT,"In this work, a detailed investigation of the impact of spacer layer thickness on analog performance of an AlInN/AlN/GaN metal oxide semiconductor high electron mobility transistor (MOSHEMT) is carried out. A thorough analysis of the key figure-of-merits such as threshold voltage (V

From the two-dimensional ATLAS device simulation results, it is observed that the performance of AlInN/AlN/GaN MOSHEMT is affected by the variation of spacer thickness. Also, we have developed mathematical expressions for the evaluation of V

m and gate leakage current for the proposed device. The model results and technology computer-aided design simulation results are verified and also found to be satisfactory. Improved sheet charge density and superior analog performance is observed due to the insertion of the AlN spacer. Suppression in the forward gate current is observed due to the insertion of the AlN spacer which made it possible to apply a high gate voltage in the transistor operation. From the fabrication point of view, it is also feasible to utilize the existing complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor process flows to fabricate the proposed device."
In Situ Growth of In2S3 Nanorods in Poly(3-Hexylthiophene) Hybrid Films,"A novel and efficient gas–liquid method for the in situ synthesis of In2S3 nanorods in a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) matrix is demonstrated. The method involves a self-contained reaction between Na2S and HCl that produces H2S, which reacts with a P3HT/InCl3 solution resulting in hybrid P3HT/In2S3 films. The Na2S solution is regenerated for further use. The method yielded results in In2S3 nanoparticles and nanorods in a P3HT matrix, as observed by transmission electron microscopy. The In2S3 nanorods are 3 nm wide and ~30 nm long. The size of the nanorods is dependent on the P3HT concentration. The band gap (E
g) of the resulting In2S3/P3HT is in the range of 2.97–3.71 eV, as measured by UV–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis) Charge transfer in the In2S3/P3HT was demonstrated by the presence of quenching in the fluorescence spectra of the composite. Chemical composition was investigated by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy analysis, as well as x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Both techniques demonstrated the formation of In2S3."

Nd8+2x
Ti18O54 ceramics (with x = 0.00 to 0.85) were synthesized by the mixed oxide route followed by annealing in a reducing atmosphere; their high-temperature thermoelectric properties have been investigated. In conjunction with the experimental observations, atomistic simulations have been performed to investigate the anisotropic behavior of the lattice thermal conductivity. The ceramics show promising n-type thermoelectric properties with relatively high Seebeck coefficient, moderate electrical conductivity, and temperature-stable, low thermal conductivity; For example, the composition with x = 0.27 (i.e., Ba5.19Nd8.54Ti18O54) exhibited a Seebeck coefficient of S

Generation of White Light from Dysprosium-Doped Strontium Aluminate Phosphor by a Solid-State Reaction Method,"A single-host lattice, white light-emitting SrAl2O4:Dy3+ phosphor was synthesized by a solid-state reaction method. The crystal structure of prepared SrAl2O4:Dy3+ phosphor was in a monoclinic phase with space group P21. The chemical composition of the sintered SrAl2O4:Dy3+ phosphor was confirmed by the energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy technique. Under ultra-violet excitation, the characteristic emissions of Dy3+ are peaking at 475 nm, 573 nm and 660 nm, originating from the transitions of 4F9/2 → 6H15/2, 4F9/2 →&!nbsp;	6H13/2 and 4F9/2 → 6H11/2 in the 4f9 configuration of Dy3+ ions. Commission International de I’Eclairage color coordinates of SrAl2O4:Dy3+ are suitable for white light-emitting phosphor. In order to investigate the suitability of the samples as white color light sources for industrial uses, correlated color temperature (CCT) and color rendering index (CRI) values were calculated. Values of CCT and CRI were found well within the defined acceptable range. Mechanoluminescence (ML) intensity of SrAl2O4:Dy3+ phosphor increased linearly with increasing impact velocity of the moving piston. Thus, the present investigation indicates piezo-electricity was responsible for producing ML in sintered SrAl2O4:Dy3+ phosphor. Decay rates of the exponential decaying period of the ML curves do not change significantly with impact velocity. The photoluminescence and ML results suggest that the synthesized SrAl2O4:Dy3+ phosphor was useful for the white light-emitting diodes and stress sensor respectively."
Facile one-pot synthesis of self-assembled 3-D flower-like SnO2 architectures and their electrochemical properties,"In this work, self-assembled 3-D flower-like SnO2 architectures have been successfully synthesized by one-pot hydrothermal method. The structure and morphology of flower-like SnO2 architectures were investigated by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical performance of self-assembled 3-D flower-like SnO2 architectures was measured by galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. As anode materials in lithium ion batteries, the results show that the obtained SnO2 architectures exhibit high lithium storage."

O thin films were prepared by sol–gel method on quartz glass. The effect of Na (or Cu) doping on the microstructure, surface morphology, optical properties of the thin films was investigated. The Na0.1Cu0.01Zn0.89O thin film has the largest average grain size and the best preferential c-axis orientation, which may be attributed to the difference in ionic radius between Zn and Na (or Cu). The Na0.1Cu0.01Zn0.89O thin film also presents denser morphology with little voids and the smallest optical band gap, which may be attributed to band edge bending and the larger grain size. The largest intensity of A1(LO) modes may be due to the major structural defect concentrations. The quenching of UV and visible emissions, which may be attributed to the increase of non-radiative recombination transition, has been observed in the Na0.1Cu0.01Zn0.89O and Na0.1Cu0.02Zn0.88O thin films."
Effect of ZnO/Er2O3 addition on microwave properties of (Zr0.8Sn0.2)TiO4 ceramics,"(Zr0.8Sn0.2)TiO4 (ZST) ceramics were prepared by conventional solid-state ceramic method and investigated by XRD, SEM and dielectric measurements. 1 wt% ZnO and different concentrations of Er2O3 ranging from 0.25 to 1 wt% were introduced to study their effect on the densification, microstructure and microwave dielectric properties of the ZST ceramics. It was found that the addition of ZnO and Er2O3 can significantly improved the density at lower temperature. Meanwhile, the microwave dielectric properties of ZST ceramics were also heavily influenced by the sintering aids. The maximum dielectric constant of 39.2 and Q × f value of 28,000 were found to be for the samples added with 0.25 wt% of Er2O3 sintered at 1240 °C for 4 h."
"An intratropical migratory passerine can quickly improve its physiological condition during post migration, reproduction and departure phases on the breeding site in the Cerrado","Migration and reproduction are energetically expensive processes that migratory animal species must confront during their life-cycle. The relationship between hematocrit and mass in birds highlight their ability to invest energy in activities such as reproduction and migration and face costs linked to ali subphases. We tested three hypotheses to evaluate the relationship between hematocrit and mass for an intratropical migrant bird, the Lesser Elaenia (Elaenia chiriquensis): (1) In the arrival phase, we expected that there would be a decrease in mass accompanied by a drop in hematocrit leveis in a negative linear relationship; (2) during the reproduction phase we expected, at most, a weak relationship and a decrease in mass and hematocrit, due to the physiological complexity of this phase; (3) on the departure phase, we expected an increase in mass complemented by an increase in hematocrit as a positive linear relationship. We found that the Lesser Elaenia has average mass and hematocrit leveis in the arrival phase similar to those in the other phases, thus not showing the expected trend as predicted above. On the other hand, during the reproduction phase, as expected, there was no significant relationship between mass and hematocrit leveis, whereas a strong relationship between these variables was detected during the departure phase. Overall, the Lesser Elaenia arrives in good condition in their breeding sites, then it undergoes some physiological stress during the breeding period, but later is able to rapidly recover optimal physiological conditions upon departure to wintering grounds."
Save your tears: eye secretions of a Ringed Kingfisher fed upon by an erebid moth,"Bodily fluids and secretions of birds are fed upon by flying insects, the best-known example being the worldwide blood-feeding mosquitoes. Much less known are the Neotropical mucus-feeding stingless bees, and the Malagasy tear-feeding moths. Herein I illustrate and briefly comment on a night-roosting Ringed Kingfisher female whose tears were fed upon by an erebid moth in the Colombian Amazon. The moth perched on the bird’s neck and fed on the secretions in the anterior upper corner of the eye. Careful checking of night-roosting birds probably will disclose additional cases of Neotropical bird species sought by tear-feeding moths."

This rail is a mangrove specialist endemic to the coastal belt from São Paulo to Santa Catarina, with some insular populations off the northern coast of São Paulo. Crabs, especially Uca spp., are the main prey in mangroves while island birds feed on large ground-dwelling arthropods and scavenge fish dropped by seabirds. Breeding is tied to the rainy season and nests found in mangrove sites were built with twigs and leaves on trees overhanging rivers and tidal channels and had 1–6 eggs."
"Population estimate of Mergus octosetaceus in the Jalapão region, Tocantins, Brazil","The Brazilian Merganser is a threatened species and classified as Critically Endangered. Its world population is estimated to be fewer than 250 individuais surviving in the wild. Currently, the species is known from disjunct populations distributed in the states of Minas Gerais, Goiás, and Tocantins (in the Jalapão region). For this study, the stretches of the Preto, Novo, Soninho, and Sono Rivers were surveyed by airboat to better estimate the species distribution in the region. Brazilian Mergansers were found only on the Novo River along a stretch upstream from Da Velha waterfall. Four pairs and a few other adult individuais were identified there. A 50 km stretch of the Novo River was selected for monthly censuses (n = 13) from August 2009 to October 2010 to estimate the relative abundance and population size of the Brazilian Merganser. The Abundance Kilometric Index was 0.125 individuais/km. The Novo River, from Da Velha waterfall until near its headwaters, is 145 km long and our survey estimated a population of 13.7 individuais. Changes caused by uncontrolled tourist activities on the Novo River, such as rafting during the species’ breeding season, riparian forest deforestation, and proposed hydropower projects, can negatively impact this small Brazilian Merganser population putting it in great risk of local extinction."
The Purplish Jay rides wild ungulates to pick food,"Corvids are renowned for their variable foraging behaviour, and about 20 species in eight genera perch on wild and domestic ungulates to pick ticks on the body of these mammals. Herein I illustrate and briefly comment on the Purplish Jay (Cyanocorax cyanomelas) riding deer and tapir in the Pantanal, Western Brazil. The jay perched on the head or back of the ungulates and searched for ticks, playing the role of a cleaner bird. Deer are rarely reported as hosts or clients of tick-picking birds in the Neotropics. The Purplish Jay is the southernmost Neotropical cleaner corvid reported to date. Given their opportunistic foraging behaviour, a few other Cyanocorax jay species may occasionally play the cleaner role of wild and domestic ungulates."
Factors Associated with Money Mismanagement Among Adults with Severe Mental Illness and Substance Abuse,"People with severe mental illness often have substantial problems with money mismanagement such as losing or lending money to other people and making impulsive or unnecessary purchases, including drugs and alcohol. Money mismanagement in turn affects patients’ health and social functioning, and can lead to homelessness and other harm. This cross-sectional study evaluated demographic and clinical predictors of money mismanagement among SSI/SSDI recipients. SSI/SSDI beneficiaries (N = 95) with recent cocaine use initiating a clinical trial were assessed at intake with demographic, cognitive, psychiatric, social/family, substance abuse, and financial measures. In multivariate regression analyses, psychiatric functioning and drug dependence diagnosis were independent predictors of self-reported money mismanagement. Even within individuals whom all had recently used cocaine, those with drug dependence and those with more psychiatric symptomatology had more difficulty managing their funds. Future studies might determine whether people who reduce their drug use and psychiatric symptomatology go on to better manage their funds."
A novel force rendering approach for virtual assembly of mechanical parts,"Virtual assembly (VA) is a typical virtual reality (VR)-based application in engineering. However, common interaction devices, such as keyboard and mouse, are less realistic due to lack of force sensation. Therefore, realistic force feedback in the VA environment provides a more natural interaction to simulate the assembly operation and result in improved task efficiency. This paper presents a novel force rendering approach, which focuses on mechanical part assembly based on three basic mechanical fit types, namely clearance fit, interference fit, and transition fit. The algorithm to calculate the assembly force is formulated by analyzing the tolerance variation along the assembly length between two mating parts. And then the force is rendered continuously at real-time during the VA operation to provide a fast, stable, and more realistic assembly force feedback to the users. Several comparative case studies are conducted to investigate the approach with the users’ performance of VA with the other three common approaches, namely conducting assembly task using a WIMP-based CAD software, with a standard physically based approach and the one with both collision detection and geometric constraints, respectively. The proposed approach is more efficient than other approaches by providing continuous force feedback to the users so as to greatly enhance their force sensation of the assembly operation. Moreover, case studies on users’ identification capability of different fit types has shown that with the continuous force rendering, users can easily tell the clearance fit from the other two fit types, hence the proposed approach equips users with the ability to possibly evaluate the assembly performance at the early stage of product development process."
Cutting force prediction in orthogonal turn-milling by directly using engagement boundaries,"Despite of the studies in the last decades, there are still some gaps in understanding of the distinctive behaviors of orthogonal turn-milling. In order to improve the performance of this new technology, deeper investigations are required. This work deals with the mechanics in non-eccentric orthogonal turn-milling. The engaged areas of both side edge and end edge are analyzed. Then, the boundary conditions used to extract them are derived. The two sets of cutting force coefficients for the side edge and end edge are calibrated based on slot milling and plunge milling, respectively. The total cutting forces are calculated as a sum of the cutting forces on both side edge and end edge. The proposed cutting force model is validated experimentally on a five-axis machine tool. In addition, comparative experiments have been conducted to investigate the effects of cutting depth and longitudinal feed rate on the cutting force in tool axis direction."
Development of fuzzy logic-based statistical process control chart pattern recognition system,"This study developed a fuzzy logic system for online variation detection by recognizing patterns in statistical process control (SPC) charts. The system enables quality engineers to take corrective actions for an out-of-control manufacturing process. The fuzzy logic SPC system has three subsystems and is able to detect most common four patterns. Data go through subsystems in the absence of detective patterns. Otherwise, data will be eliminated when a particular pattern is recognized on the SPC chart. The user-friendly output interface reduces human analysis errors. The performance of the developed fuzzy logic system is tested by a simulated process."
Association Between Paradoxical HDL Cholesterol Decrease and Risk of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients Initiated on Statin Treatment in a Primary Care Setting,Statin-induced changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are unrelated. Many patients initiated on statins experience a paradoxical decrease in HDL-C. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between a decrease in HDL-C and risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).
Abuse-Deterrent Opioid Formulations: Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Considerations,"Abuse-deterrent formulations (ADFs) are technologically sophisticated pharmaceutical formulations that impede manipulation and extraction of opioids and/or provoke unpleasant effects when they are taken in excessive quantity. This is implemented by creating physical barriers, inseparably combining the opioid with an opioid antagonist or adding aversive agents to the formulation. These pharmaceutical changes may potentially alter the pharmacokinetics and consequently the pharmacodynamics of the opioid. In this review, comparative evidence on pharmacokinetic differences between abuse-deterrent and classical formulations of the same opioids is summarized; furthermore, pharmacodynamic differences, with a focus on analgesia and abuse-related symptoms, are addressed. Most of the 12 studies comparing opioid pharmacokinetics have judged the physically intact ADF as being bioequivalent to the corresponding classical formulation. Pharmacokinetic differences have, however, been reported with physically manipulated ADFs and have ranged from moderate deviations from bioequivalence to complete changes in the pharmacokinetic profile (e.g. from a sustained-release formulation to a fast-release formulation). Pharmacodynamic effects were assessed in 14 comparative studies, which reported that intact ADFs usually provided clinically equivalent analgesia and clear advantages with respect to their addiction potential. However, withdrawal symptoms could be induced by the ADFs, although rarely and, in particular, when the ADFs had been physically altered. This evidence suggests that opioid ADFs are a working concept resulting in mostly minor pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences in comparison with classical formulations; however, they may deviate from this equivalence when physically altered."
Traceability of Biologics in The Netherlands: An Analysis of Information-Recording Systems in Clinical Practice and Spontaneous ADR Reports,"Pharmacovigilance requirements for biologics mandate that EU Member States shall ensure that any biologic that is the subject of a suspected adverse drug reaction (ADR) is identifiable by brand name and batch number. Recent studies showed that brand name identification is well established, whereas batch numbers are (still) poorly reported. We evaluated information-recording systems and practices in the Dutch hospital setting to identify determinants for brand name and batch number recording as well as success factors and bottlenecks for traceability."
Social network and private provision of public goods,"Using a simple model with interdependent utilities, we study how social networks influence individual voluntary contributions to the provision of a public good. Departing from the standard model of public good provision, we assume that an agent’s utility has two terms: (a) ‘ego’-utility derived from the agent’s consumption of public and private goods, and (b) a social utility which is the sum of utility spillovers from other agents with whom the agent has social relationships. We establish conditions for the existence of a unique interior Nash equilibrium and describe the equilibrium in terms of network characteristics. We show that social network always has a positive effect on the provision of the public good. We also find that, in networks with “small world”-like modular structures, ‘bridging’ ties connecting distant parts of social network play an important role inducing an agent’s contribution to public good. Assumptions and results of the model are discussed in relation to the role of social capital in community-level development projects and to the effect of innovation networks on firms’ R&D investments."
Evolutionary targeting for inclusive development,"Many studies articulate a theoretical conceptual change—that is, a change from neo-classical economics and “Picking Winners” policy frameworks to a systemic-evolutionary targeting framework. Within such an intellectual context, this paper attempts to expand the evolutionary targeting framework to facilitate the process of inclusive industrial development. We present a unitary industrial development trajectory which is used as a narrative to articulate the evolutionary paths of Taiwan and Malaysia in making their respective sectoral changes (from informal to formal, and then to high technology sectors) endogenous. Building on both cases, we elucidate how the organization of subsistence farming contributes to development, and hence paves the way for new industrial takeoff. In this regard, the targeting programs that focus on the Schumpeterian segment are improved upon to offer support for (re)organization of the informal sector. This study, therefore, proposes a new analytical grid theorizing the current observations in inclusive development studies. It thus explicitly acknowledges the importance of transforming the informal sector to achieve inclusive development."

Some new class of special functions suggested by the confluent hypergeometric function,"In the present work, we introduce the function representing a rapidly convergent power series which extends the well-known confluent hypergeometric function \(_1F_1[z]\) as well as the integral function \( f(z) = \sum \nolimits _{n=1}^\infty \frac{z^n}{n!^n} \) considered by Sikkema (Differential operators and equations, P. Noordhoff N. V., Djakarta, 1953). We introduce the corresponding differential operators and obtain infinite order differential equations, for which these new special functions are the eigen functions. First we establish some properties, as the order zero of these entire (integral) functions, integral representations, differential equations involving a kind of hyper-Bessel type operators of infinite order. Then we emphasize on the special cases, especially the corresponding analogues of the exponential, circular and hyperbolic functions, called here as \({\ell }\)-H exponential function, \({\ell }\)-H circular and \({\ell }\)-H hyperbolic functions. At the end, the graphs of these functions are plotted using the Maple software."
Solving a system of split variational inequality problems,"In this paper, we introduce a system of split variational inequality problems in real Hilbert spaces. Using a projection method, we propose an iterative algorithm for solving this system of split variational inequality problems. Further, we prove that the sequence generated by the iterative algorithm converges strongly to a solution of the system of split variational inequality problems. Furthermore, we discuss some consequences of the main result. The iterative algorithms and results presented in this paper generalize, unify and improve the previously known results of this area."
Ionic liquid enhanced magnesium-based polymer electrolytes for electrical double-layer capacitors,This paper describes the preparation and characterization of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-added ionic liquid-based ion conductors. The polymer electrolyte is incorporated with magnesium triflate [Mg(CF3SO3)2 or MgTf] as salt and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (BmImBr) as ionic liquid. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is carried out to investigate the glass transition temperature which is used to study the plasticizing effect of the ionic liquid. The highest conducting ionic liquid-based polymer electrolyte is used to fabricate electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLC). The electrochemical potential window is evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The electrochemical capacitance of the EDLC is evaluated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD). The electrochemical potential window of ionic liquid-added polymer electrolyte is extended from 1.35 to 2.6 V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) proves the improvement in specific capacitance of the electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) containing ionic liquid-added polymer electrolyte.
Transperineal minimally invasive approach for extralevator abdominoperineal excision,"Recently, the efficiency of transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) for rectal cancer has been demonstrated (Velthuis et al. in Surg Endosc 28:3494–3499, 2014; Fernandez-Hevia in Ann Surg 261:221–227, 2015; Atallah et al. in Tech Coloproctol 18:473–480, 2014). We present our procedure of TAMIS for extralevator abdominoperineal excision (ELAPE) (Holm et al. in Br J Surg 94:232–238, 2007)."
Integration of PGD-virtual charts into an engineering design process,"This article deals with the efficient construction of approximations of fields and quantities of interest used in geometric optimisation of complex shapes that can be encountered in engineering structures. The strategy, which is developed herein, is based on the construction of virtual charts that allow, once computed offline, to optimise the structure for a negligible online CPU cost. These virtual charts can be used as a powerful numerical decision support tool during the design of industrial structures. They are built using the proper generalized decomposition (PGD) that offers a very convenient framework to solve parametrised problems. In this paper, particular attention has been paid to the integration of the procedure into a genuine engineering design process. In particular, a dedicated methodology is proposed to interface the PGD approach with commercial software."

On stationary points of nonexpansive set-valued mappings,In this paper we deal with stationary points (also known as endpoints) of nonexpansive set-valued mappings and show that the existence of such points under certain conditions follows as a consequence of the existence of approximate stationary sequences. In particular we provide abstract extensions of well-known fixed point theorems.
Technique modifications for septodermoplasty: an illustrative case,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease that results in telangiectasia of the sinonasal tract, gastro-intestinal tract as well as possible arteriovenous malformations of the lung, liver and brain. One of the most common disease manifestations of HHT is epistaxis. Severe recurrent epistaxis necessitating iron therapy and blood transfusion is often managed with septodermoplasty. Its initial description was as an open surgical technique requiring nasal packing."
Postoperative elevation of CA15-3 due to pernicious anemia in a patient without evidence of breast cancer recurrence,"Cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) is considered as a marker for breast cancer recurrence. However, we encountered a case where the patient showed postoperative elevation of the CA15-3 level due to pernicious anemia without evidence of breast cancer recurrence. The patient was a 60-year-old postmenopausal woman. She had undergone partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for her T1 left breast cancer. SLNB had indicated no lymph node metastases. The tumor was positive for hormone receptors and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Therefore, an aromatase inhibitor and external beam irradiation had been administered as adjuvant therapy. However, the CA15-3 level was found to be elevated at 6 months postoperatively. Although imaging studies did not indicate breast cancer recurrence, CA15-3 levels continued to increase. Based on the findings of blood tests and gastroendoscopy, a diagnosis of pernicious anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency was finally confirmed at 2 years and 6 months postoperatively. The CA15-3 level returned to normal after vitamin B12 administration. The possibility of pernicious anemia should be considered in cases of postoperative elevated CA15-3 levels with no evidence of recurrence in patients with early breast cancer."
"Lack of association among TNF-α gene expression, -308 polymorphism (G > A) and virulence markers of Helicobacter pylori","Tumor necrosis factor plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of gastric diseases such as gastric cancer, and an abnormal inflammatory response has frequently been observed in dyspeptic patients. Helicobacter pylori infection can induce a gastric mucosal inflammatory response that may be influenced by -308 (G > A) polymorphisms and gene expression of the TNF-α gene."
Non-invasive magnetic resonance-guided high intensity focused ultrasound ablation of a vascular malformation in the lower extremity: a case report,"Therapy of choice for symptomatic vascular malformations consists of surgery, sclerotherapy, or embolization. However, these techniques are invasive with possible complications and require hospitalization. We present a novel non-invasive technique, i.e., magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) ablation, for the treatment of a vascular malformation in a patient. This technique applies high-intensity sound waves transcutaneously to the body and is fully non-invasive. MRI guidance is the novel aspect of HIFU treatments and is used for exquisite delineation and localization of the lesion and accurate real-time temperature monitoring during tissue ablation. MR-HIFU is a well-established treatment option for uterine fibroids and is currently being investigated for, e.g., bone tumors, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and liver cancer. MR-HIFU of vascular malformations has not been a topic of research yet."

Effects of microbial lipases on hydrolyzed milk fat at different time intervals in flavour development and oxidative stability,"The interest in application of biocatalysis during natural milk fat flavours development has increased rapidly and lipases have become the most studied group in the development of bovine milk fat flavours. Lipozyme-435, Novozyme-435 and Thermomyces lanuginosus Immobilized (TL-IM) lipases were used to hydrolyze anhydrous milk fat (AMF) and anhydrous buffalo milk fat (ABF) and their volatile flavouring compounds were identified by solid-phase micro-extraction gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS) and then compared at three hydrolysis intervals. Both AMF and ABF after lipolysis produced high amount of butanoic and hexanoic acids and other flavouring compounds; however, highest amount were produced by Lipozyme-435 and Novozyme-435 followed by TL-IM. The hydrolyzed products were assessed by Rancimat-743 for oxidative stability and found both that, for AMF and ABF treated butter oil, Lipozyme-435 and TL-IM were generally more stable compared to Novozyme-435. For both AMF and ABF treated butter oil, Lipozyme-435 was observed to cause no further oxidation consequences which indicates Lipozyme-435 was stable during hydrolysis at 55 °C for 24 h."
The effect of amino-terminated hyperbranched polymers on the impact resistance of epoxy resins,"A novel amino-terminated hyperbranched polymer (ATHBP) was synthesized through the end-capping reaction between hyperbranched polymer with hydroxyl group (HBPH) and diethylenetriamine. The chemical structure of ATHBP was characterized by attenuated total internal reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR). The effect of ATHBP content (0–30 wt%) on the impact resistance and glass transition temperature (Tg) of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A epoxy resin was studied. The toughness mechanism was discussed by observing the fracture surface morphologies of epoxy thermosets using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The results showed that the degree of branching of ATHBP was 0.56. And the introduction of ATHBP could favorably improve the impact strength but not sacrifice the Tg of epoxy resin. For example, the impact strength of 25 wt% formulation was 60.7 % higher than that of the neat epoxy thermoset. FESEM analysis indicated that the toughening mechanism may be attributed to plastic deformation mechanism."
Coagulation of landfill leachate by FeCl3: process optimization using Box–Behnken design (RSM),"FeCl3 coagulation was used to achieve maximum reduction of COD, phosphate, sulfate and color and process optimization (FeCl3 dosage, pH, reaction time) was done by BBD-RSM. Responses were recorded in terms of EC, COD, phosphate, color and sulfate removal. Variables A (pH) and B (reaction time) were negatively related to removal of COD and phosphate, whereas, C (FeCl3 dosage) was positive in case of COD removal and negative for phosphate removal. pH and coagulant dosage had negative relationship with color removal; however, reaction time showed positive relationship. In case of percent sulfate removal, variable A (pH) demonstrated negative relationship whereas B (reaction time) and C (FeCl3 dosage) were found to be positively related. Numerical optimization of the model revealed a maximum reduction of 71, 93, 86 and 99.6 % COD, phosphate, color and sulfate at optimal FeCl3 dosage = 3 g/l, pH 8, and reaction time = 95 min."
"Is Experiential Avoidance a Mediating, Moderating, Independent, Overlapping, or Proxy Risk Factor in the Onset, Relapse and Maintenance of Depressive Disorders?","Our study aim was to investigate how experiential avoidance ‘works together’ with bordering psychological constructs (i.e., rumination, worry and neuroticism) in predicting the onset, relapse and maintenance of depressive disorders. We performed a longitudinal cohort study with repeated assessments after 2 and 4 years in a sample of 737 persons with a 6-month recency dysthymic and/or major depressive disorder, a sample of 1150 remitted persons with a history of previous depressive disorders; and a sample of 626 persons with no 6-month recency depressive or anxiety disorders and no previous depressive disorders. Experiential avoidance predicted onset, relapse as well as maintenance of depressive disorders during the 4-year follow-up period. However, after controlling for rumination, worry and neuroticism, experiential avoidance no longer significantly predicted onset, relapse or maintenance of depressive disorders in contrast to repetitive thinking in the form of rumination or worry. Experiential avoidance also did not mediate or moderate the effect of rumination, worry and neuroticism."
Experimental Qualification of Mechanical and Electrical Sub-systems of a Complex Mechanism Against Fatigue Failure,"Absorber rod drive mechanisms (ARDM) play an important role in ensuring safety of a reactor by rapid insertion of an absorber rod during abnormal conditions. Various components/sub-systems of ARDMs, both mechanical and electrical, are subjected to different cyclic loadings during service life. Thus, qualifying these systems against fatigue is an important step for gaining confidence in their safe operation for the design life. ASME in Sec. III, Div. 1, Appendices (Para II—1500) provides guidelines for the experimental evaluation of the capability of components to withstand cyclic loading. These rules are developed for static components like pressure vessels. Since no such rules are available for moving components like mechanisms, the same were adopted for the ARDMs, with an understanding that the effect of inertia loads of a moving component are to be accounted in the experiments. In application of these rules to a complex mechanisms such as ARDM, various special cases arise which are not addressed explicitly in the code. The paper describes the intelligent adoption of the fatigue life rules given in ASME to various special cases and their extension to electrical systems. The paper also outlines the experiments carried out for qualifying the ARDM against fatigue."
Effect of Ni and Mn on the Creep Behaviour of 9–10 %Cr Steels with Low N and High B,"Creep behavior and microstructure of two 9–10 %Cr–3 %Co martensitic steels with high B and low N was examined. A 10 %Cr steel with low Ni and Mn additives exhibits superior creep resistance and no creep strength breakdown appears at 650 °C. In this steel a dispersion of boundary M23C6 carbides and Laves phase remains nearly unchanged under creep condition and no significant coarsening of lath structure takes place. In contrast, a 9 %Cr steel containing 0.4 wt% Mn and 0.24 %Ni exhibits the creep strength breakdown and relatively low long-term creep strength. In this steel the boundary particles are susceptible to significant coarsening under long-term creep. As a result, the tempered martensite lath structure (TMLS) tends to transform to subgrain structure; significant subgrain growth is observed. No distinct difference in effect of creep and long-term aging on a dispersion of M(C,N) carbonitrides was revealed between two steels."
Interest in a Twitter-delivered weight loss program among women of childbearing age,"Weight management through the childbearing years is important, yet few women have access to efficacious weight loss programs. Online social network-delivered programs may increase reach and thus impact. The aim of this study was to gauge interest in a Twitter-based weight loss intervention among women of childbearing age and the feasibility of recruitment via Twitter. We recruited English-speaking women aged 18–45 years (N = 63) from Twitter to complete an anonymous online survey including open-ended questions about program advantages and concerns. Forty percent of participants were obese and 83 % were trying to lose weight. Eighty-one percent were interested in a Twitter-delivered weight loss program. Interest was high in all subgroups (62–100 %). Participants (59 %) cited program advantages, including convenience, support/accountability, and privacy. Concerns (59 %) included questions about privacy, support/accountability, engagement, efficacy, and technology barriers. Research is needed to develop and evaluate social media-delivered interventions, and to develop methods for recruiting participants directly from Twitter."
Dynamics of the 3/1 planetary mean-motion resonance: an application to the HD60532 b-c planetary system,"In this paper, we use a semi-analytical approach to analyze the global structure of the phase space of the planar planetary 3/1 mean-motion resonance. The case where the outer planet is more massive than its inner companion is considered. We show that the resonant dynamics can be described using two fundamental parameters, the total angular momentum and the spacing parameter. The topology of the Hamiltonian function describing the resonant behaviour is investigated on a large domain of the phase space without time-expensive numerical integrations of the equations of motion, and without any restriction on the magnitude of the planetary eccentricities. The families of the Apsidal Corotation Resonances (ACR) parameterized by the planetary mass ratio are obtained and their stability is analyzed. The main dynamical features in the domains around the ACR are also investigated in detail by means of spectral analysis techniques, which allow us to detect the regions of different regimes of motion of resonant systems. The construction of dynamical maps for various values of the total angular momentum shows the evolution of domains of stable motion with the eccentricities, identifying possible configurations suitable for exoplanetary systems."
Secular dynamics of S-type planetary orbits in binary star systems: applicability domains of first- and second-order theories,"We analyse the secular dynamics of planets on S-type coplanar orbits in tight binary systems, based on first- and second-order analytical models, and compare their predictions with full N-body simulations. The perturbation parameter adopted for the development of these models depends on the masses of the stars and on the semimajor axis ratio between the planet and the binary. We show that each model has both advantages and limitations. While the first-order analytical model is algebraically simple and easy to implement, it is only applicable in regions of the parameter space where the perturbations are sufficiently small. The second-order model, although more complex, has a larger range of validity and must be taken into account for dynamical studies of some real exoplanetary systems such as \(\gamma \) Cephei and HD 41004A. However, in some extreme cases, neither of these analytical models yields quantitatively correct results, requiring either higher-order theories or direct numerical simulations. Finally, we determine the limits of applicability of each analytical model in the parameter space of the system, giving an important visual aid to decode which secular theory should be adopted for any given planetary system in a close binary."
A new sparse representation-based object segmentation framework,"In this paper, a novel sparse representation-based object segmentation model is proposed. The model follows from a new energy function that combines the level-set-based sparse representation and the independent component-based shape representation within a unified framework. Before the optimization of the proposed energy, a set of training shapes is firstly projected into the shape space spanned by the independent components. For an arbitrary input shape similar to some of the elements in the training set, the minimization of the energy will automatically recover a sparse shape combination according to the neighbors in the projected shape space to guide the variational image segmentation. We test our model on both public datasets and real applications, and the experimental results show the superior segmentation capabilities of the proposed model."
The impact of cut-off lows on ozone in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere over Changchun from ozonesonde observations,"In situ measurements of the vertical structure of ozone were made in Changchun (43.53°N, 125.13°E), China, by the Institute of Atmosphere Physics, in the summers of 2010–13. Analysis of the 89 validated ozone profiles shows the variation of ozone concentration in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) caused by cut-off lows (COLs) over Changchun. During the COL events, an increase of the ozone concentration and a lower height of the tropopause are observed. Backward simulations with a trajectory model show that the ozone-rich airmass brought by the COL is from Siberia. A case study proves that stratosphere–troposphere exchange (STE) occurs in the COL. The ozone-rich air mass transported from the stratosphere to the troposphere first becomes unstable, then loses its high ozone concentration. This process usually happens during the decay stage of COLs. In order to understand the influence of COLs on the ozone in the UTLS, statistical analysis of the ozone profiles within COLs, and other profiles, are employed. The results indicate that the ozone concentrations of the in-COL profiles are significantly higher than those of the other profiles between ±4 km around the tropopause. The COLs induce an increase in UTLS column ozone by 32% on average. Meanwhile, the COLs depress the lapse-rate tropopause (LRT)/dynamical tropopause height by 1.4/1.7 km and cause the atmosphere above the tropopause to be less stable. The influence of COLs is durable because the increased ozone concentration lasts at least one day after the COL has passed over Changchun. Furthermore, the relative coefficient between LRT height and lower stratosphere (LS) column ozone is -0.62, which implies a positive correlation between COL strength and LS ozone concentration."
Impact of Ball-Milling Pretreatment on Pyrolysis Behavior and Kinetics of Crystalline Cellulose,"Effect of ball-milling pretreatment on pyrolysis characteristics of cellulose was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at four different heating rates; 5, 10, 20, and 40 K/min. Variation in the thermal stability and activation energy of cellulose with ball-milling were calculated by TGA Kinetics using Kissinger, Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose, Flynn–Wall–Ozawa and Starink model free methods. Results demonstrated that ball-milling reduced the thermal stability and activation energy of cellulose. The original and ball-milled cellulose were thoroughly characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that ball-milling decreased the crystallinity of cellulose from 93 to 51 %. The results suggested that ball-milling pretreatment led to effective disruption of crystalline cellulose to amorphous cellulose. It is, therefore, concluded that the ball-milled cellulose can easily become a useful source of chemicals and energy than crystalline cellulose."
Falls as anomalies? An experimental evaluation using smartphone accelerometer data,"Life expectancy keeps growing and, among elderly people, accidental falls occur frequently. A system able to promptly detect falls would help in reducing the injuries that a fall could cause. Such a system should meet the needs of the people to which is designed, so that it is actually used. In particular, the system should be minimally invasive and inexpensive. Thanks to the fact that most of the smartphones embed accelerometers and powerful processing unit, they are good candidates both as data acquisition devices and as platforms to host fall detection systems. For this reason, in the last years several fall detection methods have been experimented on smartphone accelerometer data. Most of them have been tuned with simulated falls because, to date, datasets of real-world falls are not available. This article evaluates the effectiveness of methods that detect falls as anomalies. To this end, we compared traditional approaches with anomaly detectors. In particular, we experienced the kNN and the SVM methods using both the one-class and two-classes configurations. The comparison involved three different collections of accelerometer data, and four different data representations. Empirical results demonstrated that, in most of the cases, falls are not required to design an effective fall detector."
The effect of amino-terminated hyperbranched polymers on the impact resistance of epoxy resins,"A novel amino-terminated hyperbranched polymer (ATHBP) was synthesized through the end-capping reaction between hyperbranched polymer with hydroxyl group (HBPH) and diethylenetriamine. The chemical structure of ATHBP was characterized by attenuated total internal reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR). The effect of ATHBP content (0–30 wt%) on the impact resistance and glass transition temperature (Tg) of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A epoxy resin was studied. The toughness mechanism was discussed by observing the fracture surface morphologies of epoxy thermosets using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The results showed that the degree of branching of ATHBP was 0.56. And the introduction of ATHBP could favorably improve the impact strength but not sacrifice the Tg of epoxy resin. For example, the impact strength of 25 wt% formulation was 60.7 % higher than that of the neat epoxy thermoset. FESEM analysis indicated that the toughening mechanism may be attributed to plastic deformation mechanism."
Coagulation of landfill leachate by FeCl3: process optimization using Box–Behnken design (RSM),"FeCl3 coagulation was used to achieve maximum reduction of COD, phosphate, sulfate and color and process optimization (FeCl3 dosage, pH, reaction time) was done by BBD-RSM. Responses were recorded in terms of EC, COD, phosphate, color and sulfate removal. Variables A (pH) and B (reaction time) were negatively related to removal of COD and phosphate, whereas, C (FeCl3 dosage) was positive in case of COD removal and negative for phosphate removal. pH and coagulant dosage had negative relationship with color removal; however, reaction time showed positive relationship. In case of percent sulfate removal, variable A (pH) demonstrated negative relationship whereas B (reaction time) and C (FeCl3 dosage) were found to be positively related. Numerical optimization of the model revealed a maximum reduction of 71, 93, 86 and 99.6 % COD, phosphate, color and sulfate at optimal FeCl3 dosage = 3 g/l, pH 8, and reaction time = 95 min."
"Is Experiential Avoidance a Mediating, Moderating, Independent, Overlapping, or Proxy Risk Factor in the Onset, Relapse and Maintenance of Depressive Disorders?","Our study aim was to investigate how experiential avoidance ‘works together’ with bordering psychological constructs (i.e., rumination, worry and neuroticism) in predicting the onset, relapse and maintenance of depressive disorders. We performed a longitudinal cohort study with repeated assessments after 2 and 4 years in a sample of 737 persons with a 6-month recency dysthymic and/or major depressive disorder, a sample of 1150 remitted persons with a history of previous depressive disorders; and a sample of 626 persons with no 6-month recency depressive or anxiety disorders and no previous depressive disorders. Experiential avoidance predicted onset, relapse as well as maintenance of depressive disorders during the 4-year follow-up period. However, after controlling for rumination, worry and neuroticism, experiential avoidance no longer significantly predicted onset, relapse or maintenance of depressive disorders in contrast to repetitive thinking in the form of rumination or worry. Experiential avoidance also did not mediate or moderate the effect of rumination, worry and neuroticism."
Effects of microbial lipases on hydrolyzed milk fat at different time intervals in flavour development and oxidative stability,"The interest in application of biocatalysis during natural milk fat flavours development has increased rapidly and lipases have become the most studied group in the development of bovine milk fat flavours. Lipozyme-435, Novozyme-435 and Thermomyces lanuginosus Immobilized (TL-IM) lipases were used to hydrolyze anhydrous milk fat (AMF) and anhydrous buffalo milk fat (ABF) and their volatile flavouring compounds were identified by solid-phase micro-extraction gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS) and then compared at three hydrolysis intervals. Both AMF and ABF after lipolysis produced high amount of butanoic and hexanoic acids and other flavouring compounds; however, highest amount were produced by Lipozyme-435 and Novozyme-435 followed by TL-IM. The hydrolyzed products were assessed by Rancimat-743 for oxidative stability and found both that, for AMF and ABF treated butter oil, Lipozyme-435 and TL-IM were generally more stable compared to Novozyme-435. For both AMF and ABF treated butter oil, Lipozyme-435 was observed to cause no further oxidation consequences which indicates Lipozyme-435 was stable during hydrolysis at 55 °C for 24 h."
A unified a posteriori error estimate of local discontinuous Galerkin approximations for reactive transport problems,"To solve reactive transport problems in porous media, local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) approximations are investigated. Based on the duality technique and the residual error notations, a unified a posteriori error estimate in L

2) norm is obtained, which is usually used for guiding anisotropic and dynamic mesh adaptivity."
The Levitin-Polyak well-posedness by perturbations for systems of general variational inclusion and disclusion problems,"In this paper, the notions of the Levitin-Polyak well-posedness by perturbations for system of general variational inclusion and disclusion problems (shortly, (SGVI) and (SGVDI)) are introduced in Hausdorff topological vector spaces. Some sufficient and necessary conditions of the Levitin-Polyak well-posedness by perturbations for (SGVI) (resp., (SGVDI)) are derived under some suitable conditions. We also explore some relations among the Levitin-Polyak well-posedness by perturbations, the existence and uniqueness of solution of (SGVI) and (SGVDI), respectively. Finally, the lower (upper) semicontinuity of the approximate solution mappings of (SGVI) and (SGVDI) are established via the Levitin-Polyak well-posedness by perturbations."
Strength does not influence knee function in the ACL-deficient knee but is a correlate of knee function in the and ACL-reconstructed knee,"Knee function, whether anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-deficient or ACL-reconstructed, is related to many conditions, and no single biomechanical variable can be used to definitively assess knee performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between extension and flexion muscle strength and knee function in patients prior and following ACL reconstruction."
Phase I trial of vandetanib in combination with gemcitabine and capecitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors with an expanded cohort in pancreatic and biliary cancers,"Background Vandetanib is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that affects vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and rearranged during transfection (RET) mediated receptors which are important for growth and invasion of biliary and pancreatic cancers. This phase I study evaluated the safety profile of vandetanib in combination with standard doses of gemcitabine and capecitabine in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Methods In this single center phase I trial, patients received gemcitabine intravenously (IV) at 1000 mg/m2 days 1, 8, 15 in a 28 day cycle, capecitabine orally at 850 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1–21, and escalating doses of vandetanib (200 or 300 mg orally daily). Once the MTD was defined, an expansion cohort of patients with advanced biliary cancers and locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer was enrolled. Blood samples were also collected at predetermined time points for biomarker analysis. Results Twenty-three patients were enrolled: 9 in the dose escalation and 14 in the dose expansion cohort. One dose limiting toxicity (DLT), of grade 4 neutropenia, occurred in the 200 mg vandetanib cohort. The most common adverse effects were diarrhea (39 %), nausea and vomiting (34 %), and rash (33 %). There were 3 partial responses and stable disease of >2 months (range 2–45, median 5) was observed in 15/23 patients. There was no association between changes in biomarker analytes and disease response. Conclusion The combination of gemcitabine, capecitabine and vandetanib is well tolerated at the recommended phase II dose of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 weekly for three consecutive weeks, capecitabine 850 mg/m2 BID days 1–21, and vandetanib 300 mg daily, every 28 days. This combination demonstrated promising activity in pancreaticobiliary cancers and further evaluation is warranted in these diseases. NCT00551096."
"The Effect of Laves Phase (Fe,Al)2Zr on the High-Temperature Strength of Carbon-Alloyed Fe3Al Aluminide","The effects of carbon on the phase structure and on the yield stress σ
0.2 in the temperature range from 873 K to 1073 K (600 °C to 800 °C) of the Fe3Al type aluminides alloyed by Zr are analyzed. Four alloys with Zr and C in ranging from 1.0 to 5.0 at. pct of additives were used. The appearing of either Laves phase (Fe,Al)2Zr and/or carbides depend on the difference in concentrations, c
Zr − c
C. This parameter (c
Zr − c
C) has been selected instead of the concentration ratio c
Zr/c
C used in previous works since it exhibits a significantly better correlation with the Laves phase concentration which influences the high-temperature yield stress, σ
0.2, of the tested alloys. The presence of Laves phase or eutectic (matrix—Laves phase), respectively, enhances the value of the yield stress σ
0.2. The amount of Laves phase is decreased by the presence of C due to the affinity of carbon to Zr."
Multi-label multi-instance transfer learning for simultaneous reconstruction and cross-talk modeling of multiple human signaling pathways,"Signaling pathways play important roles in the life processes of cell growth, cell apoptosis and organism development. At present the signal transduction networks are far from complete. As an effective complement to experimental methods, computational modeling is suited to rapidly reconstruct the signaling pathways at low cost. To our knowledge, the existing computational methods seldom simultaneously exploit more than three signaling pathways into one predictive model for the discovery of novel signaling components and the cross-talk modeling between signaling pathways."
Mental Health Diagnostic Considerations in Racial/Ethnic Minority Youth,"Misdiagnoses of racial/ethnic minority youth’s mental health problems can potentially contribute to inappropriate mental health care. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review that focuses on current theory and empirical research in an attempt to answer the following two questions: (1) What evidence exists that supports or contradicts the idea that racial/ethnic minority youth’s mental health problems are misdiagnosed? (2) What are the sources of misdiagnoses? Articles were reviewed from 1967 to 2014 using PsychINFO, PubMed, and GoogleScholar. Search terms included “race”, “ethnicity”, “minority”, “culture”, “children”, “youth”, “adolescents”, “mental health”, “psychopathology”, “diagnosis”, “misdiagnosis”, “miscategorization”, “underdiagnosis”, and “overdiagnosis”. Seventy-two articles and book chapters met criteria and were included in this review. Overall, evidence was found that supports the possibility of misdiagnosis of ethnic minority youth’s emotional and behavioral problems. However, the evidence is limited such that it cannot be determined whether racial/ethnic differences are due to differences in psychopathology, mental health biases, and/or inaccurate diagnoses. Cultural and contextual factors that may influence misdiagnosis as well as recommendations for research and practice are discussed."
Macroscopic evaluation of the anterior cruciate ligament in osteoarthritic patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty,"Sacrifice of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is currently common practice during total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, patients who receive an ACL-retaining TKA maintain more normal knee kinematic patterns than those without an ACL. Additionally, satisfactory survival and function more than 20 years after bicruciate-retaining TKA has recently been reported. The purpose of this study was to compare the percentage of knees with a visually intact ACL prior to TKA surgery with previously reported values."
A study of kinetic energy harvesting for biomedical application in the head area,"This paper is focused on determining a suitability of using a kinetic energy harvester placed in the area of the human head for supplying power to a new generation of cochlear implants. Placement-dependant volumetric and mass constraints of the harvester are discussed, and the requirements for its power output are set based on the power demands on the state-of-the-art cochlear implants. Measured acceleration data for different activities are presented together with a statistics of a random user behaviour during the course of 10 months. Nonlinear simulation model based on CAD geometry and FEM analyses is developed and its parameters are optimized using the sensitivity analysis in order to generate the maximum power. Real life acceleration data are then employed to feed the input of the simulation model of energy harvester to predict the obtainable power output. The feasibility of employing the energy harvesting to power the selected biomedical application is discussed based on simulation results."
A fully-digital and ultra-low-power front-end for differential capacitive sensors,"In this paper, we present a simple, compact and low-power interface for differential capacitive sensors with a direct digital output. The complete system is composed with a current to voltage converter, an integrator, a comparator and a one-bit digital to analog converter as a feedback. The so-obtained Sigma–Delta modulator is able to deliver directly a bit stream with a ratio of logical ‘1’ directly proportional to the differential capacitance to be measured. A partially integrated prototype has been realized to demonstrate accuracy and non-linearity compatible with a 9-bit sensor."
The Interface of TiB2 and Al3Ti in Molten Aluminum,"In the grain refinement of aluminum, Al3Ti and TiB2 particles are introduced to reduce the casting grain size down to 200 micrometer level, which makes cold working possible. The particles are brought in by the addition of Al-Ti-B-type master alloys. It is generally believed that TiB2 particles are stable and nucleate α-Al grains in solidification in the presence of titanium in solution from the dissolution of Al3Ti particles in the master alloys. The titanium in solution either forms Al3Ti layers on the surface of TiB2 particles to promote the nucleation of α-Al grains or remains as solute to restrict the growth of α-Al grains in solidification. However, a consensus on a grain refinement mechanism is still to be reached due to the lack of direct observation of the three phases in castings. This paper presents finding of the TiB2/Al3Ti interfaces in an Al-Ti-B master alloy. It demonstrates a strong epitaxial growth of Al3Ti on the surface of TiB2 particles, a sign of the formation of an Al3Ti layer on the surface of TiB2 particles in grain refinement practice. The Al3Ti layer has a crystal coherency with α-Al and hence offers a substrate for heterogeneous nucleation of α-Al grains. However, the layer must be dynamic to avoid the formation of compounded Al3Ti and TiB2 particles leading to the loss of efficiency in grain refinement."
Genetic loci inherited from hens lacking maternal behaviour both inhibit and paradoxically promote this behaviour,"A major step towards the success of chickens as a domesticated species was the separation between maternal care and reproduction. Artificial incubation replaced the natural maternal behaviour of incubation and, thus, in certain breeds, it became possible to breed chickens with persistent egg production and no incubation behaviour; a typical example is the White Leghorn strain. Conversely, some strains, such as the Silkie breed, are prized for their maternal behaviour and their willingness to incubate eggs. This is often colloquially known as broodiness."
The Effectiveness of Zolpidem for the Treatment of Disorders of Consciousness,"Approximately, five million people in the United States live with the residual effects of brain injury. The causes of acquired brain injury can be categorized as traumatic brain injury or non-traumatic brain injury. There are currently no treatments shown to consistently enhance recovery from disorders of consciousness (DOC). Sporadic recovery from DOC after the administration of various pharmacological agents has been described in several case reports. Increase in arousal after zolpidem administration is seen in patients with vegetative state or minimally conscious state for treatment of restlessness and disturbances of their sleep-wake cycle. The use of zolpidem could be reasonable in select patients with neurologic injury but promising integrity of brain structures, such as intact deep and superficial gray matter structures and white matter connections."
The Rise of Policy Coherence for Development: A Multi-Causal Approach,"In recent years policy coherence for development (PCD) has become a key principle in international development debates, and it is likely to become even more relevant in the discussions on the post-2015 sustainable development goals. This article addresses the rise of PCD on the Western donors’ aid agendas. Although the concept had already appeared in the work of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in the early 1990s, it was not until 2007 that PCD became one of the Organisation’s key priorities. We adopt a complexity-sensitive perspective, involving a process-tracing analysis and a multi-causal explanatory framework. We argue that the rise of PCD is not as contingent as it looks. While actors such as the EU, the DAC and the OECD Secretariat were the ‘active causes’ of the rise of PCD, it is equally important to look at the underlying ‘constitutive causes’ that enabled policy coherence to thrive."
Broadening the Global Development Framework Post 2015: Embracing Policy Coherence and Global Public Goods,"With the 21 targets of the Millennium Development Goals and the 0.7 per cent of gross national income target for Official Development Assistance coming to an end, 2015 represents an opportunity to update and broaden the global development reporting framework to strengthen the global effort to reduce poverty in developing countries. This article proposes a three-pillar approach to monitor the post-2015 progress based on traditional development outcomes, policy coherence for development indicators and global public goods. Through an analytical framework, the desirability, feasibility and political acceptability of the approach are assessed. The article finds that any perceived technical challenges could be overcome but that the willingness of more affluent countries to have their contributions monitored is likely to be the key stumbling block."
Coherence and Contradictions in Danish Migration-Development Policy and Practice,"Since the early 2000s, increasing attention has been given to the migration–development nexus. Numerous studies, policy analyses and recommendations on how to make migration work for development in practical ways have been produced, resulting in (among other initiatives) attempts to include migration concerns in the post-2015 development agenda and efforts to promote policy coherence for development. After an initial ‘euphoria’, most involved parties today agree that there is no simple one-way relationship between migration and development. Development is unlikely to decrease migration in the short run, and migration in itself cannot be the main recipe for development. Critical voices, moreover, argue that much migration-development policy in reality has served migration management functions rather than development goals. This article reflects on these contradictions in the light of Danish policy debate and practice. It brings considerations on the migration–development nexus in dialogue with reflections on policy coherence and forwards the following two arguments: First, that although policy coherence in the migration-development field perhaps always was unrealistic, a certain degree of policy incoherence might – at least for a while – have safeguarded development budgets from being used for migration-management purposes. Second, that reluctance to incorporate migration concerns in ‘classic’ development activities represents a missed opportunity. This calls for a critical analysis of Danish and European pledges to adopt a comprehensive and coherent approach to the field of development and migration policies."
Prompt and delayed inelastic scattering reactions from fission neutron irradiation—first results of FaNGaS,A new instrument for fast neutron gamma spectroscopy has been installed and tested at the Forschungsneutronenquelle Heinz Maier-Leibnitz of the MLZ in Garching. A beam with the flux of about 108 cm−2 s−1 fission neutrons is available to irradiate small samples to study inelastic neutron scattering reactions in materials. A number of relevant elements have been investigated and new gamma lines were identified in comparison to existing data libraries. The method seems to be linear with respect to measurement time and sample mass. A particular advantage of fast neutron PGAA compared to thermal neutron PGAA appears in the analysis of materials with high thermal capture cross sections.
Preparation of Pt/C cathode catalyst supported on chestnut-like mesoporous carbon for fuel cell applications,"Fuel cells have received worldwide attention as a next-generation renewable energy technology. However, catalyst cost and durability are the main issue hampering the commercialization of fuel cells. Many studies have focused on the physicochemical properties of the carbon support to improve the catalyst’s properties. Mesoporous carbons are suitable candidates because of their appropriate structural characteristics, including high surface area, large pore size, and regularly interconnected mesopores that permit efficient diffusion of the reactants and by-products. In this study, supports made from chestnut-like carbon consisting of platelet carbon nanofibers were fabricated by selective catalytic gasification of activated carbon. Pt/C catalysts were synthesized from these support structures using the impregnation method. Catalyst performance and characteristics were investigated by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, X-ray diffractions, and the rotating disk electrode technique for the oxygen reduction reaction."
Synthesis and visible light photocatalytic properties of Bi2Fe4O9 particles via EDTA-assisted sol–gel route,"Submicron Bi2Fe4O9 particles could be obtained by applying a modified sol–gel synthesis at the temperature of 650 °C, with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as chelating agent. SEM images showed that morphology and grain size of the as-prepared powders were influenced by calcination temperature. Bi2Fe4O9 pure phase could be controlled by adjusting the amount of EDTA. Correspondingly, the crystal growth and morphology evolution mechanism in the reactions were discussed. Additionally, the photocatalytic properties of the particles were explored. The Bi2Fe4O9 particles synthesized with 5 mmol EDTA showed the highest photocatalytic activity toward methyl orange and rhodamine-B degradation under visible light irradiation, the degradation rate could be as high as 93 and 99 % in 3 h with the aid of H2O2, respectively."
"Role of ionic and nonionic surfactant on the phase formation and morphology of Ba(Ce,Zr)O3 solid solution","Ceramic powder of BaCe0.54Zr0.36Y0.1O2.95 (BCZY) was successfully synthesized via a modified sol–gel method using metal nitrate salts as precursors. The synthesis was accomplished by using three different types of surfactants which are cationic (benzalkonium chloride), anionic (sodium dodecyl sulfate) and a nonionic surfactant (polyoxyethylene (10) oleyl ether). Citric acid and ethylene glycol were used as a chelating and a polymerization agent, respectively. The crystal form and morphology of the powders were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometer and scanning electron microscope (SEM). FTIR spectra showed the traces of carbonate residues in all samples due to the presence of hydrocarbon group in the surfactant structure even after calcination process at T = 1100 °C. Samples prepared using cationic and anionic surfactant consists of the multi-phases compounds which are dominated by BaCO3, BaCeO3, CeO2 and BaZrO3. On the other hand, the samples prepared by using nonionic surfactants produce a single phase of BCZY perovskite-type oxide. SEM images revealed that the sample prepared without surfactant exhibits severe agglomeration. Morphology of the particles for the BCZY prepared by applying the cationic and anionic surfactant was, respectively, cubical and spherical in shape. As for nonionic surfactant, the particle obtained was spherical and uniform in shape. The optimum result was obtained by adding a nonionic surfactant, Brij97, which indicates high crystallinity of the BCZY powder at a temperature of 950 °C and the particle size ranging from 20 to 80 nm. It can be concluded that surfactant affects the phase formation of BCZY ceramic powder as well as its morphology."
Synergistic effects of zinc-mannitol alkoxide with calcium/zinc stearates and with β-diketone on thermal stability of rigid poly(vinyl chloride),"Zinc-ethanol metal alkoxide was primarily synthesized as an intermediate material toward zinc-mannitol alkoxide (Zn-Man), which was further prepared through the alcohol exchange reaction with the zinc-ethanol alkoxide by mannitol. The synergistic effects of Zn-Man with several commonly used thermal additives such as calcium stearate (CaSt2), zinc stearate (ZnSt2), CaSt2/ZnSt2 and stearoyl benzoyl methane (β-diketone) on poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) thermal stability were investigated from conductivity measurement, thermal aging testing and Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy. The thermal stability tests showed that Zn-Man distinctly prolonged the long-term thermal stability of rigid PVC. If used with CaSt2/ZnSt2 or β-diketone, the thermal stability time (Ts) increased to 165.2 and 164.7 min, respectively, from the initial 101.5 min of PVC stabilized with pure Zn-Man, but excess dosage of CaSt2/ZnSt2 or β-diketone deteriorated the long-term thermal stability. The initial coloring was excellently improved when Zn-Man combined with ZnSt2, CaSt2/ZnSt2 or β-diketone; while the synergistic effect between Zn-Man and CaSt2 was not significant. Moreover, testing results demonstrated that the optimal mass ratio of 3/1 showed better synergistic effects. The thermal stabilizing mechanism was also investigated through the combination of theoretical analysis and experimental testing."
A general discrete element approach for particulate materials,"Computational approaches of mechanical systems based on the continuum hypothesis, are sometimes inaccurate and not reliable. As an example, problems involving severe mesh distortion, geometric discontinuities or characterized by an assembly of discrete parts, are not easily solvable within the Lagrangian continuum framework, such as by using the classical finite element method. Computational approaches based on the description of the domain without the need of a mesh connectivity, would be useful to overcome this drawbacks. On the other hand a discrete approach is a particularly suitable tool for modeling materials at the microscale where its particulate nature becomes evident. The Lagrangian-based meshless formulation—known as smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)—has been widely applied to different engineering fields. In the present research a general force potential-based particle method falling within the SPH framework for the mechanical simulation of granular and continuum materials under dynamic condition, is developed. The particle–particle and particle-boundary interaction is modeled through force functionals, tuned according to the nature of the material being analyzed (solid, granular, …). The proposed potential-based formulation allows the description of the forces existing between the discrete elements of generic materials. Thanks to the capability to deal with short and long distance actions (namely mechanical and/or electrostatic), general force–deformation laws, etc. it allows a straightforward mechanical simulation of fine particles assemblies such as powders. The theoretical basis of the computational approach are presented and some examples involving powder motion and a continuum mechanical problem are illustrated and discussed."
Exposure to Cigarette Smoke and the Morphology of Atherosclerotic Plaques in the Extracranial Arteries Assessed by Computed Tomography Angiography in Patients with Essential Hypertension,"The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between exposure to cigarette smoke and the morphology of atherosclerotic plaques in the extracranial arteries assessed by computed tomography angiography in patients with hypertension. The study included 61 hypertensive patients: 17 active smokers (group A), 18 non-smokers, declaring environmental exposure to tobacco smoke (group B), and 26 non-smokers, not declaring exposure to cigarette smoke (group C). The number of segments with plaques was significantly higher in group A compared to groups B and C. The number of segments with non-calcified and mixed plaques was significantly higher in group A and group B than in group C. A positive correlation between cigarette-years and the number of segments with atherosclerotic plaques was noted. In summary, both active smoking and environmental exposure to tobacco smoke appear to increase the number of segments of the extracranial arteries with non-calcified and mixed atherosclerotic plaques."
The Expression of microRNA-223 and FAM5C in Cerebral Infarction Patients with Diabetes Mellitus,"The aim of the study was to investigate the expression of miR-223 and FAM5C in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of cerebral infarction patients with or without diabetes. Sixteen cases with diabetes mellitus (DM), 14 cases with cerebral infarction (CI), 12 cases with cerebral infarction and diabetes mellitus (CIDM), and 18 healthy subjects were included in this study. Real-time PCR was used to quantify mRNA expression. Western blot was used to detect FAM5C protein level. Recombinant plasmids expressing miR-223-3p and 3′ UTR of FAM5C were constructed. Dual-luciferase reporter system was used to analyze the binding of miR-223-3p to FAM5C 3′ UTR. FAM5C mRNA and protein level were significantly higher in the PBMCs of CIDM patients compared with healthy controls (P < 0.05). miR-223-3p expression in PBMCs was significantly lower in DM patients than in healthy controls (P < 0.05). The expression of miR-223-3p was negatively correlated with FAM5C mRNA in all patients and healthy controls. Co-transfection of miR-223-3p plasmid with FAM5C 3′UTR dual-luciferase plasmid significantly inhibited the luciferase activity (P < 0.01). FAM5C, but not miR-223, is a risk factor for CI in type 2 DM patients."
Predation risk tradeoffs in prey: effects on energy and behaviour,"The complexity of behavioural interactions in predator-prey systems has recently begun to capture trait-effects, or non-lethal effects, of predators on prey via induced behavioural changes. Non-lethal predation effects play crucial roles in shaping population and community dynamics, particularly by inducing changes to foraging, movement and reproductive behaviours of prey. Prey exhibit trade-offs in behaviours while minimizing predation risk. We use a novel evolutionary ecosystem simulation EcoSim to study such behavioural interactions and their effects on prey populations, thereby addressing the need for integrating multiple layers of complexity in behavioural ecology. EcoSim allows complex intra- and inter-specific interactions between behaviourally and genetically unique individuals called predators and prey, as well as complex predator-prey dynamics and coevolution in a tri-trophic and spatially heterogeneous world. We investigated the effects of predation risk on prey energy budgets and fitness. Results revealed that energy budgets, life history traits, allocation of energy to movements and fitness-related actions differed greatly between prey subjected to low-predation risk and high-predation risk. High-predation risk suppressed prey foraging activity, increased total movement and decreased reproduction relative to low-risk. We show that predation risk alone induces behavioural changes in prey which drastically affect population and community dynamics, and when interpreted within the evolutionary context of our simulation indicate that genetic changes accompanying coevolution have long-term effects on prey adaptability to the absence of predators."
Do energy efficiency measures really reduce household energy consumption? A difference-in-difference analysis,"This study investigates the impact of energy efficiency measures installed through the Carbon Emission Reduction Target (CERT) and the Community Energy Saving Programme (CESP) on domestic gas and total energy consumptions. The recently released National Energy Efficiency Data-Framework (NEED) database is used to examine the changes in domestic gas and total energy consumptions for the dwellings in the sample relative to the changes in gas and total energy consumptions for a comparable control group in the year after installation. The results obtained from this difference-in-difference analysis confirm that observed energy consumption decreases significantly in dwellings following upgrades such as cavity wall insulation, loft insulation and a new efficient boiler. The single most effective energy efficiency measure when installed alone is found to be cavity wall insulation, reducing annual gas consumption by 10.5 % and annual total energy consumption by 8.0 % in the year following installation. Comparing bundles of different energy efficiency measures, we find that dwellings retrofitted with both cavity wall insulation and a new efficient boiler experience the largest reductions in annual gas and total energy consumptions of 13.3 and 13.5 %, respectively. This is followed by a mean annual reduction of 11.9 and 10.5 % in gas and total energy consumptions for dwellings with all three energy efficiency measures installed in the same year. Contrary to expectations, installing cavity wall insulation on its own is found to be more effective in reducing measured energy consumption than combining loft insulation and a new efficient boiler."
Does Globalization Foster Economic Growth?,"This article examines the effects of globalization, by especially focusing on the relaxation of local equity requirements (LERs) in developing countries. By constructing an endogenous growth model, where profit leakage to the South through LERs plays a key role, we obtain the following results. First, the relaxation of LERs in the South drives the relocation of firms from the North to the South, yielding a U-shaped growth rate. Second, our numerical simulations suggest that a sufficient relaxation of LERs is beneficial for the South, although the shared profit of joint ventures is maximized through the use of LERs."
Distributed time-constrained guidance using nonlinear model predictive control,"The paper presents a new time-constrained guidance approach for the multi-missile network by using the nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) technique. The objective is to coordinate the impact time of a group of interceptor missiles against the stationary target. The framework of a distributed MPC scheme is developed. Each missile is assigned its own finite-horizon optimal control problem (FHOCP) and only shares the information with its neighbors. The solutions of the local FHOCP are obtained by using the improved pigeon-inspired optimization method that serves as a convenient tool to deal with the equality and inequality constraints. Further, a safe distance-based penalty term is integrated into the local cost function to achieve no-fly zone avoidance for the multi-missile network. The numerical simulations show that the distributed MPC scheme is effective to implement the cooperative time-constrained guidance with satisfied accuracy of target capture. The Monte Carlo test also demonstrates the robustness of the proposed guidance approach in consideration of the no-fly zone constraint."
Quercetin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles: a highly effective antibacterial agent in vitro and anti-infection application in vivo,"Nanotechnology-based approaches have tremendous potential for enhancing efficacy against infectious diseases. PLGA-based nanoparticles as drug delivery carrier have shown promising potential, owing to their sizes and related unique properties. This article aims to develop nanosized poly (d, l-lactide-co-glycolide) PLGA nanoparticle formulation loaded with quercetin (QT). QT is an antioxidant and antibacterial compound isolated from Chinese traditional medicine with low skin permeability and extreme water insolubility. The quercetin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (PQTs) were synthesized by emulsion–solvent evaporation method and stabilized by coating with poly (vinyl alcohol). The characteristics of PQTs were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Ultraviolet–Visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy, respectively. The PQTs showed a spherical shape with an average size of 100–150 nm. We compared the antibacterial effects of PQTs against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Micrococcus tetragenus (M. tetragenus).The PQTs produced stronger antibacterial activity to E. coli than that to M. tetragenus through disrupting bacterial cell wall integrity. The antibacterial ratio was increased with the increasing dosages and incubation time. Next, we tested the in vivo antibacterial activity in mice. No noticeable organ damage was captured from H&E-staining organ slices, suggesting the promise of using PQTs for in vivo applications. The results of this study demonstrated the interaction between bacteria and PLGA-based nanoparticles, providing encouragement for conducting further investigations on properties and antimicrobial activity of the PQTs in clinical application."
Ouabain Attenuates Cardiac Hypertrophy of Male Rat Offspring Exposed to Intrauterine Growth Restriction Following High-Salt Diet Challenge,"Ouabain can normalize the blood pressure of the adult intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) offspring through retaining the number of glomeruli of the IUGR newborn. However, the melioration of hemodynamic features coinciding with the improvement in cardiac structure and function is poorly understood. Intrauterine growth restriction was induced in pregnant rats with protein intake restriction, and ouabain was administrated using osmotic mini pumps from the second gestational day. The male offspring of the mothers with normal diet, low-protein diet, and low-protein diet added with ouabain treatment were randomly divided into 2 groups, one of which received normal diet and the other was treated with isocaloric 8% high-salt diet. We found that maternal malnutrition caused fetal growth retardation. At the end of a 40-week research, the offspring of the IUGR group presented high blood pressure and deteriorative cardiac performance and even worse in the offspring fed with 8% high-salt diet. Ouabain can normalize the blood pressure and improve the cardiac performance, even if following 8% high-salt diet challenge. Pathological and molecular analyses showed IUGR following 8% high-salt diet significantly increased the cardiac hypertrophy, whereas the unfavorable effects were ameliorated in the offspring treated with ouabain. Results suggest that the effects of ouabain on restoration of glomerular number in newborn and normalization of blood pressure during adulthood in IUGR male offspring can benefit the cardiac structure and function, especially under high-salt diet challenge."
The Stage- and Cell Type-Specific Localization of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein in Rat Ovaries,"Premutations of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are associated with increased risk of primary ovarian insufficiency. Here we examined the localization of the Fmr1 gene protein product, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), in rat ovaries at different stages, including fetus, neonate, and old age. In ovaries dissected from 19 days postcoitum embryos, the germ cells were divided into 2 types: one with decondensed chromatin in the nucleus was FMRP positive in the cytoplasm, but the other with strongly condensed chromatin in the nucleus was FMRP negative in the cytoplasm. The FMRP was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm of oocytes in growing ovarian follicles. Levels of FMRP in oocytes from elderly (9 or 14 months of age) ovaries were lower than in those from younger ovaries. These results suggest that FMRP is associated with the activation of oogenesis and oocyte function. Especially, FMRP is likely to be implicated in germline development during oogenesis."
"The Effects of Heme Oxygenase By-Products on the Proliferation and Invasion of HUVECs, HTR-8/SVneo Cells, 3A(tPA 30-1) Cells, and HESCs Under Varying Oxygen Concentrations","Abnormal spiral artery remodeling during early pregnancy leads to preeclampsia. The proliferation and invasion of trophoblasts in pregnancy are important for spiral artery remodeling. This study examined whether heme oxygenase (HO) by-products (carbon monoxide biliverdin, and iron) play roles in regulating the restoration of proliferation and invasion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), HTR-8/SV-neo cells originating from first-trimester trophoblasts, 3A(tPA 30-1) obtained from term trophoblasts, and human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) inhibited by zinc protoporphyrin IX (Znpp-9)."
Silver nanocluster based sensitivity amplification of a quartz crystal microbalance gene sensor,"The article describes a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) biosensor for the determination of nucleic acids via a DNA-templated assembly of silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) which represents a novel way for efficient signal amplification. A QCM was modified with probe DNA to specifically capture target DNA. Then, DNA-templated AgNCs were assembled to enhance the sensitivity of the QCM sensor via Ag(I) ions attached to the DNA skeleton, this followed by hydroquinone-induced reductive formation of the AgNCs. TEM and AFM were used to further confirm the formation of DNA-templated AgNCs. The results showed that frequency response of QCM sensor is up to 87 times larger when using this mode of amplification. A linear relationship was obtained between the frequency response and DNA concentration over the 0.6 to 130 nM range, with a 0.1 nM detection limit. In our perception, this scheme for improved sensitivity provides a straightforward and widely applicable tool for sensing DNA."
Simultaneous determination of formaldehyde and hydrogen sulfide in air using the cataluminescence of nanosized Zn3SnLa2O8,"The authors describe a cataluminescence (CTL) based method for simultaneous determination of formaldehyde (HCHO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in air. CTL is emitted from the surface of nano-sized Zn3SnLa2O8 contained in a CTL reactor that is operated at a typical temperature of 275 °C. CTL shows emission peaks at 525 and 650 nm, respectively, the first mainly caused by H2S, the second mainly caused by HCHO. The limits of detection are 0.07 mg∙m−3 for HCHO and 0.22 mg∙m−3 for H2S. CTL intensity is linearly related to the concentration of HCHO in the range from 0.2 to 61.7 mg∙m−3, and from 0.4 to 68.5 mg∙m−3 for H2S. Ten standard samples were tested by this method, and recoveries ranged between 98.1 and 102.6 % for HCHO, and from 97.7 to 103.8 % for H2S. Commonly encountered potential interferents, including vapors of acetaldehyde, ethanol, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, ammonia, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide, do not disturb in this method. The relative deviation (RD) of CTL signals during 180 h of continuous detection of a mixture containing both HCHO and H2S was less than 3 %, which demonstrated the longevity and stable performance of this monitor."
"Engineering geomorphological characterisation of the Vajont Slide, Italy, and a new interpretation of the chronology and evolution of the landslide","Although the 1963 Vajont Slide in Italy has been extensively studied for over 50 years, its regional geological and geomorphological context has been neglected. In this paper, we use field observations and remote sensing data to elucidate the interaction between endogenic and exogenic processes that brought the north slope of Monte Toc to failure. We present the first detailed pre- and post-failure engineering geomorphology maps of the slide area. The maps delineate two main landslide blocks, several sub-blocks, compressional and extensional zones, and secondary failures in the deposit. The maps provide new insights into the kinematics, dynamics and evolution of the slide. Finally, we discuss the origin of Vajont Gorge and a prehistoric failure that occurred at the same location as the 1963 slide. We propose, as part of a newly developed multi-stage landscape evolution sequence, that the prehistoric failure was a deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (sackung) that initiated during deglaciation and continued to slowly move until the catastrophic failure in 1963. We argue that the gorge was created by these deep-seated slow movements."
Topology optimization of PCLD on plates for minimizing sound radiation at low frequency resonance,"Topology optimization of passive constrained layer damping (PCLD) treatment patched on thin plates with respect to sound radiation at low frequency resonance is investigated. An extended solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) model is described using an interface finite element model for viscoelastic layer. Then the given FE mesh for base structure can remain the same during the optimization process. The objective function, radiated sound power, is simplified by using sound radiation mode and modal strain energy method, the merit of which is the complex dynamic equations of the composite plate need not to be solved and only modal analyses for the associated undamped modal equations are required. Numerical and experimental results show that significant reductions of the sound power are achieved. Two optimal topologies of the PCLD patches are analyzed. It’s shown that to minimize the sound radiation power at low frequency, not only the structural damping but also the volume velocity should be concerned."
Effects of interfacial conditions on shape optimization of cementless hip stem: an investigation based on a hybrid framework,"The typical biomechanical failure mechanisms associated with cementless Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) are initial micromotion, stress shielding and interface stresses. While the former is a short-term load-induced failure criterion affiliated with the post-surgery rehabilitation period, the other two mechanisms are relatively longer term phenomena. At immediate post-operative stage, biologic fixation through bone ingrowth is yet to occur and implant stability is determined by the initial micromotion. However, by the time the other failure mechanisms become prominent, sufficient bone ingrowth already prevails and consequently, the implant-bone interface characteristic changes. Therefore, any preclinical simulation aimed at designing femoral implants needs to account for this dual interfacial behaviour while dealing with these failure objectives. The present study implements a hybrid framework comprised of neural network (NN), genetic algorithm (GA) and finite element (FE) analysis for a multi-criteria 3-D shape optimization of cementless femoral implant by addressing the dual interfacial behaviour. Bonded interfacial condition was used to analyse the effects of stress shielding and interface stresses, whereas a set of contact models were used to develop an NN for faster prediction of the initial micromotion based on implant geometry. The final trade-off implant models were analysed and subsequently, compared with a generic design of femoral implant."

Association Between Paradoxical HDL Cholesterol Decrease and Risk of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients Initiated on Statin Treatment in a Primary Care Setting,Statin-induced changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are unrelated. Many patients initiated on statins experience a paradoxical decrease in HDL-C. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between a decrease in HDL-C and risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).
Traceability of Biologics in The Netherlands: An Analysis of Information-Recording Systems in Clinical Practice and Spontaneous ADR Reports,"Pharmacovigilance requirements for biologics mandate that EU Member States shall ensure that any biologic that is the subject of a suspected adverse drug reaction (ADR) is identifiable by brand name and batch number. Recent studies showed that brand name identification is well established, whereas batch numbers are (still) poorly reported. We evaluated information-recording systems and practices in the Dutch hospital setting to identify determinants for brand name and batch number recording as well as success factors and bottlenecks for traceability."
Social network and private provision of public goods,"Using a simple model with interdependent utilities, we study how social networks influence individual voluntary contributions to the provision of a public good. Departing from the standard model of public good provision, we assume that an agent’s utility has two terms: (a) ‘ego’-utility derived from the agent’s consumption of public and private goods, and (b) a social utility which is the sum of utility spillovers from other agents with whom the agent has social relationships. We establish conditions for the existence of a unique interior Nash equilibrium and describe the equilibrium in terms of network characteristics. We show that social network always has a positive effect on the provision of the public good. We also find that, in networks with “small world”-like modular structures, ‘bridging’ ties connecting distant parts of social network play an important role inducing an agent’s contribution to public good. Assumptions and results of the model are discussed in relation to the role of social capital in community-level development projects and to the effect of innovation networks on firms’ R&D investments."
Evolutionary targeting for inclusive development,"Many studies articulate a theoretical conceptual change—that is, a change from neo-classical economics and “Picking Winners” policy frameworks to a systemic-evolutionary targeting framework. Within such an intellectual context, this paper attempts to expand the evolutionary targeting framework to facilitate the process of inclusive industrial development. We present a unitary industrial development trajectory which is used as a narrative to articulate the evolutionary paths of Taiwan and Malaysia in making their respective sectoral changes (from informal to formal, and then to high technology sectors) endogenous. Building on both cases, we elucidate how the organization of subsistence farming contributes to development, and hence paves the way for new industrial takeoff. In this regard, the targeting programs that focus on the Schumpeterian segment are improved upon to offer support for (re)organization of the informal sector. This study, therefore, proposes a new analytical grid theorizing the current observations in inclusive development studies. It thus explicitly acknowledges the importance of transforming the informal sector to achieve inclusive development."
Treatment of BG-1 Ovarian Cancer Cells Expressing Estrogen Receptors with Lambda-cyhalothrin and Cypermethrin Caused a Partial Estrogenicity Via an Estrogen Receptor-dependent Pathway,"Synthetic pyrethroids (SPs) are the most common pesticides which are recently used for indoor pest control. The widespread use of SPs has resulted in the increased exposure to wild animals and humans. Recently, some SPs are suspected as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and have been assessed for their potential estrogenicity by adopting various analyzing assays. In this study, we examined the estrogenic effects of lambda-cyhalothrin (LC) and cypermethrin (CP), the most commonly used pesticides in Korea, using BG-1 ovarian cancer cells expressing estrogen receptors (ERs). To evaluate the estrogenic activities of two SPs, LC and CP, we employed MTT assay and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in LC or CP treated BG-1 ovarian cancer cells. In MTT assay, LC (10−6 M) and CP (10−5 M) significantly induced the growth of BG-1 cancer cells. LC or CP-induced cell growth was antagonized by addition of ICI 182,720 (10−8 M), an ER antagonist, suggesting that this effect appears to be mediated by an ER-dependent manner. Moreover, RT-PCR results showed that transcriptional level of cyclin D1, a cell cycle-regulating gene, was significantly up-regulated by LC and CP, while these effects were reversed by co-treatment of ICI 182,780. However, p21, a cyclin D-ckd-4 inhibitor gene, was not altered by LC or CP. Moreover, ERα expression was not significantly changed by LC and CP, while downregulated by E2. Finally, in xenografted mouse model transplanted with human BG-1 ovarian cancer cells, E2 significantly increased the tumor volume compare to a negative control, but LC did not. Taken together, these results suggest that LC and CP may possess estrogenic potentials by stimulating the growth of BG-1 ovarian cancer cells via partially ER signaling pathway associated with cell cycle as did E2, but this estrogenic effect was not found in in vivo mouse model."
Effect of Hfe Deficiency on Memory Capacity and Motor Coordination after Manganese Exposure by Drinking Water in Mice,"Excess manganese (Mn) is neurotoxic. Increased manganese stores in the brain are associated with a number of behavioral problems, including motor dysfunction, memory loss and psychiatric disorders. We previously showed that the transport and neurotoxicity of manganese after intranasal instillation of the metal are altered in Hfe-deficient mice, a mouse model of the iron overload disorder hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). However, it is not fully understood whether loss of Hfe function modifies Mn neurotoxicity after ingestion. To investigate the role of Hfe in oral Mn toxicity, we exposed Hfe-knockout (Hfe-/-) and their control wild-type (Hfe+/+) mice to MnCl2 in drinking water (5 mg/mL) for 5 weeks. Motor coordination and spatial memory capacity were determined by the rotarod test and the Barnes maze test, respectively. Brain and liver metal levels were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Compared with the water-drinking group, mice drinking Mn significantly increased Mn concentrations in the liver and brain of both genotypes. Mn exposure decreased iron levels in the liver, but not in the brain. Neither Mn nor Hfe deficiency altered tissue concentrations of copper or zinc. The rotarod test showed that Mn exposure decreased motor skills in Hfe+/+ mice, but not in Hfe-/- mice (p = 0.023). In the Barns maze test, latency to find the target hole was not altered in Mn-exposed Hfe+/+ compared with water-drinking Hfe+/+ mice. However, Mn-exposed Hfe-/- mice spent more time to find the target hole than Mn-drinking Hfe+/+ mice (p = 0.028). These data indicate that loss of Hfe function impairs spatial memory upon Mn exposure in drinking water. Our results suggest that individuals with hemochromatosis could be more vulnerable to memory deficits induced by Mn ingestion from our environment. The pathophysiological role of HFE in manganese neurotoxicity should be carefully examined in patients with HFE-associated hemochromatosis and other iron overload disorders."
>Antioxidant Activity and Anti-wrinkle Effects of Aceriphyllum rossii Leaf Ethanol Extract,"We evaluated the antioxidant activity and anti-wrinkle effects of Aceriphyllum rossii leaf ethanol extract (ARLEE) in vitro using human dermal fibroblasts. The total polyphenol and flavonoid contents of ARLEE were 578.6 and 206.3 mg/g, respectively. At a concentration of 250 µg/mL, the electron-donating ability of ARLEE was 87.1%. In comparison with the vehicle, ARLEE treatment at 100 µg/mL significantly increased type I procollagen synthesis (p < 0.01) by 50.7%. In vitro ARLEE treatment (10 mg/mL) inhibited collagenase and elastase activity by 97.1% and 99.2%, respectively. Compared with the control, ascorbic acid treatment at 100 µg/mL significantly decreased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 protein expression (p < 0.01) by 37.0%. ARLEE treatment at 50 µg/mL significantly decreased MMP-1 protein expression (p < 0.01) by 46.1%. Ascorbic acid and ARLEE treatments at 100 µg/mL significantly decreased MMP-1 mRNA expression (p < 0.01) by 26.1% and 36.1%, respectively. From these results, we conclude that ARLEE has excellent antioxidant activity and even better anti-wrinkle effects than ascorbic acid in human dermal fibroblasts. These results suggest that ARLEE could be used in functional cosmetics for the prevention or alleviation of skin wrinkles induced by ultraviolet rays."
A Study on Subchronic Inhalation Toxicity of 1-Chloropropane,"This study was conducted to measure toxicity of 1-chloropropane (CAS No. : 540-54-5). According to the OECD Test Guideline 413 (Subchronic inhalation toxicity: 90-day study), SD rats were exposed to 0, 310, 1,250, and 5,000 ppm of 1-chloropropane for 6 h/day, 5 day/week for 13 weeks via whole-body inhalation. Mortality, clinical signs, body weights, food consumption, motor activity, ophthalmoscopy, hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, organ weights, gross and histopathological findings were compared between control and all tested groups. No mortality or remarkable clinical signs were examined during the study. No gross lesions or adverse effects on body weight, food consumption, motor activity, ophthalmoscopy, urinalysis, hematology, organ weights were observed in any of male or female rats in all tested groups. In serum biochemistry, glucose was significantly decreased in males of 1,250 and 5,000 ppm groups compared to control group in dose-dependent relationship. In histopathological examination, vacuolation of acinar cells was observed in pancreas of all male and female groups exposed to 1-chloropropane. In conclusion, no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be below 310 ppm/6 h/day, 5 day/week for rats."
Acute and 28-Day Subacute Toxicity Studies of Hexane Extracts of the Roots of Lithospermum erythrorhizon in Sprague-Dawley Rats,"Lithospermum erythrorhizon has long been used as a traditional oriental medicine. In this study, the acute and 28-day subacute oral dose toxicity studies of hexane extracts of the roots of L. erythrorhizon (LEH) were performed in Sprague-Dawley rats. In the acute toxicity study, LEH was administered once orally to 5 male and 5 female rats at dose levels of 500, 1,000, and 2,000 mg/kg. Mortality, clinical signs, and body weight changes were monitored for 14 days. Salivation, soft stool, soiled perineal region, compound-colored stool, chromaturia and a decrease in body weight were observed in the extract-treated groups, and no deaths occurred during the study. Therefore, the approximate lethal dose (ALD) of LEH in male and female rats was higher than 2,000 mg/kg. In the subacute toxicity study, LEH was administered orally to male and female rats for 28 days at dose levels of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day. There was no LEH-related toxic effect in the body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, hematology, clinical chemistry and organ weights. Compound-colored (black) stool, chromaturia and increased protein, ketone bodies, bilirubin and occult blood in urine were observed in the male and female rats treated with the test substance. In addition, the necropsy revealed dark red discoloration of the kidneys, and the histopathological examination showed presence of red brown pigment or increased hyaline droplets in the renal tubules of the renal cortex. However, there were no test substance-related toxic effects in the hematology and clinical chemistry, and no morphological changes were observed in the histopathological examination of the kidneys. Therefore, it was determined that there was no significant toxicity because the changes observed were caused by the intrinsic color of the test substance. These results suggest that the no-observed-adverseeffect Level (NOAEL) of LEH is greater than 400 mg/kg/day in both sexes."
Development of fuzzy logic-based statistical process control chart pattern recognition system,"This study developed a fuzzy logic system for online variation detection by recognizing patterns in statistical process control (SPC) charts. The system enables quality engineers to take corrective actions for an out-of-control manufacturing process. The fuzzy logic SPC system has three subsystems and is able to detect most common four patterns. Data go through subsystems in the absence of detective patterns. Otherwise, data will be eliminated when a particular pattern is recognized on the SPC chart. The user-friendly output interface reduces human analysis errors. The performance of the developed fuzzy logic system is tested by a simulated process."
A novel force rendering approach for virtual assembly of mechanical parts,"Virtual assembly (VA) is a typical virtual reality (VR)-based application in engineering. However, common interaction devices, such as keyboard and mouse, are less realistic due to lack of force sensation. Therefore, realistic force feedback in the VA environment provides a more natural interaction to simulate the assembly operation and result in improved task efficiency. This paper presents a novel force rendering approach, which focuses on mechanical part assembly based on three basic mechanical fit types, namely clearance fit, interference fit, and transition fit. The algorithm to calculate the assembly force is formulated by analyzing the tolerance variation along the assembly length between two mating parts. And then the force is rendered continuously at real-time during the VA operation to provide a fast, stable, and more realistic assembly force feedback to the users. Several comparative case studies are conducted to investigate the approach with the users’ performance of VA with the other three common approaches, namely conducting assembly task using a WIMP-based CAD software, with a standard physically based approach and the one with both collision detection and geometric constraints, respectively. The proposed approach is more efficient than other approaches by providing continuous force feedback to the users so as to greatly enhance their force sensation of the assembly operation. Moreover, case studies on users’ identification capability of different fit types has shown that with the continuous force rendering, users can easily tell the clearance fit from the other two fit types, hence the proposed approach equips users with the ability to possibly evaluate the assembly performance at the early stage of product development process."
Cutting force prediction in orthogonal turn-milling by directly using engagement boundaries,"Despite of the studies in the last decades, there are still some gaps in understanding of the distinctive behaviors of orthogonal turn-milling. In order to improve the performance of this new technology, deeper investigations are required. This work deals with the mechanics in non-eccentric orthogonal turn-milling. The engaged areas of both side edge and end edge are analyzed. Then, the boundary conditions used to extract them are derived. The two sets of cutting force coefficients for the side edge and end edge are calibrated based on slot milling and plunge milling, respectively. The total cutting forces are calculated as a sum of the cutting forces on both side edge and end edge. The proposed cutting force model is validated experimentally on a five-axis machine tool. In addition, comparative experiments have been conducted to investigate the effects of cutting depth and longitudinal feed rate on the cutting force in tool axis direction."
Forgiveness Education for Fourth Grade Students in Turkey,"Research has indicated that living in an environment involving poverty and violence can have negative effects on young children. Forgiveness may be an important predictor of well-being among these children. Forgiveness education programs aim to heal these by increasing forgiveness, hope, and by being prosocial while decreasing anger and depression, which appear after deep hurt. The main aim of the study was to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of a forgiveness education program in classroom settings with fourth-grade Turkish students living in an impoverished environment. Two studies were conducted to evaluate the forgiveness education program, based on Enright’s process model of forgiveness. In the first study, students from impoverished backgrounds were found to exhibit significantly greater anger and depression than students representing an average socioeconomic status. In the second study, with 122 fourth-grade students (N = 74 experimental, 48 control) in five primary schools, the forgiveness education program was implemented by school teachers with support from psychologists. Analysis reveals a significant increase in forgiveness and hope and a decrease in anger in the first posttest for the experimental group compared with the control group, although follow-up results indicate no significant differences between the two groups. Significant findings and the forgiveness education program are discussed."
Distributed time-constrained guidance using nonlinear model predictive control,"The paper presents a new time-constrained guidance approach for the multi-missile network by using the nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) technique. The objective is to coordinate the impact time of a group of interceptor missiles against the stationary target. The framework of a distributed MPC scheme is developed. Each missile is assigned its own finite-horizon optimal control problem (FHOCP) and only shares the information with its neighbors. The solutions of the local FHOCP are obtained by using the improved pigeon-inspired optimization method that serves as a convenient tool to deal with the equality and inequality constraints. Further, a safe distance-based penalty term is integrated into the local cost function to achieve no-fly zone avoidance for the multi-missile network. The numerical simulations show that the distributed MPC scheme is effective to implement the cooperative time-constrained guidance with satisfied accuracy of target capture. The Monte Carlo test also demonstrates the robustness of the proposed guidance approach in consideration of the no-fly zone constraint."
Does Globalization Foster Economic Growth?,"This article examines the effects of globalization, by especially focusing on the relaxation of local equity requirements (LERs) in developing countries. By constructing an endogenous growth model, where profit leakage to the South through LERs plays a key role, we obtain the following results. First, the relaxation of LERs in the South drives the relocation of firms from the North to the South, yielding a U-shaped growth rate. Second, our numerical simulations suggest that a sufficient relaxation of LERs is beneficial for the South, although the shared profit of joint ventures is maximized through the use of LERs."
Salt stress affects mitotic activity and modulates antioxidant systems in onion roots,"This study was aimed to explore the effect of short-term salt stress and recovery on cytology and the activity of antioxidant enzyme in roots of onion (Allium cepa L.) plant. Roots of A. cepa were treated with different concentrations of NaCl (0, 50, 100, 150, 200 mM), and cytological and physiological indicators in the root of plant were measured in different processing time. With the increase of NaCl concentrations and processing time, mitotic activity and relative division rate (RDR) were reduced. However, during recovery, mitotic activity and RDR were restored but their values were less than control values. Salt stress caused an increase while in recovery experiments there was a slight reduction in chromosomal aberrations. A significant increase in SOD and POX activities except in 200 mM occurred after 18 h of stress which was still higher than control in recovered plants. CAT activity showed 53.90 % decrease after 18 h of salt stress and also a significant decrease was observed after 24 h post stress. The results suggest that at high salt stress up to 150 mM, the roots of A. cepa are capable to rapidly activate antioxidant defence system to resist the salt-induced oxidative stress, but could not control the cytogenetical activities. The results also suggest that the recovery is possible at physiological and cytogenetical level by retaining chromosomal and DNA integrity."
"Interpretation and approximation tools for big, dense Markov chain transition matrices in population genetics","Markov chains are a common framework for individual-based state and time discrete models in evolution. Though they played an important role in the development of basic population genetic theory, the analysis of more complex evolutionary scenarios typically involves approximation with other types of models. As the number of states increases, the big, dense transition matrices involved
 become increasingly unwieldy. However, advances in computational technology continue to reduce the challenges of “big data”, thus giving new potential to state-rich Markov chains in theoretical population genetics."
Neck circumference as an independent indicator to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in non-obese men,To investigate the relationship of the neck circumference (NC) with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in non-obese Chinese population.
Frequent induction of chromosomal aberrations in in vivo skin fibroblasts after allogeneic stem cell transplantation: hints to chromosomal instability after irradiation,Total body irradiation (TBI) has been part of standard conditioning regimens before allogeneic stem cell transplantation for many years. Its effect on normal tissue in these patients has not been studied extensively.
Non-invasive magnetic resonance-guided high intensity focused ultrasound ablation of a vascular malformation in the lower extremity: a case report,"Therapy of choice for symptomatic vascular malformations consists of surgery, sclerotherapy, or embolization. However, these techniques are invasive with possible complications and require hospitalization. We present a novel non-invasive technique, i.e., magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) ablation, for the treatment of a vascular malformation in a patient. This technique applies high-intensity sound waves transcutaneously to the body and is fully non-invasive. MRI guidance is the novel aspect of HIFU treatments and is used for exquisite delineation and localization of the lesion and accurate real-time temperature monitoring during tissue ablation. MR-HIFU is a well-established treatment option for uterine fibroids and is currently being investigated for, e.g., bone tumors, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and liver cancer. MR-HIFU of vascular malformations has not been a topic of research yet."
The role of music therapy in reducing post meal related anxiety for patients with anorexia nervosa,"It is well known that mealtime is anxiety provoking for patients with Anorexia Nervosa. However, there is little research into effective interventions for reducing meal related anxiety in an inpatient setting."
"Lack of association among TNF-α gene expression, -308 polymorphism (G > A) and virulence markers of Helicobacter pylori","Tumor necrosis factor plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of gastric diseases such as gastric cancer, and an abnormal inflammatory response has frequently been observed in dyspeptic patients. Helicobacter pylori infection can induce a gastric mucosal inflammatory response that may be influenced by -308 (G > A) polymorphisms and gene expression of the TNF-α gene."
Separation and localization of multiple distributed wideband chirps using the fractional Fourier transform,"In this paper, we consider the problem of localizing the multiple distributed wideband chirp sources using the fractional Fourier transform. The model in the time domain and that in the fractional Fourier domain derived by the Taylor series expansion are presented respectively. The representation of location vector in the Dechirping domain is illustrated which is only related to the central angle. A novel direction of arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm in the Dechirping domain is proposed, which is extended from the conventional multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm in the time domain. Using this algorithm, except for estimating the DOA, the incidence source number can be determined as well which is allowed to exceed the sensor number in the array. To demonstrate the performance of proposed algorithm, numerical results are conducted. Compared to the previous FrFT-MUSIC algorithm based on the assumption of point source model, the proposed algorithm performs a better estimation performance, especially for large angular spread and low signal-to-noise ratio."
Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander-focused primary healthcare social and emotional wellbeing research: a systematic review protocol,"Research with a focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australian’s (hereafter referred to as Indigenous1) needs is crucial to ensure culturally appropriate evidence-based strategies are developed to improve health. However, concerns surrounding this research exist, arising from some previous research lacking community consultation, resulting in little community benefit or infringing on important cultural values. Values and Ethics: Guidelines for Ethical conduct in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Research (hereafter referred to as Values and Ethics), developed by The National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia in 2003, is the ethical standard for Indigenous-focused health research. Researchers must address its Values in research design and conduct. However, its impact on research processes is unclear. Local Protocols should also be considered. This review aims to systematically examine practices related to Values and Ethics, Local Protocols and the processes of conducting Indigenous-focused primary healthcare research in collaboration with external researchers."
Solvability of a boundary value problem for singular multi-term fractional differential system with impulse effects,"In this article, we first of all convert the boundary value problems for impulsive fractional differential equations to integral equations. Second, we construct a weighted function space and prove the completely continuous property of a nonlinear operator. Finally, we establish existence results for solutions of a boundary value problem for a nonlinear impulsive fractional differential system. Our analysis relies on the well-known Schauder fixed point theorem. An example is given to illustrate main results."
Inertial sensors for smartphones navigation,"The advent of smartphones and tablets, means that we can constantly get information on our current geographical location. These devices include not only GPS/GNSS chipsets but also mass-market inertial platforms that can be used to plan activities, share locations on social networks, and also to perform positioning in indoor and outdoor scenarios. This paper shows the performance of smartphones and their inertial sensors in terms of gaining information about the user’s current geographical locatio
n considering an indoor navigation scenario. Tests were carried out to determine the accuracy and precision obtainable with internal and external sensors. In terms of the attitude and drift estimation with an updating interval equal to 1 s, 2D accuracies of about 15 cm were obtained with the images. Residual benefits were also obtained, however, for large intervals, e.g. 2 and 5 s, where the accuracies decreased to 50 cm and 2.2 m, respectively."
Essential oil composition variability among natural populations of Pinus mugo Turra in Kosovo,"Pinus mugo Turra, is a native pine species in central and southern Europe, growing in high mountains area (altitudes 1.800–2.300 m.a.s.l.). In Kosovo, it is one of the native pines too, distributed in high altitudes in the Sharri Mountains and Albanian Alps Mountains. Its populations represent an important wealth of essential oil resources available, which make this species very important in terms of economic values. The chemical composition and yields of the essential oils of dwarf pine (Pinus mugo Turra) needles, twigs and cones from six wild populations in Kosovo were investigated with the aim to assess their natural variability. The identity of P. mugo was confirmed by morphology and DNA barcoding. Sixty-two compounds were identified representing 69–95 % of the total identified compounds. The yield ranged from 0.3–0.8 % v/w in needles, 1.0–2.4 % v/w in twigs and 0.1–0.5 % v/w in cones, depending on the origin of plant material and plant organs. α-Pinene (needles: 16.9–24.5 %; twigs: 4.5–8.8 %; cones: 3.1–5.6 %), β-pinene (needles: 1.5–5.4 %; twigs: 2.2–15.4 %; cones: 1.3–14.2 %), δ-3-carene (needles: 15.4–27.8 %; twigs: 24.0–51.6 %; cones: 10.5–31.5 %), limonene + β-phellandrene (needles: 1.9–5.9 %; twigs: 12.6–24.2 %; cones: 2.1–9.3 %), (E)-caryophyllene (needles: 4.4–8.9 %; twigs: 4.0–10.8 %; cones: 10.3–26.9 %) and germacrene D (needles: 4.0–8.3 %; twigs: 0.2–6.19 %; cones: 0.1–12.4 %) were the major components of the essential oil. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analyses (HCA) suggests that the population of P. mugo clustering is not related to their geographic location, but rather seemed to be linked to local selective forces acting on chemotype diversity. Low variability related to their geographic location has an economic importance since samples originating from different locations in Kosovo can treated with same standards."
Molecular cloning and expression analysis of KIN10 and cold-acclimation related genes in wild banana ‘Huanxi’ (Musa itinerans),"Banana cultivars may experience chilling or freezing injury in some of their cultivated regions, where wild banana can still grow very well. The clarification of the cold-resistant mechanism of wild banana is vital for cold-resistant banana breeding. In this study, the central stress integrator gene KIN10 and some cold-acclimation related genes (HOS1 and ICE1s) from the cold-resistant wild banana ‘Huanxi’ (Musa itinerans) were cloned and their expression patterns under different temperature treatments were analyzed. Thirteen full-length cDNA transcripts including 6 KIN10s, 1 HOS1 and 6 ICE1s were successfully cloned. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results showed that all these genes had the highest expression levels at the critical temperature of banana (13 °C). Under chilling temperature (4 °C), the expression level of KIN10 reduced significantly but the expression of HOS1 was still higher than that at the optimal temperature (28 °C, control). Both KIN10 and HOS1 showed the lowest expression levels at 0 °C, the expression level of ICE1, however, was higher than control. As sucrose plays role in plant cold-acclimation and in regulation of KIN10 and HOS1 bioactivities, the sucrose contents of wild banana under different temperatures were detected. Results showed that the sucrose content increased as temperature lowered. Our result suggested that KIN10 may participate in cold stress response via regulating sucrose biosynthesis, which is helpful in regulating cold acclimation pathway in wild banana."
Vascular graft infection due to Pasteurella multocida,"Vascular graft infections are infrequent complications with important morbidity and mortality rates. Pasteurella multocida, a Gram negative bacillus, is a normal oral commensal of many animals. For mankind, it is a pathogenous bacillus which is rarely implicated in vascular grafts."
Antibacterial activity of nineteen selected natural products against multi-drug resistant Gram-negative phenotypes,"The present study was designed to assess the antimicrobial activity of 19 natural products belonging to terpenoids, alkaloids, thiophenes and phenolics against a panel of 14 Gram-negative multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. The results demonstrated that amongst the studied compounds, alkaloids and terpenoids were less active contrary to flavonoids: neocyclomorusin (3) and candidone (6) and isoflavonoids: neobavaisoflavone (8) and daidzein (12). Thiophene, 2-(penta-1,3-diynyl)-5-(3,4-dihydroxybut-1-ynyl)thiophene (17) showed moderate and selective activities. Compounds 3, 6, 8 and 12 displayed minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranged from 4 to 256 μg/mL on all the 14 tested bacteria. MIC values below 10 μg/mL were obtained with 8, 3, 6 and 12 against 50, 42.9, 35.7 and 21.4 % of the tested bacteria. The lowest MIC value of 4 μg/mL was obtained with compound 3 against Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC11296, Enterobacter cloacae BM47, compound 6 against Escherichia coli ATCC8739, K. pneumoniae ATCC11296, E. cloacae BM47 and compound 8 against K. pneumoniae ATCC11296 and E. cloacae BM47. The activity of flavonoid 3 was better or equal to that of chloramphenicol in all tested K. pneumoniae,
Providencia stuartii, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Within isoflavonoids, neobavaisoflavone scaffold was detected as a pharmacophoric moiety. This study indicates that natural products such as 3, 6 and 8 could be explored more to develop antimicrobial drugs to fight MDR bacterial infections."
"Sonographic chest B-lines anticipate elevated B-type natriuretic peptide level, irrespective of ejection fraction",Echocardiography and the N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level are important tests for assessing left ventricular function in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute dyspnea. Chest ultrasound is becoming an important tool in diagnosing acute pulmonary edema.
Technique modifications for septodermoplasty: an illustrative case,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease that results in telangiectasia of the sinonasal tract, gastro-intestinal tract as well as possible arteriovenous malformations of the lung, liver and brain. One of the most common disease manifestations of HHT is epistaxis. Severe recurrent epistaxis necessitating iron therapy and blood transfusion is often managed with septodermoplasty. Its initial description was as an open surgical technique requiring nasal packing."
Parametrized inequality of Hermite-Hadamard type for functions whose third derivative absolute values are quasi-convex,"In this paper we present some inequalities of Hermite-Hadamard type for functions whose third derivative absolute values are quasi-convex. Moreover, an application to special means of real numbers is also considered."
OnabotulinumtoxinA 155 U in medication overuse headache: a two years prospective study,"The efficacy and safety of OnabotulinumtoxinA 155-195 U (BOTOX®) in adults with chronic migraine (CM) were demonstrated in both the Phase III Research Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy (PREEMPT) studies. However, data about its long-term efficacy and safety in clinical settings 
are scanty. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate OnabotulinumtoxinA 155 U treatment in patients affected with CM and co-morbid medication overuse headache (MOH) over 2-year analysis. We prospectively evaluated 155 CM and MOH affected patients started on OnabotulinumtoxinA 155U (PREEMPT injection paradigm) between October 2010 and November 2011 and followed-up for 2 years. All patients failed to positively respond to previous multiple preventive therapies that were withdrawn before starting OnabotulinumtoxinA. Headache days, migraine days, acute pain medication intake days and Headache Impact Test (HIT)-6 score were used as efficacy measures, whereas safety was evaluated with side effects occurrence during the treatment phase. Baseline data were collected from patients headache diary referred to the previous month, and patients were evaluated every 3 months at the time of each injection. OnabotulinumtoxinA 155U significantly reduced the number of headache and migraine days (p < 0.001), acute pain medication intake days (p < 0.001) and HIT-6 score (p < 0.001) when compared with the baseline data. The reduction was significant after the first injection (p < 0.001), and gradually increased during the 2 years of treatment. Treatment related adverse events were transient and mild-moderate (e.g. headache, injection-site pain, eyelid ptosis, musculoskeletal weakness). This prospective 2-years analysis of efficacy and safety of long-term treatment with OnabotulinumtoxinA 155 U in patients affected with CM and MOH confirms the efficacy data from previous Randomized Clinical Trials for CM prophylaxis. Moreover, here we demonstrate that OnabotulinumtoxinA can be safely used for the long-term treatment of MOH comorbidity in CM."
Some remarks on an exact and dynamically consistent scheme for the Burgers-Huxley equation in higher dimensions,"Departing from a finite-difference scheme to approximate the solutions of the Burgers-Huxley equation, the present manuscript extends that technique to higher dimensions. We show that our methodology possesses the same numerical properties of the one-dimensional version (exactness, positivity, boundedness, monotonicity, etc.). Moreover, helped by a recent theorem on the existence and uniqueness of positive and bounded solutions of the Burgers-Huxley equation, we establish that the present method is a convergent scheme."
Testing the IRAP: Exploring the Reliability and Fakability of an Idiographic Approach to Interpersonal Attitudes,"Although multiple studies have demonstrated that the Implicit Association Test (IAT) can be successfully faked, a single study using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP; McKenna, Barnes-Holmes, Barnes-Holmes, & Stewart, International Journal of Psychology and Psychological Therapy, 7(2): 253–268, 2007) concluded that this behavior-analytic alternative to implicit measures may be relatively immune to faking. The current study examined the fakability of the IRAP using more accessible faking instructions and an idiographic approach to stimulus selection. The methodology also provided an opportunity to examine split-half and test–retest reliability, an underreported statistic among existing IRAP publications. Three IRAPs were delivered in succession to 102 undergraduates randomly assigned to one of three conditions: three real IRAPs, two real IRAPs followed by a faked IRAP, or one real IRAP followed by two faked IRAPs. Split-half reliabilities were acceptable for four of the six real IRAPs and excellent for the three faked IRAPs. For the group receiving three real IRAPs, consecutive IRAPs generated significant test–retest correlations; the group engaging in two consecutive faked IRAPs also generated a significant test–retest correlation. Furthermore, all groups that received faking instructions subsequently demonstrated significantly reversed IRAP performance compared to previous real IRAPs and to real IRAPs in other conditions: Faking was robustly demonstrated. These results may have implications with regard not only to the fakability but also the reliability of the measure. Future research might focus on methods of detecting and/or preventing faking of the procedure."
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia with concurrent aplasia of the pericardium in a foal,"In veterinary medicine congenital abnormalities of the diaphragm and pericardium are rare, idiopathic malformations, being reported mainly in dogs. This report documents an unusual case of developmental defects in a foal consisting of diaphragmatic hernia concurrent with pericardial aplasia."
"First detection, clinical presentation and phylogenetic characterization of Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in Austria","Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a syndrome that is characterized by rapidly spreading watery diarrhea affecting pigs of all ages, but with major effects on suckling piglets. The disease, as well as the causative Alphacoronavirus, the Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), was first described in Europe in the 1970s and since then has spread over many Asian and American countries, where it recently led to devastating effects on swine health and pork industry. While the disease was seldom reported in Europe within the last few decades, a few recent reports re-emergence of PED in German pig farms. The hitherto isolated German strain seems to be closely related to a low pathogenic PEDV variant from the USA. This case report describes the first detection of PEDV in Austria."
Frequent induction of chromosomal aberrations in in vivo skin fibroblasts after allogeneic stem cell transplantation: hints to chromosomal instability after irradiation,Total body irradiation (TBI) has been part of standard conditioning regimens before allogeneic stem cell transplantation for many years. Its effect on normal tissue in these patients has not been studied extensively.
Nodal Solutions for Supercritical Laplace Equations,In this paper we study radial solutions for the following equation
"Financial uncertainty, risk aversion and monetary policy","We estimate the response of uncertainty/risk aversion to monetary policy actions in both the financial sector and the aggregate economy using a structural vector autoregressive model. When compared with other sectors, our constructs reveal that financial risk aversion/uncertainty has greater correlation with the aggregate risk aversion and uncertainty. Our analysis reveals that financial risk aversion and uncertainty exhibit stronger interdependence with monetary policy actions than aggregate uncertainty and risk aversion. Tighter monetary policy induces risk aversion and uncertainty increment in both the financial sector and the aggregate market. However, the financial sector risk aversion and uncertainty responses are of greater magnitude."
Pentagonal chains and annuli as models for designing nanostructures from cages,"Carbon is the most versatile of chemical elements in combining with itself or other elements to form chains, rings, sheets, cages, and periodic 3D structures. One of the perspective trends for creating new molecules of nanotechnological interest deals with constructs which may be formed by chemically linking of cage molecules. The growing interest in fullerene polyhedra and other molecules with pentagonal rings raises also a question about geometrically consistent in \({\mathbb {E}}^{3}\) nanoarchitectures which may be obtained by aggregating many such molecules. Simple examples are chains and rings assembled from pyramidal (car)borane subunits. Adequate geometrical models of such objects are a chain and an annulus built from regular pentagons wherein any two adjacent pentagons share an edge. Among arising combinatorial problems may be both analytical and constructive enumeration of such chains and annuli drawn in plane with no two edges crossing each other. This may also employ several mathematical disciplines, such as geometry, (spectral) graph theory, semigroup theory, theory of fractals, and others. We discuss some practical approaches for solving the mentioned mathematical problem."
Zinc Corrosion in Acidic Solutions Containing Single and Mixed Surfactants,"The influence of surfactant synergism on Zn corrosion inhibition in 0.1-M HCl aqueous solutions has been determined at room temperature. Solutions of single and mixed surfactants consisting of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and N,N-dimethyldodecan-1-amine oxide (DDAO) in water and in 0.1-M HCl were also prepared at room temperature. Critical micelle concentration (CMC) data were obtained through surface tension measurements as a function of mixing composition. A regular solution model was considered to analyze CMC values. The interaction parameter (β), the composition of mixed micelles (x) and the activity coefficients (f) were estimated by a regular solution model for all amphoteric–anionic mixed systems. β Vvalues showed synergism for the binary mixtures of these solutions in the absence and presence of 0.1-M HCl at all investigated compositions. Zinc corrosion in single and binary SDS/DDAO mixed solutions at 5-mM total surfactant concentrations in the presence of 0.1-M HCl was also investigated at static and dynamic conditions. The weight loss data revealed corrosion inhibition activity obeyed the following order: binary (0.75 DDAO + 0.25 SDS) > binary (0.50 DDAO + 0.50 SDS) > single DDAO > single SDS, suggesting an enhancement in the corrosion inhibition activity of DDAO in the presence of a proper amount of SDS. Conductivity time measurements show a similar trend as that obtained by a weight loss method at (0.50 DDAO + 0.50 SDS). The results were illustrated on the basis of synergistic interaction between the mixed surfactants."
Isoprenoid Alcohols are Susceptible to Oxidation with Singlet Oxygen and Hydroxyl Radicals,"Isoprenoids, as common constituents of all living cells, are exposed to oxidative agents—reactive oxygen species, for example, singlet oxygen or hydroxyl radicals. Despite this fact, products of oxidation of polyisoprenoids have never been characterized. In this study, chemical oxidation of isoprenoid alcohols (Prenol-2 and -10) was performed using singlet oxygen (generated in the presence of hydrogen peroxide/molybdate or upon photochemical reaction in the presence of porphyrin), oxygen (formed upon hydrogen peroxide dismutation) or hydroxyl radical (generated by the hydrogen peroxide/sonication, UV/titanium dioxide or UV/hydrogen peroxide) systems. The structure of the obtained products, hydroxy-, peroxy- and heterocyclic derivatives, was studied with the aid of mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods. Furthermore, mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization appeared to be a useful analytical tool to detect the products of oxidation of isoprenoids (ESI–MS analysis), as well as to establish their structure on the basis of the fragmentation spectra of selected ions (ESI–MS/MS analysis). Taken together, susceptibility of polyisoprenoid alcohols to various oxidizing agents was shown for the first time."
Interaction theory of hypersonic laminar near-wake flow behind an adiabatic circular cylinder,"The separation and shock wave formation on the aft-body of a hypersonic adiabatic circular cylinder were studied numerically using the open source software OpenFOAM. The simulations of laminar flow were performed over a range of Reynolds numbers (\(8\times 10^3 < Re < 8\times 10^4\)) at a free-stream Mach number of 5.9. Off-body viscous forces were isolated by controlling the wall boundary condition. It was observed that the off-body viscous forces play a dominant role compared to the boundary layer in displacement of the interaction onset in response to a change in Reynolds number. A modified free-interaction equation and correlation parameter has been presented which accounts for wall curvature effects on the interaction. The free-interaction equation was manipulated to isolate the contribution of the viscous–inviscid interaction to the overall pressure rise and shock formation. Using these equations coupled with high-quality simulation data, the underlying mechanisms resulting in Reynolds number dependence of the lip-shock formation were investigated. A constant value for the interaction parameter representing the part of the pressure rise due to viscous–inviscid interaction has been observed at separation over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. The effect of curvature has been shown to be the primary contributor to the Reynolds number dependence of the free-interaction mechanism at separation. The observations in this work have been discussed here to create a thorough analysis of the Reynolds number-dependent nature of the lip-shock."
Oestrogen-soaked vaginal packing for decubitus ulcer in advanced pelvic organ prolapse: a case series,Cervicovaginal decubitus ulceration is a well-known complication of advanced pelvic organ prolapse (POP). There is no consensus for its management. This case series describes the outcome of using repeated vaginal packs soaked with oestrogen cream to reduce POP and promote decubitus ulcer healing. We aimed to investigate the speed of ulcer healing and endometrial safety with this regimen.
Managing novel orally administered anticoagulants in patients undergoing urogynaecological surgery,"The use of novel orally administered anticoagulant agents (NOACs) provides new challenges to clinicians in the perioperative care of patients undergoing urogynaecological surgery. We aimed to assess evidence for managing patients taking NOACs before and after urogynaecological surgery. We conducted a literature search in CINAHL, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Cochrane Library and PubMed for original research articles in the English language on this topic. However, despite initially identifying 556 articles, no articles pertained to the use of NOACs in urogynaecological surgery. We subsequently reviewed national and international guidance on managing patients prescribed NOACs and created a concise guideline to aid urogynaecologists in the perioperative care of these patients. Consensus is needed on perioperative optimisation of anticoagulation in urogynaecological patients using NOACs."
Development of Superconducting-Tunnel-Junction Array Detectors with Three-Dimensional Structure Beyond 1000-Pixels,"Superconducting-tunnel-junction (STJ) array X-ray detectors have exhibited excellent characteristics for fluorescence-yield X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) in a soft X-ray range. For high-throughput XAFS analyses, we developed a new close-packed STJ arrangement with a space of 10 \(\upmu \)m (use the correct space) between adjacent STJ pixels by using three-dimensional multilayer structure (3D-STJ) with the wiring layer underneath the STJ pixel layer. In this work, in order to solve a double-peak response originating from absorption events in the top and bottom electrodes, we have fabricated the 3D-STJ with an asymmetric layer structure. Single-peak response for the soft X-rays below 0.7 keV was obtained. The closed-packed 3D-STJ array detector with 100 pixels has an operation yield of 93 % and a mean energy resolution of 12.5 \(\pm \) 0.7 eV in full-width at half-maximum for the C-K\(\alpha \) X-ray."
GroundBIRD: Observing Cosmic Microwave Polarization at Large Angular Scale with Kinetic Inductance Detectors and High-Speed Rotating Telescope,"Cosmic microwave background (CMB) is an important source of information about the origin of our universe. In particular, odd-parity large angular scale patterns in the CMB polarization, the primordial B-modes, are strong evidence for an inflationary universe, related to the accelerating expansion of the metric. We are developing a unique telescope, GroundBIRD, to take CMB polarization measurements. The telescope combines novel techniques: high-speed rotation scanning, cold optics, and microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs). We evaluated the response of MKIDs on the rotation stage. Method of shielding from the geo-magnetic field is established. We have also developed a receiver cryostat. We are able to maintain a sufficient cold status for observations on the optical configuration. We plan to start commissioning the system by observing CMB in Japan in 2015–2016. We will then deploy GroundBIRD in the Canary Islands for further scientific observations."
Impact of preoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation on vasoactive inotrope score after implantation of left ventricular assist device,"The purpose of this study was to elucidate the difference in inotrope use between patients who underwent left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation with preoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and those who underwent LVAD implantation without preoperative ECMO. One hundred and eight patients who underwent LVAD implantation were enrolled in this study. Prior to LVAD implantation, 27 patients received ECMO support (ECMO group) and the other 81 patients did not (non-ECMO group). Cardiac index (CI), mean arterial pressure (MAP), mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), and the vasoactive inotropic score (VIS) were recorded at weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), 30 min after weaning from CPB (min after CPB), 60 min after CPB, and at the end of surgery. MAP and VIS were also recorded before induction of anesthesia (baseline). The modified VIS was defined as: (dopamine µg/kg/min × 1 + dobutamine µg/kg/min × 1 + epinephrine µg/kg/min × 100 + noradrenaline µg/kg/min × 100 + milrinone µg/kg/min × 10 + olprinone µg/kg/min × 25). There were no significant differences between the ECMO group and the non-ECMO group in terms of hemodynamic parameters such as MAP, CI, and SvO2. However, the ECMO group had higher VIS and noradrenaline doses than that of non-ECMO group (p = 0.030 and p = 0.044, respectively). VIS was significantly higher in ECMO group at 30 min after CPB (p = 0.03), 60 min after CPB (p = 0.003), and at the end of the surgery (p < 0.001). The doses of noradrenaline were significantly higher in ECMO group at 60 min after CPB (p = 0.013), and at the end of surgery (p = 0.002). Patients who received ECMO support prior to LVAD implantation required significantly more noradrenaline to maintain normal levels of hemodynamic parameters compared with patients without ECMO."
The role of the family doctor in the management of adults who are obese: a scoping review protocol,The role of family doctors in the management of obesity in primary care will become increasingly important as more of the adult population become overweight or obese. Having a solid understanding of the family doctor’s role as a sole practitioner is important for supporting practitioners in providing patient care and for informing future research.
Endocervical adenocarcinoma: selected diagnostic challenges,"Endocervical adenocarcinomas can be classified into two main types of tumors, namely, those related to high-risk human papillomavirus and those unrelated to high-risk human papillomavirus. The former, representing the vast majority, are referred to as endocervical adenocarcinomas of usual type and the latter are dominated by the gastric-type mucinous adenocarcinomas. Commonly encountered diagnostic problems concerning these endocervical adenocarcinomas include: (1) diagnosing invasion for endocervical adenocarcinomas of usual type, particularly superficial forms which must be distinguished from extensive endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ; (2) distinguishing high-risk human papillomavirus-related endocervical adenocarcinomas from endometrial endometrioid carcinomas; and (3) distinguishing benign/hyperplastic mucinous endocervical glandular proliferations from gastric-type mucinous endocervical adenocarcinomas, particularly minimal deviation adenocarcinoma. The current review provides practical points and numerous illustrative examples to guide pathologists in addressing these diagnostic challenges in routine practice."
How to approach the many faces of endometrioid carcinoma,"This article reviews the salient features of variants of endometrioid carcinoma (ECa) that can pose a diagnostic challenge and/or are associated with unique clinicopathological findings. Variants with distinct architectural and cytologic features include the following: (1) ECa with a villoglandular pattern (tumor with finger-like papillae lined by bland cells with a tendency for vascular/lymphatic invasion and lymph node metastasis once this pattern is seen within the myoinvasive component); (2) papillary ECa of intermediate grade (grade 2) (tumor that can be mistaken for serous carcinoma, as it contains papillae showing slightly irregular contours, moderately atypical cells, and it is associated with vascular/lymphatic invasion/lymph node metastasis, but with common association with mucinous metaplasia, MELF (microcystic, elongated, and fragmented) pattern of invasion, and wild p53 expression); (3) ECa with non-villous papillae (tumor containing pseudopapillae within glands with bland-appearing cytology commonly associated with abortive squamous differentiation and otherwise not different from usual ECa); (4) ECa with microglandular-like pattern (tumor that mimics microglandular hyperplasia of the cervix, often lacking the typical appearance of microglandular hyperplasia and showing Ki-67 index >10%, strong CD10 expression, and negative PAX-2, p63, and CD34); and (5) ECa with sex cord-like formations and hyalinization (tumor with interconnected cords and nests of bland epithelioid and spindled cells that merge with a typical component of low-grade ECa, usually associated with squamous differentiation and hyalinization). This tumor should be distinguished from carcinosarcoma and, in contrast to the latter, it shows nuclear β-catenin expression, ER/PR and patchy p16 positivity, tends to present at a low stage, and has a favorable prognosis and (6) dedifferentiated ECa (tumor showing a low-grade ECa juxtaposed to an undifferentiated carcinoma—the latter characterized by variably sized monotonous, often non-cohesive cells with brisk mitotic activity and usually arranged in sheets). Undifferentiated carcinoma tends to be negative for PAX8 and ER/PR with variable expression of keratins and can be associated with microsatellite instability (may be part of Lynch syndrome). Variants with distinct cytological features include the following: (1) ECa with clear cells (tumors with clearing due to ‘clear’ (glycogenated) squamous cells, distinct vacuoles, or not otherwise specified. EC with clear cells should be distinguished from clear cell carcinoma by the absence of the variety of architectural patterns, lack of cuboidal/flattened/hobnail cells, and lack of degree of atypia usually detected in clear cell carcinoma. In addition, they are ER/PR positive and Napsin A and p504S negative in contrast to clear cell carcinoma); (2) ECa with spindle cells (tumor with transition from spindle cells to the glandular component of a low-grade ECa. The spindle cells are keratin, ER/PR, and patchy p16 positive and show wild-type p53 expression); (3) ECa with mucinous differentiation (this tumor can be mistaken for a cervical adenocarcinoma, as they have overlapping features. Expression of ER/PR and vimentin in the context of a negative or patchy p16 positivity and the absence of high-risk HPV allows a correct diagnosis)."
Practical issues in the diagnosis of serous carcinoma of the endometrium,"Serous carcinoma (SC) represents ~10% of endometrial carcinomas, but is responsible for almost 40% of cancer deaths. This article reviews the main pathological features, differential diagnosis, and the usefulness of molecular pathology and immunohistochemistry in its diagnosis. Most helpful features for the diagnosis include: irregularly shaped and sized papillae, slit-like spaces, cell stratification and budding, highly atypical cells, architectural and cytological discordance in pseudoglandular tumors, as well as lack of endometrioid features. SC shows typically a predominant papillary growth, which is also found in some subtypes of endometrioid carcinoma of the endometrium (EEC). Distinction is easy when attention is paid to the presence of diffuse marked nuclear pleomorphism, but also to the complex papillary architecture. SC may also show a solid or pseudoglandular patterns, and in these cases differential diagnosis may be difficult with EEC grade 3. Moreover, a high proportion of SC may exhibit clear cells, and, thus, may be confused with clear cell carcinoma. Finally, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish mixed SC-EEC, from SC that combines papillary and pseudoglandular growths. Although there is not a single immunohistochemical marker for distinguishing SC from its mimickers, some antibodies are useful (p53, p16, IMP2, and IMP3), particularly when used in combination. Diagnosis of SC may be even more problematic in small biopsies; a diagnosis of high-grade endometrial carcinoma, SC component can not be excluded, is acceptable as a managerial approach, so it could be taken into account at the time of final surgery."
A practical approach to the diagnosis of mixed epithelial and mesenchymal tumours of the uterus,"The current 2014 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of mixed epithelial and mesenchymal tumours of the uterus includes categories of carcinosarcoma, adenosarcoma, adenofibroma, adenomyoma and atypical polypoid adenomyoma, the last two lesions being composed of an admixture of benign epithelial and mesenchymal elements with a prominent smooth muscle component. In this review, each of these categories of uterine neoplasm is covered with an emphasis on practical tips for the surgical pathologist and new developments. In particular, helpful clues in the distinction between carcinosarcoma and dedifferentiated endometrial carcinoma will be discussed. In addition, salient features to help distinguish between adenofibroma, adenosarcoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and other mesenchymal neoplasms in the differential diagnosis will be outlined. Finally, a discussion of adenomyoma and its main differential diagnostic considerations will be covered."
"The Beni Haoua, Algeria, Mw 4.9 earthquake: source parameters, engineering, and seismotectonic implications","A moderate Mw 4.9 earthquake struck the Beni Haoua (Algeria) coastal area on April 25, 2012. The mainshock was largely recorded by the accelerograph network of the Centre National de Recherche Appliquée en Génie Parasismique (CGS). The same day the earthquake occurred, eight mobile short period stations were deployed through the epicentral area. In this study, we use accelerogram and seismogram data recorded by these two networks. We combined the focal mechanism built from the first motion of P waves and from waveform inversion, and the distribution of aftershocks to well constrain the source parameters. The mainshock is located with a shallow focal depth, ∼9 km, and the focal mechanism shows a nearly pure left lateral strike slip motion, with total seismic moment of 2.8 × 1016 N.m (Mw = 4.9). The aftershocks mainly cluster on a narrow NS strip, starting at the coast up to 3–4 km inland. This cluster, almost vertical, is concentrated between 6 and 10 km depth. The second part of this work concerns the damage distribution and estimated intensity in the epicentral area. The damage distribution is discussed in connection with the observed maximum strong motion. The acceleration response spectrum with 5 % damping of the mainshock and aftershocks give the maximum amplitude in high frequency which directly affects the performance of the high-frequency structures. Finally, we tie this earthquake with the seismotectonic of the region, leading to conclude that it occurred on a N–S transform zone between two major compressional fault zones oriented NE–SW."
"Self-assembled supramolecular synthons of 2,6 diaminopyridinium tosylate","A novel organic nonlinear optical crystal, 2,6 diaminopyridinium tosylate (2,6DPT), was synthesized and grown by the slow evaporation method. Formation of the new crystalline compound was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction study. The title compound (2,6DPT) crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system with space group of P21/c. The crystalline perfection of the as-grown crystal was assessed by high-resolution X-ray diffraction study and the quality of it is reasonably good. The thermal stability of 2,6DPT is found to be 180 °C by thermogravimetric and differential thermal (TG–DTA) analyses. The specific heat capacity of 2,6DPT is found to be 3.86 J g−1 K−1. UV–Vis–NIR spectral study showed that the grown crystal is transparent in the entire visible region with the lower cut-off wavelength of 380 nm. The laser-induced surface damage threshold of grown crystal was measured to be 0.2538 GW cm−2 for 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser radiation. Nonlinear refractive index (n
2), absorption coefficient (β) and third-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ(3)) were measured by Z-scan technique."
Testing the Social Cost of Rapid Economic Development in Malaysia: The Effect of Trade on Life Expectancy,"The sheer size of industrializing economies’ echo rising health challenges, are we ignoring the darker side of economic development? Thus, this paper explores the impact of trade openness on life expectancy in Malaysia using time series data over the period of 1960–2014. We have applied structural break unit root and as well as cointegration tests to examine integrating properties of the variables and cointegration between the variables. The causal linkage between the variables is tested by applying the VECM Granger causality. The empirical evidence confirms the presence of cointegration amid the variables. Furthermore, economic growth increases life expectancy. Exports and imports have positive impact on life expectancy. The feedback effect exists between economic growth and life expectancy. Exports and imports cause life expectancy in Granger sense."
Out-of-the tropics or trans-tropical dispersal? The origins of the disjunct distribution of the gooseneck barnacle Pollicipes elegans,"Studying species with disjunct distributions allows biogeographers to evaluate factors controlling species ranges, limits on gene flow, and allopatric speciation. Here, we use phylogeographic and population genetic studies of the barnacle Pollicipes elegans to discriminate between two primary hypotheses about the origin of disjunct distributions of extra-tropical populations: trans-tropical stepping-stone colonization versus an out-of-the tropics origin."
"Immunofluorescent staining reveals hypermethylation of microchromosomes in the central bearded dragon, Pogona vitticeps","Studies of model organisms have demonstrated that DNA cytosine methylation and histone modifications are key regulators of gene expression in biological processes. Comparatively little is known about the presence and distribution of epigenetic marks in non-model amniotes such as non-avian reptiles whose genomes are typically packaged into chromosomes of distinct size classes. Studies of chicken karyotypes have associated the gene-richness and high GC content of microchromosomes with a distinct epigenetic landscape. To determine whether this is likely to be a common feature of amniote microchromosomes, we have analysed the distribution of epigenetic marks using immunofluorescence on metaphase chromosomes of the central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps). This study is the first to study the distribution of epigenetic marks on non-avian reptile chromosomes."
Cardiac dose reduction during tangential breast irradiation using deep inspiration breath hold: a dose comparison study based on deformable image registration,Radiation therapy (RT) for a left-sided breast cancer often involves some incidental exposure of the heart and increase in the rate of major coronary events. One method to reduce the dose to the heart during a tangential breast irradiation is the deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) technique. Our department adopted DIBH for selected left breast cancer patients with a maximum cardiac distance ≥ 10 mm. We evaluated the effect of the DIBH on cardiac dose compared to normal free breathing (FB). The secondary objective of our present study was to use modeled risk estimates to quantify the risk of coronary events after RT with DIBH.
"Evaluation of the utilization of external radiotherapy in the treatment of localized prostate cancer in Andalusia, Spain","Around 27,000 new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed every year in Spain and 5400 die from this disease. Radiotherapy (RT), alone or combined, has proven to be effective as initial treatment in patients with localized disease. Our objective was to evaluate the use of external beam RT (EBRT) in our region, comparing the indication rate and irradiation rate and examining variability in its application among hospitals."
Rapid transesterification of micro-amount of lipids from microalgae via a micro-mixer reactor,"Fatty acid composition is an important physiological parameter of microalgae, which is taken as the third generation alternative resource of biodiesel. To boost microalgal research and applications, a convenient, rapid, and acid-catalyzed transesterification procedure that satisfies the demand for the analysis of the fatty acid composition of lipids with micro-scale samples in the high-throughput screening of microalgal strains is needed, along with the evaluation of the physiological status of microalgae in response to nutrient stress."
Chondrogenic induction of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells from Wharton’s jelly embedded in alginate hydrogel and without added growth factor: an alternative stem cell source for cartilage tissue engineering,"Due to their intrinsic properties, stem cells are promising tools for new developments in tissue engineering and particularly for cartilage tissue regeneration. Although mesenchymal stromal/stem cells from bone marrow (BM-MSC) have long been the most used stem cell source in cartilage tissue engineering, they have certain limits. Thanks to their properties such as low immunogenicity and particularly chondrogenic differentiation potential, mesenchymal stromal/stem cells from Wharton’s jelly (WJ-MSC) promise to be an interesting source of MSC for cartilage tissue engineering."
Relationship between glycemic control and histochemical myeloperoxidase activity in neutrophils in patients with type 2 diabetes,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a lysosomal hemoprotein found in the azurophilic granules in neutrophils. Myeloperoxidase plays an important role in oxygen-dependent killing of bacteria, fungi, virus and malignant cells. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is listed among conditions that may lead to secondary MPO deficiency in neutrophils but inconsistent results concerning MPO activity in diabetic patients have been reported in the literature. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between glycemic control in patients with type 2 DM and MPO activity in neutrophils from a histochemical perspective."
Usefulness of using laser-induced photoacoustic measurement and 3.0 Tesla MRI to assess knee cartilage damage: a comparison study,"T2 mapping is an MRI method particularly reflective of the collagen arrangement in the cartilage, and diffusion tensor (DT) imaging captures the diffusion of water molecules. Laser-induced photoacoustic measurement (LIPA) makes it possible to assess not only the thickness of the cartilage layer but also its viscoelastic properties. By assessing cartilage damage assessment using LIPA and 3.0 Tesla MRI (T2 mapping and DT imaging), this study investigates the usefulness of the various methods."
Maintenance of autoantibody production in pristane-induced murine lupus,Pristane-treated mice chronically produce high levels of anti-ribonucleoprotein/Smith (anti-Sm/RNP) and other lupus autoantibodies. The present study addressed how these autoantibody levels are maintained over time.
BEAT-IT: Comparing a behavioural activation treatment for depression in adults with intellectual disabilities with an attention control: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Depression appears to be more enduring amongst people with intellectual disabilities, suggesting that it is a more chronic problem or more poorly managed in this population. This is not helped by a lack of evidence about the effectiveness of psychological therapies for people who have intellectual disabilities and depression. Behavioural activation, which aims to counteract depression by increasing individuals’ level of meaningful activity and their exposure to positive reinforcers, has proven to be as effective as cognitive behavioural therapy in the general population. Given that this therapy makes fewer communicative demands and focuses on activity, it was thought that behavioural activation would be both accessible and apt for people with intellectual disabilities, who are often socially marginalised."
Dorsal penile nerve block with ropivacaine versus intravenous tramadol for the prevention of catheter-related bladder discomfort: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) is common in male patients under general anesthesia, and it may cause patient agitation and exacerbated postoperative pain. In this study, we will enroll male patients undergoing elective surgery with urinary catheterization after anesthetic induction and compare the efficacy of a dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) and intravenous tramadol for the prevention of CRBD."
The use of a novel cleaning closed suction system reduces the volume of secretions within the endotracheal tube as assessed by micro-computed tomography: a randomized clinical trial,"Early after intubation, a layer of biofilm covers the inner lumen of the endotracheal tube (ETT). Cleaning the ETT might prevent airways colonization by pathogens, reduce resistance to airflow, and decrease sudden ETT obstruction. We investigated the effectiveness of a cleaning closed suction system in maintaining the endotracheal tube free from secretions."
Dynamic methylation pattern of cyp19a1a core promoter during zebrafish ovarian folliculogenesis,"In vertebrates, the aromatase coded by the cyp19a1a gene can catalyze the conversion from androgens to estrogens. Thus, the regulatory mechanisms of cyp19a1a gene expression are a critical research field in reproductive endocrinology. In this study, we use zebrafish as a model to study the dynamic methylation levels of the cyp19a1a gene core promoter during zebrafish ovarian folliculogenesis. The results show that there is an apparent fluctuation of the methylation levels of zebrafish cyp19a1a core promoter. Moreover, the methylation levels are inversely correlated with the expression levels of cyp19a1a transcripts when the ovarian follicles develop from PV into the MV stage. Also, the CpG dinucleotides which are close to the transcriptional starting site may have provided a significant blocking effect on inhibiting the transcriptional function of RNA polymerase II. Taken together, the results from the present study strongly suggest that DNA methylation was one of mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of cyp19a1a gene expression during folliculogenesis. This methylation mechanism modifying transcriptional process accompanied with zebrafish ovarian folliculogenesis might also shed new light on the regulation of cyp19a1a expression during the ovarian developmental stage in other vertebrates."
Attentional function and basal forebrain cholinergic neuron morphology during aging in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome,"Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) exhibit intellectual disability and develop Alzheimer’s disease-like neuropathology during the third decade of life. The Ts65Dn mouse model of DS exhibits key features of both disorders, including impairments in learning, attention and memory, as well as atrophy of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs). The present study evaluated attentional function in relation to BFCN morphology in young (3 months) and middle-aged (12 months) Ts65Dn mice and disomic (2N) controls. Ts65Dn mice exhibited attentional dysfunction at both ages, with greater impairment in older trisomics. Density of BFCNs was significantly lower for Ts65Dn mice independent of age, which may contribute to attentional dysfunction since BFCN density was positively associated with performance on an attention task. BFCN volume decreased with age in 2N but not Ts65Dn mice. Paradoxically, BFCN volume was greater in older trisomic mice, suggestive of a compensatory response. In sum, attentional dysfunction occurred in both young and middle-aged Ts65Dn mice, which may in part reflect reduced density and/or phenotypic alterations in BFCNs."
Negative association between GATA3 and fascin could predict relapse-free and overall survival in patients with breast cancer,"GATA3 and fascin proteins are known prognostic markers in several cancers. GATA3 is a key regulator of mammary gland morphogenesis and luminal cell differentiation, whereas fascin is a pro-metastatic actin-bundling protein. In this study, we analyzed and compared the predictive abilities of GATA3 and fascin for clinical outcomes of patients with breast cancer. The combined expression pattern based on GATA3−/+ and fascin−/+ was evaluated by immunostaining using a tissue microarray, and relationships between protein expression and several clinicopathological parameters were analyzed. GATA3 expression was associated with good prognostic parameters, but fascin was correlated with poor prognostic parameters. On comparing GATA3 and fascin, we found an inverse relationship between fascin and GATA3 expressions. On analysis of combined markers, GATA3+/fascin− was correlated with improved clinical outcomes compared to GATA3−/fascin+. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in relapse-free and overall survival between GATA3+/fascin− and GATA3−/fascin+. Combined marker analysis of GATA3/fascin showed an inverse association and improved prognostic information for patients with breast cancer."
Local resolution of ideals subordinated to a foliation,"Let M be a complex- or real-analytic manifold, \(\theta \) be a singular distribution and \(\mathcal {I}\) a coherent ideal sheaf defined on M. We prove the existence of a local resolution of singularities of \(\mathcal {I}\) that preserves the class of singularities of \(\theta \), under the hypothesis that the considered class of singularities is invariant by \(\theta \)-admissible blowings-up. In particular, if \(\theta \) is monomial, we prove the existence of a local resolution of singularities of \(\mathcal {I}\) that preserves the monomiality of the singular distribution \(\theta \)."
The dog prostate cancer (DPC-1) model: a reliable tool for molecular imaging of prostate tumors and metastases,"Clinical applicability of newly discovered reagents for molecular imaging is hampered by the lack of translational models. As the dog prostate cancer (DPC-1) model recapitulates in dogs the natural history of prostate cancer in man, we tested the feasibility of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT imaging in this model using an anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)/17G1 antibody as the radiotracer."
Bounds for q-integrals of \({}_{r+1}\psi_{r+1}\) with applications,"In this paper, we establish an inequality for the q-integral of the bilateral basic hypergeometric function \({}_{r+1}\psi_{r+1}\). As applications of the inequality, we give some sufficient conditions for the convergence of q-series."
Convergence theorems for split equality generalized mixed equilibrium problems for demi-contractive mappings,"In this paper, we introduce a new iterative algorithm for solving the split equality generalized mixed equilibrium problems. The weak and strong convergence theorems are proved for demi-contractive mappings in real Hilbert spaces. Several special cases are also discussed. As applications, we employ our results to get the convergence results for the split equality convex differentiable optimization problem, the split equality convex minimization problem, and the split equality mixed equilibrium problem. The results in this paper generalize, extend, and unify some recent results in the literature."
Mixed quasi-variational inequalities involving error bounds,"In this paper, we define some new notions of gap functions for set-valued mixed quasi-variational inequalities under suitable conditions. Further, we obtain local/global bounds for the solution of set-valued mixed quasi-variational inequality problems in terms of the residual gap function, the regularized gap function, and the D-gap function. The results obtained in this paper are generalization and refinement of previously known results for some class of variational inequality problems."
Derivation of consensus inactivation status for X-linked genes from genome-wide studies,"X chromosome inactivation is the epigenetic silencing of the majority of the genes on one of the X chromosomes in XX therian mammals. In humans, approximately 15 % of genes consistently escape from this inactivation and another 15 % of genes vary between individuals or tissues in whether they are subject to, or escape from, inactivation. Multiple studies have provided inactivation status calls for a large subset of the genes on the X chromosome; however, these studies vary in which genes they were able to make calls for and in some cases which call they give a specific gene."
Speech signal modeling using multivariate distributions,"Using a proper distribution function for speech signal or for its representations is of crucial importance in statistical-based speech processing algorithms. Although the most commonly used probability density function (pdf) for speech signals is Gaussian, recent studies have shown the superiority of super-Gaussian pdfs. A large research effort has focused on the investigation of a univariate case of speech signal distribution; however, in this paper, we study the multivariate distributions of speech signal and its representations using the conventional distribution functions, e.g., multivariate Gaussian and multivariate Laplace, and the copula-based multivariate distributions as candidates. The copula-based technique is a powerful method in modeling non-Gaussian multivariate distributions with non-linear inter-dimensional dependency. The level of similarity between the candidate pdfs and the real speech pdf in different domains is evaluated using the energy goodness-of-fit test."
Reprogramming somatic cells to cells with neuronal characteristics by defined medium both in vitro and in vivo,"Currently, direct conversion from somatic cells to neurons requires virus-mediated delivery of at least one transcriptional factor or a combination of several small-molecule compounds. Delivery of transcriptional factors may affect genome stability, while small-molecule compounds may require more evaluations when applied in vivo. Thus, a defined medium with only conventional growth factors or additives for cell culture is desirable for inducing neuronal trans-differentiation."
Phylogenetic investigation of enteric bovine coronavirus in Ireland reveals partitioning between European and global strains,"Bovine coronavirus is a primary cause of neonatal calf diarrhea worldwide, and is also associated with acute diarrhea in adult cattle during the winter season. There are no reports on molecular characterization of bovine coronavirus in Ireland, and little data exists apart from serological studies."
Saccharification of orange peel wastes with crude enzymes from new isolated Aspergillus japonicus PJ01,"This study investigated the saccharification of orange peel wastes with crude enzymes from Aspergillus japonicus PJ01. Pretreated orange peel powder was hydrolyzed by submerged fermentation (SmF) and solid-state fermentation (SSF) crude enzymes, the results showed that 4 % (w/v) of solid loading, undiluted crude enzymes, and 45 °C were suitable saccharification conditions. The hydrolysis kinetics showed that the apparent Michaelis–Menten constant \(K_{{\text{m}_{app} }}\) and maximal reaction rate \(V_{{\max_{app} }}\) were 73.32 g/L and 0.118 g/(L min) for SmF enzyme, and 41.45 g/L and 0.116 g/(L min) for SSF enzyme, respectively. After 48 h of hydrolysis, the saccharification yields were 58.5 and 78.7 %, the reducing sugar concentrations were 14.9 and 20.1 mg/mL by SmF and SSF enzymes. Material balance showed that the SmF enzymatic hydrolysate was enriched galacturonic acid > arabinose > galactose > xylose, and the SSF enzymatic hydrolysate was enriched galacturonic acid > xylose > galactose > arabinose."
Reply to Critics,"This article responds to the four contributors to the book symposium on Conscience and Conviction: The Case for Civil Disobedience. Those four contributors are Thomas Hill Jr, David Lefkowitz, William Smith, and Daniel Weinstock
. Hill examines the concepts of conviction and conscience (Chapters 1 and 2); Smith discusses conviction and then analyses the right to civil disobedience and my humanistic arguments for it (Chapter 4); Weinstock explores democratic challenges for civil disobedience (Chapter 5); and Lefkowitz assesses the merits of a legal demands-of-conviction excuse for civil disobedience (Chapter 5). This ‘Reply to Critics’ addresses them in turn."
Do Consumers Learn from Their Own Experiences?,"It is natural to think that a household may learn from its own experiences and subsequently increase savings. This paper tests empirically the hypothesis that Japanese households learn from their experiences of large expenditure and increase their targets for precautionary savings after such experiences. The results imply that households raise their targets for precautionary savings by 4–5 percent of annual income in response to such experiences. Moreover, data are consistent with the argument that targets for savings affect actual savings. Assuming this holds, the results in this paper suggest that consumers may increase their actual savings following large expenditure."
Understanding Japan’s Capital Goods Exports,"Japan is the leading supplier of sophisticated capital goods to East Asian countries. These goods embody advanced technologies and facilitate learning and productivity growth. Capital goods also represent 30–40% of Japan’s exports. This paper investigates the determinants of these exports. Results from dynamic ordinary least squares estimation indicate that exports depend on exchange rates, income in the importing countries and downstream countries’ exports to the rest of the world. Results from out-of-sample forecasts indicate that Japanese exports crashed in 2009 because of the perfect storm of a yen appreciation, a global slowdown and a collapse in Asia’s exports."
"Hyperbolic Discounting, Borrowing Aversion and Debt Holding","Analysis of an original Internet-based survey reveals that debt holding is related to time discounting through: (i) present bias, measured by the degree of declining impatience in the generalized hyperbolic discount function; (ii) borrowing aversion, captured by a sign effect in that future losses are discounted at lower rates than future gains; and (iii) impatience, measured by the overall discount rate. Hyperbolic respondents are classified naïve if their answers reveal them to be time-inconsistent procrastinators, and otherwise sophisticated. Naïve respondents with more steeply declining impatience are more likely to be debtors. The sign effect relates negatively to borrowing. Survey responses indicative of high or declining impatience are associated with credit card borrowing and other overborrowing indicators."
Translational Modeling in Schizophrenia: Predicting Human Dopamine D2 Receptor Occupancy,To assess the ability of a previously developed hybrid physiology-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PBPKPD) model in rats to predict the dopamine D2 receptor occupancy (D2RO) in human striatum following administration of antipsychotic drugs.
"Band Anticrossing in Dilute Germanium Carbides 
Using Hybrid Density Functionals","Dilute germanium carbides (Ge1−x

) offer a direct bandgap for compact silicon photonics, but widely varying properties have been reported. This work reports improved band structure calculations for Ge1−x
C
x
 using ab initio simulations that employ the HSE06 exchange–correlation density functional. Contrary to Vegard’s law, the conduction band minimum at Γ is consistently found to decrease with increasing C content, while L and X valleys change much more slowly. The calculated Ge bandgap is within 11% of experimental values. A decrease in energy at the Γ conduction band valley of (170 meV ± 50)/%C is predicted, leading to a direct bandgap for x > 0.008. These results indicate a promising material for Group IV lasers."
Cycling reliability of RF-MEMS switches with Gold–Platinum multilayers as contact material,"Contact resistance is the main parameter used for assessing the high cycling reliability of RF microelectromechanical (RF-MEMS) switches. In this paper the use of a modified contact material is tested and compared to pure gold in cycling experiments performed on a RF-MEMS switch in shunt capacitive configuration. The modified contact material is a gold-based multilayer with a thin layer of platinum sandwiched between two layers of gold. The experiment consists in comparing devices with the same layout but with different contact material. While the two types of switch start with similar RF performances, the device with the modified material shows a marked improvement in cycling reliability and a lower series resistance up to 106 cycles when compared to gold contact devices."
Fabrication of microfluidic structures in quartz via micro machining technologies,"Microfluidic channels have been created for quartz material using micromechanical manufacturing technologies such as micro laser machining, micro ultrasonic machining, and ultra-precision machining. Ultra-precision machining has been used to manufacture cross-junction channels 14 µm wide and 28 µm deep with a three-dimensional triangle cross-section. Micro laser machining has been used 
to manufacture U-shaped and -shaped microfluidic channels. Deep holes and microfluidic channels with a high slenderness ratio (width/depth) can be obtained by using micro ultrasonic machining technology. These three machining techniques are compared with respect to surface profiles and machining quality."
Modeling and Characterization of Texture Evolution in Twist Extrusion,"Twist extrusion (TE) is a severe plastic deformation method with a potential for commercialization. Deformation during the TE process is non-uniform and non-monotonic, which is expected to result in significant and non-trivial microstructural changes in metallic materials. In this study, texture evolution during TE of pre-textured copper was investigated. Experimental characterization of textures after various numbers of passes demonstrated that TE can be used for producing uniformly weak textures in pre-textured copper. Crystal plasticity simulations were found to run into the problem known as strain reversal texture. In particular, crystal plasticity simulations predicted the return of initial texture upon strain reversal in the first pass of TE, whereas the experimental texture was not reversed and had components related to simple shear. Grain refinement, imperfect strain reversal, and material asymmetry are proposed to be responsible for the occurrence of strain reversal texture in TE. Effects of the non-random initial texture on the microstructure and texture evolution are also discussed."
Kernel methods for word sense disambiguation,"Many applications of natural language processing (NLP) need an accurate resolution of various ambiguities existing in natural language. The task of fulfilling this need is also called word sense disambiguation (WSD). WSD is to resolve the correct sense for an instance of a polysemous word. On the other hand, as one of the most popular machine learning approaches, kernel methods have attracted significant interest in recent years and have exhibited fairly high performance in a wide variety of learning tasks. In this paper, we present a survey of the research progress of kernel-based WSD techniques. We start by introducing some preliminary knowledge concerning WSD and kernel methods. Then, a review of the main approaches in the literature is presented, focusing on the following issues: context representation, kernel design and learning algorithms. We also provide some further discussions on the kernel-based WSD approaches. Finally, open problems and future directions are discussed."
Dietary sodium and iodine in remote Indigenous Australian communities: will salt-reduction strategies increase risk of iodine deficiency? A cross-sectional analysis and simulation study,"Excess salt intake is a global issue. Effective salt-reduction strategies are needed, however, as salt is a vehicle for iodine fortification, these strategies may also reduce iodine intake. This study examines the case of the remote Indigenous Australian population; we employed an innovative, objective method to assess sodium and iodine intakes against requirements and modelled the potential effects of salt-reduction strategies on estimated sodium and iodine intakes."
Characteristics associated with the consumption of malted drinks among Malaysian primary school children: findings from the MyBreakfast study,"The consumption of beverages contributes to diet quality and overall nutrition. Studies on malted drinks, one of the widely consumed beverage choices among children in Asia, however, have received limited attention. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of malted drink consumption and explored associations of sociodemographic characteristics, nutrient intakes, weight status and physical activity levels with malted drink consumption among primary school children in Malaysia."

Synthesis and characterization of NiMoO4 via ultrasonic route by a novel precursor,"In this work, nickel molybdate (NiMoO4) nanostructures have been synthesized by low-temperature sonochemical method. Simplicity, rapid reaction rate, controllable reaction conditions and safety of the technique as well as the uniform shape, narrow size distribution, and high purity of prepared nano-sized materials are some of the main advantage of this method. The benefit of using ultrasound radiation in combination with thermal treatment is high yield and purity of product. The effect of various parameters such as: power of ultrasound irradiation, concentration of initial precursors, sonication time, and surfactant on morphology, size and purity of products were investigated. The products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmittance electron microscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. This work provides a general, simple and effective method to control the composition and morphology of NiMoO4 nanostructures."
Efficiency of sample-based indices for spatial pattern recognition of wild pistachio (Pistacia atlantica) trees in semi-arid woodlands,"The efficiency of sample-based indices proposed to quantify the spatial distribution of trees is influenced by the structure of tree stands, environmental heterogeneity and degree of aggregation. We evaluated 10 commonly used distance-based and 10 density-based indices using two structurally different stands of wild pistachio trees in the Zagros woodlands, Iran, to assess the reliability of each in revealing stand structure in woodlands. All trees were completely stem-mapped in a nearly pure (40 ha) and a mixed (45 ha) stand. First, the inhomogeneous pair correlation function [g(r)] and the Clark–Evans index (CEI) were used as references to reveal the true spatial arrangement of all trees in these stands. The sampled data were then evaluated using the 20 indices. Sampling was undertaken in a grid based on a square lattice using square plots (30 m × 30 m) and nearest neighbor distances at the sample points. The g(r) and CEI statistics showed that the wild pistachio trees were aggregated in both stands, although the degree of aggregation was markedly higher in the pure stand. Three distance- and six density-based indices statistically verified that the wild pistachio trees were aggregated in both stands. The distance-based Hines and Hines statistic (h

t
) and the density-based standardised Morisita (I

p
), patchiness (IP) and Cassie (C

A
) indices revealed aggregation of the trees in the two structurally different stands in the Zagros woodlands and the higher clumping in the pure stand, whereas the other indices were not sensitive enough."

A novel graphene-chitosan-Bi2O3 nanocomposite modified sensor for sensitive and selective electrochemical determination of a monoamine neurotransmitter epinephrine,"A novel sensitive electrochemical sensor has been developed by modification of glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with graphene (GRP), chitosan (CHIT), and bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) nanoparticles. The morphological characteristics of nanocomposite (GRP-CHIT-Bi2O3 or GCB) were studied by scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscopy. The electrochemical behavior of epinephrine at nanocomposite modified GCE (GCB/GCE) was investigated in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution using cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry. GCB/GCE showed an enhancement in the current response as compared to bare GCE. Electrochemical impedance spectra showed a reduction of charge transfer resistance and higher electrocatalytic behavior of the sensor. The electrooxidation process of epinephrine at the modified sensor was found to be diffusion controlled. GCB/GCE showed a linear response to epinephrine in the range 100 to 500 nM. The limit of detection and limit of quantification were found to be 3.56 and 11.85 nM, respectively, which is lower than many other sensors reported for epinephrine in literature. The modified sensor showed high sensitivity (1.3 nA/nM) and selectivity for epinephrine. The method was employed for quantification of epinephrine in pharmaceutical formulation and human blood serum samples."
Environmental Tobacco Smoke Exposure in Pregnancy is Associated With Earlier Delivery and Reduced Birth Weight,"The association between maternal smoking and preterm birth (PTB) has been known for more than 50 years but the effect of passive smoking is controversial. This retrospective cohort study in Bristol, United Kingdom, examines the effect of environmental tobacco smoke exposure (ETSE) on gestational age at delivery, birth weight, PTB, and being small-for-gestational age (SGA). Environmental tobacco smoke exposure was defined by either self-report or exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) levels, and exposed women were compared with unexposed controls. Two models were used: The first included all women with adjustment for maternal smoking, and the second considered nonsmokers alone. Both models were further adjusted for maternal age, body mass index, parity, ethnicity, employment status, socioeconomic position, asthma, preeclampsia, and offspring sex. Logistic regression and likelihood ratio tests were used to test for any association between exposure and the binary outcomes (PTB and SGA), while linear regression and F tests were used to test for associations between exposure and the continuous outcomes. There were 13 359 deliveries in 2012 to 2014, with complete data for 5066 and 4793 women in the self-reported and eCO-measured exposure groups, respectively. Self-reported exposure was associated with earlier delivery (−0.19 weeks; 95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.32 to −0.05) and reduced birth weight (−56 g, 95% CI: −97 to −16 g) but no increase in the risk of PTB or SGA. There was no evidence for an association between eCO-measured exposure and any of the outcome measures. This information is important when advising women and their families and adds further support to continued public health efforts to reduce exposure to tobacco smoke."
Effects of a Levonorgestrel-Releasing Intrauterine System on the Expression of Steroid Receptor Coregulators in Adenomyosis,"Although the pathophysiology of adenomyosis has not been clarified, it is thought to be related to ectopic endometrium, which depends on hormonal regulation. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is effective for the medical treatment of adenomyosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which LNG-IUS ameliorates adenomyosis pathology remain unclear. This study was designed to compare the expression levels of steroid receptor coregulators in human endometrium of control and participants with adenomyosis and to determine whether LNG-IUS modulated their expression. Immunohistochemistry with H-scores was performed. Steroid receptor coactivators were shown to have significantly decreased expressions at the secretory phase in the LNG-IUS group when compared to the other groups. Expression of transcriptional intermediary factor 2 was lower in the LNG-IUS group than in both the control group (P = .015) and the untreated adenomyosis group (P = .019) during the secretory phase. Amplified in breast cancer 1 expression was higher in the stromal cells of the untreated adenomyosis group than in those of the controls (P = .017) during the secretory phase; however, levels were lower in the LNG-IUS group (P = .005). Nuclear receptor corepressor expression increased during the proliferative phase and decreased during the secretory phase in untreated adenomyosis; this pattern was reversed in the control and LNG-IUS groups. Thus, an altered expression of steroid receptor coregulators may play a role in adenomyosis development and treatment."
Resveratrol Protects Against Pathological Preterm Birth by Suppression of Macrophage-Mediated Inflammation,"Inflammatory cytokines play a major role in spontaneous preterm birth. Resveratrol has strong anti-inflammatory effects, but its effect on preterm birth in vivo is unknown. We investigated whether resveratrol protects against preterm birth in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced preterm mouse model. Twelve-day-old pregnant mice were fed 20 to 40 mg/kg resveratrol daily. On day 15, 10 μg of LPS was injected into uterine cervices. Resveratrol administration significantly decreased the rate of preterm birth. Resveratrol administration abolished LPS-induced elevation of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL) 1β but not IL-6 levels. The TNF-α messenger RNA levels were decreased in the cervices of resveratrol-administered mice compared with controls. Resveratrol treatment suppressed the elevation in TNF-α and IL-1β levels in LPS-exposed peritoneal macrophages. Further resveratrol treatment eradicated the proinflammatory cytokine-mediated elevation in cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in peritoneal macrophages. Resveratrol may protect against pathological preterm birth by suppression of elevated proinflammatory cytokines and consequent elevation of COX-2 in macrophages."

Effects of a 1 year development programme for recently graduated veterinary professionals on personal and job resources: a combined quantitative and qualitative approach,"The early years in professional practice are for many veterinary and medical professionals a period of great challenges and consequently increased stress levels. Personal resources appear to have a positive impact on the course of this transition period. Personal resources are defined as developable systems of positive beliefs about one’s self and the world that are generally linked to resilience. They are negatively related to burnout and positively and reciprocally to job resources, work engagement and job performance. With the aim of enhancing personal resources of recently graduated veterinarians, a 1 year multi-modular resources development programme was designed. This study was conducted to analyse:"
Academic leagues: a Brazilian way to teach about cancer in medical universities,"Performance of qualified professionals committed to cancer care on a global scale is critical. Nevertheless there is a deficit in Cancer Education in Brazilian medical schools (MS). Projects called Academic Leagues (AL) have been gaining attention. However, there are few studies on this subject. AL arise from student initiative, arranged into different areas, on focus in general knowledge, universal to any medical field. They are not obligatory and students are responsible for the organizing and planning processes of AL, so participation highlights the motivation to active pursuit of knowledge. The objective of this study was to explore the relevance of AL, especially on the development of important skills and attitudes for medical students."
Gymnosperm and angiosperm pollen grains in Holocene sediments from a paleolagoon in the coastal plain of extreme southern Brazil,"This paper describes pollen grains of three gymnosperms and 31 angiosperms preserved in one Quaternary sedimentary profile of a paleolagoon, Hermenegildo Beach (33°42′S–53°18′W), in the extreme southern coastal plain of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. We present these data as taxonomic references for paleoenvironmental studies in this region. The profile was collected directly from the vertical slope over an interval covering the last conventional 2600 years, as determined by radiocarbon dating. Chemical processing of the samples was performed according to standard methodology, using HCl, HF, KOH, and acetolysis, and analyses were performed on light microscopy. The pollen material was found during the counts of 300 pollen grains in each sample, controlled by saturation curves. Descriptions and illustrations are included, along with ecological data from the original organisms. The high taxonomic diversity found in this study will enhance subsequent plant successional studies, which are essential to paleoenvironmental reconstructions of the coastal plain of southern Brazil."
