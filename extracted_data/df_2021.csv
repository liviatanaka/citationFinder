A Finite Difference Method for the Variational p-Laplacian,"We propose a new monotone finite difference discretization for the variational p-Laplace operator, \(\Delta _pu=\text{ div }(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u),\) and present a convergent numerical scheme for related Dirichlet problems. The resulting nonlinear system is solved using two different methods: one based on Newton-Raphson and one explicit method. Finally, we exhibit some numerical simulations supporting our theoretical results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first monotone finite difference discretization of the variational p-Laplacian and also the first time that nonhomogeneous problems for this operator can be treated numerically with a finite difference scheme."
"Alcanivorax limicola sp. nov., isolated from a soda alkali-saline soil","An alkaliphilic and aerobic bacterium, designated as strain JB21T, was isolated from a soda alkali-saline soil sample in Heilongjiang, Northeast China. Strain JB21T is a Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, non-motile and amylase-positive bacterium. Growth occurred at 15–45 °C (optimum, 35–37 °C), in the presence of 0–15.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 1.0%) and at pH 6.5–10.5 (optimum, pH 8.5–9.5). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain JB21T was most closely related to type strains of the genus Alcanivorax, with the highest sequence similarity to Alcanivorax indicus SW127T (96.3%), and shared 95.4–93.1% sequence identity with other valid type strains of this genus. The major cellular fatty acids identified were C16:0 and summed feature 8 (C18:1ω6c and/or C18:1ω7c). The polar lipids comprised phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and one unidentified phospholipid. The genomic G + C content of strain JB21T was 61.3 mol%. The digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) estimation and average nucleotide identity (ANI) between strain JB21T and type strains of the genus Alcanivorax were 18.3–23.2% and 69.2–79.0%, respectively. On the basis of its phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, we suggest the creation of a new species within the Alcanivorax genus, named Alcanivorax limicola sp. nov., type strain JB21T (= CGMCC 1.16632T = JCM 33717T)."
Selected aspects of a cold forging process for hollow balls,"This paper presents the results of a study investigating a cold forging process for producing hollow balls with different wall thicknesses. The study was performed by FEM numerical modelling, which made it possible to obtain a wide spectrum of results. For the analysis of FEM results obtained for problematic cases (shape defects in forged balls), novel hypotheses for results interpretation are proposed. The FEM numerical model and hypotheses are then verified via experimental testing, and selected theoretical results are compared with experimental findings. Finally, obtained results are discussed (e.g. the effect of billet dimensions on forging conditions, wall thickness and hole size), a method for FEM results interpretation is presented, and design-related solutions ensuring the production of defect-free hollow balls are proposed."
Anal endosonographic assessment of the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of obstetric anal sphincter injury,Obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) are a common cause of maternal morbidity with an overall incidence in the UK of 2.9% (range 0–8%). They can cause a range of physical symptoms and psychological distress. This study aims to assess the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of OASIS using endoanal ultrasound (EAUS) and the correlation between confirmed injury and change to anorectal physiology squeeze pressure and the incidence of bowel symptoms.
Conversion of lignin-derived 3-methoxycatechol to the natural product purpurogallin using bacterial P450 GcoAB and laccase CueO,"Purpurogallin is a natural benzotropolone extracted from Quercus spp, which has antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties. Purpurogallin is typically synthesized from pyrogallol using enzymatic or metal catalysts, neither economically feasible nor environmentally friendly. 3-Methoxycatechol (3-MC) is a lignin-derived renewable chemical with the potential to be a substrate for the biosynthesis of purpurogallin. In this study, we designed a pathway to produce purpurogallin from 3-MC. We first characterized four bacterial laccases and identified the laccase CueO from Escherichia coli, which converts pyrogallol to purpurogallin. Then, we used CueO and the P450 GcoAB reported to convert 3-MC to pyrogallol, to construct a method for producing purpurogallin directly from 3-MC. A total of 0.21 ± 0.05 mM purpurogallin was produced from 5 mM 3-MC by whole-cell conversion. This study provides a new method to enable efficient and sustainable synthesis of purpurogallin and offers new insights into lignin valorization."
New ways of treatment of fractures of the humeral shaft: does the combination of intramedullary nail osteosynthesis and cerclage improve the healing process?,"The humeral shaft fracture is a rare fracture of the long bones with various treatment options. Dreaded complications such as lesions of the radial nerve or non-unions make the decision for what kind of therapy option more difficult. Biomechanically the upper arm is mostly exposed to rotational forces, which affect intramedullary nail osteosynthesis. Additive cerclage may compensate for these in spiral fractures. The aim of this study is to investigate what effect a combination of intramedullary nail osteosynthesis and limited invasive cerclage has on the rate of healing. In addition, this study addresses the question if complications arise as a result of cerclage."
Quantitative assessment of the central versus peripheral effect of intravenous clonidine using baroreflex equilibrium diagrams,"Clonidine is a first-generation central antihypertensive that reduces sympathetic nerve activity (SNA). Although clonidine also exerts peripheral vasoconstriction, the extent to which this vasoconstriction offsets the centrally mediated arterial pressure (AP)-lowering effect remains unknown. In anesthetized rats (n = 8), we examined SNA and AP responses to stepwise changes in carotid sinus pressure under control conditions and after intravenous low-dose (2 μg/kg) and high-dose clonidine (5 μg/kg). In the baroreflex equilibrium diagram analysis, the operating-point AP under the control condition was 115.2 (108.5–127.7) mmHg [median (25th–75th percentile range)]. While the operating-point AP after low-dose clonidine was not significantly different with or without the peripheral effect, the operating-point AP after high-dose clonidine was higher with the peripheral effect than without [81.3 (76.2–98.2) mmHg vs. 70.7 (57.7–96.9), P < 0.05]. The vasoconstrictive effect of clonidine partly offset the centrally mediated AP-lowering effect after high-dose administration."
Improving local prevalence estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections using a causal debiasing framework,"Global and national surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology is mostly based on targeted schemes focused on testing individuals with symptoms. These tested groups are often unrepresentative of the wider population and exhibit test positivity rates that are biased upwards compared with the true population prevalence. Such data are routinely used to infer infection prevalence and the effective reproduction number, Rt, which affects public health policy. Here, we describe a causal framework that provides debiased fine-scale spatiotemporal estimates by combining targeted test counts with data from a randomized surveillance study in the United Kingdom called REACT. Our probabilistic model includes a bias parameter that captures the increased probability of an infected individual being tested, relative to a non-infected individual, and transforms observed test counts to debiased estimates of the true underlying local prevalence and Rt. We validated our approach on held-out REACT data over a 7-month period. Furthermore, our local estimates of Rt are indicative of 1-week- and 2-week-ahead changes in SARS-CoV-2-positive case numbers. We also observed increases in estimated local prevalence and Rt that reflect the spread of the Alpha and Delta variants. Our results illustrate how randomized surveys can augment targeted testing to improve statistical accuracy in monitoring the spread of emerging and ongoing infectious disease."
External field-strengthened Ostwald nanowelding,"The accomplishment of nanowelding typically requires the input of high energy, possibly causing appreciable damages to the brittle nanomaterial. Herein, we report an external field (EF, i.e., light, direct current (DC), and alternating current (AC))-strengthened Ostwald nanowelding (ONW) strategy to enable low-temperature nanowelding of Au nanoparticles (NPs) with nanoscale spacing in solution and propose an electron localization mechanism to understand it. We reveal that the EF-derived local electrons not only greatly strengthen the dissolution of surface atoms and the reduction of Au3+ ions dissolved, but also confine (together with ordered water molecules) the transport of Au3+ ions within the nanogap. Consequently, the electrochemical Ostwald ripening (OR) process of the Au NPs is actively strengthened, which, along with the local electron-strengthened surface atom diffusion (as a result of the strong electrostatic repulsion created), enables feasible ONW for solution processing of interdigital electrodes (IDEs) from Au NPs and high-performance transparent conductor (TC) from Ag nanowires (NWs). Our low-temperature nanowelding strategy offers an efficient interconnection technique for the processing of functional nanodevices from individual nanomaterials."
Optimisation design and verification of the acoustic environment for multimedia classrooms in universities based on simulation,"The acoustic environment of the classroom is one of the most important factors influencing the teaching and learning effects of the teacher and students. It is critical to ensure good speech intelligibility in classrooms. However, due to some factors, it may not be easy to achieve an ideal classroom acoustic environment, especially in large-scale multimedia classrooms. In a real renovation project of 39 multimedia classrooms in a university, seven typical rooms were selected, and the acoustic environment optimisation design and verification for these multimedia classrooms were performed based on simulation. First, the acoustic and sound reinforcement design schemes were determined based on the room acoustics software ODEON. Next, the effects of the optimisation design were analysed, and the simulated and measured results were compared; the accuracy of using the reduced sound absorption coefficients, which were determined empirically, was also examined. Finally, the recommended reverberation times (RTs) in multimedia classrooms corresponding to speech intelligibility were discussed, the effectiveness of the speech transmission index (STI) as a primary parameter for classroom acoustic environment control was considered, and the acoustic environment under the unoccupied and occupied statuses was compared. The results revealed that although there are many factors influencing the effect of classroom acoustic environment control, an adequate result can be expected on applying the appropriate method. Considering both the acoustic design and visual requirements also makes the classroom likely to have a good visual effect in addition to having a good listening environment."
A BIM-Based Approach to Automated Prefabricated Building Construction Site Layout Planning,"Construction site layout planning (CSLP) is a typical problem in construction site management that urgently needs to be solved. A reasonable construction site layout can improve efficiency and reduce costs and unnecessary loss of time. To solve the CSLP problem, some emerging optimization algorithms and enhanced mathematical models have been developed. The building information model (BIM) provides data support for the implementation of previous research. However, manually extracting and modifying parameters from the BIM for use in optimization algorithms is cumbersome in practical applications, wasting considerable time and human resources. In this paper, we propose a framework of automated prefabricated building CSLP to realize the integration of the BIM and an optimization algorithm, which utilizes the Dynamo visual programming platform to create an information channel between the BIM and the optimization algorithm. A typical and practical case, which is optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), is demonstrated to validate the proposed approach and to show an effective reduction in material transportation cost and unnecessary loss of time."
"Narcotic detection efficacy and behavior of police dogs are affected by rearing system, weaning time, and maternal bond","The present study was performed to investigate the influences of rearing type, time of weaning, and maternal bond on the narcotic detection efficacy of police dogs. One hundred German shepherd dogs (52 males and 48 females) were utilized in this study. The study was divided into three experiments. Experiment I: dogs were divided into two groups with known previous history of rearing system; the first group received natural rearing (natural suckling). While the second group received artificial rearing. Experiment II: dogs were distributed into three groups. In the first group, dogs were weaned at 8 weeks, in the second group, dogs were weaned at 12 weeks and in the third group, dogs were orphans. Experiment III: dogs were distributed into two groups. The first group contained the dogs which were trained in the presence of their mothers, while the second group contained the dogs which were trained in the absence of their mothers. Results revealed that the narcotics detection trainability performance measures were significantly affected by the rearing system, time of weaning as well as the maternal bond, where the naturally reared dogs, dogs weaned at 12 weeks and those trained in the presence of their mothers showed better performance represented by the higher proportions of correct alerts and the lower false alerts, and chances and passes to detect the narcotics. These observations suggests that the events of the past (rearing type, extension of suckling and maternal bond) are correlated to and positively affected the future behavior and narcotic detection efficacy of police dogs without the need for additional reinforcements. In conclusion, this study can be a base for further research toward reducing the expensive and time-consuming training practices required for adult working dogs to locate narcotics and other objectives."
Osteostimulating Ability of β-tricalcium Phosphate/collagen Composite as a Practical Bone-grafting Substitute: In vitro and in vivo Comparison Study with Commercial One,"A biocompatible and biodegradable bioceramic, β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) has been widely considered as a safe and effective alternative to autograft for bone reconstruction due to its excellent osteoconductivity. Here, we prepared the composite of β-TCP and collagen (β-TCP/col) to investigate whether such a bone extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimetic synthetic bone graft can achieve a highly accelerated bone growth comparable to a commercially available bone substitute. The bone regenerating effects of the β-TCP/col block were evaluated in vitro and in vivo by comparison with Bio-Oss Collagen® (Bio-Oss/col). Preosteoblasts showed similar levels of cell adhesion and proliferation in the β-TCP/col and Bio-Oss/col scaffolds. Expression levels of osteogenic differentiation marker genes, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteocalcin (OCN), increased significantly in cells on the collagen plug compared to the control (without any bone graft material). Notably, cells on the β-TCP/col scaffold exhibited more than 2-fold higher expression levels of ALP and OCN compared to the Bio-Oss/col scaffold. In addition, in vivo animal experiments showed that the β-TCP/col scaffold induced a remarkably accelerated bone formation (∼69.54%) compared to the Bio-Oss/col scaffold (∼67.08%) and the collagen plug (∼11.47%) at 8 weeks after implantation. These results indicated that the composite of β-TCP and collagen (β-TCP/col) showing a comparable bone-regenerating ability could be used as a substitute for the most commercially available Bio-Oss Collagen®."
"Enhanced Solubility Through Particle Size Control, Modification of Crystal Behavior, and Crystalline Form Changes in Solid Dispersion of Nifedipine","The purpose of this study was to investigate the selectivity of polymers and the suitability of spray drying to enhance nifedipine solubility. Nifedipine alone or in combination with polymers was dissolved in a mixed solvent of methylene chloride and ethanol. The hydrophilic polymers used were PVP K-30, HPMC, HPMCP, Eudragit, and HPMCAS. Each solid dispersion was prepared using a laboratory spray dryer. The spray-dried solid dispersants were characterized by SEM, DSC, and XRPD analysis, and dissolution tests compared the dissolution rates of nifedipine solid dispersants and nifedipine. The results showed that all spray-dried solid dispersions were in an amorphous form. Dissolution tests were performed at pH 1.2 (artificial gastric juice) and pH 6.8 (artificial intestinal juice) to evaluate solid dispersion solubility. The solid dispersion containing HPMC showed a notably enhanced dissolution rate under both pH conditions. Interestingly, HPMCP and HPMCAS showed almost no enhancement of dissolution behavior at pH 1.2, but a significant increase (10 times or higher) over that of the pure polymer at pH 6.8. Solubility enhancement of poorly soluble drugs differs markedly among the polymers used for spray drying. From the results, HPMCP and HPMCAS are suitable as carriers for drugs with poor solubility that require acid resistance."
Quantum absentminded driver problem revisited,"The aim of the paper is to study the problem of absentminded driver in the quantum domain. In the classical case, it is a well-known example of a decision problem with imperfect recall that exhibits lack of equivalence between mixed and behavioral strategies. The optimal payoff outcome is significantly lower than the maximum payoff appearing in the game. This raises the question whether a quantum approach to the problem can increase the strategic position of the decision maker. The results that we present in the paper clearly reveal the benefits from playing the absentminded problem with the aid of quantum objects. Through appropriately chosen initial quantum state, the unitary strategies enable the decision maker to obtain the maximum possible payoff. At the same time, our scheme comes down to the classical problem with a suitable restriction of unitary strategies."
Application of UAV Photogrammetry to Slope-Displacement Measurement,"To reduce accidents caused by slope failures, disaster assessments and displacement measurements of steep slopes are conducted. Measurement values can vary greatly, depending on the technician’s proficiency. Moreover, land creep and minute displacements are difficult to detect. In this study, we attempted to solve this problem using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and aerial triangulation. After a review of previous studies, a measurement precision of 10 cm for daily monitoring and sub-centimeters for precise monitoring were set. Twelve checkpoints were used, and the comparison results between the measured values using the total station and the aerial triangulation using the UAV were as follows. A virtual reference station (VRS) and three ground control points (GCPs) yielded 11.58 mm for the 3D (root-mean-square error) RMSE, and post-processed kinematic (PPK) and three GCPs generated 9.71 mm. By differentiating the results of multiple observations, the PPK processing results could achieve sub-centimeter accuracy. We verified that direct georeferencing using a VRS is sufficient for daily monitoring, and precise measurements require at least three GCPs. Geotechnicians can use VRS observations for economical slope monitoring in normal times, and accurate observations with GCPs when precise measurements are required."
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological stress in breast cancer patients,"The majority of breast cancer patients are severely psychologically affected by breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent therapeutic procedures. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions on public life have additionally caused significant psychological distress for much of the population. It is therefore plausible that breast cancer patients might be particularly susceptible to the additional psychological stress caused by the pandemic, increasing suffering. In this study we therefore aimed to assess the level of psychological distress currently experienced by a defined group of breast cancer patients in our breast cancer centre, compared to distress levels pre-COVID-19 pandemic."
Near fatal stent thrombosis in an aneurysmatic RCX as first manifestation of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) without thrombocytopenia,Thrombosis resulting from heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) occurs in about 2% of patients without a significant decrease in platelet counts. We report on such a near fatal thrombotic event caused by coronary intervention.
Pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic: an exploration of patients’ lived experiences,Infectious outbreaks are known to cause fear and panic. Exploration of pregnant individuals’ psychosocial condition using a qualitative lens during an infectious outbreak is limited. In this study we explore pregnant individuals’ lived experiences as well as their psychological and behavioural responses during COVID-19 with the goal of providing useful strategies from the patient’s perspective to enable health care providers to help pregnant patients navigate this and future pandemics.
Neuronavigated Magnetic Stimulation combined with cognitive training for Alzheimer’s patients: an EEG graph study,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in elderly subjects. Recent studies verified the effects of cognitive training combined with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS-COG) in AD patients. Here, we analyzed neuropsychological and neurophysiological data, derived from electroencephalography (EEG), to evaluate the effects of a 6-week protocol of rTMS-COG in 72 AD. We designed a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial to evaluate efficacy of rTMS on 6 brain regions obtained by an individual MRI combined with COG related to brain areas to stimulate (i.e., syntax and grammar tasks, comprehension of lexical meaning and categorization tasks, action naming, object naming, spatial memory, spatial attention). Patients underwent neuropsychological and EEG examination before (T0), after treatment (T1), and after 40 weeks (T2), to evaluate the effects of rehabilitation therapy. “Small World” (SW) graph approach was introduced allowing us to model the architecture of brain connectivity in order to correlate it with cognitive improvements. We found that following 6 weeks of intensive daily treatment the immediate results showed an improvement in cognitive scales among AD patients. SW present no differences before and after the treatment, whereas a crucial SW modulation emerges at 40-week follow-up, emphasizing the importance of rTMS-COG rehabilitation treatment for AD. Additional results demonstrated that the delta and alpha1 SW seem to be diagnostic biomarkers of AD, whereas alpha2 SW might represent a prognostic biomarker of cognitive recovery. Derived EEG parameters can be awarded the role of diagnostic and predictive biomarkers of AD progression, and rTMS-COG can be regarded as a potentially useful treatment for AD."
Synthesis and NMR cryoporometry of LaF3 nanoparticles with closed pores filled by D2O,"The series of LaF3 nanoparticles with closed pores filled with water H2O and heavy water D2O are synthesized by the hydrothermal treatment in autoclave at 140 °C, 160 °C, and 180 °C for 24 h. The samples are characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) cryoporometry techniques. According to particle size distribution, the mean diameter of synthesized particles ranges from 31 to 45 nm. The pore sizes for H2O and D2O inside nanoparticles are determined by NMR cryoporometry and TEM methods. The method for the synthesis of nanoparticles with closed pores filled with heavy water is proposed."
Local atomic and electronic structure of Pt-Os nanoplates and nanofibers derived from the single-source precursor (NH4)2[Pt0.5Os0.5Cl6],"Nowadays, Pt-Os binary systems are mainly considered as catalysts and electrocatalysts, but the role of Os in these processes is still poorly understood. The electronic structure of Pt-Os nanosystems remains a few studied as well. Using bimetallic (NH4)2[Pt0.5Os0.5Cl6] as a single-source precursor for preparing Pt-Os nanoalloy through the thermal decomposition in hydrogen and inert atmospheres, the relation of morphology, atomic ordering, and electronic structure of Pt-Os nanoalloy was examined by in situ Quick XAFS, XPS, PXRD, SEM, and HRTEM techniques. Being the only variable parameter, the decomposition atmosphere was found to govern the morphology of the Pt-Os nanoalloy and change the atomic ordering (alloying extent), which involves a change in the electronic structure. In a hydrogen atmosphere, the nanofibers (NFs) (ø ~ 5–6 nm) with the atomic ordering Oscore&Pt-richshell were observed to form; in a nitrogen atmosphere, thin nanoplates (NPLs) (~ 12 nm) with the atomic architecture Os-richcore&Pt-richshell were found out. The depletion in the Os 5d5/2 and Pt 5d5/2,3/2 states was revealed for Pt-Os nanoalloys. This unusual result disagrees with the known d-band theory and indicates that there is a gain of non-d conduction electron counts at one or both sites. Mixed conductivity may exist in such Pt-Os nanoalloy that may be responsible for a manifestation of new physical properties of this binary system ."
Het effect van of-vragen tijdens telefonische triage,"Tijdens telefonische triage op de huisartsenpost maken triagisten gebruik van de Nederlandse Triage Standaard. Deze beslishulp beïnvloedt de interactie tussen triagisten en patiënten, en bevordert het gebruik van meerkeuze of-vragen (bijvoorbeeld ‘Is het een stekende of beklemmende pijn op de borst?’). Onze conversatieanalyse toont aan dat interactionele problemen kunnen ontstaan bij of-vragen wanneer die inadequaat zijn vormgegeven en wanneer de patiënt niet duidelijk is over zijn klachten. Inzicht in de ongewenste gevolgen van of-vragen is essentieel voor het verbeteren van de telefonische triage."

"Hydrocarbon generation history in the Chagan Depression, Inner Mongolia, northern China: constraints of hydrocarbon generation kinetics and thermal history","The Chagan Depression is an important oil producing area in the Yingen-Ejinaqi Basin, northern China. The organic matter of the Early Cretaceous Bayingebi 2 member is mainly type II kerogen, and is the main source rock in this depression. However, the study of the hydrocarbon generation history of the Bayingebi 2 member is limited due to the lack of the hydrocarbon generation kinetic parameters. A source rock sample with type II kerogen of the Bayingebi 2 member was selected to for a gold tube-autoclave pyrolysis experiment, and the hydrocarbon generation kinetic parameters were obtained. Then, the hydrocarbon generation history of a typical well was reconstructed using the BasinMod 1D based on the thermal history of the Chagan Depression. The results show that the activation energy of generated gas is between 49 and 66 kcal/mol, with a frequency factor of 9.43 × 1011 s−1. The activation energy of oil is between 44 and 53 kcal/mol, with a frequency factor of 5.17 × 1012 s−1. The hydrocarbon generation potential of type II kerogen in the Chagan Depression is 273.7 mg/g TOC. The source rocks of the typical well have gone through two stages of hydrocarbon generation during the Suhongtu 1 member and Yingen Formation deposition. The maximum mass of generated oil and gas are 312 and 105 kg/m2 rock, respectively. This work provides important parameters for re-evaluating the hydrocarbon resources of the Chagan Depression."
Farnesol and tyrosol: novel inducers for microbial production of carotenoids and prodigiosin,"This study was performed to elucidate the effects of two fungal quorum sensing molecules (tyrosol and farnesol) on carotenoid synthesis in the yeast Rhodotorula glutinis and prodigioin synthesis in the bacterium Serratia marcencens. Farnesol or tyrosol was directly added to the flask cultures at the beginning (immediately after inoculation with the preculture) of day 1 or the beginning (49th h) of day 3. The results demonstrated that tyrosol supplementation increased the synthesis of carotenoids but farnesol supplementation increased the synthesis of prodigiosin. It was found that adding farnesol or tyrosol into the culture on day 3 compared to day 1 caused more increments in pigment synthesis. The maximum increase (fivefold) in the synthesis of prodigiosin was achieved with 200 μL/L farnesol supplementation, whereas the maximum increase (2.13 fold) in the synthesis of carotenoids was achieved with 4 mg/L tyrosol supplementation. This is the first report about the effects of fungal quorum sensing molecules (farnesol and tyrosol) on the synthesis of carotenoids and prodigiosin in microorganisms. Due to non-human toxicity and low price and of farnesol and tyrosol, these molecules can be used as novel inducers for large-scale production of microbial pigments."
Oscillatory Loomis—Whitney and Projections of Sublevel Sets,"We consider an oscillatory integral operator with Loomis—Whitney multilinear form. The phase is real analytic in a neighborhood of the origin in ℝd and satisfies a nondegeneracy condition related to its Newton polyhedron. Maximal decay is obtained for this operator in certain cases, depending on the Newton polyhedron of the phase and the given Lebesgue exponents. Our estimates imply volumes of sublevel sets of such real analytic functions are small relative to the product of areas of projections onto coordinate hyperplanes."
Seminorms for multiple averages along polynomials and applications to joint ergodicity,"Exploiting the recent work of Tao and Ziegler on the concatenation theorem on factors, we find explicit characteristic factors for multiple averages along polynomials on systems with commuting transformations, and use them to study criteria of joint ergodicity for sequences of the form \((T_{1}^{p_{1,j}(n)}\cdots T_{d}^{p_{d,j}(n)})_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\), 1 ≤ j ≤ k, where T1, …, Td are commuting measure preserving transformations on a probability measure space and pi, j are integer polynomials. To be more precise, we provide a sufficient condition for such sequences to be jointly ergodic, giving also a characterization for sequences of the form \((T_{i}^{p(n)})_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\), 1 ≤ i ≤ d to be jointly ergodic, answering a question due to Bergelson."
Cauchy singular integral operator with parameters in Log-Hölder spaces,"This paper is motivated by a claim in the classical textbook of Muskhelishvili concerning the Cauchy singular integral operator S on Hölder functions with parameters. To the contrary of the claim, a counter example was constructed by Tumanov which shows that S with parameters fails to maintain the same Hölder regularity with respect to the parameters. In view of the example, the behavior of the Cauchy singular integral operator with parameters between a type of Log-Hölder spaces is investigated to obtain the sharp norm estimates. At the end of the paper, we discuss its application to the \(\bar{\partial}\) problem on product domains."
Stationary fully nonlinear mean-field games,"In this paper we examine fully nonlinear mean-field games associated with a minimization problem. The variational setting is driven by a functional depending on its argument through its Hessian matrix. We work under fairly natural conditions and establish improved (sharp) regularity for the solutions in Sobolev spaces. Then, we prove the existence of minimizers for the variational problem and the existence of solutions to the mean-field games system. We also investigate a unidimensional example and unveil new information on the explicit solutions. Our findings can be generalized to a larger class of operators, yielding information on a broader range of examples."
Coorbit spaces associated to integrably admissible dilation groups,"This paper considers coorbit spaces parametrized by mixed, weighted Lebesgue spaces with respect to the quasi-regular representation of the semi-direct product of Euclidean space and a suitable matrix dilation group. The class of dilation groups that we allow, the so-called integrably admissible dilation groups, contains the matrix groups yielding an irreducible, square-integrable quasi-regular representation as a proper subclass. The obtained scale of coorbit spaces extends therefore the well-studied wavelet coorbit spaces associated to discrete series representations. We show that for any integrably admissible dilation group there exists a convienent space of smooth, admissible analyzing vectors that can be used to define a consistent coorbit space possessing all the essential properties that are known to hold in the setting of discrete series representations. In particular, the obtained coorbit spaces can be realized as Besov-type decomposition spaces by means of a Littlewood—Paley-type characterization. The classes of anisotropic Besov spaces associated to expansive matrices are shown to coincide precisely with the coorbit spaces induced by the integrably admissible one-parameter groups."
"Molluscan diversity of coastal Karnataka, India and role of physicochemical parameters on their diversity","The intertidal zone is unique in terms of its ecological conditions and faunal assemblages. Molluscs form a key link in the food chain and have a high socioeconomic value for coastal fisheries. Intertidal habitats of Karnataka are modified by anthropogenic disturbances which threaten the animals living there including molluscs. The present study is designed to know the diversity of molluscs of Karnataka coast, India and to understand the factors influencing variations in molluscan diversity. Thirteen intertidal habitats of coastal Karnataka were selected for the study of which six sites were visited on monthly basis from February 2017 to January 2018. Molluscan shells were collected from these sites using quadrates of 0.25m2 from fixed intervals. The other sites were visited once during the study and molluscs were collected using quadrates and by handpicking. Molluscs were brought to the laboratory, preserved in 70% alcohol, and identified using the standard identification keys. Abiotic parameters such as air temperature, water temperature, wave frequency were noted in the field. Environmental variable such as precipitation was studied. Physico-chemical parameters of water (salinity, electrical conductivity, pH of water) were analysed using standard methods. A total of 36 species of molluscs were recorded from the intertidal habitats of coastal Karnataka. It includes 21 species of gastropods and 15 species of bivalves. Bullia melanoides, Saccostrea cucullata and Echinolittorina leucostica were found throughout the study. Abranda myeformis, Mactra luzonica, Sunetta sp, Turricula tornata fulminata were the rare shells found on the beaches of coastal Karnataka. The abundance of molluscs was observed post-monsoon in all the sites. Species richness of molluscs was more in post-monsoon in all the intertidal areas except beaches of Kaup and Kota-Padukere. Shannon-Weiner index and Simpsons index were more in post-monsoon in the beaches of Someshwar, Panambur, Sasihithlu, and Gangolli whereas diversity indices were highest in intertidal areas of Kaup and Kota-Padukere in premonsoon. Kruskal–Wallis test showed the significant differences between abundance (P = 0.001) and species richness (P = 0.002) of molluscs with the seasons. During the study salinity, electrical conductivity, and pH of water ranged between 21.7–33.66ppt, 41.42–57.90 mS/m, and 7.36–8.47 respectively. Average values of air temperature, water temperature, and wave frequency varied between 26.500C–30.250C, 27.750C–30.250C, and 6–9 between the seasons. However, no significant correlation was found between these parameters and species diversity. The number of molluscs was more when the wave frequency was between 6–7. A significant negative correlation of wave frequency with molluscan abundance was observed which shows that reduced wave-action increases the molluscan diversity. A significant correlation between the electrical conductivity of water with species richness indicates that this is the important physico-chemical parameter responsible for the distribution of molluscan species on the coast. Wave frequency and electrical conductivity are the parameters are responsible for molluscan diversity in the intertidal zones. Thus the littoral zones of the Karnataka coast provide suitable habitats for molluscs."
Nonhomogeneous quasilinear elliptic problems: linear and sublinear cases,"We are concerned with a class of second order quasilinear elliptic equations driven by a nonhomogeneous differential operator introduced by C.A. Stuart [22] and whose study is motivated by models in Nonlinear Optics. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence of at least one or two non-negative solutions. Our analysis considers the cases when the reaction has either a sublinear or a linear growth. In the sublinear case, we also prove a nonexistence property. The proofs combine energy estimates and variational methods."
Impact of a School-Based Multicomponent Positive Psychology Intervention on Adolescents’ Time Attitudes: A Latent Transition Analysis,"Time attitudes, which refer to positive and negative feelings towards the past, present, and future, are a salient phenomenon in the developmental stage of adolescence and have been related to better well-being. Positive feelings towards time can be promoted in the school setting through empirically validated positive psychology interventions. However, the extent to which these interventions impact the time attitudes of adolescents remains unknown. The current study investigated the influence of a multicomponent positive psychology intervention on adolescents’ transitions between time attitude profiles and how these transitions are related to their emotional, social, and psychological well-being. Participants consisted of 220 (M = 14.98; 47.3% female) adolescents from two Spanish high schools who participated in the six-week Get to Know Me+ program. Adolescents’ time attitudes and well-being were measured via the Adolescents and Adult Time Inventory–Time Attitudes and the Mental Health Continuum–Short Form, respectively, at pre- and postintervention. Participants were clustered in different profiles through a latent profile analysis, and the transitions were analyzed using a latent transition analysis. Five profiles were identified (negative, present/future negative, past negative, optimistic, and positive), and results indicated that adolescents who participated in the intervention were more likely to transition to positive profiles (optimistic and positive) and generally reported higher well-being, especially those in the negative, present/future negative, and optimistic profiles. Preliminary evidence showed that school-based multicomponent positive psychology interventions can have a positive impact on adolescents’ feelings towards time and well-being."
"Biologic TNF-α inhibitors reduce microgliosis, neuronal loss, and tau phosphorylation in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy","Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) plays a central role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, making biologic TNF-α inhibitors (TNFIs), including etanercept, viable therapeutics for AD. The protective effects of biologic TNFIs on AD hallmark pathology (Aβ deposition and tau pathology) have been demonstrated. However, the effects of biologic TNFIs on Aβ-independent tau pathology have not been reported. Existing biologic TNFIs do not cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB), therefore we engineered a BBB-penetrating biologic TNFI by fusing the extracellular domain of the type-II human TNF-α receptor (TNFR) to a transferrin receptor antibody (TfRMAb) that ferries the TNFR into the brain via receptor-mediated transcytosis. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of TfRMAb-TNFR (BBB-penetrating TNFI) and etanercept (non-BBB-penetrating TNFI) in the PS19 transgenic mouse model of tauopathy."

Recent Advances in Nature-Inspired Solutions for Ground Engineering (NiSE),"The ground is a natural grand system; it is composed of myriad constituents that aggregate to form several geologic and biogenic systems. These systems operate independently and interplay harmoniously via important networked structures over multiple spatial and temporal scales. This paper presents arguments and derivations couched by the authors, to first give a better understanding of these intertwined networked structures, and then to give an insight of why and how these can be imitated to develop a new generation of nature-symbiotic ground engineering techniques. The paper draws on numerous recent advances made by the authors, and others, in imitating forms (e.g. synthetic fibres that imitate plant roots), materials (e.g. living composite materials, or living soil that imitate fungi and microbes), generative processes (e.g. managed decomposition of construction rubble to mimic weathering of aragonites to calcites), and functions (e.g. recreating the self-healing, self-producing, and self-forming capacity of natural systems). Advances are reported in three categories of Materials, Models, and Methods (3Ms). A novel value-based appraisal tool is also presented, providing a means to vet the effectiveness of 3Ms as standalone units or in combinations."
Estimating upper-extremity function from kinematics in stroke patients following goal-oriented computer-based training,"After a stroke, a wide range of deficits can occur with varying onset latencies. As a result, assessing impairment and recovery are enormous challenges in neurorehabilitation. Although several clinical scales are generally accepted, they are time-consuming, show high inter-rater variability, have low ecological validity, and are vulnerable to biases introduced by compensatory movements and action modifications. Alternative methods need to be developed for efficient and objective assessment. In this study, we explore the potential of computer-based body tracking systems and classification tools to estimate the motor impairment of the more affected arm in stroke patients."
Farnesol and tyrosol: novel inducers for microbial production of carotenoids and prodigiosin,"This study was performed to elucidate the effects of two fungal quorum sensing molecules (tyrosol and farnesol) on carotenoid synthesis in the yeast Rhodotorula glutinis and prodigioin synthesis in the bacterium Serratia marcencens. Farnesol or tyrosol was directly added to the flask cultures at the beginning (immediately after inoculation with the preculture) of day 1 or the beginning (49th h) of day 3. The results demonstrated that tyrosol supplementation increased the synthesis of carotenoids but farnesol supplementation increased the synthesis of prodigiosin. It was found that adding farnesol or tyrosol into the culture on day 3 compared to day 1 caused more increments in pigment synthesis. The maximum increase (fivefold) in the synthesis of prodigiosin was achieved with 200 μL/L farnesol supplementation, whereas the maximum increase (2.13 fold) in the synthesis of carotenoids was achieved with 4 mg/L tyrosol supplementation. This is the first report about the effects of fungal quorum sensing molecules (farnesol and tyrosol) on the synthesis of carotenoids and prodigiosin in microorganisms. Due to non-human toxicity and low price and of farnesol and tyrosol, these molecules can be used as novel inducers for large-scale production of microbial pigments."
Anal endosonographic assessment of the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of obstetric anal sphincter injury,Obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) are a common cause of maternal morbidity with an overall incidence in the UK of 2.9% (range 0–8%).

This study aims to assess the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of OASIS using endoanal ultrasound (EAUS) and the correlation between confirmed injury and change to anorectal physiology squeeze pressure and the incidence of bowel symptoms.
Het effect van of-vragen tijdens telefonische triage,"Tijdens telefonische triage op de huisartsenpost maken triagisten gebruik van de Nederlandse Triage Standaard. Deze beslishulp beïnvloedt de interactie tussen triagisten en patiënten, en bevordert het gebruik van meerkeuze of-vragen (bijvoorbeeld ‘Is het een stekende of beklemmende pijn op de borst?’). Onze conversatieanalyse toont aan dat interactionele problemen kunnen ontstaan bij of-vragen wanneer die inadequaat zijn vormgegeven en wanneer de patiënt niet duidelijk is over zijn klachten. Inzicht in de ongewenste gevolgen van of-vragen is essentieel voor het verbeteren van de telefonische triage."

"Hydrocarbon generation history in the Chagan Depression, Inner Mongolia, northern China: constraints of hydrocarbon generation kinetics and thermal history","The Chagan Depression is an important oil producing area in the Yingen-Ejinaqi Basin, northern China. The organic matter of the Early Cretaceous Bayingebi 2 member is mainly type II kerogen, and is the main source rock in this depression. However, the study of the hydrocarbon generation history of the Bayingebi 2 member is limited due to the lack of the hydrocarbon generation kinetic parameters. A source rock sample with type II kerogen of the Bayingebi 2 member was selected to for a gold tube-autoclave pyrolysis experiment, and the hydrocarbon generation kinetic parameters were obtained. Then, the hydrocarbon generation history of a typical well was reconstructed using the BasinMod 1D based on the thermal history of the Chagan Depression. The results show that the activation energy of generated gas is between 49 and 66 kcal/mol, with a frequency factor of 9.43 × 1011 s−1. The activation energy of oil is between 44 and 53 kcal/mol, with a frequency factor of 5.17 × 1012 s−1. The hydrocarbon generation potential of type II kerogen in the Chagan Depression is 273.7 mg/g TOC. The source rocks of the typical well have gone through two stages of hydrocarbon generation during the Suhongtu 1 member and Yingen Formation deposition. The maximum mass of generated oil and gas are 312 and 105 kg/m2 rock, respectively. This work provides important parameters for re-evaluating the hydrocarbon resources of the Chagan Depression."
Progress and opportunities in backward angle (u-channel) physics,"Backward angle (u-channel) scattering provides complementary information for studies of hadron spectroscopy and structure, but has been less comprehensively studied than the corresponding forward angle case. As a result, the physics of u-channel scattering poses a range of new experimental and theoretical opportunities and questions. We summarize recent progress in measuring and understanding high energy reactions with baryon charge exchange in the u-channel, as discussed in the first Backward angle (u-channel) Physics Workshop. In particular, we discuss backward angle measurements and their theoretical description via both hadronic models and the collinear factorization approach, and discuss planned future measurements of u-channel physics. Finally, we propose outstanding questions and challenges for u-channel physics."
Kerr–Schild–Kundt metrics in generic gravity theories with modified Horndeski couplings,"The Kerr–Schild–Kundt (KSK) metrics are known to be one of the universal metrics in general relativity, which means that they solve the vacuum field equations of any gravity theory constructed from the curvature tensor and its higher-order covariant derivatives. There is yet no complete proof that these metrics are universal in the presence of matter fields such as electromagnetic and/or scalar fields. In order to get some insight into what happens when we extend the “universality theorem” to the case in which the electromagnetic field is present, as a first step, we study the KSK class of metrics in the context of modified Horndeski theories with Maxwell’s field. We obtain exact solutions of these theories representing the pp-waves and AdS-plane waves in arbitrary D dimensions."
New ways of treatment of fractures of the humeral shaft: does the combination of intramedullary nail osteosynthesis and cerclage improve the healing process?,"The humeral shaft fracture is a rare fracture of the long bones with various treatment options. Dreaded complications such as lesions of the radial nerve or non-unions make the decision for what kind of therapy option more difficult. Biomechanically the upper arm is mostly exposed to rotational forces, which affect intramedullary nail osteosynthesis. Additive cerclage may compensate for these in spiral fractures. The aim of this study is to investigate what effect a combination of intramedullary nail osteosynthesis and limited invasive cerclage has on the rate of healing. In addition, this study addresses the question if complications arise as a result of cerclage."
"Molluscan diversity of coastal Karnataka, India and role of physicochemical parameters on their diversity","The intertidal zone is unique in terms of its ecological conditions and faunal assemblages. Molluscs form a key link in the food chain and have a high socioeconomic value for coastal fisheries. Intertidal habitats of Karnataka are modified by anthropogenic disturbances which threaten the animals living there including molluscs. The present study is designed to know the diversity of molluscs of Karnataka coast, India and to understand the factors influencing variations in molluscan diversity. Thirteen intertidal habitats of coastal Karnataka were selected for the study of which six sites were visited on monthly basis from February 2017 to January 2018. Molluscan shells were collected from these sites using quadrates of 0.25m2 from fixed intervals. The other sites were visited once during the study and molluscs were collected using quadrates and by handpicking. Molluscs were brought to the laboratory, preserved in 70% alcohol, and identified using the standard identification keys. Abiotic parameters such as air temperature, water temperature, wave frequency were noted in the field. Environmental variable such as precipitation was studied. Physico-chemical parameters of water (salinity, electrical conductivity, pH of water) were analysed using standard methods. A total of 36 species of molluscs were recorded from the intertidal habitats of coastal Karnataka. It includes 21 species of gastropods and 15 species of bivalves. Bullia melanoides, Saccostrea cucullata and Echinolittorina leucostica were found throughout the study. Abranda myeformis, Mactra luzonica, Sunetta sp, Turricula tornata fulminata were the rare shells found on the beaches of coastal Karnataka. The abundance of molluscs was observed post-monsoon in all the sites. Species richness of molluscs was more in post-monsoon in all the intertidal areas except beaches of Kaup and Kota-Padukere. Shannon-Weiner index and Simpsons index were more in post-monsoon in the beaches of Someshwar, Panambur, Sasihithlu, and Gangolli whereas diversity indices were highest in intertidal areas of Kaup and Kota-Padukere in premonsoon. Kruskal–Wallis test showed the significant differences between abundance (P = 0.001) and species richness (P = 0.002) of molluscs with the seasons. During the study salinity, electrical conductivity, and pH of water ranged between 21.7–33.66ppt, 41.42–57.90 mS/m, and 7.36–8.47 respectively. Average values of air temperature, water temperature, and wave frequency varied between 26.500C–30.250C, 27.750C–30.250C, and 6–9 between the seasons. However, no significant correlation was found between these parameters and species diversity. The number of molluscs was more when the wave frequency was between 6–7. A significant negative correlation of wave frequency with molluscan abundance was observed which shows that reduced wave-action increases the molluscan diversity. A significant correlation between the electrical conductivity of water with species richness indicates that this is the important physico-chemical parameter responsible for the distribution of molluscan species on the coast. Wave frequency and electrical conductivity are the parameters are responsible for molluscan diversity in the intertidal zones. Thus the littoral zones of the Karnataka coast provide suitable habitats for molluscs."

Oscillatory Loomis—Whitney and Projections of Sublevel Sets,"We consider an oscillatory integral operator with Loomis—Whitney multilinear form. The phase is real analytic in a neighborhood of the origin in ℝd and satisfies a nondegeneracy condition related to its Newton polyhedron.

Our estimates imply volumes of sublevel sets of such real analytic functions are small relative to the product of areas of projections onto coordinate hyperplanes."
Seminorms for multiple averages along polynomials and applications to joint ergodicity,"Exploiting the recent work of Tao and Ziegler on the concatenation theorem on factors, we find explicit characteristic factors for multiple averages along polynomials on systems with commuting transformations, and use them to study criteria of joint ergodicity for sequences of the form \((T_{1}^{p_{1,j}(n)}\cdots T_{d}^{p_{d,j}(n)})_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\), 1 ≤ j ≤ k, where T1, …, Td are commuting measure preserving transformations on a probability measure space and pi, j are integer polynomials. To be more precise, we provide a sufficient condition for such sequences to be jointly ergodic, giving also a characterization for sequences of the form \((T_{i}^{p(n)})_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\), 1 ≤ i ≤ d to be jointly ergodic, answering a question due to Bergelson."
Cauchy singular integral operator with parameters in Log-Hölder spaces,"This paper is motivated by a claim in the classical textbook of Muskhelishvili concerning the Cauchy singular integral operator S on Hölder functions with parameters. To the contrary of the claim, a counter example was constructed by Tumanov which shows that S with parameters fails to maintain the same Hölder regularity with respect to the parameters. In view of the example, the behavior of the Cauchy singular integral operator with parameters between a type of Log-Hölder spaces is investigated to obtain the sharp norm estimates. At the end of the paper, we discuss its application to the \(\bar{\partial}\) problem on product domains."
Stationary fully nonlinear mean-field games,"In this paper we examine fully nonlinear mean-field games associated with a minimization problem. The variational setting is driven by a functional depending on its argument through its Hessian matrix. We work under fairly natural conditions and establish improved (sharp) regularity for the solutions in Sobolev spaces. Then, we prove the existence of minimizers for the variational problem and the existence of solutions to the mean-field games system. We also investigate a unidimensional example and unveil new information on the explicit solutions. Our findings can be generalized to a larger class of operators, yielding information on a broader range of examples."
Coorbit spaces associated to integrably admissible dilation groups,"This paper considers coorbit spaces parametrized by mixed, weighted Lebesgue spaces with respect to the quasi-regular representation of the semi-direct product of Euclidean space and a suitable matrix dilation group. The class of dilation groups that we allow, the so-called integrably admissible dilation groups, contains the matrix groups yielding an irreducible, square-integrable quasi-regular representation as a proper subclass. The obtained scale of coorbit spaces extends therefore the well-studied wavelet coorbit spaces associated to discrete series representations. We show that for any integrably admissible dilation group there exists a convienent space of smooth, admissible analyzing vectors that can be used to define a consistent coorbit space possessing all the essential properties that are known to hold in the setting of discrete series representations. In particular, the obtained coorbit spaces can be realized as Besov-type decomposition spaces by means of a Littlewood—Paley-type characterization. The classes of anisotropic Besov spaces associated to expansive matrices are shown to coincide precisely with the coorbit spaces induced by the integrably admissible one-parameter groups."

"Cooling processes of a dolerite sill inferred from the variations in plagioclase aspect ratio, Atsumi District, north-eastern Japan","The upper Kayaoka sheet in the Atsumi area, Northeast Japan, has an alkaline-basaltic composition. The modal olivine and Ni enrichment in the lower part of the sheet indicates the accumulation of early formed olivine crystals. Overall, the average aspect ratio of plagioclase increases from the central part of the sheet toward both the top and bottom margins. The average aspect ratios of plagioclase and calculated crystallisation times at each height of the sheet, except for the lowermost margin, are roughly plotted near the regression line drawn based on those from many sills in previous research. However, we observed that the average aspect ratios of plagioclase in some horizons of the central part of the sheet exhibit an offset from the regression line. The olivine analcite dolerite in the central part of the sheet is rich in zeolite amygdules and glassy mesostasis with a quench texture. These observations suggest that the cooling rate in the central part of the sheet was faster compared with assuming conductive cooling only. A plausible mechanism for the rapid cooling at the centre of the sheet is heat transport by the convection of seawater that has infiltrated the columnar joint."
Optimisation design and verification of the acoustic environment for multimedia classrooms in universities based on simulation,"The acoustic environment of the classroom is one of the most important factors influencing the teaching and learning effects of the teacher and students. It is critical to ensure good speech intelligibility in classrooms. However, due to some factors, it may not be easy to achieve an ideal classroom acoustic environment, especially in large-scale multimedia classrooms. In a real renovation project of 39 multimedia classrooms in a university, seven typical rooms were selected, and the acoustic environment optimisation design and verification for these multimedia classrooms were performed based on simulation. First, the acoustic and sound reinforcement design schemes were determined based on the room acoustics software ODEON. Next, the effects of the optimisation design were analysed, and the simulated and measured results were compared; the accuracy of using the reduced sound absorption coefficients, which were determined empirically, was also examined. Finally, the recommended reverberation times (RTs) in multimedia classrooms corresponding to speech intelligibility were discussed, the effectiveness of the speech transmission index (STI) as a primary parameter for classroom acoustic environment control was considered, and the acoustic environment under the unoccupied and occupied statuses was compared. The results revealed that although there are many factors influencing the effect of classroom acoustic environment control, an adequate result can be expected on applying the appropriate method. Considering both the acoustic design and visual requirements also makes the classroom likely to have a good visual effect in addition to having a good listening environment."
External field-strengthened Ostwald nanowelding,"The accomplishment of nanowelding typically requires the input of high energy, possibly causing appreciable damages to the brittle nanomaterial. Herein, we report an external field (EF, i.e., light, direct current (DC), and alternating current (AC))-strengthened Ostwald nanowelding (ONW) strategy to enable low-temperature nanowelding of Au nanoparticles (NPs) with nanoscale spacing in solution and propose an electron localization mechanism to understand it. We reveal that the EF-derived local electrons not only greatly strengthen the dissolution of surface atoms and the reduction of Au3+ ions dissolved, but also confine (together with ordered water molecules) the transport of Au3+ ions within the nanogap. Consequently, the electrochemical Ostwald ripening (OR) process of the Au NPs is actively strengthened, which, along with the local electron-strengthened surface atom diffusion (as a result of the strong electrostatic repulsion created), enables feasible ONW for solution processing of interdigital electrodes (IDEs) from Au NPs and high-performance transparent conductor (TC) from Ag nanowires (NWs). Our low-temperature nanowelding strategy offers an efficient interconnection technique for the processing of functional nanodevices from individual nanomaterials."
Estimation of rock Fe content based on hyperspectral indices,"Information on the Fe content of bare rocks is needed for implementing geochemical processes and identifying mines. However, the influence of Fe content on the spectra of bare rocks has not been thoroughly analyzed in previous studies. The Saur Mountain region within the Hoboksar of the Russell Hill depression was selected as the study area. Specifically, we analyzed six hyperspectral indices related to rock Fe content based on laboratory measurements (Dataset I) and field measurements (Dataset II). In situ field measurements were acquired to verify the laboratory measurements. Fe content of the rock samples collected from different fresh and weathered rock surfaces were divided into six levels to reveal the spatial distributions of Fe content of these samples. In addition, we clearly displayed wavelengths with obvious characteristics by analyzing the spectra of these samples. The results of this work indicated that Fe content estimation models based on the fresh rock surface measurements in the laboratory can be applied to in situ field or satellite-based measurements of Fe content of the weathered rock surfaces. It is not the best way to use only the single wavelengths reflectance at all absorption wavelengths or the depth of these absorption features to estimate Fe content. Based on sample data analysis, the comparison with other indices revealed that the performance of the modified normalized difference index is the best indicator for estimating rock Fe content, with R2 values of 0.45 and 0.40 corresponding to datasets I and II, respectively. Hence, the modified normalized difference index (the wavelengths of 2220, 2290, and 2370 nm) identified in this study could contribute considerably to improve the identification accuracy of rock Fe content in the bare rock areas. The method proposed in this study can obviously provide an efficient solution for large-scale rock Fe content measurements in the field."
"Oral administration of tartrazine (E102) accelerates the incidence and the development of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a) anthracene (DMBA)-induced breast cancer in rats","Despite the considerable advances made in the treatment of cancer, it remains a global threat. Tartrazine (E102) is a synthetic dye widely used in food industries; it has recently been shown to induce oxidative stress (a well known risk factor of cancer) in rat tissues. The present work therefore aimed to assess the impact of a regular consumption of tartrazine on the incidence of breast cancer in rats."
A Determinantal Approach to Post Quantum Analogue of Appell Type Polynomials,"In this paper, we have studied post-quantum analogue of Appell type polynomials ((p, q)-Appell polynomials) from determinantal aspect using the definition of post-quantum analogue of Appell type polynomials from Sadjang (Anal Math 45:583, 2019). Some basic properties for post-quantum analogue of Appell polynomials have been established. Further 2D post-quantum Appell polynomials has been defined and studied from determinantal aspect and some interesting properties of these polynomials using new definition has been presented. In case \(p=1,\) post-quantum analogue of Appell type polynomials reduces to quantum analogue of Appell type polynomials. For \(p=q=1,\) post-quantum analogue of Appell type polynomials reduces to its classical version."

Cameron’s operator in terms of determinants and hypergeometric numbers,"By studying Cameron’s operator in terms of determinants, two kinds of “integer” sequences of incomplete numbers were introduced. One was the sequence of restricted numbers, including s-step Fibonacci sequences. Another was the sequence of associated numbers, including Lamé sequences of higher order. By the classical Trudi’s formula and the inverse relation, more expressions were able to be obtained. These relations and identities can be extended to those of sequence of negative integers or rational numbers. As applications, we consider hypergeometric Bernoulli, Cauchy and Euler numbers with some modifications."
Consent for rapid genomic sequencing for critically ill children: legal and ethical issues,"Although rapid genomic sequencing (RGS) is improving care for critically ill children with rare disease, it also raises important ethical questions that need to be explored as its use becomes more widespread. Two such questions relate to the degree of consent that should be required for RGS to proceed and whether it might ever be appropriate to override parents’ decisions not to allow RGS to be performed in their critically ill child. To explore these questions, we first examine the legal frameworks on securing consent for genomic sequencing and how they apply to the specific context of RGS for critically ill children. We then use a tool from clinical ethics, the Zone of Parental Discretion, to explore two case studies and identify under which circumstances it might be appropriate for parental refusal of RGS to be overridden. We argue that RGS may be a context where, in addition to assessing the complexity of the test offered, it is ethically appropriate to consider an effect on patient outcomes when deciding the degree of consent required. We also suggest that there are some contexts where it may be ethically justified to perform RGS, even when it is actively against the wishes of the parents. More work is needed to examine exactly how ‘time-sensitive’ exceptions to current guidance on consent for genomic sequencing could be formulated and operationalised for RGS for critically ill-children."
Cheeger bounds on spin-two fields,"We consider gravity compactifications whose internal space consists of small bridges connecting larger manifolds, possibly noncompact. We prove that, under rather general assumptions, this leads to a massive spin-two field with very small mass. The argument involves a recently-noticed relation to Bakry-Émery geometry, a version of the so-called Cheeger constant, and the theory of synthetic Ricci lower bounds. The latter technique allows generalizations to non-smooth spaces such as those with D-brane singularities. For AdSd vacua with a bridge admitting an AdSd+1 interpretation, the holographic dual is a CFTd with two CFTd−1 boundaries. The ratio of their degrees of freedom gives the graviton mass, generalizing results obtained by Bachas and Lavdas for d = 4. We also prove new bounds on the higher eigenvalues. These are in agreement with the spin-two swampland conjecture in the regime where the background is scale-separated; in the opposite regime we provide examples where they are in naive tension with it."

Local Bifurcation Analysis of One Parameter in the Greitzer’s Model with a General Compressor Characteristic,"Based on the Greitzer’s reduced model, an analytical study on the instabilities phenomena of the operating point is presented using some basic properties of the nonlinear dynamic system. Moreover, a proposal of a general compressor characteristic curve, that suits the stationary system, is given. The Routh–Hurwitz theorem is applied to determine the stability conditions on the model parameters. An analysis along with a discussion is presented when the compression system goes to the Hopf bifurcation point during surge. For the Hopf bifurcation case, an approximate expression, for the periodic cycle of the system’s solution from the equilibrium point, is obtained and the direction is determined using Lyapunov’s stability theory. A numerical simulation is executed to illustrate the theoretical results."
Modified horseshoe crab peptides target and kill bacteria inside host cells,"Bacteria that occupy an intracellular niche can evade extracellular host immune responses and antimicrobial molecules. In addition to classic intracellular pathogens, other bacteria including uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) can adopt both extracellular and intracellular lifestyles. UPEC intracellular survival and replication complicates treatment, as many therapeutic molecules do not effectively reach all components of the infection cycle. In this study, we explored cell-penetrating antimicrobial peptides from distinct structural classes as alternative molecules for targeting bacteria. We identified two β-hairpin peptides from the horseshoe crab, tachyplesin I and polyphemusin I, with broad antimicrobial activity toward a panel of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in planktonic form. Peptide analogs [I11A]tachyplesin I and [I11S]tachyplesin I maintained activity toward bacteria, but were less toxic to mammalian cells than native tachyplesin I. This important increase in therapeutic window allowed treatment with higher concentrations of [I11A]tachyplesin I and [I11S]tachyplesin I, to significantly reduce intramacrophage survival of UPEC in an in vitro infection model. Mechanistic studies using bacterial cells, model membranes and cell membrane extracts, suggest that tachyplesin I and polyphemusin I peptides kill UPEC by selectively binding and disrupting bacterial cell membranes. Moreover, treatment of UPEC with sublethal peptide concentrations increased zinc toxicity and enhanced innate macrophage antimicrobial pathways. In summary, our combined data show that cell-penetrating peptides are attractive alternatives to traditional small molecule antibiotics for treating UPEC infection, and that optimization of native peptide sequences can deliver effective antimicrobials for targeting bacteria in extracellular and intracellular environments."
Development of a novel and synthetic HematoMiR technology that broadly modulates quiescence of stem cells and enhances HSC expansion,"Hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs) transplantation is the primary therapeutic modality used to treat hematopoietic disorders. It centers on the capability of a small quantity of HSCs to repopulate whole blood lineages. Along with limited availability of suitable donors, the need for sufficient number of donor HSCs is still challenging in clinical relevance. This has been addressed by ex vivo HSC expansion albeit with partial success, and thus development of an alternative strategy that could improve HSC expansion is required. To that end, we aimed to build HematoMiR, an oligo-based technology that broadly targets HSC quiescence factors. Here, we show that HematoMiRs and their combinations targeting over 50 factors involved in HSC quiescence could induce robust ex vivo murine and human HSC expansion. In particular, HematoMiR-5 treatment enhanced cell cycle through down-regulation of negative cell cycle regulators in HSCs. HematoMiR-5 treated HSPCs had reduced DNA damage during the course of ex vivo expansion. Moreover, HematoMiR-5 treatment led to sustained HSC self-renewal ability and a low apoptosis rate. In addition, HematoMiR-5 expanded HSCs demonstrated successful engraftment and repopulation capacity in the recipient animals. Furthermore, combinatorial treatments of HematoMiR-2 and 5 allowed vigorous ex vivo HSC expansion. These findings demonstrate that novel and synthetic HematoMiR technology is feasible for HSC ex vivo expansion through the sequence-dependent modulation of numerous HSC quiescence modulators."
Plasma membrane perforation by GSDME during apoptosis-driven secondary necrosis,"Secondary necrosis has long been perceived as an uncontrolled process resulting in total lysis of the apoptotic cell. Recently, it was shown that progression of apoptosis to secondary necrosis is regulated by Gasdermin E (GSDME), which requires activation by caspase-3. Although the contribution of GSDME in this context has been attributed to its pore-forming capacity, little is known about the kinetics and size characteristics of this. Here we report on the membrane permeabilizing features of GSDME by monitoring the influx and efflux of dextrans of different sizes into/from anti-Fas-treated L929sAhFas cells undergoing apoptosis-driven secondary necrosis. We found that GSDME accelerates cell lysis measured by SYTOX Blue staining but does not affect the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane. Furthermore, loss of GSDME expression clearly hampered the influx of fluorescently labeled dextrans while the efflux happened independently of the presence or absence of GSDME expression. Importantly, both in- and efflux of dextrans were dependent on their molecular weight. Altogether, our results demonstrate that GSDME regulates the passage of compounds together with other plasma membrane destabilizing subroutines."
Protein abundance of the cytokine receptor γc controls the thymic generation of innate-like T cells,"Innate-like T (iT) cells comprise a population of immunoregulatory T cells whose effector function is imposed during their development in the thymus to provide protective immunity prior to antigen encounter. The molecular mechanism that drives the generation of iT cells remains unclear. Here, we report that the cytokine receptor γc plays a previously unappreciated role for thymic iT cells by controlling their cellular abundance, lineage commitment, and subset differentiation. As such, γc overexpression on thymocytes dramatically altered iT cell generation in the thymus, as it skewed the subset composition of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells and promoted the generation of IFNγ-producing innate CD8 T cells. Mechanistically, we found that the γc-STAT6 axis drives the differentiation of IL-4-producing iNKT cells, which in turn induced the generation of innate CD8 T cells. Collectively, these results reveal a cytokine-driven circuity of thymic iT cell differentiation that is controlled by the abundance of γc proteins."
An exact solution for the semi-stationary compressible Stokes problem,"In this note, we present an exact solution for the semi-stationary compressible Stokes problem in \({\mathbb {R}}^{N}\). In the case of radial symmetry, an exact solution with velocity of the form \(c(t)r^{s}\) is obtained for \(s=\frac{1-N\gamma +\gamma }{\gamma +1}\), where \(\gamma >1\) is the adiabatic index and \(r=|x|\). Some interesting properties of the exact solution are analyzed."
On fraction-dense algebraic frames,We abstract the notion of fraction-density of f-rings (introduced by Anthony Hager and Jorge Martínez) to algebraic frames. We say an algebraic frame with the finite intersection property on compact elements is fraction-dense if each of its polars is a polar of a compact element. This turns out to be a “conservative” extension of the fraction-density property in the sense that a reduced f-ring is fraction-dense precisely when its frame of radical ideals is fraction-dense. We characterize these frames and study properties of some other types of algebraic frames that arise naturally in the characterizations of the fraction-dense ones.
The least left n-trinilpotent congruence on the free trioid,"In the author’s recent paper, the free left (right) n-trinilpotent trioid was constructed. Our aim is to characterize the least left (right) n-trinilpotent congruence on the free trioid."
Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in Coats’ disease: a case report,"Coats’ disease was originally defined as a unilateral idiopathic exudative retinopathy in young males, characterized by abnormal retinal vascular telangiectasia with intraretinal and subretinal lipid exudation. The retinal detachment is usually exudative. Herein, we describe a case of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with detectable retinal break in a patient with Coats’ disease."
Mitigating social-ecological risks from the surge in China’s overseas investment: an Indonesian profile,"Rapid development has become a global priority as countries strive to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Sustainable development is crucial for increasing human well-being in emerging economies while avoiding perverse outcomes on livelihoods, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) promises to help countries reach their national goals for economic growth, trade, and development, but there remain widespread concerns over how this boom in Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) will impact social-ecological systems. Here, we discuss the risks implicit in BRI-related FDI projects to ecosystems and local communities, and how these risks can be mitigated or exacerbated by national governance of BRI projects and national development policies. We frame our discussion around Indonesia, where convoluted governance of some of the largest Chinese FDI projects may reduce accountability, and a recent job creation law brings risks of rapid unsustainable development practices across this biodiversity hotspot."
Histopathologic features and molecular genetic landscape of HER2-amplified endometrial carcinomas,"HER2 is an established therapeutic biomarker in advanced or recurrent endometrial serous carcinoma. Current clinical guidelines recommend HER2 testing exclusively in this endometrial carcinoma (EC) subtype; however, the full spectrum of ECs harboring HER2 amplification remains ill-defined. The present study characterizes the clinicopathologic and molecular features of HER2-amplified ECs across all histologic subtypes. Retrospective analysis of our institutional cohort of 2,042 ECs subjected to targeted clinical massively parallel sequencing identified 77 (3.8%) cases with HER2 amplification, a group comprised of serous (n = 29), endometrioid (low-grade, n = 2, high-grade, n = 1) and clear cell (n = 4) carcinomas, carcinosarcomas (n = 18) and high-grade ECs with ambiguous features (HGEC, n = 23). A co-existing TP53 mutation was identified in 94% (72/77) of HER2-amplified ECs. Other recurrent genetic alterations included amplification of CCNE1 (22%) and ERBB3 (10%), FBXW7 mutations or deletions (13%), and mutations in PIK3CA (40%) and PPP2R1A (13%). The HER2 immunohistochemistry score was 2+ or 3+ for all evaluable cases (n = 61). Apart from carcinosarcomas, which often showed lower HER2 expression, particularly in the sarcomatous component, HER2 immunohistochemical staining pattern and intensity were similar across EC subtypes. Intratumor heterogeneity in HER2 expression was common and correlated with genetic heterogeneity as detected by fluorescence in-situ hybridization. These results demonstrate the frequent co-occurrence of HER2 amplification with TP53 mutation and high-grade histology, rather than being specific to serous carcinoma, per se. Overall, these findings suggest that HER2 targeted therapy may be more broadly applicable to all high-grade EC histotypes and consideration should be given to expanding therapeutic eligibility."
Design of a Z-scheme printable artificial leaf device based on CdS@TiO2/Pt/ITO/WO3@Co3O4 for water splitting,"Hydrogen and oxygen production based on photocatalytic monolithic water splitting is considered to be one of the effective ways to produce sustainable and clean energy. The key challenge in this process is to develop new photocatalysts that can simultaneously produce H2 and O2 at a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1 without the use of any sacrificial agents. In order to solve this problem, highly efficient and ingenious photosystems in nature have been studied intensively. Herein, we prepared printable Z-type composite photocatalysts CdS@TiO2/Pt/ITO/WO3/Co3O4 mimicking biological vegetative leaves in nature and constructed an “artificial leaf” device that completely decomposes water. We use an electron solid penetrating transporter ITO, which can rapidly transfer photogenerated electrons and photogenerated holes and reduce the compound rate of photogenerated carriers. Thus, the efficiency of photocatalytic total water dissolution is enhanced. This photocatalyst was able to produce both H2 and O2 in water with an H2 production rate of 75.93 μmol g−1 h−1 and an O2 production rate of 36.49 μmol g−1 h−1. We designed the oxygen-producing photocatalyst WO3/Co3O4, which produced oxygen at a rate of 159.21 μmol g−1 h−1 6 times higher than that of WO3 alone. Furthermore, the morphology, composition, and microstructures of the photocatalyst were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption–desorption."
"Phase stability, mechanical and optoelectronic properties of lanthanum chromite-based perovskite oxide","The structural, magnetic, electronic, optical and mechanical properties of lanthanum chromite LaCrO3 were investigated in cubic (Pm-3m) and orthorhombic (Pbnm) phases by the first-principles method based on the density functional theory. In this study, the WC-GGA with additional Hubbard potential U and Tran–Blaha-modified Becke–Johnson potential (TB-mBJ) were used. The structure optimization was accomplished for ferromagnetic (FM), A-type (A-AFM), C-type (C-AFM) and G-type (G-AFM). Both O-LaCrO3 and C-LaCrO3 phases were stable in the G-AFM state. The density of states and band structure revealed the existence of a wide band gap calculated with GGA + U and TB-mBJ, these two methods provide the accurate results for the band gap which are in good agreement with experimental values. The dielectric functions and optical proprieties were also calculated such as the absorption coefficient, refractivity index and the energy loss function. The elastic properties such as bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio as well as the anisotropic factors were investigated. It has been shown that O-LaCrO3 and C-LaCrO3 phases were mechanically stable. Finally, the average sound velocity and the Debye temperatures of LaCrO3 were evaluated."
Co-Occurrence of Geriatric Syndromes and Diseases in the General Population: Assessment of the Dimensions of Aging,"The co-occurrence of multiple medical or psychosocial conditions (geriatric syndromes (GS) and age-related diseases) is a growing concern in older people. Given the diversity of these conditions and their complex interactions, our aim was to determine whether they could be structured into synthetic dimensions in order to facilitate the management of multimorbidity."
Activity of convalescent and vaccine serum against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron,"The Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was initially identified in November 2021 in South Africa and Botswana, as well as in a sample from a traveller from South Africa in Hong Kong1,2. Since then, Omicron has been detected globally. This variant appears to be at least as infectious as Delta (B.1.617.2), has already caused superspreader events3, and has outcompeted Delta within weeks in several countries and metropolitan areas. Omicron hosts an unprecedented number of mutations in its spike gene and early reports have provided evidence for extensive immune escape and reduced vaccine effectiveness2,4,5,6. Here we investigated the virus-neutralizing and spike protein-binding activity of sera from convalescent, double mRNA-vaccinated, mRNA-boosted, convalescent double-vaccinated and convalescent boosted individuals against wild-type, Beta (B.1.351) and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 isolates and spike proteins. Neutralizing activity of sera from convalescent and double-vaccinated participants was undetectable or very low against Omicron compared with the wild-type virus, whereas neutralizing activity of sera from individuals who had been exposed to spike three or four times through infection and vaccination was maintained, although at significantly reduced levels. Binding to the receptor-binding and N-terminal domains of the Omicron spike protein was reduced compared with binding to the wild type in convalescent unvaccinated individuals, but was mostly retained in vaccinated individuals."
Reduction in trabecular meshwork stem cell content in donor eyes with primary open angle glaucoma,"We previously identified and characterized human trabecular meshwork stem cells (TMSCs) based on high expression of ABCG2/p75 positivity and high nucleus to cytoplasmic ratio. These TMSCs expressing high ABCG2 and p75 were located to the insert region of the human TM. Additionally, we demonstrated an age-related reduction in the TMSC content which was significantly associated with TM cell loss. In continuation, this study was aimed to determine the TMSC content in glaucomatous donor eyes wherein a drastic reduction in TM cellularity has already been reported. Anterior segments from known glaucomatous (n = 6) and age-matched normal (n = 8) donors were dissected into four quadrants. A minimum of three sections from each quadrant were used for histopathological analysis as well as immunostaining. Analysis of hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections from glaucomatous tissues revealed a decrease in total TM cellularity, thickening of trabecular beams, fusion of trabeculae, absence of patent Schlemm’s canal compared to age-matched controls. In addition, the TM thickness at various positions of the meshwork and the coronal as well as the meridional diameters of the Schlemm’s canal were observed to be significantly reduced in glaucomatous eyes. Further, sections from both the groups were immunostained for universal stem cell marker ABCG2 and neural crest derived stem cell marker p75. The images were acquired using Leica SP8 confocal microscope. Quantification of total TM cellularity based on nuclear counterstain (mean ± SD) using ImageJ identified 69.33 ± 12.77 cells/section in control eyes. In glaucomatous donors, the TM cellularity was found to be reduced significantly to 41.83 ± 9.0 (p = 0.0007). In addition, a reduction in the percentage of TMSCs (cells with high ABCG2 expression and p75 positivity) was evident in glaucomatous donors (0.14 ± 0.17%) compared to age-matched controls (4.73 ± 5.46%) (p = 0.064). Thus, the present study confirmed the significant decline in TM cellularity and a reducing trend in the TMSC content, though this reduction was non-significant in glaucomatous donor eyes. Further studies are essential to elucidate the role of TMSCs in the pathogenesis of primary open angle glaucoma."
Utilization of Carica papaya latex on coating of SPIONs for dye removal and drug delivery,"Latex, a milky substance found in a variety of plants which is a natural source of biologically active compounds. In this study, Latex was collected from raw Carica papaya and was characterized using UV–Vis, FTIR and GC–MS analyses. Super Paramagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs) were synthesized, coated with C. papaya latex (PL-Sp) and characterized using UV–Vis, FT-IR, SEM–EDX, XRD, VSM and Zeta potential analyses. SPIONs and latex coated SPIONs (PL-Sp) were used in batch adsorption study for effective removal of Methylene blue (MB) dye, where (PL-Sp) removed MB dye effectively. Further the PL-Sp was used to produce a nanoconjugate loaded with curcumin and it was characterized using UV–Vis spectrophotometer, FT-IR, SEM–EDX, XRD, VSM and Zeta potential. It showed a sustained drug release pattern and also found to have good antibacterial and anticancer activity."
Application of large-scale grid-connected solar photovoltaic system for voltage stability improvement of weak national grids,"This paper investigates the application of large-scale solar photovoltaic (SPV) system for voltage stability improvement of weak national grids. Large-scale SPV integration has been investigated on the Nigerian power system to enhance voltage stability and as a viable alternative to the aged shunt reactors currently being used in the Nigerian national grid to mitigate overvoltage issues in Northern Nigeria. Two scenarios of increasing SPV penetration level (PL) are investigated in this work, namely, centralized large-scale SPV at the critical bus and dispersed large-scale SPV across the weak buses. The voltage stability of the system is evaluated using the active power margin (APM) also called megawatt margin (MWM) derived from Active Power–Voltage (P–V) analysis, the reactive power margin (RPM) and the associated critical voltage–reactive power ratio (CVQR) index obtained from Reactive Power–Voltage (Q–V) analysis. All simulations are carried out in DIgSILENT PowerFactory software and result analyses done with MATLAB. The results show that with centralized SPV generation for the case study system, the highest bus voltage is able to fall within acceptable limits at 26.29% (1000 MW), while the dispersed SPV achieves this at 21.44% (800 MW). Also, the dispersed SPV scenario provides better voltage stability improvement for the system as indicated by the MWM, RPM and the CVQR index of the system. Therefore, this work provides a baseline insight on the potential application of large-scale SPV in weak grids such as the Nigerian case to address the voltage stability problems in the power system while utilizing the abundant solar resource to meet the increasing energy demand."
The mediating role of resilience in the effects of physical exercise on college students’ negative emotions during the COVID-19 epidemic,"Due to its suddenness and unpredictability, COVID-19 caused strife and effects on public mental health, resulting in a surge of negative emotions. The study explores the relationship between physical exercise and negative emotions in home-based college students during the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the mediating role of resilience, thus providing a new basis for understanding the role of physical exercise in improving negative emotions in college students; A total of 1214 college students were investigated with the Physical Exercise Questionnaire, Negative Emotion Scale and Resilience Scale; Both physical exercise and resilience were significantly negatively correlated with negative emotions in college students (r = − 0.25, − 0.33, P < 0.001), and there was a significant positive correlation between physical exercise and resilience (r = 0.47, P < 0.001). Physical exercise had a direct effect on the negative emotions of college students (β = − 0.14, P < 0.001). Resilience had a partial mediating effect between physical exercise and the negative emotions of the college students, with a mediating effect value of 0.14 and a mediating effect contribution rate of 50.00%; The study found that physical exercise not only directly affected the negative emotions of college students but also improved their resilience by slowing down their negative emotions and promoting their mental health."
Performance evaluation of ozonation for removal of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and genes from hospital wastewater,"The performance of ozonation for the removal of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) using Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa carrying ARGs from hospital wastewaters was evaluated in this study. Bacterial inactivation was determined using plate count methods and real time PCR for ARG damage (Sul1, blatem, blactx, blavim and qnrS). The reduction rate of bacterial cells and ARGs was increased by different amounts of transferred ozone dose from 11 to 45 mg/L. The concentration of 108 cfu/ml bacteria was reduced  to an acceptable level by ozone treatment after a 5 min contact time,  Although the removal rate was much higher for concentrations of 106 cfu/ml and 104 cfu/ml bacteria. Overall, the tendency of gene reduction by ozonation from more to less was 16S rRNA > sul1 > blatem > blactx > qnrS > blavim. Given that plasmid-borne ARGs can potentially be transferred to other bacteria even after the disinfection process, our results can provide important insights into the fate of ARGs during hospital wastewater ozonation."
Hypoxia driven opioid targeted automated device for overdose rescue,"Opioid use disorder has been designated a worsening epidemic with over 100,000 deaths due to opioid overdoses recorded in 2021 alone. Unintentional deaths due to opioid overdoses have continued to rise inexorably. While opioid overdose antidotes such as naloxone, and nalmefene are available, these must be administered within a critical time window to be effective. Unfortunately, opioid-overdoses may occur in the absence of antidote, or may be unwitnessed, and the rapid onset of cognitive impairment and unconsciousness, which frequently accompany an overdose may render self-administration of an antidote impossible. Thus, many lives are lost because: (1) an opioid overdose is not anticipated (i.e., monitored/detected), and (2) antidote is either not present, and/or not administered within the critical frame of effectiveness. Currently lacking is a non-invasive means of automatically detecting, reporting, and treating such overdoses. To address this problem, we have designed a wearable, on-demand system that comprises a safe, compact, non-invasive device which can monitor, and effectively deliver an antidote without human intervention, and report the opioid overdose event. A novel feature of our device is a needle-stow chamber that stores needles in a sterile state and inserts needles into tissue only when drug delivery is needed. The system uses a microcontroller which continuously monitors respiratory status as assessed by reflex pulse oximetry. When the oximeter detects the wearer’s percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen to be less than or equal to 90%, which is an indication of impending respiratory failure in otherwise healthy individuals, the microcontroller initiates a sequence of events that simultaneously results in the subcutaneous administration of opioid antidote, nalmefene, and transmission of a GPS-trackable 911 alert. The device is compact (4 × 3 × 3 cm), adhesively attaches to the skin, and can be conveniently worn on the arm. Furthermore, this device permits a centralized remotely accessible system for effective institutional, large-scale intervention. Most importantly, this device has the potential for saving lives that are currently being lost to an alarmingly increasing epidemic."
Highly divergent herpesviruses in threatened river dolphins from Brazil,"River dolphins are a highly threatened polyphyletic group comprised of four odontocete families: Iniidae, Pontoporiidae, Lipotidae, and Platanistidae, the first two endemic to South America. To address the knowledge gap regarding infectious agents in this cetacean group, we surveyed the presence of herpesviruses by PCR in skin and/or blood samples of live-captured Amazon (Inia geoffrensis, n = 25) and Bolivian (Inia boliviensis, n = 22) river dolphins of the Amazon basin and in selected tissue samples of franciscanas (Pontoporia blainvillei, n = 27) stranded or bycaught in southeastern Brazil. Additionally, available franciscana tissue samples were examined by histopathology. Herpesvirus DNA was amplified in 13 Bolivian river dolphins (59.1%, 95% CI 38.5–79.6%) and 14 franciscanas (51.9%, 95% CI 33.0–70.7%). All Amazon river dolphins were herpesvirus-negative. Two different herpesviruses were found in Bolivian river dolphins: a previously known gammaherpesvirus detected in blood and/or skin samples of all positive individuals and a novel alphaherpesvirus in the skin of one animal. A new gammaherpesvirus was found in several franciscana samples—the first herpesvirus recorded in Pontoporiidae. Intranuclear inclusion bodies consistent with herpesvirus were observed in the lymph node of one franciscana. The high divergence among the obtained herpesviruses and those previously described can be explained by viral-host coevolution, and by the fact that these populations are fairly isolated."
Intrinsic and environmental factors modulating autonomous robotic search under high uncertainty,"Autonomous robotic search problems deal with different levels of uncertainty. When uncertainty is low, deterministic strategies employing available knowledge result in most effective searches. However, there are domains where uncertainty is always high since information about robot location, environment boundaries or precise reference points is unattainable, e.g., in cave, deep ocean, planetary exploration, or upon sensor or communications impairment. Furthermore, latency regarding when search targets move, appear or disappear add to uncertainty sources. Here we study intrinsic and environmental factors that affect low-informed robotic search based on diffusive Brownian, naive ballistic, and superdiffusive strategies (Lévy walks), and in particular, the effectiveness of their random exploration. Representative strategies were evaluated considering both intrinsic (motion drift, energy or memory limitations) and extrinsic factors (obstacles and search boundaries). Our results point towards minimum-knowledge based modulation approaches that can adjust distinct spatial and temporal aspects of random exploration to lead to effective autonomous search under uncertainty."
Downstream competition and profits under different input price bargaining structures,"In a vertically related duopoly with input price bargaining, this paper re-examines the downstream firms’ profitability under different market competition degrees. It is shown the rather counterintuitive result that downstream firms earn highest profits with semi-collusion, whose level depends on the upstream bargaining structures, the relative parties’ bargaining power, and the parameters measuring the degree of product differentiation in the downstream market. Concerning social welfare, the key result is that policymakers can tolerate some degree of collusion with decentralized bargaining structures; centralized structures advise for a more procompetitive policy."
The steady laminar planar mixing layer flow of viscoelastic FENE-P fluids,"An approximate self-similar solution is proposed for the steady laminar mixing layer flow of viscoelastic fluids, described by the FENE-P constitutive equation. The solution is obtained by performing an order of magnitude analysis and ensuing simplifications of the governing equations following the procedures used in the corresponding planar boundary layer flow solution (Parvar S, Silva CB, Pinho FT, Phys Fluids 33(2):023103, 2021). The effects of Weissenberg number, maximum polymer extensibility and viscosity ratio on mixing layer, displacement, and momentum thicknesses as well as on velocity, stress, and conformation tensor profiles are investigated in detail. At low elasticity levels, the mixing layer exhibits a self-similar behavior, with the kinematic quantities collapsing on the corresponding Newtonian flow curves and the polymer characteristics exhibiting a unique behavior if adequately normalized. However, with increasing levels of elasticity not only the profiles deviate from the low elasticity levels asymptote, but they cease to collapse onto single curves, showing a dependence on local values of the relevant dimensionless numbers, i.e., the approximate similar solution becomes local. Our solution matches the corresponding Newtonian solution and compares well with the significantly costlier numerical simulations using the RheoFoam toolbox of OpenFoam open-source code."
Modified inertial projection and contraction algorithms for solving variational inequality problems with non-Lipschitz continuous operators,"In this paper, we present four modified inertial projection and contraction methods to solve the variational inequality problem with a pseudo-monotone and non-Lipschitz continuous operator in real Hilbert spaces. Strong convergence theorems of the proposed algorithms are established without the prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the operator. Several numerical experiments and the applications to optimal control problems are provided to verify the advantages and efficiency of the proposed algorithms."
Estimating the Effect of AfCFTA on Intra-African Trade using Augmented GE-PPML,"This paper draws on a general equilibrium poisson pseudo maximum likelihood model augmented by a dynamic capital accumulation to estimate the effects of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) on intra-African trade flows. The empirical results show that the AfCFTA could raise intra-African trade by 24% in the short term and slightly more in the long run. However, the potential trade and welfare gains associated with the continental trade integration reform are expected to vary across countries, with the largest gains accruing to countries that exhibit relatively low intra-regional trade performance and level of integration pre-AfCFTA."
Using dynamic digital radiography to assess pulmonary circulation imaging in a patient with congenital heart disease,
"Generalized flatness constants, spanning lattice polytopes, and the Gromov width","In this paper we motivate some new directions of research regarding the lattice width of convex bodies. We show that convex bodies of sufficiently large width contain a unimodular copy of a standard simplex. Following an argument of Eisenbrand and Shmonin, we prove that every lattice polytope contains a minimal generating set of the affine lattice spanned by its lattice points such that the number of generators (and the lattice width of their convex hull) is bounded by a constant which only depends on the dimension. We also discuss relations to recent results on spanning lattice polytopes and how our results could be viewed as the beginning of the study of generalized flatness constants. Regarding symplectic geometry, we point out how the lattice width of a Delzant polytope is related to upper and lower bounds on the Gromov width of its associated symplectic toric manifold. Throughout, we include several open questions."
On the complexity of equational decision problems for finite height complemented and orthocomplemented modular lattices,"We study the computational complexity of the satisfiability problem and the complement of the equivalence problem for complemented (orthocomplemented) modular lattices L and classes thereof. Concerning a simple L of finite height, \(\mathcal {NP}\)-hardness is shown for both problems. Moreover, both problems are shown to be polynomial-time equivalent to the same feasibility problem over the division ring D whenever L is the subspace lattice of a D-vector space of finite dimension at least 3. Considering the class of all finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, the equivalence problem for the class of subspace ortholattices is shown to be polynomial-time equivalent to that for the class of endomorphism \(*\)-rings with pseudo-inversion; moreover, we derive completeness for the complement of the Boolean part of the nondeterministic Blum-Shub-Smale model of real computation without constants. This result extends to the additive category of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, enriched by adjunction and pseudo-inversion."
General results on bivariate extended Weibull Morgenstern family and concomitants of its generalized order statistics,"In this paper, we develop the extended Weibull family of distributions to a bivariate class using the Farlie–Gumbel–Morgenstern copula. This is called the bivariate Farlie–Gumbel–Morgenstern extended Weibull family, and some of its properties are investigated. Some special cases of this family and their correlation coefficient are found. Also, the maximum correlation coefficient of most special cases is investigated. We study the concomitants of generalized order statistics from this new class of Morgenstern bivariate distribution and obtain some relevant relations for single and product moments of concomitants. Some well-known information measures such as the Shannon entropy and extropy for concomitants are derived."
eNOS controls angiogenic sprouting and retinal neovascularization through the regulation of endothelial cell polarity,"The roles of nitric oxide (NO) and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in the regulation of angiogenesis are well documented. However, the involvement of eNOS in the sprouting of endothelial tip-cells at the vascular front during sprouting angiogenesis remains poorly defined. In this study, we show that downregulation of eNOS markedly inhibits VEGF-stimulated migration of endothelial cells but increases their polarization, as evidenced by the reorientation of the Golgi in migrating monolayers and by the fewer filopodia on tip cells at ends of sprouts in endothelial cell spheroids. The effect of eNOS inhibition on EC polarization was prevented in Par3-depleted cells. Importantly, downregulation of eNOS increased the expression of polarity genes, such as PARD3B, PARD6A, PARD6B, PKCΖ, TJP3, and CRB1 in endothelial cells. In retinas of eNOS knockout mice, vascular development is retarded with decreased vessel density and vascular branching. Furthermore, tip cells at the extremities of the vascular front have a marked reduction in the number of filopodia per cell and are more oriented. In a model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), eNOS deficient mice are protected during the initial vaso-obliterative phase, have reduced pathological neovascularization, and retinal endothelial tip cells have fewer filopodia. Single-cell RNA sequencing of endothelial cells from OIR retinas revealed enrichment of genes related to cell polarity in the endothelial tip-cell subtype of eNOS deficient mice. These results indicate that inhibition of eNOS alters the polarity program of endothelial cells, which increases cell polarization, regulates sprouting angiogenesis and normalizes pathological neovascularization during retinopathy."
Silencing the triacylglycerol lipase (TGL) gene decreases the number of apyrene sperm and inhibits oviposition in Sitotroga cerealella,"Triacylglycerol lipase (TGL) is an essential lipid metabolism enzyme that also plays a critical role in energy metabolism; however, how it regulates other life processes is unknown. To investigate the functional role of TGL in moth reproduction, males Sitotroga cerealella were used as a model. The TGL gene was cloned and analysed. The results showed that the open reading frame of TGL was 1968 bp long and contained three conserved regions. TGL gene expression was higher in the larval and early adult stages than in the pupal stage, with the highest levels observed in the fat body, testis and accessory glands during the early adult stage. Moreover, after TGL in male adults was silenced through RNAi, the protein content in male accessory glands remained unchanged, and the spermatophore transferred into females mated with TGL-silenced males became small and empty; meanwhile, the number of apyrene sperm in the spermatophore was significantly reduced due to the reduction of apyrene sperm in males, which eventually led to the significant reduction of egg-laying amount. All of the findings suggest that TGL regulates the amount of sperm in male moths as well as the morphology and quality of spermatophores transferred to females after mating with treated males, implying that TGL is critical for Sitotroga cerealella’s reproductive process."
Ethoxy acetalated dextran-based nanocarriers accomplish efficient inhibition of leukotriene formation by a novel FLAP antagonist in human leukocytes and blood,"Leukotrienes are pro-inflammatory lipid mediators generated by 5-lipoxygenase aided by the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP). BRP-201, a novel benzimidazole-based FLAP antagonist, inhibits leukotriene biosynthesis in isolated leukocytes. However, like other FLAP antagonists, BRP-201 fails to effectively suppress leukotriene formation in blood, which limits its therapeutic value. Here, we describe the encapsulation of BRP-201 into poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and ethoxy acetalated dextran (Ace-DEX) nanoparticles (NPs), aiming to overcome these detrimental pharmacokinetic limitations and to enhance the bioactivity of BRP-201. NPs loaded with BRP-201 were produced via nanoprecipitation and the physicochemical properties of the NPs were analyzed in-depth using dynamic light scattering (size, dispersity, degradation), electrophoretic light scattering (effective charge), NP tracking analysis (size, dispersity), scanning electron microscopy (size and morphology), UV–VIS spectroscopy (drug loading), an analytical ultracentrifuge (drug release, degradation kinetics), and Raman spectroscopy (chemical attributes). Biological assays were performed to study cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and efficiency of BRP-201-loaded NPs versus free BRP-201 to suppress leukotriene formation in primary human leukocytes and whole blood. Both PLGA- and Ace-DEX-based NPs were significantly more efficient to inhibit leukotriene formation in neutrophils versus free drug. Whole blood experiments revealed that encapsulation of BRP-201 into Ace-DEX NPs strongly increases its potency, especially upon pro-longed (≥ 5 h) incubations and upon lipopolysaccharide-challenge of blood. Finally, intravenous injection of BRP-201-loaded NPs significantly suppressed leukotriene levels in blood of mice in vivo. These results reveal the feasibility of our pharmacological approach using a novel FLAP antagonist encapsulated into Ace-DEX-based NPs with improved efficiency in blood to suppress leukotriene biosynthesis."
Generalized eigenfunctions and eigenvalues: A unifying framework for Shnol-type theorems,"Let H be a generalized Schrödinger operator on a domain of a non-compact connected Riemannian manifold, and a generalized eigenfunction u for H: that is, u satisfies the equation Hu = λu in the weak sense but is not necessarily in L2. The problem is to find conditions on the growth of u, so that λ belongs to the spectrum of H. We unify and generalize known results on this problem. In addition, a variety of examples is provided, illustrating the different nature of the growth conditions."
Obstructions for automorphic quasiregular maps and Lattès-type uniformly quasiregular maps,"Suppose that M is a closed, connected, and oriented Riemannian n-manifold, f: ℝn → M is a quasiregular map automorphic under a discrete group Γ of Euclidean isometries, and f has finite multiplicity in a fundamental cell of Γ. We show that if Γ has a sufficiently large translation subgroup ΓT, then dim Γ ∈ {0, n − 1, n}. If f is strongly automorphic and induces a non-injective Lattès-type uniformly quasiregular map, then the same assertion holds without the assumption on the size of ΓT. Moreover, an even stronger restriction holds in the Lattès case if M is not a rational cohomology sphere."
"Sloshing, Steklov and corners: Asymptotics of sloshing eigenvalues","In the present paper we develop an approach to obtain sharp spectral asymptotics for Steklov type problems on planar domains with corners. Our main focus is on the two-dimensional sloshing problem, which is a mixed Steklov—Neumann boundary value problem describing small vertical oscillations of an ideal fluid in a container or in a canal with a uniform cross-section. We prove a two-term asymptotic formula for sloshing eigenvalues. In particular, this confirms a conjecture posed by Fox and Kuttler in 1983. We also obtain similar eigenvalue asymptotics for other related mixed Steklov type problems, and discuss applications to the study of Steklov spectral asymptotics on polygons."
Characterization of an extracellular α-xylosidase involved in xyloglucan degradation in Aspergillus oryzae,"α-Xylosidases release the α-d-xylopyranosyl side chain from di- and oligosaccharides derived from xyloglucans and are involved in xyloglucan degradation. In this study, an extracellular α-xylosidase, named AxyB, is identified and characterized in Aspergillus oryzae. AxyB belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 31 and releases d-xylose from isoprimeverose (α-d-xylopyranosyl-(1 → 6)-d-glucopyranose) and xyloglucan oligosaccharides. In the hydrolysis of xyloglucan oligosaccharides (XLLG, Glc4Xyl3Gal2 nonasaccharide; XLXG/XXLG, Glc4Xyl3Gal1 octasaccharide; and XXXG, Glc4Xyl3 heptasaccharide), AxyB releases one molecule of the xylopyranosyl side chain attached to the non-reducing end of the β-1,4-glucan main chain of these xyloglucan oligosaccharides to yield GLLG (Glc4Xyl2Gal2), GLXG/GXLG (Glc4Xyl2Gal1), and GXXG (Glc4Xyl2). A. oryzae has both extracellular and intracellular α-xylosidase, suggesting that xyloglucan oligosaccharides are degraded by a combination of isoprimeverose-producing oligoxyloglucan hydrolase and intracellular α-xylosidase and a combination of extracellular α-xylosidase and β-glucosidase(s) in A. oryzae."
Secretome-based screening of fusion partners and their application in recombinant protein secretion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"For the efficient production of heterologous proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we screened for a novel fusion partner from the yeast secretome. From twenty major proteins identified from the yeast secretome, we selected Scw4p, a cell wall protein with similarity to glucanase, and modified to develop a general fusion partner for the secretory expression of heterologous proteins in yeast. The optimal size of the SCW4 gene to act as an efficient fusion partner was determined by C-terminal truncation analysis; two of the variants, S1 (truncated at codon 115Q) and S2 (truncated at codon 142E), were further used for the secretion of heterologous proteins. When fused with S2, the secretion of three target proteins (hGH, exendin-4, and hPTH) significantly increased. Conserved O-glycosylation sites (Ser/Thr-rich domain) and hydrophilic sequences of S2 were deemed important for the function of S2 as a secretion fusion partner. Approximately 5 g/L of the S2-exendin-4 fusion protein was obtained from fed-batch fermentation. Intact target proteins were easily purified by affinity chromatography after in vitro processing of the fusion partner. This system may be of general application for the secretory production of heterologous proteins in S. cerevisiae."
Local radiotherapy and E7 RNA-LPX vaccination show enhanced therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of HPV16+ cancer,"Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is a causative agent for several cancers types (genital, anal and head and neck region). The HPV E6 and E7 proteins are oncogenic drivers and thus are ideal candidates for therapeutic vaccination. We recently reported that a novel ribonucleic acid lipoplex (RNA-LPX)-based HPV16 vaccine, E7 RNA-LPX, mediates regression of mouse HPV16+ tumors and establishes protective T cell memory. An HPV16 E6/E7 RNA-LPX vaccine is currently being investigated in two phase I and II clinical trials in various HPV-driven cancer types; however, it remains a high unmet medical need for treatments for patients with radiosensitive HPV16+ tumors. Therefore, we set out to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of E7 RNA-LPX vaccine combined with standard-of-care local radiotherapy (LRT). We demonstrate that E7 RNA-LPX synergizes with LRT in HPV16+ mouse tumors, with potent therapeutic effects exceeding those of either monotherapy. Mode of action studies revealed that the E7 RNA-LPX vaccine induced high numbers of intratumoral-E7-specific CD8+ T cells, rendering cold tumors immunologically hot, whereas LRT primarily acted as a cytotoxic therapy, reducing tumor mass and intratumor hypoxia by predisposing tumor cells to antigen-specific T cell-mediated killing. Overall, LRT enhanced the effector function of E7 RNA-LPX-primed T cell responses. The therapeutic synergy was dependent on total radiation dose, rather than radiation dose-fractionation. Together, these results show that LRT synergizes with E7 RNA-LPX and enhances its anti-tumor activity against HPV16+ cancer models. This work paves into a new translational therapy for HPV16+ cancer patients."
"Myocardial injury in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a retrospective study, systematic review, and meta-analysis","The majority of studies evaluating the effect of myocardial injury on the survival of COVID-19 patients have been performed outside of the United States (U.S.).

Finding light in dark archives: using AI to connect context and content in email,"Email archives are important historical resources, but access to such data poses a unique archival challenge and many born-digital collections remain dark, while questions of how they should be effectively made available remain. This paper contributes to the growing interest in preserving access to email by addressing the needs of users, in readiness for when such collections become more widely available. We argue that for the content of email to be meaningfully accessed, the context of email must form part of this access. In exploring this idea, we focus on discovery within large, multi-custodian archives of organisational email, where emails’ network features are particularly apparent. We introduce our prototype search tool, which uses AI-based methods to support user-driven exploration of email. Specifically, we integrate two distinct AI models that generate systematically different types of results, one based upon simple, phrase-matching and the other upon more complex, BERT embeddings. Together, these provide a new pathway to contextual discovery that accounts for the diversity of future archival users, their interests and level of experience."
An Incidental Finding Accompanying Hypertension in an Adolescent Girl,"Cerebral arteriovenous malformations in pediatric and adolescent patients differ in terms of clinical presentation, management, and outcomes than in adults. They are more prone to present with hemorrhage so curative managements as open surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery are more commonly required in this age group. A 16-year-old girl diagnosed with obesity-related hypertension was presented with recurrent headache and vomiting despite adequate treatment. Because of her recurrent and relapsing symptoms, cerebral imaging was performed and unruptured arteriovenous malformation was detected. Sterotactic radiosurgery was performed and she has been symptom-free for about 5 years. In a hypertensive patient, when clinical features worsen despite adequate treatment, and when unusual symptoms occur, further imaging techniques should be performed to detect possible secondary causes or accompanying clinical features."
Spontaneously Ruptured Dural Ectasia in a Patient with Marfan Syndrome: a Case Report and Discussion of the Challenges Faced,"Dural ectasia is a common finding in patients with Marfan syndrome, while many of these patients are on anticoagulants due to prosthetic heart valves. A 44-year-old man was transferred to the ER due to cauda equina syndrome. The patient was on warfarin. His CT scan revealed spontaneous hemorrhage in the lumbosacral region. The patient underwent an urgent laminectomy with subtotal removal of haemorrhagic tissue. Post-operatively, he developed sepsis due to wound leak. Additionally he developed resistance to heparin. The complications were successfully managed, and the patient was discharged 3 months after his admission. People with Marfan syndrome could have significant co-morbidities while their management can be complicated by various issues. We present a case of lumbosacral hemorrhage and cauda equina with the background of dural ectasia and anticoagulants and discuss the relevant set of complications and their management."
"Site selection for managed aquifer recharge in the city of Kabul, Afghanistan, using a multi-criteria decision analysis and geographic information system","While the success and sustainability of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) strongly depends on many characteristics of the site, it is necessary to integrate the site characteristics and develop suitability maps to indicate the most suitable locations. The objective of this study is to integrate geographic information system (GIS) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques to identify the most suitable areas for a MAR project in the Kabul city area, Afghanistan. Data for six effective criteria, including slope, drainage density, surface infiltration rate, unsaturated zone thickness, soil type and electrical conductivity, were collected and then a classification map was produced for each criterion in the GIS environment. By applying MCDA techniques, the weights of the effective criteria were obtained. A suitability map was generated from each technique separately based on a combination of all criteria weights and thematic layers. The result of the analytical network process (ANP) method was found to be more precise and reliable compared with that of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method. Based on the final suitability map produced from the ANP model, there is 3.7, 15.0, 37.4, 33.1 and 10.3% of the total area that is unsuitable, of low suitability, moderately suitable, suitable and very suitable for MAR application, respectively. As a final result of this work, seven sites have been prioritized based on land use. The integration of multi-criteria decision analysis and GIS is recognized as an effective method for the selection of managed aquifer recharge sites."
Morphologic analysis of hysteretic behavior of China Laizhou Bay submarine mucky clay and its cyclic failure criteria,"The cyclic response of soil seabed under longs-term cyclic loading is critical to foundation stability of offshore wind turbines (OWT); therefore, the accurate analysis and design of foundation structure of OWT require a clear understanding of the dynamic characteristics of submarine soil. While existing studies mostly concentrate on the cyclic stress–strain and pore-water pressure behavior, this paper investigates and quantifies the morphological development of hysteretic behavior based on a series of dynamic triaxial testing results. Four morphological parameters are introduced to quantitatively describe the hysteretic behavior, i.e., the non-closure degree, length–width ratio, inclination, area. Two distinct development laws of morphological parameters against number of cycles are observed, i.e., the destructive mode under large cyclic stress ratio (CSR) and the stable mode under small CSR. Furthermore, soil specimens under different cyclic stress paths were divide into three failure states, i.e., failure state, critical state, and stable state, and the cyclic failure criteria by analyzing cumulative strain development and energy dissipation were discussed and proposed. This provides a fundamental reference for investigating engineering geology properties of submarine clay under long-term cyclic loading."
A note on the complexity of the bilevel bottleneck assignment problem,"We establish the NP-completeness of the variant of the bilevel assignment problem, where the leader and the follower both have bottleneck objective functions and were the follower behaves according to the optimistic rule.

On the Space Thermal Destratification in a Partially Filled Hydrogen Propellant Tank by Jet Injection,"Hydrogen, as a space propellant, plays an important role in future space energy systems. However, it is sensitive to heat leakage from the environment because of its low boiling point and small density. Besides, the buoyancy convection is weakened and even completely suppressed in space microgravity environment. When there is heat leakage on the wall of the propellant tank, temperature stratification will be produced around the heat leakage source, resulting in propellant overheating. This will affect the interfacial heat and mass transfer, leading to pressure rise in the tank, and even endanger the structural safety of the system. To prevent tank pressure from rising above its design limits, venting or active pressure control techniques must be implemented. The cryogenic jet mixing is an effective method to suppress temperature stratification. The cryogenic fluid is mixed with the fluid inside the tank through a jet nozzle to reduce the thermal stratification and achieve uniform temperature distribution. In the present study, the temperature stratification phenomenon caused by heat leakage and its destratification via a cryogenic jet under microgravity condition were numerically investigated in the context of a partially liquid-filled large scale model tank. The effects of cryogenic jet mixing on the elimination of temperature stratification were analyzed for different initial filling ratios and mass flow rates. The results show that a higher incident mass flow rate can effectively destroy the temperature stratification inside the tank and promote an inside fluid flow for a given liquid filling ratio. A smaller filling ratio results in a faster growth in both average temperature and average pressure, and a larger amount of mass transfer inside the tank. It is more efficient to implement the cryogenic jet injection in the early stage when the remained propellant is still abundant, or adopt a higher incident mass flow rate to suppress the thermal stratification in the tank."
Solving Burgers’ equation with quantum computing,"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are a vital part of the design process in the aerospace industry. Although reliable CFD results can be obtained with turbulence models, direct numerical simulation of complex bodies in three spatial dimensions (3D) is impracticable due to the massive amount of computational elements. For instance, a 3D direct numerical simulation of a turbulent boundary-layer over the wing of a commercial jetliner that resolves all relevant length scales using a serial CFD solver on a modern digital computer would take approximately 750 million years or roughly 20% of the earth’s age. Over the past 25 years, quantum computers have become the object of great interest worldwide as powerful quantum algorithms have been constructed for several important, computationally challenging problems that provide enormous speed-up over the best-known classical algorithms. In this paper, we adapt a recently introduced quantum algorithm for partial differential equations to Burgers’ equation and develop a quantum CFD solver that determines its solutions. We used our quantum CFD solver to verify the quantum Burgers’ equation algorithm to find the flow solution when a shockwave is and is not present. The quantum simulation results were compared to: (i) an exact analytical solution for a flow without a shockwave; and (ii) the results of a classical CFD solver for flows with and without a shockwave. Excellent agreement was found in both cases, and the error of the quantum CFD solver was comparable to that of the classical CFD solver."
Ethoxy acetalated dextran-based nanocarriers accomplish efficient inhibition of leukotriene formation by a novel FLAP antagonist in human leukocytes and blood,"Leukotrienes are pro-inflammatory lipid mediators generated by 5-lipoxygenase aided by the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP).

On the complexity of equational decision problems for finite height complemented and orthocomplemented modular lattices,"We study the computational complexity of the satisfiability problem and the complement of the equivalence problem for complemented (orthocomplemented) modular lattices L and classes thereof. Concerning a simple L of finite height, \(\mathcal {NP}\)-hardness is shown for both problems. Moreover, both problems are shown to be polynomial-time equivalent to the same feasibility problem over the division ring D whenever L is the subspace lattice of a D-vector space of finite dimension at least 3. Considering the class of all finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, the equivalence problem for the class of subspace ortholattices is shown to be polynomial-time equivalent to that for the class of endomorphism \(*\)-rings with pseudo-inversion; moreover, we derive completeness for the complement of the Boolean part of the nondeterministic Blum-Shub-Smale model of real computation without constants. This result extends to the additive category of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, enriched by adjunction and pseudo-inversion."
Inhomogeneous Conformal Field Theory Out of Equilibrium,"We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of conformal field theory (CFT) in 1+1 dimensions with a smooth position-dependent velocity v(x) explicitly breaking translation invariance. Such inhomogeneous CFT is argued to effectively describe 1+1-dimensional quantum many-body systems with certain inhomogeneities varying on mesoscopic scales. Both heat and charge transport are studied, where, for concreteness, we suppose that our CFT has a conserved U(1) current. Based on projective unitary representations of diffeomorphisms and smooth maps in Minkowskian CFT, we obtain a recipe for computing the exact non-equilibrium dynamics in inhomogeneous CFT when evolving from initial states defined by smooth inverse-temperature and chemical-potential profiles \(\beta (x)\) and \(\mu (x)\). Using this recipe, the following exact analytical results are obtained: (i) the full time evolution of densities and currents for heat and charge transport, (ii) correlation functions for components of the energy–momentum tensor and the U(1) current as well as for any primary field, and (iii) the thermal and electrical conductivities. The latter are computed by direct dynamical considerations and alternatively using a Green–Kubo formula. Both give the same explicit expressions for the conductivities, which reveal how inhomogeneous dynamics opens up the possibility for diffusion as well as implies a generalization of the Wiedemann–Franz law to finite times within CFT."

Cost-Effectiveness of perioperative Vaginally Administered estrogen in postmenopausal women undergoing prolapse surgery (EVA trial): study protocol for a multicenter double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial,"Surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is associated with high recurrence rates. The costs associated with the treatment of recurrent POP are huge, and the burden from women who encounter recurrent POP, negatively impacts their quality of life. Estrogen therapy might improve surgical outcome for POP due to its potential beneficial effects. It is thought that vaginal estrogen therapy improves healing and long-term maintenance of connective tissue integrity. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of perioperative vaginal estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women undergoing POP surgery."
Linearly implicit local energy-preserving algorithm for a class of multi-symplectic Hamiltonian PDEs,"We give a systematic, linearly implicit, local energy-preserving method for the general multi-symplectic Hamiltonian system with cubic invariants by combining Kahan’s discretization in time and Euler-box discretization in space. The new method is applied to some classical multi-symplectic Hamiltonian partial differential equations to test its effectiveness, efficiency, solution accuracy and energy preservation."
Thermal analysis of hypersonic reactive flows on the SARA Brazilian satellite reentry trajectory,"Numerical simulations of hypersonic flows are presented for the Brazilian satellite SARA undergoing atmospheric reentry. The Navier–Stokes equations are numerically solved by the finite volume method with the inclusion of chemical source terms to model the effects of dissociation and ionization. The two-temperature model proposed by Park is employed to analyze the translational–rotational and vibrational–electronic temperature modes. Despite the low density conditions, which lead to high mean free paths, a comparison of the present results against those obtained by DSMC shows that the present calculations are sufficiently accurate even at the highest altitude considered. Moreover, estimates of the Knudsen numbers for the present test cases indicate that they are sufficiently low to justify the continuum model. A mesh refinement study is carried out in order to evaluate the influence of near-wall mesh spacing and the number of volumes in the normal and longitudinal directions of the flow on the calculation of the heat flux over the satellite surface. Analysis of the results shows that thermodynamic non-equilibrium occurs along the entire reentry trajectory of the satellite. While for high altitudes the flow density is extremely low, at lower altitudes supersonic conditions are achieved and, in both cases, chemical reactions are not relevant. On the other hand, for some intermediate altitudes of the reentry trajectory, thermodynamic non-equilibrium is severely affected by the chemical reactions. In these cases, a weak ionization occurs besides dissociation of the gas species and the accurate prediction of the surface heat flux requires a reactive gas model."

"Effect of inhomogeneity, initial stress, sandiness, and viscosity on the propagation of torsional wave","This model is established to analyse the analytical assessment and mathematical modelling to  unveil the characteristics of torsional wave in an inhomogeneous sandy layer rested upon a viscoelastic half-space. It has been considered that the assumed model is under compressive initial stress. To acquire the required dispersion equation, the appropriate boundary conditions with the assistance of displacement and stress components have been well satisfied. The main objective of this study is to analyse the impact of different affecting parameters such as inhomogeneity, sandiness, compressive initial stress, tensile initial stress and viscosity on the propagation of torsional wave. In a particular case, it has been shown that dispersion equation is in well agreement with the standard result which validates the undertaken study."

Digital Transformation in Medical Affairs Sparked by the Pandemic: Insights and Learnings from COVID-19 Era and Beyond,"A number of developments, including increasing regulatory and compliance scrutiny, increased transparency expectations, an increasingly vocal patient, patient centricity and greater requirements for real-world evidence, have driven the growth and importance of medical affairs as a trusted, science-driven partner over the past decade. The healthcare environment is shifting towards a digital, data-driven and payor-focused model. Likewise, medical affairs as a function within the pharmaceutical industry has become more “patient-centric” with strategic engagements embracing payers and patients apart from clinicians. The pandemic has impacted the healthcare industry as well as the function of medical affairs in numerous ways and has brought new challenges and demands to tackle. There is indeed a silver lining due to intense digital transformation within this crisis. The emerging digital innovation and new technologies in healthcare, medical education and virtual communications are likely to stay and advance further. In this review, we discuss how the digital transformation sparked by the pandemic has impacted the medical affairs function in pharmaceuticals and provide further insights and learnings from the COVID-19 era and beyond. Based on the learning and insights, digital innovation in three key strategic imperatives of medical affairs—HCP engagement, external partnerships and data generation will enable medical affairs to become future-fit as a strategic leadership function."
Towards automatic detection and prioritization of pre-logging overhead: a case study of hadoop ecosystem,"The pre-logging overhead refers to the overhead produced by pre-logging statements (PLS), which are used to construct the parameters of logging calls. In practice, these logging-related statements are usually guarded by conditional statements, known as logging guards, to ensure that they are only executed when necessary (e.g., at the debugging phase). However, developers occasionally forget to add logging guards to costly PLS, resulting in missing logging guards (MLG) issues, which can have a significant impact on performance, particularly for high-throughput software, and lead to critical performance issues. In this paper, (1) we conduct the first empirical study of 137 commits addressing MLG issues in five popular open-source software of the Hadoop ecosystem. Based on the results, we reveal five findings of the current practice of logging guards. (2) We devise an accurate algorithm to detect PLSs (over 95% in precision and recall) and find out 16 problematic partially guarded logging calls (10 of them are confirmed and fixed by developers). (3) We investigate two metric-based ranking approaches using six software metrics to prioritize PLSs based on their impact on performance. We discover that the execution frequency of PLSs achieves the best performance, and combining multiple software metrics can improve performance (7.8% on average)."

The problem is to find conditions on the growth of u, so that λ belongs to the spectrum of H. We unify and generalize known results on this problem. In addition, a variety of examples is provided, illustrating the different nature of the growth conditions."

We show that if Γ has a sufficiently large translation subgroup ΓT, then dim Γ ∈ {0, n − 1, n}. If f is strongly automorphic and induces a non-injective Lattès-type uniformly quasiregular map, then the same assertion holds without the assumption on the size of ΓT. Moreover, an even stronger restriction holds in the Lattès case if M is not a rational cohomology sphere."
Gluino-SUGRA scenarios in light of FNAL muon g – 2 anomaly,"Gluino-SUGRA (\( \overset{\sim }{g} \)SUGRA), which is an economical extension of the predictive mSUGRA, adopts much heavier gluino mass parameter than other gauginos mass parameters and universal scalar mass parameter at the unification scale. It can elegantly reconcile the experimental results on the Higgs boson mass, the muon g − 2, the null results in search for supersymmetry at the LHC and the results from B-physics. In this work, we propose several new ways to generate large gaugino hierarchy (i.e. M3 » M1, M2) for \( \overset{\sim }{g} \)SUGRA model building and then discuss in detail the implications of the new muon g − 2 results with the updated LHC constraints on such \( \overset{\sim }{g} \)SUGRA scenarios. We obtain the following observations: (i) for the most interesting M1 = M2 case at the GUT scale with a viable bino-like dark matter, the \( \overset{\sim }{g} \)SUGRA can explain the muon g − 2 anomaly at 1σ level and be consistent with the updated LHC constraints for 6 ≤ M3/M1 ≤ 9 at the GUT scale; (ii) For M1 : M2 = 5 : 1 at the GUT scale with wino-like dark matter, the \( \overset{\sim }{g} \)SUGRA model can explain the muon g − 2 anomaly at 2σ level and be consistent with the updated LHC constraints for 3 ≤ M3/M1 ≤ 3.2 at the GUT scale; (iii) For M1 : M2 = 3 : 2 at the GUT scale with mixed bino-wino dark matter, the \( \overset{\sim }{g} \)SUGRA model can explain the muon g − 2 anomaly at 1σ level and be consistent with the updated LHC constraints for 6.9 ≤ M3/M1 ≤ 7.5 at the GUT scale. Although the choice of heavy gluino will always increase the FT involved, some of the 1σ/2σ survived points of \( \Delta {a}_{\mu}^{\mathrm{combine}} \) can still allow low EWFT of order several hundreds and be fairly natural. Constraints from (dimension-five operator induced) proton decay are also discussed."
Off diagonal charged scalar couplings with the Z boson: Zee-type models as an example,"Models with scalar doublets and charged scalar singlets have the interesting property that they have couplings between one Z boson and two charged scalars of different masses. This property is often ignored in phenomenological analysis, as it is absent from models with only extra scalar doublets. We explore this issue in detail, considering \(h \rightarrow Z \gamma \), \(B \rightarrow X_s \gamma \), and the decay of a heavy charged scalar into a lighter one and a Z boson. We propose that the latter be actively searched for at the LHC, using the scalar sector of the Zee-type models as a prototype and proposing benchmark points which obey all current experimental data, and could be within reach of the LHC."
Inhomogeneous Conformal Field Theory Out of Equilibrium,"We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of conformal field theory (CFT) in 1+1 dimensions with a smooth position-dependent velocity v(x) explicitly breaking translation invariance. Such inhomogeneous CFT is argued to effectively describe 1+1-dimensional quantum many-body systems with certain inhomogeneities varying on mesoscopic scales. Both heat and charge transport are studied, where, for concreteness, we suppose that our CFT has a conserved U(1) current. Based on projective unitary representations of diffeomorphisms and smooth maps in Minkowskian CFT, we obtain a recipe for computing the exact non-equilibrium dynamics in inhomogeneous CFT when evolving from initial states defined by smooth inverse-temperature and chemical-potential profiles \(\beta (x)\) and \(\mu (x)\). Using this recipe, the following exact analytical results are obtained: (i) the full time evolution of densities and currents for heat and charge transport, (ii) correlation functions for components of the energy–momentum tensor and the U(1) current as well as for any primary field, and (iii) the thermal and electrical conductivities. The latter are computed by direct dynamical considerations and alternatively using a Green–Kubo formula. Both give the same explicit expressions for the conductivities, which reveal how inhomogeneous dynamics opens up the possibility for diffusion as well as implies a generalization of the Wiedemann–Franz law to finite times within CFT."

Mitochondrial function influences expression of methamphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization,"Repeated methamphetamine use leads to long lasting brain and behavioral changes in humans and laboratory rats. These changes have high energy requirements, implicating a role for mitochondria. We explored whether mitochondrial function underpins behaviors that occur in rats months after stopping methamphetamine self-administration. Accordingly, rats self-administered intravenous methamphetamine for 3 h/day for 14 days. The mitochondrial toxin rotenone was administered as (1 mg/kg/day for 6 days) via an osmotic minipump starting at 0, 14 or 28 days of abstinence abstinence. On abstinence day 61, expression of methamphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization was obtained with an acute methamphetamine challenge in rotenone-free rats. Rotenone impeded the expression of sensitization, with the most robust effects obtained with later abstinence exposure. These findings verified that self-titration of moderate methamphetamine doses results in behavioral (and thus brain) changes that can be revealed months after exposure termination, and that the meth-initiated processes progressed during abstinence so that longer abstinence periods were more susceptible to the consequences of exposure to a mitochondrial toxin."
Biased TCR gene usage in citrullinated Tenascin C specific T-cells in rheumatoid arthritis,"We aimed to search for common features in the autoreactive T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), focusing on the newly identified candidate antigen citrullinated Tenascin C (cit-TNC). Mononuclear cells from peripheral blood or synovial fluid of eight RA-patients positive for the RA-associated HLA-DRB1*04:01 allele were in-vitro cultured with recently identified citrullinated peptides from Tenascin C. Antigen-specific T cells were isolated using peptide-HLA tetramer staining and subsequently single-cell sequenced for paired alpha/beta TCR analyses by bioinformatic tools. TCRs were re-expressed for further studies of antigen-specificity and T cell responses. Autoreactive T cell lines could be grown out from both peripheral blood and synovial fluid. We demonstrate the feasibility of retrieving true autoreactive TCR sequences by validating antigen-specificity in T cell lines with re-expressed TCRs. One of the Tenascin C peptides, cit-TNC22, gave the most robust T cell responses including biased TCR gene usage patterns. The shared TCR-beta chain signature among the cit-TNC22-specific TCRs was evident in blood and synovial fluid of different patients. The identification of common elements in the autoreactive TCR repertoire gives promise to the possibility of both immune monitoring of the autoimmune components in RA and of future antigen- or TCR-targeted specific intervention in subsets of patients."
Global CO2 fertilization of Sphagnum peat mosses via suppression of photorespiration during the twentieth century,"Natural peatlands contribute significantly to global carbon sequestration and storage of biomass, most of which derives from Sphagnum peat mosses. Atmospheric CO2 levels have increased dramatically during the twentieth century, from 280 to > 400 ppm, which has affected plant carbon dynamics. Net carbon assimilation is strongly reduced by photorespiration, a process that depends on the CO2 to O2 ratio. Here we investigate the response of the photorespiration to photosynthesis ratio in Sphagnum mosses to recent CO2 increases by comparing deuterium isotopomers of historical and contemporary Sphagnum tissues collected from 36 peat cores from five continents. Rising CO2 levels generally suppressed photorespiration relative to photosynthesis but the magnitude of suppression depended on the current water table depth. By estimating the changes in water table depth, temperature, and precipitation during the twentieth century, we excluded potential effects of these climate parameters on the observed isotopomer responses. Further, we showed that the photorespiration to photosynthesis ratio varied between Sphagnum subgenera, indicating differences in their photosynthetic capacity. The global suppression of photorespiration in Sphagnum suggests an increased net primary production potential in response to the ongoing rise in atmospheric CO2, in particular for mire structures with intermediate water table depths."
Bedside determination of microcirculatory oxygen delivery and uptake: a prospective observational clinical study for proof of principle,"Assessment of microcirculatory functional capacity is considered to be of prime importance for therapy guidance and outcome prediction in critically ill intensive care patients. Here, we show determination of skin microcirculatory oxygen delivery and consumption rates to be a feasible approach at the patient’s bedside. Real time laser-doppler flowmetry (LDF) and white light spectrophotometry (WLS) were used for assessment of thenar skin microperfusion, regional Hb and postcapillary venous oxygen saturation before and after forearm ischemia. Adapted Fick’s principle equations allowed for calculation of microcirculatory oxygen delivery and uptake. Patient groups with expected different microcirculatory status were compared [control (n = 20), sepsis-1/2 definition criteria identified SIRS (n = 10) and septic shock patients (n = 20), and the latter group further classified according to sepsis-3 definition criteria in sepsis (n = 10) and septic shock (n = 10)], respectively. In otherwise healthy controls, microcirculatory oxygen delivery and uptake approximately doubled after ischemia with maximum values (mDO2max and mVO2max) significantly lower in SIRS or septic patient groups, respectively. Scatter plots of mVO2max and mDO2max values defined a region of unphysiological low values not observed in control but in critically ill patients with the percentage of dots within this region being highest in septic shock patients. LDF and WLS combined with vasoocclusive testing reveals significant differences in microcirculatory oxygen delivery and uptake capacity between control and critically ill patients. As a clinically feasible technique for bedside determination of microcirculatory oxygen delivery and uptake, LDF and WLS combined with vasoocclusive testing holds promise for monitoring of disease progression and/or guidance of therapy at the microcirculatory level to be tested in further clinical trials."
Country-level factors dynamics and ABO/Rh blood groups contribution to COVID-19 mortality,"The identification of factors associated to COVID-19 mortality is important to design effective containment measures and safeguard at-risk categories. In the last year, several investigations have tried to ascertain key features to predict the COVID-19 mortality tolls in relation to country-specific dynamics and population structure. Most studies focused on the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic observed in the first half of 2020. Numerous studies have reported significant associations between COVID-19 mortality and relevant variables, for instance obesity, healthcare system indicators such as hospital beds density, and bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunization. In this work, we investigated the role of ABO/Rh blood groups at three different stages of the pandemic while accounting for demographic, economic, and health system related confounding factors. Using a machine learning approach, we found that the “B+” blood group frequency is an important factor at all stages of the pandemic, confirming previous findings that blood groups are linked to COVID-19 severity and fatal outcome."
Genome-wide analysis uncovers tomato leaf lncRNAs transcriptionally active upon Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato challenge,"Plants rely on (in)direct detection of bacterial pathogens through plasma membrane-localized and intracellular receptor proteins. Surface pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) participate in the detection of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and are required for the activation of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Pathogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) deploys ~ 30 effector proteins into the plant cell that contribute to pathogenicity. Resistant plants are capable of detecting the presence or activity of effectors and mount another response termed effector-triggered immunity (ETI). In order to investigate the involvement of tomato’s long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the immune response against Pst, we used RNA-seq data to predict and characterize those that are transcriptionally active in leaves challenged with a large set of treatments. Our prediction strategy was validated by sequence comparison with tomato lncRNAs described in previous works and by an alternative approach (RT-qPCR). Early PTI (30 min), late PTI (6 h) and ETI (6 h) differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs were identified and used to perform a co-expression analysis including neighboring (± 100 kb) DE protein-coding genes. Some of the described networks could represent key regulatory mechanisms of photosynthesis, PRR abundance at the cell surface and mitigation of oxidative stress, associated to tomato-Pst pathosystem."
Cost-Effectiveness of perioperative Vaginally Administered estrogen in postmenopausal women undergoing prolapse surgery (EVA trial): study protocol for a multicenter double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial,"Surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is associated with high recurrence rates. The costs associated with the treatment of recurrent POP are huge, and the burden from women who encounter recurrent POP, negatively impacts their quality of life. Estrogen therapy might improve surgical outcome for POP due to its potential beneficial effects. It is thought that vaginal estrogen therapy improves healing and long-term maintenance of connective tissue integrity. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of perioperative vaginal estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women undergoing POP surgery."
Linearly implicit local energy-preserving algorithm for a class of multi-symplectic Hamiltonian PDEs,"We give a systematic, linearly implicit, local energy-preserving method for the general multi-symplectic Hamiltonian system with cubic invariants by combining Kahan’s discretization in time and Euler-box discretization in space. The new method is applied to some classical multi-symplectic Hamiltonian partial differential equations to test its effectiveness, efficiency, solution accuracy and energy preservation."

Arithmetic properties for \(\ell \)-regular partition functions with distinct even parts,"Let \(Ped_{\ell }(n)\) denote the number of \(\ell \)-regular partitions of a positive integer n into distinct even parts.

We also prove the infinite families of congruences modulo 9, 12, 18 and 24 for \(Ped_{9}(n).\) For example, for any \(\alpha \ge 0\) and \(1\le r\le p-1\), we have"
"Effect of inhomogeneity, initial stress, sandiness, and viscosity on the propagation of torsional wave","This model is established to analyse the analytical assessment and mathematical modelling to  unveil the characteristics of torsional wave in an inhomogeneous sandy layer rested upon a viscoelastic half-space. It has been considered that the assumed model is under compressive initial stress. To acquire the required dispersion equation, the appropriate boundary conditions with the assistance of displacement and stress components have been well satisfied. The main objective of this study is to analyse the impact of different affecting parameters such as inhomogeneity, sandiness, compressive initial stress, tensile initial stress and viscosity on the propagation of torsional wave. In a particular case, it has been shown that dispersion equation is in well agreement with the standard result which validates the undertaken study."
Thermal analysis of hypersonic reactive flows on the SARA Brazilian satellite reentry trajectory,"Numerical simulations of hypersonic flows are presented for the Brazilian satellite SARA undergoing atmospheric reentry. The Navier–Stokes equations are numerically solved by the finite volume method with the inclusion of chemical source terms to model the effects of dissociation and ionization. The two-temperature model proposed by Park is employed to analyze the translational–rotational and vibrational–electronic temperature modes. Despite the low density conditions, which lead to high mean free paths, a comparison of the present results against those obtained by DSMC shows that the present calculations are sufficiently accurate even at the highest altitude considered. Moreover, estimates of the Knudsen numbers for the present test cases indicate that they are sufficiently low to justify the continuum model. A mesh refinement study is carried out in order to evaluate the influence of near-wall mesh spacing and the number of volumes in the normal and longitudinal directions of the flow on the calculation of the heat flux over the satellite surface. Analysis of the results shows that thermodynamic non-equilibrium occurs along the entire reentry trajectory of the satellite. While for high altitudes the flow density is extremely low, at lower altitudes supersonic conditions are achieved and, in both cases, chemical reactions are not relevant. On the other hand, for some intermediate altitudes of the reentry trajectory, thermodynamic non-equilibrium is severely affected by the chemical reactions. In these cases, a weak ionization occurs besides dissociation of the gas species and the accurate prediction of the surface heat flux requires a reactive gas model."
Digital Transformation in Medical Affairs Sparked by the Pandemic: Insights and Learnings from COVID-19 Era and Beyond,"A number of developments, including increasing regulatory and compliance scrutiny, increased transparency expectations, an increasingly vocal patient, patient centricity and greater requirements for real-world evidence, have driven the growth and importance of medical affairs as a trusted, science-driven partner over the past decade. The healthcare environment is shifting towards a digital, data-driven and payor-focused model. Likewise, medical affairs as a function within the pharmaceutical industry has become more “patient-centric” with strategic engagements embracing payers and patients apart from clinicians. The pandemic has impacted the healthcare industry as well as the function of medical affairs in numerous ways and has brought new challenges and demands to tackle. There is indeed a silver lining due to intense digital transformation within this crisis. The emerging digital innovation and new technologies in healthcare, medical education and virtual communications are likely to stay and advance further. In this review, we discuss how the digital transformation sparked by the pandemic has impacted the medical affairs function in pharmaceuticals and provide further insights and learnings from the COVID-19 era and beyond. Based on the learning and insights, digital innovation in three key strategic imperatives of medical affairs—HCP engagement, external partnerships and data generation will enable medical affairs to become future-fit as a strategic leadership function."

Dual antiplatelet therapy before coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with myocardial infarction: a prospective cohort study,"Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients with MI who are candidates for early coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can affect intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of DAPT up to the day before CABG on the outcomes during and after surgery in patients with MI."
Towards automatic detection and prioritization of pre-logging overhead: a case study of hadoop ecosystem,"The pre-logging overhead refers to the overhead produced by pre-logging statements (PLS), which are used to construct the parameters of logging calls. In practice, these logging-related statements are usually guarded by conditional statements, known as logging guards, to ensure that they are only executed when necessary (e.g., at the debugging phase). However, developers occasionally forget to add logging guards to costly PLS, resulting in missing logging guards (MLG) issues, which can have a significant impact on performance, particularly for high-throughput software, and lead to critical performance issues. In this paper, (1) we conduct the first empirical study of 137 commits addressing MLG issues in five popular open-source software of the Hadoop ecosystem. Based on the results, we reveal five findings of the current practice of logging guards. (2) We devise an accurate algorithm to detect PLSs (over 95% in precision and recall) and find out 16 problematic partially guarded logging calls (10 of them are confirmed and fixed by developers). (3) We investigate two metric-based ranking approaches using six software metrics to prioritize PLSs based on their impact on performance. We discover that the execution frequency of PLSs achieves the best performance, and combining multiple software metrics can improve performance (7.8% on average)."
Regularized ridge regression models to estimate static elastic moduli from wireline measurements: case study from Southern Iraq,"Elastic moduli such as Young’s modulus (E), Poisson’s ratio (v), and bulk modulus (K) are vital to creating geomechanical models for wellbore stability, hydraulic fracturing, sand production, etc. Due to the difficulty of obtaining core samples and performing rock testing, alternatively, wireline measurements can be used to estimate dynamic moduli. However, dynamic moduli are significantly different from elastic moduli due to many factors. In this paper, correlations for three zones (Nahr Umr shale, Zubair shale, and Zubair sandstone) located in southern Iraq were created to estimate static E, K, and ν from dynamic data. Core plugs from the aforementioned three zones alongside wireline measurements for the same sections were acquired. Single-stage triaxial (SST) tests with CT scans were executed for the core plugs. The data were separated into two parts; training (70%), and testing (30%) to ensure the models can be generalized to new data. Regularized ridge regression models were created to estimate static E, K, and ν from dynamic data (wireline measurements). The shrinkage parameter (α) was selected for each model based on an iterative process, where the goal is to ensure having the smallest error. The results showed that all models had testing R2 ranging between 0.92 and 0.997 and consistent with the training results. All models of E, K, and ν were linear besides ν for the Zubair sandstone and shale which were second-degree polynomial. Furthermore, root means squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were utilized to assess the error of the models. Both RMSE and MAE were consistently low in training and testing without a large discrepancy. Thus, with the regularization of ridge regression and consistent low error during the training and testing, it can be concluded that the proposed models can be generalized to new data and no overfitting can be observed. The proposed models for Nahr Umr shale, Zubair shale, and Zubair sandstone can be utilized to estimate E, K, and ν based on readily available dynamic data which can contribute to creating robust geomechanical models for hydraulic fracturing, sand production, wellbore stability, etc."
MMFGAN: A novel multimodal brain medical image fusion based on the improvement of generative adversarial network,"In recent years, the multimodal medical imaging assisted diagnosis and treatment technology has developed rapidly. In brain disease diagnosis, CT-SPECT, MRI-PET and MRI-SPECT fusion images are more favored by brain doctors because they contain both soft tissue structure information and organ metabolism information. Most of the previous medical image fusion algorithms are the migration of other types of image fusion methods and such operations often lose the features of the medical image itself. This paper proposes a multimodal medical image fusion model based on the residual attention mechanism of the generative adversarial network. In the design of the generator, we construct the residual attention mechanism block and the concat detail texture block. After source images are concatenated to a matrix , the matrix is put into two blocks at the same time to extract information such as size, shape, spatial location and texture details. The obtained features are put into the merge block to reconstruct the image. The obtained reconstructed image and source images are respectively put into two discriminators for correction to obtain the final fused image. The model has been experimented on the images of three databases and achieved good fusion results. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations prove that the model is superior to other comparison algorithms in terms of image fusion quality and detail information retention."
L-Proline catalyzed one-pot three-component synthesis and evaluation for biological activities of tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran: evaluation by green chemistry metrics,"A series of tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyrans derivatives were synthesized with substituted pyrazole carbaldehydes, malononitrile and dimedone by ecofriendly L-proline catalyst in aqueous ethanol. The synthesized compounds were characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and Mass spectral techniques. This method holds the advantages of one-pot multicomponent, simple synthetic route, mild reaction conditions, high yield, use of less toxic chemicals and use of eco-friendly catalyst. We also report the study of the synthetic protocol by green chemistry metrics indicates a green relevance. Also, synthesized compounds were screened for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. Most of the tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyrans derivatives exhibit excellent activity."
Stability and eradication of tumor in a model with almost periodically radiated cells,"In this work, we propose a model with almost periodic radiation cancer treatment which describes the dynamics of cell populations in a tumor. We establish conditions that warranty bounded asymptotic limits: either vanishing tumor or almost periodic oscillations in the tissue. The proof of these results use the theory of cooperative systems. We also give sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the almost periodic solution or the vanishing equilibrium, which then become global attractors. Numerical simulations are performed using specific radiation functions to illustrate our analytical findings."
Three-Phased Risk-Management Benchmark for Internationalization of Small and Medium-Sized Construction Companies,"Small and medium-sized construction companies (SMCCs) typically lack the international experience of their large counterparts. International construction projects often are more uncertain than domestic projects, which can pique SMCCs’ interest or necessity for external benchmarks of best practices. This study aims to provide a three-phased risk-management benchmark framework for the internationalization of SMCCs. The first-phase benchmarking evaluates how well companies prepare to undertake business abroad and what capabilities they should improve upon based on comparative data from 41 SMCCs. The second-phase benchmarking provides risk information from 49 international subcontract projects that must be managed for SMCCs. In the last phase, the benchmark delivers subcontractor risk-response strategies through the analysis of 134 international-contractual cases. Additionally, the three illustrative cases show that the benchmark framework and metrics are quite helpful for decision-makers and SMCC practitioners in evaluating and responding to their international construction project risks."
Local radiotherapy and E7 RNA-LPX vaccination show enhanced therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of HPV16+ cancer,"Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is a causative agent for several cancers types (genital, anal and head and neck region). The HPV E6 and E7 proteins are oncogenic drivers and thus are ideal candidates for therapeutic vaccination. We recently reported that a novel ribonucleic acid lipoplex (RNA-LPX)-based HPV16 vaccine, E7 RNA-LPX, mediates regression of mouse HPV16+ tumors and establishes protective T cell memory. An HPV16 E6/E7 RNA-LPX vaccine is currently being investigated in two phase I and II clinical trials in various HPV-driven cancer types; however, it remains a high unmet medical need for treatments for patients with radiosensitive HPV16+ tumors. Therefore, we set out to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of E7 RNA-LPX vaccine combined with standard-of-care local radiotherapy (LRT). We demonstrate that E7 RNA-LPX synergizes with LRT in HPV16+ mouse tumors, with potent therapeutic effects exceeding those of either monotherapy. Mode of action studies revealed that the E7 RNA-LPX vaccine induced high numbers of intratumoral-E7-specific CD8+ T cells, rendering cold tumors immunologically hot, whereas LRT primarily acted as a cytotoxic therapy, reducing tumor mass and intratumor hypoxia by predisposing tumor cells to antigen-specific T cell-mediated killing. Overall, LRT enhanced the effector function of E7 RNA-LPX-primed T cell responses. The therapeutic synergy was dependent on total radiation dose, rather than radiation dose-fractionation. Together, these results show that LRT synergizes with E7 RNA-LPX and enhances its anti-tumor activity against HPV16+ cancer models. This work paves into a new translational therapy for HPV16+ cancer patients."
"Site selection for managed aquifer recharge in the city of Kabul, Afghanistan, using a multi-criteria decision analysis and geographic information system","While the success and sustainability of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) strongly depends on many characteristics of the site, it is necessary to integrate the site characteristics and develop suitability maps to indicate the most suitable locations. The objective of this study is to integrate geographic information system (GIS) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques to identify the most suitable areas for a MAR project in the Kabul city area, Afghanistan. Data for six effective criteria, including slope, drainage density, surface infiltration rate, unsaturated zone thickness, soil type and electrical conductivity, were collected and then a classification map was produced for each criterion in the GIS environment. By applying MCDA techniques, the weights of the effective criteria were obtained. A suitability map was generated from each technique separately based on a combination of all criteria weights and thematic layers. The result of the analytical network process (ANP) method was found to be more precise and reliable compared with that of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method. Based on the final suitability map produced from the ANP model, there is 3.7, 15.0, 37.4, 33.1 and 10.3% of the total area that is unsuitable, of low suitability, moderately suitable, suitable and very suitable for MAR application, respectively. As a final result of this work, seven sites have been prioritized based on land use. The integration of multi-criteria decision analysis and GIS is recognized as an effective method for the selection of managed aquifer recharge sites."
Morphologic analysis of hysteretic behavior of China Laizhou Bay submarine mucky clay and its cyclic failure criteria,"The cyclic response of soil seabed under longs-term cyclic loading is critical to foundation stability of offshore wind turbines (OWT); therefore, the accurate analysis and design of foundation structure of OWT require a clear understanding of the dynamic characteristics of submarine soil. While existing studies mostly concentrate on the cyclic stress–strain and pore-water pressure behavior, this paper investigates and quantifies the morphological development of hysteretic behavior based on a series of dynamic triaxial testing results. Four morphological parameters are introduced to quantitatively describe the hysteretic behavior, i.e., the non-closure degree, length–width ratio, inclination, area. Two distinct development laws of morphological parameters against number of cycles are observed, i.e., the destructive mode under large cyclic stress ratio (CSR) and the stable mode under small CSR. Furthermore, soil specimens under different cyclic stress paths were divide into three failure states, i.e., failure state, critical state, and stable state, and the cyclic failure criteria by analyzing cumulative strain development and energy dissipation were discussed and proposed. This provides a fundamental reference for investigating engineering geology properties of submarine clay under long-term cyclic loading."

Effect of Social Groups on Crowd Movement in Mass Religious Gatherings: A Case Study of Kumbh Mela,"In mass religious gatherings like Kumbh Mela, where participation of groups is much higher than individuals, studying the impact of groups on the macroscopic parameters is imperative. Although many researchers have studied group behaviour and its dynamics, the effect of the presence of groups in different group sizes on crowd movement is seldom studied. This paper tries to strengthen the existing literature by studying the impact of the presence of groups and group sizes on crowd movement in two major attractions of Kumbh Mela-2016. The average speed was found to decrease as the group size increased. Further, while comparing the groups’ speeds with isolated pedestrian speeds, it was inferred that the presence of groups slows overall crowd movement. This is done assuming a location as an isolated pedestrian section, based on a few criteria. This study will help bring out interesting insights on the effect of groups in the crowd and uncover their impact on the overall speed of the crowd. This study can also help the event planners and managers to take proper crowd management measures (such as appropriate barricading, streamlining the flow, etc.) whenever there is a reduction in speeds at the ghat or temple regions."
Porous hydroxyapatite scaffold produced using Musa paradisiaca template and its in vitro bioactivity,"The effect of HA amount on the physical properties and bioactivity of porous HA prepared by replica method using Musa paradisiaca as template has been studied. The templates were prepared by cutting the banana fronds into cylindrical shape. Slurries were prepared by mixing 9, 10, and 11 g HA with 11% sago starch, 2.5% Darvan821A, and distilled water. Slurries then stirred at 150 rpm for 24 h. Templates were impregnated into slurry and then dried at 110°C for 2 h. The green bodies were burned at 600°C for 1 h followed by sintering at 1250°C for 1 h. Porous HA was tested in vitro using simulated body fluid solution by soaking for 7–14 days. The cell attachment done by using Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK21) cell. The porous HA was produced with shrinkage in the range of 53.6–58.9%vol, density of 1.26–1.47 g/cm3, porosity of 53.5–60.1%, and compressive strength of 3.89–4 MPa. The pore size was obtained at the range 71.26–89.13 μm. The biodegradation rate of samples was found at the range of 1.34–2.27% with the increased apatite and carbonate content on porous HA after immersion proven by FTIR result. The cell attachment test showed that the viability of HA was 80.3% confirming that samples were non-toxic material."
Archaeal and Bacterial Diversity and Distribution Patterns in Mediterranean-Climate Vernal Pools of Mexico and the Western USA,"Biogeographic patterns in microorganisms are poorly understood, despite the importance of microbial communities for a range of ecosystem processes. Our knowledge of microbial ecology and biogeography is particularly deficient in rare and threatened ecosystems. We tested for three ecological patterns in microbial community composition within ephemeral wetlands—vernal pools—located across Baja California (Mexico) and California (USA): (1) habitat filtering; (2) a latitudinal diversity gradient; and (3) distance decay in community composition. Paired water and soil samples were collected along a latitudinal transect of vernal pools, and bacterial and archaeal communities were characterized using 16S rDNA sequencing. We identified two main microbial communities, with one community present in the soil matrix that included archaeal and bacterial soil taxa, and another community present in the overlying water that was dominated by common freshwater bacterial taxa. Aquatic microbial communities were more diverse in the north, and displayed a significant but inverted latitudinal diversity pattern. Aquatic communities also exhibited a significant distance-decay pattern, with geographic proximity, and precipitation explaining part of the community variation. Collectively these results indicate greater sensitivity to spatial and environmental variation in vernal pool aquatic microbial communities than in soil microbial communities. We conclude that vernal pool aquatic microbial communities can display distribution patterns similar to those exhibited by larger organisms, but differ in some key aspects, such as the latitudinal gradient in diversity."
Recombinant invasive Lactobacillus plantarum expressing the J subgroup avian leukosis virus Gp85 protein induces protection against avian leukosis in chickens,"Avian leukosis, caused by avian leukosis virus (ALV), is an infectious tumor disease and severely hinders the development of the poultry industry. The use of Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) could effectively alleviate viremia in the early period of J subgroup ALV (ALV-J) infection. In this study, an invasive L. plantarum NC8 expressing Gp85 protein of ALV-J was constructed. After chickens were orally administered the recombinant invasive NC8, the levels of expression of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood and spleen by flow cytometry and the proliferation ability of splenocytes by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay were examined, and the contents of cytokines, the anti-ALV-J antibody in serum, and mucosal antibody sIgA in intestinal lavage fluid were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The immunoprotective efficiency was evaluated by monitoring the infection rate, the percent of cloacal swabs and survival, body weight gain, the organ indexes, and relative virus loads after challenge with ALV-J. The results showed that the recombinant invasive strain (FnBPA-gp85) could promote the expression levels of the CD8+T cells in peripheral blood and spleen, the proliferation of splenocytes, the secretions of cytokines interleukin 2 (IL-2) and γ-interferon (IFN-γ), and the production of IgG and sIgA compared with the PBS and FnBPA control groups in chickens. The FnBPA-gp85 group was exhibited the highest immune protection against ALV-J infection. The above results indicated that the recombinant invasive NC8 could promote the cellular immunity, humoral immunity, and mucosal immunity responses in chicken and provide a new method for exploring the live vaccine against ALV-J."
Rational design of novel fusion rabies glycoproteins displaying a major antigenic site of foot-and-mouth disease virus for vaccine applications,"Chimeric virus-like particles are self-assembling structures composed of viral proteins that had been modified to incorporate sequences from different organisms, being able to trigger immune responses against the heterologous sequence. However, the identification of suitable sites for that purpose in the carrier protein is not an easy task. In this work, we describe the generation of rabies chimeric VLPs that expose a major antigenic site of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) by identifying suitable regions in rabies glycoprotein (RVG), as a proof of concept of a novel heterologous display platform for vaccine applications. To identify adequate sites for insertion of heterologous sequences without altering the correct folding of RVG, we identified regions that were evolutionally non-conserved in Lyssavirus glycoproteins and performed a structural analysis of those regions using a 3D model of RVG trimer that we generated. The heterologous sequence was inserted in three different sites within RVG sequence. In every case, it did not affect the correct folding of the protein and was surface exposed, being recognized by anti-FMDV antibodies in expressing cells as well as in the surface of VLPs. This work sets the base for the development of a heterologous antigen display platform based on rabies VLPs."
Linear inversion-imaging method based on joint primary reflected waves and surface-related multiples,"In marine seismic exploration, especially in deep-water and hard ocean-bottom cases, free-surface multiples are strongly developed. Compared with primary waves, the wider illumination aperture of the multiples is beneficial for high-resolution seismic imaging. In this study, by introducing a new compound source composed of primaries and free-surface multiples and by ignoring internal multiples, we derive a new linearized forward problem (free-surface-multiple prediction model) under a weak-scattering assumption (i.e., first-order Born approximation). On the basis of the new linearized problem, we propose a joint inversion-imaging method by simultaneously using the primaries and free-surface multiples under the general framework of least square inversion. To eliminate the crosstalk artifacts introduced by the cross-correlation of multiples with different orders, we prove that the crosstalk artifacts can be gradually eliminated during the inversion if a proper step length is selected. Synthetic- and field-data tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
"Achievements, experiences and challenges of the battle against poverty in China’s ethnic minority areas: focusing on the “three areas and three prefectures”","The incidence of poverty in three of China’s provinces (Qinghai, Guizhou and Yunnan) and five of its autonomous regions (Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Tibet, Ningxia, and Xinjiang) is greater than the national average. As severely impoverished areas in China and top priorities in the country’s battle against poverty, ethnic minority areas, especially the most impoverished “three areas” (the Tibet Autonomous Region, prefectures and counties with large Tibetan populations in the provinces of Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu and Yunnan, and the Hotan, Aksu, Kashgar prefectures and Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture in southern Xinjiang) and the “three prefectures” (the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, and the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu Province) showed a significant reduction in poverty and achieved decisive progress in poverty elimination from 2018 to 2019. This laid a solid foundation for the building of a moderately prosperous society in an all respects by 2020. By reviewing and explaining methods and measures of targeted poverty alleviation used in ethnic minority areas of China, this paper summarizes the most successful experiences of these areas, particularly the “Three Areas and Three Prefectures”, in the process of alleviating poverty and building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. These successful experiences consist of four aspects: roles of national systems, promotion of key poverty alleviation efforts, improved mechanisms and systems for targeted poverty alleviation, and specific innovative methods and measures. While examining the difficulties of eliminating poverty and building a moderately prosperous society in all respects in China’s ethnic minority areas, especially in the “Three Areas and Three Prefectures”, this article also discusses practical challenges and problems yet to be solved, such as follow-up adjustments of poverty alleviation policies, cultivation of self-development capacity and weak educational foundations. Ultimately, this paper offers relevant solutions and suggestions in relation to macro policies, government officials and impoverished groups."
"Habitat-, age-, and sex-related alterations in oxidative stress biomarkers in the blood of mute swans (Cygnus olor) inhabiting pomeranian coastal areas (Northern Poland)","The mute swan (Cygnus olor) can be considered a representative species of birds associated with the aquatic environment and responding very clearly to changes in the environment. Assuming that the condition of the mute swan population well reflects the state of the environment, this species was used in our research as a bioindicative species. Thus, the aim of our study was to elucidate the association between metal contents in soil samples collected from a habitat of mute swans and element contents in their feathers as well as the levels of biomarkers of lipid peroxidation, oxidatively modified proteins, and total antioxidant capacity in the blood of mute swans living in three agglomerations in coastal areas in the southern part of the Baltic Sea (Pomeranian region, northern Poland). We compared the effects of inhabitation, age, and sex on the ecophysiological accumulation of metals in three wintering populations of the mute swan from coastal areas of northern Poland, i.e., Słupsk, Gdynia, and Sopot. In Słupsk, the anthropogenic pressure was related predominantly to the level of Al and, to a lesser extent, to the content of Rh and Ru. We found maximum levels of lipid peroxidation biomarkers in the blood of the mute swans from Gdynia (38.20 ± 6.35 nmol MDA·mL−1). At the same time, maximum levels of aldehydic and ketonic derivatives of oxidatively modified proteins were noted in the blood of swans from Sopot compared to the values obtained in mute swans from Słupsk and Gdynia. This trend suggesting high levels of oxidative stress biomarkers was also confirmed by a decrease in the total antioxidant capacity in these groups."
Development of well complexity calculator and its integration into standard well engineering management system/well delivery system,"Oil and gas well drilling is the most important and complex task for oil and gas exploration. It is not necessary that design and execution complexity remain the same for two different wells even in the same field. It is possible to have a very complex well to drill after a very straightforward simple well being drilled earlier in the same field. Making correlation or comparison of any of the two or more than two oil and gas drilling wells is an ongoing debate in the petroleum industry. Generally, companies compare the oil and gas drilling wells on a single or two parameters, for example: time versus depth, directional trajectories, well cost and/or other single factors in disengagement of one another. In order to compare two different types of oil and gas drilling wells, having distinctive design, drilling and fluid program and challenges, a scientific rating system is required, which can relate various wells with one another. In this research paper, a calculator named Well Complexity Calculator has been developed to measure the complexity of the oil and gas well drilling by using different parameters. All these parameters are commonly affecting the drilling program and its execution. Secondly, a methodology is designed for integration of Well Complexity Calculator into standard Well Engineering Management System/Well Delivery System for better execution of drilling program. Fifty-one (51) oil and gas drilling well complexity parameters have been utilized to develop Well Complexity Calculator, where they are categorized into three main complexities types named Design Well Complexity, Geological Well Complexity and Project Well Complexity. Design and Geological Well Complexities combine to form Drilling Well Complexity, and then Drilling Well Complexity and Project Well Complexity combine to form Well Complexity. Median, Mode and Monte Carlo simulation techniques were chosen to develop the calculator where Median showed best suited results and was accordingly chosen for the final calculator. Sixty-six (66) actual oil and gas wells’ camouflaged drilling data were used to analyze and fine tune the developed Well Complexity Calculator. Output complexities of these wells were falling in different complexity levels. Moreover, it was seen that the number of low, high and medium complexity wells was different for Design, Geological, Project, Drilling and Well Complexities which is in line with the real-world scenario."
A step too far or a step in the wrong direction? A critique of the 2014 Amendment to the Belgian Euthanasia Act,"In 2014, Article 3 of the the Belgian Euthanasia Act (2002) (the Euthanasia Act) was amended (‘the Amendment’) to include the ‘capacity for discernment’ requirement. This paper explores the implications of this highly controversial Amendment. I remain unconvinced of the benefits for children < 12 years old suffering chronic or terminal illnesses. In Part One, I argue that the phrase ‘capacity for discernment’ is problematic and vulnerable to abuse; neither a consistent, widely accepted definition of the phrase has been established nor a standardised method or procedure to adequately gauge a minor’s capacity for discernment. In Part Two I advance the argument that specifically for children < 12 years, aggressive and sophisticated paediatric palliative care treatment, which risks, but does not intend death, is more ethically justified than Euthanasia treatment. A definition of a child’s interests is best achieved through a care-based ethics framework; namely, the child’s relationship with their parents and family members, their doctors and medical practitioners is held to be an interest of crucial importance for the child. I conclude that paediatric palliative care arguably better promotes and upholds this interest."
Fetal information as shared information: using NIPT to test for adult-onset conditions,"The possibilities of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) are expanding, and the use of NIPT for adult-onset conditions may become widely available in the near future. If parents use NIPT to test for these conditions, and the pregnancy is continued, they will have information about the child’s genetic predisposition from birth. In this paper, we argue that prospective parents should be able to access NIPT for an adult-onset condition, even when they have no intention to terminate the pregnancy. We begin by outlining the arguments against testing in such a situation, which generally apply the same considerations that apply in the predictive testing of a minor to the fetus in utero. We then contend, firstly, that there are important practical considerations that support availability of testing for prospective parents regardless of their stated intentions. Secondly, we object to the ethical equation of a fetus in utero with a minor. We base our analysis on a view of pregnancy that conceptualises the fetus as a part of the gestational parent, as opposed to the more common ‘container’ model of pregnancy. We suggest that fetal information is best conceptualised as shared information between the gestational parent and future child. Thus, it should be approached in similar ways as other kinds of shared information (such as genetic information with implications for family members), where a person has a claim over their own information, but should be encouraged to consider the interests of other relevant parties."
The Bohr Inequality for the Generalized Cesáro Averaging Operators,"The main aim of this paper is to prove a generalization of the classical Bohr theorem and as an application, we obtain a counterpart of Bohr theorem for the generalized Cesáro operator."
Sugarcane Genetic Diversity and Major Germplasm Collections,"Genetic diversity present in the sugarcane germplasm, among different Saccharum species and related taxa, represents a large reservoir of genes to develop new varieties and hybrids for any character or ecosystem. Every country engaged in sugarcane improvement retains a collection of sugarcane clones, which evolves over time with new additions. Sugarcane improvement became a professionally directed and scientific endeavour in the early twentieth century. At around this time researchers in India and Indonesia also developed inter-specific hybrids between Saccharum officinarum and S. spontaneum, which formed the founding clones for variety development worldwide. Since then, inter-specific crosses formed the basis for the development of the modern sugarcane industry globally. Deleterious effects of climate, human activities and growing importance of the crop for the production of sugar, ethanol and energy from its biomass add to the importance of research attention to preserve, characterize and utilize accessions from all the genera in the Saccharum complex in a systematic way. It is obvious that the genetic resources have been utilized to a considerable extent by different workers, although success in terms of released varieties has been limited to a handful of ancestor clones from S. officinarum, S. spontaneum and S. barberi. However, reports of many hybrids developed from various species combinations, several of which are novel creations, have attained commercial-level or near-commercial-level clones are encouraging. All the activities connected with collection, preservation, characterization, documentation and utilization should aim to be more systematic through conventional breeding, genomic breeding and gene harvesting. Aided by the powerful molecular, genomic and bioinformatics tools, the genetic diversity available in the germplasm offers opportunities to design and develop sugarcane varieties with substantial yield improvement under any situations and for generating diversified products in the coming years."
Prime number factorization using a spinor Bose–Einstein condensate-inspired topological quantum computer,"Inspired by non-abelian vortex anyons in spinor Bose–Einstein condensates, we consider the quantum double \(\mathcal {D}(\mathbb {Q}_8)\) anyon model as a platform to carry out a particular instance of Shor’s factorization algorithm. We suggest that the \(\mathcal {D}(\mathbb {Q}_8)\) anyon model could be realized by a specific low-temperature phase of a spin-2 Bose–Einstein condensate. We provide the excitation spectrum for this model, as well as the fusion rules, braid group representations, and a circuit architecture that facilitates the computation. All necessary quantum gates, less one, can be compiled exactly for this hybrid topological quantum computer. The required non-topological gate could be implemented using measurement based protocols. To analyze the effect of decoherence on the non-topological gate, a noise model based on stochastic unitary rotations is considered. The computational potential of this quantum double anyon model is similar to that of the Majorana fermion-based Ising anyon model, thus offering a complementary future platform for topological quantum computation."
"Connecting Grammatical Person, Humanness, and Discourse Functions: Always Progressives as a Case Study","Because they reflect such important pragmatic and cognitive aspects of discourse, grammatical person and humanness merit special consideration in the analysis of any linguistic structure containing nominals. Progressive verbs tend to take human and volitional subjects, a pattern one might predict extends to always progressives used as complaints, e.g., you’re always muttering. (Being agentive, humans can be held accountable for irritating actions.) This functional, corpus-based study explores the relationship between the functions of 1233 always progressives and features of their grammatical subjects. Tokens were coded by subject type (first person pronoun [1PP], addressee ﻿you [Addr], generic you [Gen], third party [3P], or nonhuman [NH]) and function (complaint, lament, positive evaluation, or emotionally neutral description). A configural frequency analysis indicated that the combinations 3P-Complain, 3P-Positive, and Addr-Complain were more frequent than expected and the combinations 1PP-Complain, NH-Complain, Gen-Complain, 1PP-Positive, and 3P-Describe were less frequent. I propose sociological explanations for these findings, such as a reluctance to brag and the fact that gossip—the sharing of negative information about third parties—serves crucial social functions. In addition, I show that generic you is semantically and functionally similar to the 1PP, and that, given this, analyses should not conflate generic and addressee you."
Microstructural-mechanical co-relation for Al2O3 reinforced aluminum metallic foam processed by compaction and sintering,"This present work represented a low porous Al2O3-AMF, based on two processing parameters: compaction pressure (60 and 90 MPa) and alumina powder (120 microns, 2% and 4% Al2O3 addition). Initially, pure aluminum powder of 81 microns and fine alumina powder of 120 microns were ball milled, also influenced by the gelatin gel for binding strength. After the ball milling process, the mixture was compacted inside the closed die under a pressure of 60 and 90 MPa before the sintering process. The sintering process was conducted in a conventional way inside the muffle furnace for a temperature range of 1080 °C. Compaction and micro-indentation hardness were evaluated along with the optical microscopic view, microstructure, and XRD results for the generated interfaces during the process. Results reveal that with the addition of Al2O3, compaction and hardness properties have been improved, and Al2O3 is a crucial parameter for the improvement of the properties."
Applying Ramseyfication to Infrared Spectroscopy,"The so-called Ramsey–Carnap approach, or Ramseyfication, has gone out of fashion in the philosophy of science. Advocates have tried to argue for a revival by writing methodological and metatheoretical studies of Ramseyfication. For this paper I have chosen a different approach; I will apply Ramseyfication to infrared spectroscopy—a method used in analytical chemistry—in order to logically analyse the relation between measurements and mathematical structures. My aim in doing so is to contribute to the debate about the Application Problem of Mathematics, thereby making a case for Ramseyfication as a method of study for scientific theories."
Image denoising based on global image similar patches searching and HOSVD to patches tensor,"Nonlocal self-similarity of natural image is an essential property for image processing. But how to measure the similarity between different patches and how to better exploit the similarity of patches are two crucial problems for image denoising. In this article, we establish a novel image denoising method based on a global image similar patches searching method and the similar patches tensor high-order singular value decomposition theory. Particularly, in order to find the reasonable similar patches to a reference, a variant of Gaussian mixture model (GMM) global similar patches searching method is proposed, and the graph process unit-based GMM model training method is performed to speed up the training process. Furthermore, the k-means and the local inter-class searching are used to improve on the similarity measure between patches. To better exploit the similarity of patches to image denoising, we rearrange similar patches to a tensor for each reference, and an iterative adaptive weighted tensor low-rank approximation method is established to perform image denoising. Experimental results clearly show that the proposed method is comparable to many recent denoising algorithms from the PNSR, SSIM and NCC viewpoint. For higher noise level (e.g., \(sigma=50\)), the performance of our proposed algorithm evinces a 0.06-unit, 0.05-unit and 0.12-unit improvement in the PNSR, SSIM and NCC score, respectively, when compared to state-of-the-art."
Heptagon functions and seven-gluon amplitudes in multi-Regge kinematics,"We compute all 2 → 5 gluon scattering amplitudes in planar \( \mathcal{N} \) = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory in the multi-Regge limit that is sensitive to the non-trivial (“long”) Regge cut. We provide the amplitudes through four loops and to all logarithmic accuracy at leading power, in terms of single-valued multiple polylogarithms of two variables. To obtain these results, we leverage the function-level results for the amplitudes in the Steinmann cluster bootstrap. To high powers in the series expansion in the two variables, our results agree with the recently conjectured all-order central emission vertex used in the Fourier-Mellin representation of amplitudes in multi-Regge kinematics. Our results therefore provide a resummation of the Fourier-Mellin residues into single-valued polylogarithms, and constitute an important cross-check between the bootstrap approach and the all-orders multi-Regge proposal."
Extracting bigravity from string theory,"The origin of the graviton from string theory is well understood: it corresponds to a massless state in closed string spectra, whose low-energy effective action, as extracted from string scattering amplitudes, is that of Einstein-Hilbert. In this work, we explore the possibility of such a string-theoretic emergence of ghost-free bimetric theory, a recently proposed theory that involves two dynamical metrics, that around particular backgrounds propagates the graviton and a massive spin-2 field, which has been argued to be a viable dark matter candidate. By choosing to identify the latter with a massive spin-2 state of open string spectra, we compute tree-level three-point string scattering amplitudes that describe interactions of the massive spin-2 with itself and with the graviton. With the mass of the external legs depending on the string scale, we discover that extracting the corresponding low-energy effective actions in four spacetime dimensions is a subtle but consistent process and proceed to appropriately compare them with bimetric theory. Our findings consist in establishing that string and bimetric theory provide to lowest order the same set of two-derivative terms describing the interactions of the massive spin-2 with itself and with the graviton, albeit up to numerical coefficient discrepancies, a fact that we analyze and interpret. We conclude with a mention of future investigations."
Electrostatic theory of rectangular waveguides filled with anisotropic media,"The electrostatic (or, in a better word, quasi-electrostatic) theory of waves propagation in a long, rectangular waveguide having perfect electric conductor walls that filled with an anisotropic medium (here, a medium of nanowire-based hyperbolic metamaterials) is presented. Some data on characteristics of these waves are prepared. The presented results include electrostatic field configurations (modes) that can be supported by such structures and their corresponding cutoff frequencies, group velocities, power flows and storage energies."
"Does it pay to be an ethical leader in entrepreneurship? An investigation of the relationships between entrepreneurs’ regulatory focus, ethical leadership, and small firm growth","In this research, we use regulatory focus theory and ethical leadership theory to explore the dispositional and behavioral mechanisms of individual entrepreneurs that contribute to small firm growth. While previous research has mainly investigated the outcomes of regulatory focus and ethical leadership in a managerial and subordinate setting, little attention has been paid to such relationships in an entrepreneurial setting in which entrepreneurs and their personalities impact small firms’ growth. The purpose of the study is to uncover whether promotion or prevention focus is related to entrepreneurs’ ethical leadership, and whether entrepreneurs’ self-evaluation of their ethical leadership style is associated with small firm growth. Drawing from a dataset of 166 entrepreneurs and applying SEM analysis, we found that promotion focus, rather than prevention focus, is positively related to ethical leadership and that ethical leadership is positively and significantly related to small firm growth. The study emphasizes that entrepreneurs’ ethical leadership can enhance small firm growth, and therefore it pays off for entrepreneurs to be ethical leaders."

Socioeconomic inequalities in access and use of skilled birth attendants during childbirth in Ghana: a decomposition analysis,"Equitable access to skilled birth attendance during delivery is vital for reducing global maternal deaths to 70 deaths per 100, 000 to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Although several initiatives have been implemented to reduce maternal mortality in Ghana, inequalities in access to skilled birth attendance during delivery still exist among women of different socioeconomic groups. This study assesses the socioeconomic inequalities in access and use of skilled birth attendants during delivery in Ghana."

Trend in survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and its relationship with bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a six-year prospective observational study in Beijing,"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), a global health problem with a survival rate ranging from 2 to 22% across different countries, has been a leading cause of premature death for decades. The aim of this study was to evaluate the trends of survival after OHCA over time and its relationship with bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), initial shockable rhythm, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and survived event."
Effective action of string theory at order \(\alpha '\) in the presence of boundary,"Recently, using the assumption that the string theory effective action at the critical dimension is background independent, the classical on-shell effective action of the bosonic string theory at order \(\alpha '\) in a spacetime manifold without boundary has been reproduced, up to an overall parameter, by imposing the O(1, 1) symmetry when the background has a circle. In the presence of the boundary, we consider a background which has boundary and a circle such that the unit normal vector of the boundary is independent of the circle. Then the O(1, 1) symmetry can fix the bulk action without using the lowest order equation of motion. Moreover, the above constraints and the constraint from the principle of the least action in the presence of boundary can fix the boundary action, up to five boundary parameters. In the least action principle, we assume that not only the values of the massless fields but also the values of their first derivatives are arbitrary on the boundary. We have also observed that the cosmological reduction of the leading order action in the presence of the Hawking–Gibbons boundary term, produces zero cosmological boundary action. Imposing this as another constraint on the boundary couplings at order \(\alpha '\), we find the boundary action up to two parameters. For a specific value for these two parameters, the gravity couplings in the boundary become the Chern–Simons gravity plus another term which has the Laplacian of the extrinsic curvature."
Particle production at a finite potential step: transition from Euler–Heisenberg to Klein paradox,"Spontaneous pair production for spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles is explored in a quantitative manner for a static \(\tanh \)-Sauter potential step (SS), evaluating the imaginary part of the effective action. We provide finite-valued per unit-surface results, including the exact sharp-edge Klein paradox (KP) limit, which is the upper bound to pair production. At the vacuum instability threshold the spin-0 particle production can surpass that for the spin-1/2 rate. Presenting the effect of two opposite sign Sauter potential steps creating a well we show that spin-0 pair production, contrary to the case of spin-1/2, requires a smoothly sloped wall."
Mode spectra of magnetic and dielectric plasmon spheres obtained from Mie scattering and free oscillation theories,"This paper presents Mie scattering theory as compared to rigorous electromagnetic theory of free oscillations in magnetic and electric plasmon spheres. It is shown that the maxima of Mie scattering and absorption spectra well correspond to resonance frequencies of plasmon modes occurring in dielectric and magnetic spheres, similarly as it takes place for ordinary dielectric resonator modes. Mie theory is well applicable to determine resonance frequencies and scattering parameters of spherical plasmons. However, this theory cannot be applied to determine intrinsic properties of modes induced in the object by the incident plane wave, like quality factors. On the contrary, rigorous electromagnetic theory of free oscillations allows one to determine the complex resonance frequency of each mode that can occur in a given object, and the corresponding quality factor accounting for various kind of losses, including medium and radiation losses. The advantage of the free oscillations theory, as shown in this paper, is in the determination of the quality factors of modes occurring in magnetic plasmon spheres made of a strongly dispersive magnetic medium."
Vulgar Talk and Learned Reasoning in Berkeley’s Moral and Religious Thought,"Berkeley “argues with the learned and speaks with the vulgar.” I use his double maxim to interpret his ethics. My approach is new. The Sermons and Guardian Essays mainly speak to the vulgar and Passive Obedience and Alciphron reason with the learned. The reward of ethics is eternal bliss in a future state: religion and ethics are connected. I study a set of problems: resurrection, eternal life, happiness, benevolence, the goodness of God, and self-love. Divine bliss is unlike any earthly happiness. The idea of law does not support benevolence, even if it is a Christian duty and virtue. God is good, but how to prove it? The learned must study the complex theodicy problem; the vulgar need assurance based on their sensuous experience and fervent hope of eternal bliss. Self-love may be a vital issue to the learned, although the vulgar may not realize their need to overcome it. The main questions concern Berkeley’s two approaches to ethical problems: first, how do their topics differ, and second, are they mutually consistent?"
DFT study on the gold(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition and rearrangement reactions of allene-containing allylic silyl ether,"The DFT calculation at the B3LYP/B3LYP-D3(BJ) level was carried out to explore the reaction mechanism of the synthesis of spirocyclo[4,5]decane skeleton by gold-catalyzed allenyl compounds. The more accurate energy under the CH3CN solvent in the experiment is calculated by the single-point energy of the SMD model. Computational studies have shown that the reaction consists of three main steps: intramolecular cycloaddition of the end group carbon atoms of allenyl and vinyl groups, the semipinacol rearrangement process in which the four-membered ring is reconstructed into the five-membered ring, the elimination reaction releases the catalyst and obtains the product. The calculation results show that Zheng et al. reported that the gold-catalyzed synthesis reaction can easily occur under the experimental conditions due to its low activation free energy (12.07–15.49 kcal/mol). Furthermore, it was found that the MOMO(CH2)2 substituent has higher reactivity than the corresponding reactant of the phenyl substituent."
"How groundwater time series and aquifer property data explain heterogeneity in the Permo-Triassic sandstone aquifers of the Eden Valley, Cumbria, UK","A novel investigation of the impact of meteorological and geological heterogeneity within the Permo-Triassic Sandstone aquifers of the River Eden catchment, Cumbria (UK), is described. Quantifying the impact of heterogeneity on the water cycle is increasingly important to sustainably manage water resources and minimise flood risk. Traditional investigations on heterogeneity at the catchment scale require a considerable amount of data, and this has led to the analysis of available time series to interpret the impact of heterogeneity. The current research integrated groundwater-level and meteorological time series in conjunction with aquifer property data at 11 borehole locations to quantify the impact of heterogeneity and inform the hydrogeological conceptual understanding. The study visually categorised and used seasonal trend decomposition by LOESS (STL) on 11 groundwater and meteorological time series. Decomposition components of the different time series were compared using variance ratios. Though the Eden catchment exhibits highly heterogeneous rainfall distribution, comparative analysis at borehole locations showed that (1) meteorological drivers at borehole locations are broadly homogeneous and (2) the meteorological drivers are not sufficient to generate the variation observed in the groundwater-level time series. Three distinct hydrogeological regimes were identified and shown to coincide with heterogeneous features in the southern Brockram facies, which is the northern silicified region of the Penrith Sandstone and the St Bees Sandstone. The use of STL analysis in combination with detailed aquifer property data is a low-impact insightful investigative tool that helps guide the development of hydrogeological conceptual models."
Immune-modulation effect of Halocynthia aurantium tunic lipid on RAW264.7 cells,"The current study evaluated the immune-regulatory potential of lipid extract from Halocynthia aurantium tunic on macrophage cells. The results showed that H. aurantium lipid is composed of primarily SFA (68.32%), followed by MUFA and PUFA (17.61% and 14.07%, respectively). Halocynthia aurantium lipid dose-dependently modulated the NO and PGE2 production in RAW264.7 cells without any LPS stimulation. The lipid effectively up-regulated the cytokine expression, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in RAW264.7 cells. The COX-2 expression as a key biomarker for inflammation was also significantly increased. Conversely, H. aurantium lipid down-regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Halocynthia aurantium lipid modulated the phosphorylation of NF-κB p-65, p38, ERK, and JNK, indicating that this lipid activated through NF-κB and MAPK pathways. These results provide insight into the immune-regulatory activities of H. aurantium tunic lipid and suggest that H. aurantium tunic may a potential lipid source for immune-regulatory molecules."
"Informal input suppliers, quality choice and welfare","This paper proposes a theoretical model in which a formal upstream firm competes against informal input suppliers, which constitute an alternative, albeit lower-quality input source for formal downstream firms. The existence of an alternative source increases competition in the industry, which tends to be welfare-increasing. However, it may also distort the incentives of the formal upstream firm to invest in quality upgrading. Assuming quantity competition downstream, we analyze how these incentives change and whether the negative welfare effect of a reduced investment by the upstream firm may more than offset the positive welfare effect of increased competition brought about by informal input suppliers. We find that there are parameter values such that this is the case, and welfare decreases if informal input suppliers are present. We analyze the robustness of this result to alternative modeling assumptions, such as price competition downstream and the use of two-part tariffs by the formal upstream firm."
Random Unitary Representations of Surface Groups I: Asymptotic Expansions,"In this paper, we study random representations of fundamental groups of surfaces into special unitary groups. The random model we use is based on a symplectic form on moduli space due to Atiyah, Bott and Goldman. Let \(\Sigma _{g}\) denote a topological surface of genus \(g\ge 2\). We establish the existence of a large n asymptotic expansion, to any fixed order, for the expected value of the trace of any fixed element of \(\pi _{1}(\Sigma _{g})\) under a random representation of \(\pi _{1}(\Sigma _{g})\) into \(\mathsf {SU}(n)\). Each such expected value involves a contribution from all irreducible representations of \(\mathsf {SU}(n)\). The main technical contribution of the paper is effective analytic control of the entire contribution from irreducible representations outside finite sets of carefully chosen rational families of representations."
Left ventricular structure and function in patients with chronic kidney disease assessed by 3D echocardiography: the CPH-CKD ECHO study,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality amongst patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This is the first study using 3-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) to investigate associations between adverse changes of the left ventricle, and different stages of CKD. Participants were recruited from the Copenhagen CKD cohort study and the Herlev-Gentofte CKD cohort study. Patients were stratified according to GFR category (G1 + 2: eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, G3: eGFR = 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m2, and G4 + 5: eGFR ≤ 29 mL/min/1.73 m2), and according to albuminuria (A1: UACR < 30 mg/g, A2: 30–300 mg/g, A3: > 300 mg/g). Echocardiograms were analysed for left ventricular (LV) mass index (LVMi), LV ejection fraction (LVEF), and global strain measures. In adjusted analysis, eGFR groups were adjusted for confounders and albuminuria category, while albuminuria groups were adjusted for confounders and GFR category. The study population consisted of 662 outpatients with CKD and 169 controls. Mean age was 57 ± 13 years, and 61% were males. Mean LVEF and global longitudinal strain (GLS) were increasingly impaired across eGFR groups: LVEF = 60.1%, 58.4%, and 57.8% (p = 0.013), GLS =  − 16.1%, − 14.8%, and − 14.6% (p < 0.0001) for G1 + 2, G3, and G4 + 5. LVMi and prevalence of LV hypertrophy increased with albuminuria severity: mean LVMi = 87.9 g/m2, 88.1 g/m2, and 92.1 g/m2 (p = 0.007) from A1-3. Adjusted analysis confirmed reduced LVEF in G3 compared with G1 + 2, and increased LVMi in A3 compared with A1. Increasingly impaired eGFR was associated with adverse changes in LV systolic function, while albuminuria was associated with adverse changes in LV mass assessed by 3DE. Their associations were independent of each other."
Left atrium reservoir function is central in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis,"We investigated the relationship between Left Atrium strain reservoir function and symptoms and its impact on modulating Left Ventricular mechanics, diastolic filling, stroke volume, mean trans-mitral gradient and pulmonary pressure in mitral stenosis (MS) patients. We examined 195 full spectrum MS patients which were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n = 109) included patients with NYHA I & II functional class and group 2 (n = 86) included patients with NYHA III & IV functional class. LA strain reservoir function and classical echocardiographic parameters were calculated. LASr was significantly higher in group 1 versus group 2 in patients with MVA ≤ 1cm2 [8.8(6.0–12.6) vs 6.8(4.1–8.9), p = 0.03) and when 1cm2 < MVA ≤ 1.5 cm2 [10.0 (5.4–13.8) vs 6.7(4.5–9.0), p = 0.02). In patients with Pulmonary Hypertension, group 1 had significantly higher LASr than group 2 [11.1(6.6–14.8) vs 5.9(4.3–9.0), p = 0.002) By multivariate analysis, diabetes (OR = 4.11, 95%CI: 1.6–10.4), stroke (OR = 2.9, 95%CI: 1.1–7.9), LASr (OR = 0.9, 95%CI: 0.80–0.99) and LV ejection fraction (LVEF)(OR = 0.9, 95%CI: 0.91–0.99) were independently associated with NYHA functional class. LASr was significantly and positively correlated to MVA (r = 0.3, p < 10–3), stroke volume (r = 0.25, p = 10–3), mitral inflow (r = 0.4, p < 10–3) and LVEF(r = 0.14, p = 0.05). It was significantly and negatively correlated to left ventricular strain (r = −0.65, p < 10–3), LA indexed volume (r = −0.40, p < 10–3), maximum tricuspid regurgitation velocity (r = −0.25, p = 0.003), MTMG (r = −0.25, p = 10–3), and heart rate (r = −0.4, p < 10–3). We demonstrated a large range of interaction between LASr and mitral valve echocardiographic parameters. This may explain the reasons we identified LASr as an independent factor for MS functional tolerance."
Enhanced Absorption of Hg2+ by a Recyclable Thiol-Functionalized Salix Psammophila,"To solve the heavy metal water contamination problem of mercury ions, salix psammophila (SPP) powder was functionalized by thiol to prepare a novel adsorbent (TSPP). The materials were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), thermogravimetry (TG), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The maximum adsorption capacity of TSPP was 1615.1 mgg−1 in 60 min (pH = 2, temperature 45 ℃, Hg2+ concentration = 700 mgL−1). The adsorption of Hg2+ by TSPP conforms to the pseudo-secondary kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption process of Hg2+ mainly includes ion exchange of -COOH, electrostatic attraction of -NH−, electron transfer of -NH2, and chelation of sulfhydryl group and other functional groups. In addition, TSPP still has a high adsorption capacity of 1547.5 mgg−1 after four recycling times, indicating that it can be used as a low-cost, high-economy, and environmentally friendly adsorbent."
"Solar Photocatalysis for Degradation of Pharmaceuticals in Hospital Wastewater: Influence of the Type of Catalyst, Aqueous Matrix, and Toxicity Evaluation","In this work, solar photocatalytic degradation of the drug mixture atenolol (ATL), acetaminophen (ACP), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in distilled water, tap water, and hospital wastewater was evaluated. The photocatalytic activity of two commercial TiO2-based catalysts, Degussa P25 and KronoClean 7000, was studied at different catalyst amounts, under simulated and natural solar irradiation for the solution of 10 mg L−1 initial concentration of each drug. The results showed complete degradation of the mixture and abatement of 70% of the initial TOC concentration in distilled water with Degussa P25 (1.0 g L−1) using both radiation sources at 400 kJ m−2 of the UV accumulated energy. Thus, to evaluate the matrix effect in the process, the degradation was carried out in hospital wastewater spiked with the drug mixture. Complete degradation of ACP and ATL and 85% of SMX elimination was reached in hospital wastewater, but only 18.1% of the initial TOC reduction was achieved using Degussa P25 catalyst under natural solar radiation at 400 kJ m−2 of accumulated UV energy. Additionally, the process was evaluated in a 20 L semi-pilot plant where degradation near 90% for all drugs was reached in tap water using 0.5 g L−1 of Degussa P25, obtaining a 51.6% of TOC abatement at 38.9 kJ L−1 of accumulated UV energy. Finally, the effluent toxicity during the degradation of the pharmaceuticals in hospital wastewater was evaluated, finding that the natural solar-mediated photocatalysis using TiO2 Degussa P25 is an effective process to obtain a non-toxic effluent."
Melnikov method for non-conservative perturbations of the restricted three-body problem,"We consider the planar circular restricted three-body problem, as a model for the motion of a spacecraft relative to the Earth–Moon system. We focus on the collinear equilibrium points \(L_1\) and \(L_2\). There are families of Lyapunov periodic orbits around either \(L_1\) or \(L_2\), forming Lyapunov manifolds. There also exist homoclinic orbits to the Lyapunov manifolds around either \(L_1\) or \(L_2\), as well as heteroclinic orbits between the Lyapunov manifold around \(L_1\) and the one around \(L_2\). The motion along the homoclinic/heteroclinic orbits can be described via the scattering map, which gives the future asymptotic of a homoclinic orbit as a function of the past asymptotic. In contrast to the more customary Melnikov theory, we do not need to assume that the asymptotic orbits have a special nature (periodic, quasi-periodic, etc.). We add a non-conservative, time-dependent perturbation, as a model for a thrust applied to the spacecraft for some duration of time, or for some other effect, such as solar radiation pressure. We compute the first-order approximation of the perturbed scattering map, in terms of fast convergent integrals of the perturbation along homoclinic/heteroclinic orbits of the unperturbed system. As a possible application, this result can be used to determine the trajectory of the spacecraft upon using the thrust."
Trend in survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and its relationship with bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a six-year prospective observational study in Beijing,"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), a global health problem with a survival rate ranging from 2 to 22% across different countries, has been a leading cause of premature death for decades. The aim of this study was to evaluate the trends of survival after OHCA over time and its relationship with bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), initial shockable rhythm, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and survived event."
Socioeconomic inequalities in access and use of skilled birth attendants during childbirth in Ghana: a decomposition analysis,"Equitable access to skilled birth attendance during delivery is vital for reducing global maternal deaths to 70 deaths per 100, 000 to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Although several initiatives have been implemented to reduce maternal mortality in Ghana, inequalities in access to skilled birth attendance during delivery still exist among women of different socioeconomic groups. This study assesses the socioeconomic inequalities in access and use of skilled birth attendants during delivery in Ghana."
Does disrespect and abuse during childbirth differ between public and private hospitals in Southeast Nigeria,"Disrespect and Abuse (D&A) during childbirth represents an important barrier to skilled birth utilization, indicating a problem with quality of care and a violation of women‘s human rights.

Subsequent surgery after primary ACLR results in a significantly inferior subjective outcome at a 2-year follow-up,"To analyze minimal important change (MIC), patient-acceptable symptom state (PASS) and treatment failure after reoperation within 2 years of primary ACL reconstruction and compare them with patients without additional surgery."
Inflated 3D ConvNet context analysis for violence detection,"According to the Wall Street Journal, one billion surveillance cameras will be deployed around the world by 2021. This amount of information can be hardly managed by humans. Using a Inflated 3D ConvNet as backbone, this paper introduces a novel automatic violence detection approach that outperforms state-of-the-art existing proposals. Most of those proposals consider a pre-processing step to only focus on some regions of interest in the scene, i.e., those actually containing a human subject. In this regard, this paper also reports the results of an extensive analysis on whether and how the context can affect or not the adopted classifier performance. The experiments show that context-free footage yields substantial deterioration of the classifier performance (2% to 5%) on publicly available datasets. However, they also demonstrate that performance stabilizes in context-free settings, no matter the level of context restriction applied. Finally, a cross-dataset experiment investigates the generalizability of results obtained in a single-collection experiment (same dataset used for training and testing) to cross-collection settings (different datasets used for training and testing)."
Effect of Surface Topography on ZDDP Tribofilm Formation During Running-in Stage Subject to Boundary Lubrication,"Experimental investigations have been conducted to study the effects of surface topography on ZDDP (zinc dialkyldithiophosphate) chemical tribofilm formation during running-in stage under boundary lubrication conditions. The scope of presented work has been limited and focused on reciprocating motion under boundary lubrication to simulate the upper and lower dead centre of piston ring movement, which is prone to adhesive wear failure. Several surface topographies were designed and fabricated to measure, compare coefficient of friction and ZDDP critical time of tribofilm formation. Rubbing surfaces and their corresponding tribofilms were characterized by SEM and EDX. Mechanisms of surface topography effects on the critical time of ZDDP tribofilm formation is presented and discussed. Results from this study have demonstrated that the surface topography has a significant influence on the critical time of ZDDP tribofilm formation during running-in process and corresponding wear performance. This research provides an opportunity to augment anti-wear performance under boundary lubrication condition. This can be achieved by optimizing surface morphology design to influence the formation of anti-wear tribofilms during the running-in stage. In turn, this will result in interacting component’s service life enhancement and significant cost savings from mitigated wear."
Limit Sets of Discontinuous Vector Fields on Two-Dimensional Manifolds,"In this paper, limit sets of trajectories of a discontinuous vector field Z defined on a two-dimensional manifold M are studied. As in the classical Poincaré–Bendixson theorem, trajectories of Z are supposed to be confined on some compact invariant set \(K\subset V\), where V is a coordinate neighborhood of M, and we require that Z and K fulfill some hypotheses analogous to the referred theorem. More precisely, M is split in an arbitrary number of regions by a set of smooth curves \(\Sigma \) so that Z is defined by pieces on those regions, being eventually discontinuous on \(\Sigma \). Moreover, it is assumed that K contains finite pseudo-equilibria of Z and at most two pieces of it, each piece having finite equilibria on \(K{\setminus }\Sigma \) and at most one tangency point on \(K\cap \Sigma \). We require no extra assumption on \(\Sigma \) but regularity, therefore the existence of the so-called sliding motion is allowed on \(\Sigma \) along with crossing and tangency points. The main results of the paper fully describe the limit sets of trajectories of Z under the previous hypotheses (see Theorem 1) and also state some features of a particular limit set presenting non-empty interior and nondeterministic chaos (see Theorem 2). They also generalize some previous results of the literature when trajectories either slide on \(\Sigma \) indefinitely or never slide again after some finite time (see the fundamental lemma). Some examples and classes of systems fitting the hypotheses of the main results are also provided in the paper along with an algorithm to apply Theorem 1 to robust discontinuous vector fields."
Carbon nanotubes/reduced graphene oxide composites as electrode materials for supercapacitors,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/graphene composite fiber has become an encouraging material for the construction of wearable supercapacitors due to its excellent performance. CNTs/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composite fibers with large specific surface area were prepared by CVD method using alginic acid (Alg)/graphene oxide (GO) fibers with Ni ions uniformly loaded, the structure and electrochemical performance were investigated. Flexible Alg/GO fiber with diameters of 45 to 125 μm were fabricated by dry-jet wet spinning or wet spinning. CNTs/RGO composite fibers with hollow CNTs in diameters of 150 to 500 nm, which were fabricated by CVD method using Ni as catalyst, exhibited a specific surface area of 366.98 m2 g−1. Electrochemical analysts indicated that the fibers exhibited excellent specific capacitance of 267.8 F g−1 for double-layer capacitors and 49.3 F g−1 for symmetrical capacitors, which implied that the porous composite fiber with large specific surface area is a potential electrode material for fabricating flexible energy storage device."

Left ventricular structure and function in patients with chronic kidney disease assessed by 3D echocardiography: the CPH-CKD ECHO study,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality amongst patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This is the first study using 3-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) to investigate associations between adverse changes of the left ventricle, and different stages of CKD. Participants were recruited from the Copenhagen CKD cohort study and the Herlev-Gentofte CKD cohort study. Patients were stratified according to GFR category (G1 + 2: eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, G3: eGFR = 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m2, and G4 + 5: eGFR ≤ 29 mL/min/1.73 m2), and according to albuminuria (A1: UACR < 30 mg/g, A2: 30–300 mg/g, A3: > 300 mg/g). Echocardiograms were analysed for left ventricular (LV) mass index (LVMi), LV ejection fraction (LVEF), and global strain measures. In adjusted analysis, eGFR groups were adjusted for confounders and albuminuria category, while albuminuria groups were adjusted for confounders and GFR category. The study population consisted of 662 outpatients with CKD and 169 controls. Mean age was 57 ± 13 years, and 61% were males.

Adjusted analysis confirmed reduced LVEF in G3 compared with G1 + 2, and increased LVMi in A3 compared with A1. Increasingly impaired eGFR was associated with adverse changes in LV systolic function, while albuminuria was associated with adverse changes in LV mass assessed by 3DE. Their associations were independent of each other."
Left atrium reservoir function is central in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis,"We investigated the relationship between Left Atrium strain reservoir function and symptoms and its impact on modulating Left Ventricular mechanics, diastolic filling, stroke volume, mean trans-mitral gradient and pulmonary pressure in mitral stenosis (MS) patients. We examined 195 full spectrum MS patients which were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n = 109) included patients with NYHA I & II functional class and group 2 (n = 86) included patients with NYHA III & IV functional class. LA strain reservoir function and classical echocardiographic parameters were calculated. LASr was significantly higher in group 1 versus group 2 in patients with MVA ≤ 1cm2 [8.8(6.0–12.6) vs 6.8(4.1–8.9), p = 0.03) and when 1cm2 < MVA ≤ 1.5 cm2 [10.0 (5.4–13.8) vs 6.7(4.5–9.0), p = 0.02). In patients with Pulmonary Hypertension, group 1 had significantly higher LASr than group 2 [11.1(6.6–14.8) vs 5.9(4.3–9.0), p = 0.002) By multivariate analysis, diabetes (OR = 4.11, 95%CI: 1.6–10.4), stroke (OR = 2.9, 95%CI: 1.1–7.9), LASr (OR = 0.9, 95%CI: 0.80–0.99) and LV ejection fraction (LVEF)(OR = 0.9, 95%CI: 0.91–0.99) were independently associated with NYHA functional class.

"Solar Photocatalysis for Degradation of Pharmaceuticals in Hospital Wastewater: Influence of the Type of Catalyst, Aqueous Matrix, and Toxicity Evaluation","In this work, solar photocatalytic degradation of the drug mixture atenolol (ATL), acetaminophen (ACP), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in distilled water, tap water, and hospital wastewater was evaluated. The photocatalytic activity of two commercial TiO2-based catalysts, Degussa P25 and KronoClean 7000, was studied at different catalyst amounts, under simulated and natural solar irradiation for the solution of 10 mg L−1 initial concentration of each drug. The results showed complete degradation of the mixture and abatement of 70% of the initial TOC concentration in distilled water with Degussa P25 (1.0 g L−1) using both radiation sources at 400 kJ m−2 of the UV accumulated energy. Thus, to evaluate the matrix effect in the process, the degradation was carried out in hospital wastewater spiked with the drug mixture. Complete degradation of ACP and ATL and 85% of SMX elimination was reached in hospital wastewater, but only 18.1% of the initial TOC reduction was achieved using Degussa P25 catalyst under natural solar radiation at 400 kJ m−2 of accumulated UV energy. Additionally, the process was evaluated in a 20 L semi-pilot plant where degradation near 90% for all drugs was reached in tap water using 0.5 g L−1 of Degussa P25, obtaining a 51.6% of TOC abatement at 38.9 kJ L−1 of accumulated UV energy. Finally, the effluent toxicity during the degradation of the pharmaceuticals in hospital wastewater was evaluated, finding that the natural solar-mediated photocatalysis using TiO2 Degussa P25 is an effective process to obtain a non-toxic effluent."
Melnikov method for non-conservative perturbations of the restricted three-body problem,"We consider the planar circular restricted three-body problem, as a model for the motion of a spacecraft relative to the Earth–Moon system. We focus on the collinear equilibrium points \(L_1\) and \(L_2\). There are families of Lyapunov periodic orbits around either \(L_1\) or \(L_2\), forming Lyapunov manifolds. There also exist homoclinic orbits to the Lyapunov manifolds around either \(L_1\) or \(L_2\), as well as heteroclinic orbits between the Lyapunov manifold around \(L_1\) and the one around \(L_2\). The motion along the homoclinic/heteroclinic orbits can be described via the scattering map, which gives the future asymptotic of a homoclinic orbit as a function of the past asymptotic. In contrast to the more customary Melnikov theory, we do not need to assume that the asymptotic orbits have a special nature (periodic, quasi-periodic, etc.). We add a non-conservative, time-dependent perturbation, as a model for a thrust applied to the spacecraft for some duration of time, or for some other effect, such as solar radiation pressure. We compute the first-order approximation of the perturbed scattering map, in terms of fast convergent integrals of the perturbation along homoclinic/heteroclinic orbits of the unperturbed system. As a possible application, this result can be used to determine the trajectory of the spacecraft upon using the thrust."
"Sleep position, patient comfort, and technical performance with two established procedures for home sleep testing","In patients with a high pre-test probability of suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), (cardio)-respiratory polygraphy (RP; level 3) is commonly used for home sleep testing (HST); however, testing based on peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) is increasingly recognized as an alternative method. The aim of the study was to compare sleep position, patients’ comfort, and technical failure rates of HST with RP and PAT in patients with suspected OSA."
Detection of anthropogenically driven trends in Arctic amplification,"The driving mechanism of Arctic amplification (AA) is so complex that no consistent and definitive conclusion has been formed yet. In particular, the internally and externally driven trends of AA have not been distinguished using observation-based methods. Given that the Arctic is more sensitive than other regions to anthropogenic greenhouse gas increases and other external forcings, we focus on separating anthropogenically driven trends from the Arctic surface air temperature (SAT) changes during 1979–2017 to quantify the contribution of anthropogenic effects on AA, with detection and attribution converted to probability distribution functions. Results indicate that the Arctic coast of the Siberian Great Plains, from the Barents Sea to the Kara Sea and eastward to the Bering Strait, has been warming most significantly, and is mainly dominated by anthropogenically driven trends. From 1979 to 2017, the minimum anthropogenically driven warming in most parts of the Arctic Ocean exceeds 2℃, especially the Kara Sea area, where the anthropogenically driven warming is significant, reaching 4℃. In addition, the minimum anthropogenic contributions exceed 60% in most parts of the Arctic Circle and are more than 80% of the warming trend in (75–90° N, 150–180° W). In 140° W–140° E Arctic region, the anthropogenically driven trend is the most remarkable, at 0.82℃ / decade, accounting for 84.5% of the measured warming trend. Meanwhile, the anthropogenically driven trend accelerates most rapidly in this area (0–140° W, 60–90° N)."
Development of well complexity calculator and its integration into standard well engineering management system/well delivery system,"Oil and gas well drilling is the most important and complex task for oil and gas exploration. It is not necessary that design and execution complexity remain the same for two different wells even in the same field. It is possible to have a very complex well to drill after a very straightforward simple well being drilled earlier in the same field. Making correlation or comparison of any of the two or more than two oil and gas drilling wells is an ongoing debate in the petroleum industry. Generally, companies compare the oil and gas drilling wells on a single or two parameters, for example: time versus depth, directional trajectories, well cost and/or other single factors in disengagement of one another. In order to compare two different types of oil and gas drilling wells, having distinctive design, drilling and fluid program and challenges, a scientific rating system is required, which can relate various wells with one another. In this research paper, a calculator named Well Complexity Calculator has been developed to measure the complexity of the oil and gas well drilling by using different parameters. All these parameters are commonly affecting the drilling program and its execution. Secondly, a methodology is designed for integration of Well Complexity Calculator into standard Well Engineering Management System/Well Delivery System for better execution of drilling program. Fifty-one (51) oil and gas drilling well complexity parameters have been utilized to develop Well Complexity Calculator, where they are categorized into three main complexities types named Design Well Complexity, Geological Well Complexity and Project Well Complexity. Design and Geological Well Complexities combine to form Drilling Well Complexity, and then Drilling Well Complexity and Project Well Complexity combine to form Well Complexity. Median, Mode and Monte Carlo simulation techniques were chosen to develop the calculator where Median showed best suited results and was accordingly chosen for the final calculator. Sixty-six (66) actual oil and gas wells’ camouflaged drilling data were used to analyze and fine tune the developed Well Complexity Calculator. Output complexities of these wells were falling in different complexity levels. Moreover, it was seen that the number of low, high and medium complexity wells was different for Design, Geological, Project, Drilling and Well Complexities which is in line with the real-world scenario."
"Habitat-, age-, and sex-related alterations in oxidative stress biomarkers in the blood of mute swans (Cygnus olor) inhabiting pomeranian coastal areas (Northern Poland)","The mute swan (Cygnus olor) can be considered a representative species of birds associated with the aquatic environment and responding very clearly to changes in the environment. Assuming that the condition of the mute swan population well reflects the state of the environment, this species was used in our research as a bioindicative species. Thus, the aim of our study was to elucidate the association between metal contents in soil samples collected from a habitat of mute swans and element contents in their feathers as well as the levels of biomarkers of lipid peroxidation, oxidatively modified proteins, and total antioxidant capacity in the blood of mute swans living in three agglomerations in coastal areas in the southern part of the Baltic Sea (Pomeranian region, northern Poland). We compared the effects of inhabitation, age, and sex on the ecophysiological accumulation of metals in three wintering populations of the mute swan from coastal areas of northern Poland, i.e., Słupsk, Gdynia, and Sopot. In Słupsk, the anthropogenic pressure was related predominantly to the level of Al and, to a lesser extent, to the content of Rh and Ru. We found maximum levels of lipid peroxidation biomarkers in the blood of the mute swans from Gdynia (38.20 ± 6.35 nmol MDA·mL−1). At the same time, maximum levels of aldehydic and ketonic derivatives of oxidatively modified proteins were noted in the blood of swans from Sopot compared to the values obtained in mute swans from Słupsk and Gdynia. This trend suggesting high levels of oxidative stress biomarkers was also confirmed by a decrease in the total antioxidant capacity in these groups."
Vulgar Talk and Learned Reasoning in Berkeley’s Moral and Religious Thought,"Berkeley “argues with the learned and speaks with the vulgar.” I use his double maxim to interpret his ethics. My approach is new. The Sermons and Guardian Essays mainly speak to the vulgar and Passive Obedience and Alciphron reason with the learned. The reward of ethics is eternal bliss in a future state: religion and ethics are connected. I study a set of problems: resurrection, eternal life, happiness, benevolence, the goodness of God, and self-love. Divine bliss is unlike any earthly happiness. The idea of law does not support benevolence, even if it is a Christian duty and virtue. God is good, but how to prove it? The learned must study the complex theodicy problem; the vulgar need assurance based on their sensuous experience and fervent hope of eternal bliss. Self-love may be a vital issue to the learned, although the vulgar may not realize their need to overcome it. The main questions concern Berkeley’s two approaches to ethical problems: first, how do their topics differ, and second, are they mutually consistent?"

The Bohr Inequality for the Generalized Cesáro Averaging Operators,"The main aim of this paper is to prove a generalization of the classical Bohr theorem and as an application, we obtain a counterpart of Bohr theorem for the generalized Cesáro operator."
An Inequality Involving Bernstein Polynomials and Box-Convex Functions,"We provide a simple proof to a conjecture posed by Raşa (Report of Meeting Conference on Ulam’s Type Stability, Rytro, Poland, June 2–6, https://doi.org/10.2478/aupcsm-2014-0011, 2014), and its extension to q-monotone functions obtained by Abel and Leviatan (Results Math 75(4):181–193, 2020). Probabilistic proofs were recently obtained by Komisarski and Rajba (J Math Anal Appl 458:821–830, 2018) and Komisarski and Rajba (Results Math, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00025-021-01417-2, 2021). In this paper, we extend the results from Abel and Leviatan (2020) to the case of box convex functions of order (q, s)."
Periodic solutions for p-Laplacian with logistic growth,"This paper is concerned with the existence and non-existence of positive periodic solutions for \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-\mathrm {div} (| \nabla u |^{p-2} \nabla u )= u^{q}(a-b u^{\beta })\) with \(p>1\), where \(a=a(x,t)\) and \(b=b(x,t)\) are positive periodic functions. Some numerical simulation also be implemented to verify our results."
Biodiversity and ecosystem functions depend on environmental conditions and resources rather than the geodiversity of a tropical biodiversity hotspot,"Biodiversity and ecosystem functions are highly threatened by global change. It has been proposed that geodiversity can be used as an easy-to-measure surrogate of biodiversity to guide conservation management. However, so far, there is mixed evidence to what extent geodiversity can predict biodiversity and ecosystem functions at the regional scale relevant for conservation planning. Here, we analyse how geodiversity computed as a compound index is suited to predict the diversity of four taxa and associated ecosystem functions in a tropical mountain hotspot of biodiversity and compare the results with the predictive power of environmental conditions and resources (climate, habitat, soil). We show that combinations of these environmental variables better explain species diversity and ecosystem functions than a geodiversity index and identified climate variables as more important predictors than habitat and soil variables, although the best predictors differ between taxa and functions. We conclude that a compound geodiversity index cannot be used as a single surrogate predictor for species diversity and ecosystem functions in tropical mountain rain forest ecosystems and is thus little suited to facilitate conservation management at the regional scale. Instead, both the selection and the combination of environmental variables are essential to guide conservation efforts to safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem functions."
Comparative de novo transcriptome analysis identifies salinity stress responsive genes and metabolic pathways in sugarcane and its wild relative Erianthus arundinaceus [Retzius] Jeswiet,"Erianthus arundinaceus [Retzius] Jeswiet, a wild relative of sugarcane has a high biomass production potential and a reservoir of many genes for superior agronomic traits and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. A comparative physiological, anatomical and root transcriptome analysis were carried out to identify the salt-responsive genes and metabolic pathways associated with salt-tolerant E. arundinaceus genotype IND99-907 and salinity-sensitive sugarcane genotype Co 97010. IND99-907 recorded growth of young leaves, higher proline content, higher relative water content, intact root anatomical structures and lower Na+/K+, Ca2+/K+ and Mg2+/K+ ratio as compared to the sugarcane genotype Co 97010. We have generated four de novo transcriptome assemblies between stressed and control root samples of IND99-907 and Co 97010. A total of 649 and 501 differentially expressed genes (FDR<0.01) were identified from the stressed and control libraries of IND99-907 and Co 97010 respectively. Genes and pathways related to early stress-responsive signal transduction, hormone signalling, cytoskeleton organization, cellular membrane stabilization, plasma membrane-bound calcium and proton transport, sodium extrusion, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, cellular transporters related to plasma membrane-bound trafficking, nucleobase transporter, clathrin-mediated endocytosis were highly enriched in IND99-907. Whereas in Co 97010, genes related to late stress-responsive signal transduction, electron transport system, senescence, protein degradation and programmed cell death, transport-related genes associated with cellular respiration and mitochondrial respiratory chain, vesicular trafficking, nitrate transporter and fewer secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes were highly enriched. A total of 27 pathways, 24 biological processes, three molecular functions and one cellular component were significantly enriched (FDR≤ 0.05) in IND99-907 as compared to 20 pathways, two biological processes without any significant molecular function and cellular components in Co 97010, indicates the unique and distinct expression pattern of genes and metabolic pathways in both genotypes. The genomic resources developed from this study is useful for sugarcane crop improvement through development of genic SSR markers and genetic engineering approaches."
Biophysical and biochemical properties of PHGDH revealed by studies on PHGDH inhibitors,"The rate-limiting serine biogenesis enzyme PHGDH is overexpressed in cancers. Both serine withdrawal and genetic/pharmacological inhibition of PHGDH have demonstrated promising tumor-suppressing activities. However, the enzyme properties of PHGDH are not well understood and the discovery of PHGDH inhibitors is still in its infancy. Here, oridonin was identified from a natural product library as a new PHGDH inhibitor. The crystal structure of PHGDH in complex with oridonin revealed a new allosteric site. The binding of oridonin to this site reduced the activity of the enzyme by relocating R54, a residue involved in substrate binding. Mutagenesis studies showed that PHGDH activity was very sensitive to cysteine mutations, especially those in the substrate binding domain. Conjugation of oridonin and other reported covalent PHGDH inhibitors to these sites will therefore inhibit PHGDH. In addition to being inhibited enzymatically, PHGDH can also be inhibited by protein aggregation and proteasome-mediated degradation. Several tested PHGDH cancer mutants showed altered enzymatic activity, which can be explained by protein structure and stability. Overall, the above studies present new biophysical and biochemical insights into PHGDH and may facilitate the future design of PHGDH inhibitors."
Esc peptides as novel potentiators of defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator: an unprecedented property of antimicrobial peptides,"Mutations in the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein lead to persistent lung bacterial infections, mainly due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, causing loss of respiratory function and finally death of people affected by CF. Unfortunately, even in the era of CFTR modulation therapies, management of pulmonary infections in CF remains highly challenging especially for patients with advanced stages of lung disease. Recently, we identified antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), namely Esc peptides, with potent antipseudomonal activity. In this study, by means of electrophysiological techniques and computational studies we discovered their ability to increase the CFTR-controlled ion currents, by direct interaction with the F508del-CFTR mutant. Remarkably, this property was not explored previously with any AMPs or peptides in general. More interestingly, in contrast with clinically used CFTR modulators, Esc peptides would give particular benefit to CF patients by combining their capability to eradicate lung infections and to act as promoters of airway wound repair with their ability to ameliorate the activity of the channel with conductance defects. Overall, our findings not only highlighted Esc peptides as the first characterized AMPs with a novel property, that is the potentiator activity of CFTR, but also paved the avenue to investigate the functions of AMPs and/or other peptide molecules, for a new up-and-coming pharmacological approach to address CF lung disease."
"Eusociality is linked to caste-specific differences in metabolism, immune system, and somatic maintenance-related processes in an ant species","The social organization of many primate, bird and rodent species and the role of individuals within that organization are associated with specific individual physiological traits. However, this association is perhaps most pronounced in eusocial insects (e.g., termites, ants). In such species, genetically close individuals show significant differences in behavior, physiology, and life expectancy. Studies addressing the metabolic changes according to the social role are still lacking. We aimed at understanding how sociality could influence essential molecular processes in a eusocial insect, the black garden ant (Lasius niger) where queens can live up to ten times longer than workers. Using mass spectrometry-based analysis, we explored the whole metabolome of queens, nest-workers and foraging workers. A former proteomics study done in the same species allowed us to compare the findings of both approaches. Confirming the former results at the proteome level, we showed that queens had fewer metabolites related to immunity. Contrary to our predictions, we did not find any metabolite linked to reproduction in queens. Among the workers, foragers had a metabolic signature reflecting a more stressful environment and a more highly stimulated immune system. We also found that nest-workers had more digestion-related metabolites. Hence, we showed that specific metabolic signatures match specific social roles. Besides, we identified metabolites differently expressed among behavioral castes and involved in nutrient sensing and longevity pathways (e.g., sirtuins, FOXO). The links between such molecular pathways and aging being found in an increasing number of taxa, our results confirm and strengthen their potential universality."
Deterioration of headache impact and health-related quality of life in migraine patients after cessation of preventive treatment with CGRP(−receptor) antibodies,Migraine preventive treatment with CGRP(−receptor) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has a positive effect on patients’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The German treatment guidelines recommend discontinuing successful treatment with CGRP(−receptor) mAbs after 6–12 months. We aimed to evaluate headache-specific and generic HRQoL for three months after discontinuation of CGRP(−receptor) mAb treatment.
Inflated 3D ConvNet context analysis for violence detection,"According to the Wall Street Journal, one billion surveillance cameras will be deployed around the world by 2021. This amount of information can be hardly managed by humans. Using a Inflated 3D ConvNet as backbone, this paper introduces a novel automatic violence detection approach that outperforms state-of-the-art existing proposals. Most of those proposals consider a pre-processing step to only focus on some regions of interest in the scene, i.e., those actually containing a human subject. In this regard, this paper also reports the results of an extensive analysis on whether and how the context can affect or not the adopted classifier performance. The experiments show that context-free footage yields substantial deterioration of the classifier performance (2% to 5%) on publicly available datasets. However, they also demonstrate that performance stabilizes in context-free settings, no matter the level of context restriction applied. Finally, a cross-dataset experiment investigates the generalizability of results obtained in a single-collection experiment (same dataset used for training and testing) to cross-collection settings (different datasets used for training and testing)."

Linear inversion-imaging method based on joint primary reflected waves and surface-related multiples,"In marine seismic exploration, especially in deep-water and hard ocean-bottom cases, free-surface multiples are strongly developed. Compared with primary waves, the wider illumination aperture of the multiples is beneficial for high-resolution seismic imaging. In this study, by introducing a new compound source composed of primaries and free-surface multiples and by ignoring internal multiples, we derive a new linearized forward problem (free-surface-multiple prediction model) under a weak-scattering assumption (i.e., first-order Born approximation). On the basis of the new linearized problem, we propose a joint inversion-imaging method by simultaneously using the primaries and free-surface multiples under the general framework of least square inversion. To eliminate the crosstalk artifacts introduced by the cross-correlation of multiples with different orders, we prove that the crosstalk artifacts can be gradually eliminated during the inversion if a proper step length is selected. Synthetic- and field-data tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
Fetal information as shared information: using NIPT to test for adult-onset conditions,"The possibilities of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) are expanding, and the use of NIPT for adult-onset conditions may become widely available in the near future. If parents use NIPT to test for these conditions, and the pregnancy is continued, they will have information about the child’s genetic predisposition from birth. In this paper, we argue that prospective parents should be able to access NIPT for an adult-onset condition, even when they have no intention to terminate the pregnancy. We begin by outlining the arguments against testing in such a situation, which generally apply the same considerations that apply in the predictive testing of a minor to the fetus in utero. We then contend, firstly, that there are important practical considerations that support availability of testing for prospective parents regardless of their stated intentions. Secondly, we object to the ethical equation of a fetus in utero with a minor. We base our analysis on a view of pregnancy that conceptualises the fetus as a part of the gestational parent, as opposed to the more common ‘container’ model of pregnancy. We suggest that fetal information is best conceptualised as shared information between the gestational parent and future child. Thus, it should be approached in similar ways as other kinds of shared information (such as genetic information with implications for family members), where a person has a claim over their own information, but should be encouraged to consider the interests of other relevant parties."
A step too far or a step in the wrong direction? A critique of the 2014 Amendment to the Belgian Euthanasia Act,"In 2014, Article 3 of the the Belgian Euthanasia Act (2002) (the Euthanasia Act) was amended (‘the Amendment’) to include the ‘capacity for discernment’ requirement. This paper explores the implications of this highly controversial Amendment. I remain unconvinced of the benefits for children < 12 years old suffering chronic or terminal illnesses. In Part One, I argue that the phrase ‘capacity for discernment’ is problematic and vulnerable to abuse; neither a consistent, widely accepted definition of the phrase has been established nor a standardised method or procedure to adequately gauge a minor’s capacity for discernment. In Part Two I advance the argument that specifically for children < 12 years, aggressive and sophisticated paediatric palliative care treatment, which risks, but does not intend death, is more ethically justified than Euthanasia treatment. A definition of a child’s interests is best achieved through a care-based ethics framework; namely, the child’s relationship with their parents and family members, their doctors and medical practitioners is held to be an interest of crucial importance for the child. I conclude that paediatric palliative care arguably better promotes and upholds this interest."
"An in vivo evaluation of anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-pyretic activities of newly synthesized 1, 2, 4 Triazole derivatives","In recent years, 1, 2, 4-triazole and its derivatives have been reported to be pharmacologically significant scaffolds. They possess analgesic, anti-tubercular, anti-inflammatory, anti-convulsant, anti-oxidant, anti-fungal, anti-cancer, anxiolytic and anti-depressant activity. This study was designed and conducted to evaluate the potential anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activities of Triazole derivatives."
Using a cubic B-spline method in conjunction with a one-step optimized hybrid block approach to solve nonlinear partial differential equations,"In this paper, we develop an optimized hybrid block method which is combined with a modified cubic B-spline method, for solving non-linear partial differential equations. In particular, it will be applied for solving three well-known problems, namely, the Burgers equation, Buckmaster equation and FitzHugh–Nagumo equation. Most of the developed methods in the literature for non-linear partial differential equations have not focused on optimizing the time step-size and a very small value must be considered to get accurate approximations. The motivation behind the development of this work is to overcome this trade-off up to much extent using a larger time step-size without compromising accuracy. The optimized hybrid block method considered is proved to be A-stable and convergent. Furthermore, the obtained numerical approximations have been compared with exact and numerical solutions available in the literature and found to be adequate. In particular, without using quasilinearization or filtering techniques, the results for small viscosity coefficient for Burgers equation are found to be accurate. We have found that the combination of the two considered methods is computationally efficient for solving non-linear PDEs."
A personalized decision aid for prostate cancer shared decision making,"A shared decision-making model is preferred for engaging prostate cancer patients in treatment decisions. However, the process of assessing an individual’s preferences and values is challenging and not formalized. The purpose of this study is to develop an automated decision aid for patient-centric treatment decision-making using decision analysis, preference thresholds and value elicitations to maximize the compatibility between a patient’s treatment expectations and outcome."
Level and contributing factors of health data quality and information use in two districts in Northwest Ethiopia: social-ecological perspective,"The health management information system has been implemented at all levels of healthcare delivery to ensure quality data production and information use in Ethiopia. Including the capacity-building activities and provision of infrastructure, various efforts have been made to improve the production and use of quality health data though the result is still unsatisfactory. This study aimed to examine the quality of health data and use in Wogera and Tach-Armacheho districts and understand its barriers and facilitators."
Multi-task learning for Chinese clinical named entity recognition with external knowledge,"Named entity recognition (NER) on Chinese electronic medical/healthcare records has attracted significantly attentions as it can be applied to building applications to understand these records. Most previous methods have been purely data-driven, requiring high-quality and large-scale labeled medical data. However, labeled data is expensive to obtain, and these data-driven methods are difficult to handle rare and unseen entities."
Circ_0000620 acts as an oncogenic factor in gastric cancer through regulating MMP2 expression via sponging miR-671-5p,Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common cancers in the digestive system.

This study focused on the biological role and molecular mechanism of circ_0000620 in GC progression.
"Achievements, experiences and challenges of the battle against poverty in China’s ethnic minority areas: focusing on the “three areas and three prefectures”","The incidence of poverty in three of China’s provinces (Qinghai, Guizhou and Yunnan) and five of its autonomous regions (Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Tibet, Ningxia, and Xinjiang) is greater than the national average. As severely impoverished areas in China and top priorities in the country’s battle against poverty, ethnic minority areas, especially the most impoverished “three areas” (the Tibet Autonomous Region, prefectures and counties with large Tibetan populations in the provinces of Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu and Yunnan, and the Hotan, Aksu, Kashgar prefectures and Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture in southern Xinjiang) and the “three prefectures” (the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, and the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu Province) showed a significant reduction in poverty and achieved decisive progress in poverty elimination from 2018 to 2019. This laid a solid foundation for the building of a moderately prosperous society in an all respects by 2020. By reviewing and explaining methods and measures of targeted poverty alleviation used in ethnic minority areas of China, this paper summarizes the most successful experiences of these areas, particularly the “Three Areas and Three Prefectures”, in the process of alleviating poverty and building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. These successful experiences consist of four aspects: roles of national systems, promotion of key poverty alleviation efforts, improved mechanisms and systems for targeted poverty alleviation, and specific innovative methods and measures. While examining the difficulties of eliminating poverty and building a moderately prosperous society in all respects in China’s ethnic minority areas, especially in the “Three Areas and Three Prefectures”, this article also discusses practical challenges and problems yet to be solved, such as follow-up adjustments of poverty alleviation policies, cultivation of self-development capacity and weak educational foundations. Ultimately, this paper offers relevant solutions and suggestions in relation to macro policies, government officials and impoverished groups."
Current practice patterns and gaps in guideline-concordant breast cancer survivorship care,"Breast cancer-specific survivorship care guidelines for the more than 3.8 million survivors in the U.S. are available, but implementation in clinical practice remains challenging. We examined current practice patterns and factors associated with guideline-concordant survivorship care among oncologists."
Advance rent mobilisation strategies of graduate renters in Ghana: a submarket of the private rental housing market,"The practice of advance rent, where landlords ask renters to pay a lump-sum rent covering 2 or more years, is gaining scholarly and political attention in Africa. Nevertheless, there is limited empirical research investigating how renters mobilize funds to meet this financial commitment. Existing literature suggests that renters, irrespective of their educational level, face difficulties in paying advance rent, hence compelling them to rely mainly on their bonding (family and friends) and bridging (employers and financial institutions) social capital to pay advance rent. Drawing on rational choice and social capital theories coupled with data from a novel (graduate) sub-market of Ghana’s rental housing market, this article finds that personal savings remain the most rational current and future source of funding options graduate renters draw upon to pay advance rent, albeit some still drawing on their social capital. The findings demonstrate that graduate renters do not use bonding social capital in their future mobilization strategies after they have drawn on the same in previous years, although they continue to rely on their bridging social capital and other strategies to mobilize funds for advance rent. The study suggests the need to rethink rational choice and social capital theories to incorporate inter-temporal dynamics among different social groups and to traverse the current binary conception of the rental housing market in Ghana to consider different sub-markets and how they respond to existing challenges in the housing sector."
"Complexes of Li, Na, and Mg with 2D allotropies of second and third period: a theoretical study","Complexes of Li, Na, and Mg with graphene, silicene, phosphorene nanoflakes (NFs), and their 2D allotropies have been studied at dispersion corrected TPSS/def-TZVP level of theory. The energy partition analysis of the complexes revealed that for most of the complexes exchange and correlation energies represent dominant contributions to the binding with strong charge transfer from the metal atom to a NF. The exceptions are Mg complexes of graphene and phosphorene NFs where binding is due to dispersion and correlation terms. This difference is also reflected in large Mg-NF distances suggesting weak intermolecular interactions in these complexes. The calculated activation energies for metal hopping are easily achievable at room temperatures for carbon and silicon allotropies. However, they are significantly higher for phosphorus allotropies reaching almost 18 kcal/mol. Generally, activation energies for hopping increase with binding energies for graphene, silicene, and phosphorene NFs. This trend does not observe however for graphene, silicene, and phosphorene 2D allotropies."
Experimental investigation on the effect of forward-facing steps and gaps combined with wall suction on boundary layer transition,"Wall suction is known to be an effective Laminar Flow Control (LFC) technique to delay laminar-turbulent transition, but its commercial implementation is still limited due to design and integration issues. In particular, current design tools that model wall suction do not account for potential surface discontinuities that can arise during installation. However, these defects should be accounted for since they generally move transition further upstream, which could cancel drag reduction benefits from wall suction. Given this context, the present investigation aims at experimentally characterizing the combined effect of wall suction and two types of surface defects that can be found on aerodynamic surfaces, i.e., forward-facing steps (FFS) and gaps. Critical relative dimensions (at which transition occurs at the defect location) were different for each type of defect but remained unchanged regardless of whether wall suction was applied or not. For subcritical defects (defects where transition occurs further downstream of their location), wall suction could still delay transition, with reduced effectiveness. Spectral analysis inside the boundary layer revealed that the transition mechanism, governed by Tollmien–Schlichting instabilities, was unchanged in the presence of either critical or subcritical defects. The resulting increase in amplification of the existing instabilities due to either defect warranted the use of the \(\Delta N\) model to capture this effect. Wall suction is therefore a robust LFC technique that can compete with the destabilizing effects of subcritical defects, albeit less effectively than in a smooth configuration. However, given the chosen suction flow rates, this technique could not delay or prevent the critical dimensions determined for cases without suction"
Three-dimensional flow field and acoustics of supersonic rectangular jets,"Supersonic jets are known to produce complex flow fields containing high levels of turbulence, thin shear layers with large gradients, and elevated noise levels. One of the critical parameters that determine the characteristics of supersonic flow is the nozzle geometry. In this experimental study, supersonic jets produced by a rectangular converging-diverging (C-D) nozzle with an aspect ratio of 4 and a design Mach number of 1.44 are studied. A multitude of supersonic jet expansion conditions ranging from highly over-expanded jets to under-expanded jets are explored. High spatial resolution velocity field measurements are obtained using planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) to identify the mean flow field structures, including shocks and shear layers, within the minor and major axis planes along the nozzle centerline. In order to completely characterize the asymmetric nature of the rectangular jet flow field, direct volumetric measurements of the full three-dimensional velocity field are also obtained using Tomographic PIV. Apart from the time-averaged velocity field, measures of the turbulent kinetic energy and vorticity fields are also obtained from the statistically converged results. Through these detailed measurements, the shock cell structures, shear layer growth, and volumetric features such as corner vortices and shear layer coherent structures are elucidated at a very high level of fidelity and over a broad range of conditions. High-fidelity microphone measurements along the minor and major axes are also taken to provide complementary information on the aeroacoustics of supersonic rectangular jets. As expected, the sound generated by imperfectly expanded jets is found to contain strong screech tones and broadband shock-associated noise. The screech tone frequencies are found to be correlated with the fully expanded jet Mach number, with the degree and manner of jet expansion strongly affecting the aeroacoustic characteristics of the supersonic rectangular jets."
Human alveolar type 2 epithelium transdifferentiates into metaplastic KRT5+ basal cells,"Loss of alveolar type 2 cells (AEC2s) and the ectopic appearance of basal cells in the alveoli characterize severe lung injuries such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Here we demonstrate that human alveolar type 2 cells (hAEC2s), unlike murine AEC2s, transdifferentiate into basal cells in response to fibrotic signalling in the lung mesenchyme, in vitro and in vivo. Single-cell analysis of normal hAEC2s and mesenchymal cells in organoid co-cultures revealed the emergence of pathologic fibroblasts and basaloid cells previously described in IPF. Transforming growth factor-β1 and anti-bone morphogenic protein signalling in the organoids promoted transdifferentiation. Trajectory and histologic analyses of both hAEC2-derived organoids and IPF epithelium indicated that hAEC2s transdifferentiate into basal cells through alveolar-basal intermediates that accumulate in proximity to pathologic CTHRC1hi/TGFB1hi fibroblasts. Our study indicates that hAEC2 loss and expansion of alveolar metaplastic basal cells in severe human lung injuries are causally connected through an hAEC2-basal cell lineage trajectory driven by aberrant mesenchyme."
Internal structure of ultralow-velocity zones consistent with origin from a basal magma ocean,"Seismological observations reveal patches of low-velocity anomalies at the core–mantle boundary known as ultralow-velocity zones. Despite recent advances, their origin and dynamic link to the lowermost mantle remain unclear. Here we employ seismic data analysis and high-resolution geodynamic modelling to study the origin of ultralow-velocity zones beneath the Coral Sea between Australia and New Zealand. The analysis of core-reflected waveforms with rigorous estimation of Bayesian uncertainties shows strong evidence of stratified density increases (~30%) and shear-wave velocity decreases (~50%) within the ultralow-velocity zones. These zones thin on two sides and occur at the edge of the Pacific large low-shear-velocity province. Geodynamic modelling demonstrates that these features are consistent with the presence of compositional heterogeneities within the ultralow-velocity zones that may be caused by the remnants of Earth’s early differentiation. We conclude that small-scale structures that are compositionally distinct from their surroundings reside at the bottom of the mantle without full homogenization, throughout Earth’s history."
Variation and transmission of the human gut microbiota across multiple familial generations,"Although the composition and functional potential of the human gut microbiota evolve over the lifespan, kinship has been identified as a key covariate of microbial community diversification. However, to date, sharing of microbiota features within families has mostly been assessed between parents and their direct offspring. Here we investigate the potential transmission and persistence of familial microbiome patterns and microbial genotypes in a family cohort (n = 102) spanning 3 to 5 generations over the same female bloodline. We observe microbiome community composition associated with kinship, with seven low abundant genera displaying familial distribution patterns. While kinship and current cohabitation emerge as closely entangled variables, our explorative analyses of microbial genotype distribution and transmission estimates point at the latter as a key covariate of strain dissemination. Highest potential transmission rates are estimated between sisters and mother–daughter pairs, decreasing with increasing daughter’s age and being higher among cohabiting pairs than those living apart. Although rare, we detect potential transmission events spanning three and four generations, primarily involving species of the genera Alistipes and Bacteroides. Overall, while our analyses confirm the existence of family-bound microbiome community profiles, transmission or co-acquisition of bacterial strains appears to be strongly linked to cohabitation."
Enhancing echelon-ferrers construction for constant dimension code,"Echelon-Ferrers construction is one of the most powerful methods to improve the lower bounds for constant dimension codes. Although the method was proposed more than 10 years ago, it is still the best construction in a number of cases. In this paper, we remove parts of lifted FDRM codes from the echelon-Ferrers construction, and insert an SC-representation set, which finally improves the Echelon-ferrers construction, to get lower bounds for the following cases: \(A_q(11,4,4),\ A_q(15,4,4)\) and \(A_q(19,4,4)\)."
A new accelerated proximal boosting machine with convergence rate \(O(1/t^2)\),"Boosting algorithms, a well-studied and effective machine learning technology, iteratively combines the output of weak learners to produce a powerful predictive model with performances improved over the single weak learner. Accelerated proximal boosting machine (APBM) is a boosting algorithm built upon the proximal point algorithm and employed Nesterov’s accelerated descent. However, in the acceleration process, the momentum term will accumulate errors, which may cause the algorithm to diverge. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named CAPBM, which incorporates corrected pseudo residual into the design of APBM in boosting process. By applying the corrected pseudo residual to update the momentum sequence, CAPBM can reduce the error generated when fitting the residual, and further ensure the algorithm convergence. Finally, we theoretically prove that CAPBM is convergent with a rate of \(O(1/t^2)\). Numerical experiments on real datasets are carried out to illustrate that the proposed CAPBM algorithm is effective and competitive."
A comprehensive conceptual and bibliometric study of person-centered methodologies,"Person-centered approaches, such as latent profile analysis (LPA) and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), have gained in popularity in organizational scholarship because of their ability to provide insight into how interrelations between a group of conditions can lead to a particular outcome. Despite the growing acceptance of person-centered approaches in social science research, traditional variable-centered approaches continue to prevail, although their dominance is increasingly questioned. This paper offers in-depth analysis of the current state of QCA and LPA from both a conceptual and a bibliometric perspective. This study thus aims to contextualize the role of person-centered methodologies in organizational scholarship. This aim is important, given the significance of exploring novel approaches to advance knowledge in organizational research. This paper provides scholars with quantifiable and readily comparable information on the use of these emerging but promising methods in organizational studies. Ultimately, this scientific contribution sheds light on the current and prospective applications of person-centered methods in research. Moreover, it offers scholars who are considering applying these methods objective analysis of the scientific production in this area thus far."
Porous Media Cleaning by Pulsating Filtration Flow,"A problem of porous media cleaning by a pulsating external flow is studied numerically. We consider a closed domain of porous media, which was initially clogged by an impurity. The purification of such a domain is performed by an external vertical pulsating flow of a pure fluid. The transport of the impurity with immobilization process is modeled into framework of the nonlinear MIM model with saturation of the immobile phase. The clogging of media is taken into account which, in turn, leads to a decrease of the pore volume due to the immobilized impurity on the pores. The one dimensional solution as in the form of vertical seepage was obtained. It is shown that the most effective cleaning is achieved for the maximal possible value of the external flow intensity and can be controlled by the variation of the pulsation frequency and amplitude. However at the high intensities of the external flow the one dimensional solution becomes unstable. The stability problem was solved within the quasistatic approach. The critical curves in the system parameters are obtained and discussed."
Forecasting carbon futures price: a hybrid method incorporating fuzzy entropy and extreme learning machine,"In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model that extends prior work involving ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) by using fuzzy entropy and extreme learning machine (ELM) methods. We demonstrate this 3-stage model by applying it to forecast carbon futures prices which are characterized by chaos and complexity. First, we employ the EEMD method to decompose carbon futures prices into a couple of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residue. Second, the fuzzy entropy and K-means clustering methods are used to reconstruct the IMFs and the residue to obtain three reconstructed components, specifically a high frequency series, a low frequency series, and a trend series. Third, the ARMA model is implemented for the stationary high and low frequency series, while the extreme learning machine (ELM) model is utilized for the non-stationary trend series. Finally, all the component forecasts are aggregated to form final forecasts of the carbon price for each model. The empirical results show that the proposed reconstruction algorithm can bring more than 40% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the traditional fine-to-coarse reconstruction algorithm under the same forecasting framework. The hybrid forecasting model proposed in this paper also well captures the direction of the price changes, with strong and robust forecasting ability, which is significantly better than the single forecasting models and the other hybrid forecasting models."
RETRACTED ARTICLE: Post-operative blood pressure and 3-year major adverse cardiac events in Chinese patients undergoing PCI,"There is no clear evidence for the target value of blood pressure control after Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Therefore, our study was designed to explore the relationship between blood pressure after PCI and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during 3-year follow-up."

Understanding the sociodemographic factors associated with intention to receive SMS messages for health information in a rural area of Bangladesh,"The use of digital interventions for managing chronic diseases is significantly increasing. The aim of this study was to estimate the proportion of ownership of a mobile phone, and factors associated with the ability to read and access SMS delivered health information, and willingness to pay for it among people with hypertension in a rural area in Bangladesh."
Association between health insurance enrolment and maternal health care service utilization among women in Ethiopia,"Health insurance was considered as the third global health transition which can increase access to health care services by eliminating monetary obstacles to maternal health care use, particularly in emerging nations. Hence, this study aimed to assess the association between health insurance enrolment and maternal health care service utilization among women in Ethiopia."
"Joint spatio-temporal modelling of adverse pregnancy outcomes sharing common risk factors at sub-county level in Kenya, 2016–2019","Adverse pregnancy outcomes jointly account for a high proportion of mortality and morbidity among pregnant women and their infants. Furthermore, the burden attributed to adverse pregnancy outcomes remains high and inadequately characterised due to the intricate interplay of its etiology and shared set of important risk factors. This study sought to quantify and map the underlying risk of multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes in Kenya at sub-county level using a shared component space-time modelling framework."
Experimental study on inertial focusing pattern in asymmetric contraction–expansion array microchannel,"The transition of particle equilibrium pattern was investigated in contraction–expansion array (CEA) microchannel. The experimental results showed that, in addition to ordinary trajectory 1 (a focusing band near the center of the channel), another novel trajectory 2 could appear on the side near cavity sidewall. The effects of cavity dimension, Reynolds number, and particle diameter on the inertial focusing pattern of the particles were explored in detail. The equilibrium position of trajectory 1 will shift from the geometric center of the channel to the wall with cavity due to the influence of secondary flow generated by CEA units. The particles of 20 μm and 15 μm showed ideal focusing, while the particles of 10 μm focused in a wild band. It showed that the asymmetric CEA units can be used to regulate the focusing position of particles. Because of the squeezing action of two vortexes at the entrance of the contraction section, the trajectory 2 can be stable once it appears. In addition, the location of trajectory 2 is less affected by particle diameters and Re. In the same structure, trajectory 2 is more likely to appear with small particle diameter and large Re. Finally, we summarized the critical Re of focusing pattern transition. When it is greater than this critical value, trajectory 1 and trajectory 2 will exist in the channels simultaneously. It could be used to guide the design of the CEA channels. This basic research could provide a guidance to the application of microfluidic particle manipulation technique."
"Model of care and chance of spontaneous vaginal birth: a prospective, multicenter matched-pair analysis from North Rhine-Westphalia","Advantages of midwife-led models of care have been reported; these include a higher vaginal birth rate and less interventions. In Germany, 98.4% of women are giving birth in obstetrician-led units. We compared the outcome of birth planned in alongside midwifery units (AMU) with a matched group of low-risk women who gave birth in obstetrician-led units."
Barriers and attitudes towards cervical cancer screening in primary healthcare in Poland - doctors’ perspective,"Healthcare systems have adopted different strategies to reduce the burden of cervical cancer. In Poland, a population-based screening program was implemented in 2006, leading to a downward trend in cervical cancer burden. However, screening rates are still low in relation to other EU member states. In Poland, Pap smears are mainly performed by gynecologists rather than Primary Health Care (PHC) physicians. Little is known about the experiences and attitudes of the latter regarding cervical cancer screening in a PHC setting."
Swiss GPs’ preferences for antidepressant treatment in mild depression: vignette-based quantitative analysis,"GPs frequently prescribe antidepressants in mild depression. The aim of this study was to examine, how often Swiss GPs recommend antidepressants in various clinical presentations of mild depression and which factors contribute to antidepressant treatment recommendations."
Lineage recording in human cerebral organoids,"Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived organoids provide models to study human organ development. Single-cell transcriptomics enable highly resolved descriptions of cell states within these systems; however, approaches are needed to directly measure lineage relationships. Here we establish iTracer, a lineage recorder that combines reporter barcodes with inducible CRISPR–Cas9 scarring and is compatible with single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. We apply iTracer to explore clonality and lineage dynamics during cerebral organoid development and identify a time window of fate restriction as well as variation in neurogenic dynamics between progenitor neuron families. We also establish long-term four-dimensional light-sheet microscopy for spatial lineage recording in cerebral organoids and confirm regional clonality in the developing neuroepithelium. We incorporate gene perturbation (iTracer-perturb) and assess the effect of mosaic TSC2 mutations on cerebral organoid development. Our data shed light on how lineages and fates are established during cerebral organoid formation. More broadly, our techniques can be adapted in any iPSC-derived culture system to dissect lineage alterations during normal or perturbed development."
Monitoring protein conformational changes using fluorescent nanoantennas,"Understanding the relationship between protein structural dynamics and function is crucial for both basic research and biotechnology. However, methods for studying the fast dynamics of structural changes are limited. Here, we introduce fluorescent nanoantennas as a spectroscopic technique to sense and report protein conformational changes through noncovalent dye-protein interactions. Using experiments and molecular simulations, we detect and characterize five distinct conformational states of intestinal alkaline phosphatase, including the transient enzyme–substrate complex. We also explored the universality of the nanoantenna strategy with another model protein, Protein G and its interaction with antibodies, and demonstrated a rapid screening strategy to identify efficient nanoantennas. These versatile nanoantennas can be used with diverse dyes to monitor small and large conformational changes, suggesting that they could be used to characterize diverse protein movements or in high-throughput screening applications."
Oliver C. Cox and the political economy of racial capitalism,"Oliver C. Cox was one of the most important and accomplished US-based sociologists, labor historians, and socialist thinkers of the twentieth century. He produced a series of classic works on racial prejudice and race relations and the foundations and development of capitalism. Despite some recent interest in his work, likely due to the renewed interest in the concept of racial capitalism, in-depth analysis of Cox’s work remains underdeveloped. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, the paper shows that the development of racial prejudice was, for Cox, not only an invention of capitalism as a particular moment in history, but it was also always undergirded by the requirements of capitalist political economy. Second, I show the dynamics that Cox believed were required to establish the conditions for racially prejudiced working-class subjects. Part of capital’s ideological alibi was, for Cox, the development and sedimentation of working-class racial antagonism. Yet, Cox showed that racial antagonism among the working class was inherently contradictory and counter to working-class interests and was traceable to the social, political, and economic apparatus of the elite class. Because the elite class necessarily relies upon the exploitation of the labor supply, it likewise relies upon racial antagonism to maintain labor quiescence. The work of the social scientist, then, is to explain such asocial phenomena in materialist terms, thereby redirecting working-class energy toward solidarity and the horizon of socialist revolution."
The impact of different data sources on the level and structure of income inequality,"This paper aims to analyze the effect on measured inequality and its structure of using administrative data instead of survey data. Different analyses are carried out based on the Spanish Survey on Income and Living Conditions (ECV) that continued to ask households for their income despite assigning their income data as provided by the Tax Agency and the Social Security Administration. Our main finding is that the largest discrepancies between administrative and survey data are in the tails of the distribution. In addition to that, there are clear differences in the level and structure of inequality across data sources. These differences matter, and our results should be a wake-up call to interpret the results based on only one source of income data with caution."
An isotopic labeling approach linking natural products with biosynthetic gene clusters,"Major advances in genome sequencing and large-scale biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) analysis have prompted an age of natural product discovery driven by genome mining. Still, connecting molecules to their cognate BGCs is a substantial bottleneck for this approach. We have developed a mass-spectrometry-based parallel stable isotope labeling platform, termed IsoAnalyst, which assists in associating metabolite stable isotope labeling patterns with BGC structure prediction to connect natural products to their corresponding BGCs. Here we show that IsoAnalyst can quickly associate both known metabolites and unknown analytes with BGCs to elucidate the complex chemical phenotypes of these biosynthetic systems. We validate this approach for a range of compound classes, using both the type strain Saccharopolyspora erythraea and an environmentally isolated Micromonospora sp. We further demonstrate the utility of this tool with the discovery of lobosamide D, a new and structurally unique member of the family of lobosamide macrolactams."
Effect of shadowing and background radiation on optical OQAM-FBMC based visible light communication system,"Filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) technique is a capable contender of 5G communication system. Recently it has been introduced to the optical wireless communication. FBMC has several advantages over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing such as low out-of-band distortion, asynchronous transmission and increased spectral efficiency. In this presented work, firstly the effect of shadowing and background radiation is analyzed on FBMC based visible light communication system. The minimization of bit error rate (BER) is done using metaheuristic optimization algorithm to obtain optimum performance of optical FBMC technique. Then estimation technique for shadowing and background radiation noise is proposed. The proposed estimation technique shows 20 percent improvement in the spectral efficiency of FBMC and BER is also improved by 2.5 dB than without estimation. However, computational complexity and PAPR is slightly increased due to extra processing at receiver which can be further reduced by algorithms."
The case for private administration of deposit guarantee schemes,"We make the case that the responsibility for appointing board members in Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGS) for commercial banks should be entrusted to the industry. In doing so, we challenge the position adopted by the International Monetary Fund, which has proposed public DGSs as the best practice. We lay out the comparative advantages of private over public DGS administration, and contend that the role of the government should in principle be limited to regulating DGSs specifically and financial markets in general. We conclude that the current worldwide trend towards greater involvement of government in financial regulation should not be extended to the administration of DGSs."
"Spatio-temporal analysis of climatic variability, trend detection, and drought assessment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan","This study spatio-temporally analyzes the climatic variability and assesses drought in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The temperature and rainfall data were collected from Pakistan Meteorology Department (PMD) for a period from 1971 to 2018, whereas potential evapotranspiration was calculated applying Thornthwaite methodology. The variability in rainfall and temperature was spatially analyzed in GIS environment, whereas for trend detection, the Mann–Kendall approach has been applied. The Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) has been used for assessing drought assessment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. After applying the RDI, four drought phases were detected in the study area. The most severe drought span was during 1998–2002. Additionally, during the last 3 years (2015–2018), severe to extreme drought period was recorded at the majority of meteorological stations. The frequency of dry years varies from 8 to 3% at Balakot to 22.9% at Drosh meteorological station. The analysis further reveals that the increasing drought trend has been recorded at Kalam, Pattan, Balakot, and Kakul meteorological stations. The increasing drought at higher altitudes is because of a decrease in the amount of precipitation and an increase in temperature, which is an intimation of increasing risk to available water resources (glaciers) in this region and it will ultimately increase the issue of water scarcity in Pakistan."
Effect of load control mode on the post-peak behaviour of siltstone,"The mechanical properties and post-peak behaviour of rocks are typically determined using axial and circumferential strain control load methods. However, the effects of the load control mode on the mechanical properties and post-peak behaviour of rocks have not been investigated comprehensively. In this study, the mechanical properties and post-peak behaviour of siltstone are investigated using both the axial and circumferential strain control modes. Rock specimens are tested under uniaxial and triaxial compression. Laboratory test results indicate that the compressive strength, residual strength, and fracture angle are smaller when loading is performed via the circumferential strain control mode; however, the elastic modulus is higher. The stress–strain curves obtained from the axial strain control test are those of class I. However, the stress–strain curves obtained from the circumferential strain control test transited from that of class II to class I as the confining pressure increases. The occurrence mechanism of the class II curve and the transition of the stress–strain curve from class II to class I are clarified. The brittleness estimated from the rock specimens under the two load control modes indicate greater brittleness under circumferential strain control loading."
"Phenol biodegradation by plant growth promoting bacterium, S. odorifera: kinetic modeling and process optimization","One of the main organic pollutants that could result from industrial products and chemical transformations is phenol. In the current study, the kinetics of Serratia odorifera, which was isolated from arable soil, was studied by growing it on broth minimal medium spiked with phenol as only carbon source and energy. The newly isolated plant growth-promoting bacterium (PGPB), S. odorifera, was used for the first time for phenol biodegradation. The growth kinetics parameters (phenol-dependent) including maximum specific growth rate (μmax), half-saturation coefficient (Ks), and the Haldane’s growth kinetics inhibition coefficient (Ki), were tested via Haldane inhibition model and resulted on the 0.469 (h −1), 26.6 (mgL−1), and 292 (mgL−1), respectively. The sum of squared error (SSR) of 4.89 × 10–3 was fitted to the experimental data by Haldane equation. The results of phenol biodegradation were fitted into the modified Gombertz model. The increase of phenol concentrations led to increases in both the rate of phenol biodegradation and lagging time. The optimal phenol biodegradation and bacterial growth obtained by S. odorifera, were at 28 °C incubation temperature and a pH of 7.0. The pathway of phenol biodegradation by S. odorifera was proposed in the current study to provide a new insight into synchronization of phenol biodegradation and plant growth-promoting bacteria. This may play an important role in remediation of phenol-contaminated soil besides promoting the plant growth, thus lessening the plant stress."
Self-directed Science Learning During COVID-19 and Beyond,"Prompted by the sudden shift to remote instruction in March 2020 brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers explored online resources to support their students learning from home. We report on how twelve teachers identified and creatively leveraged open educational resources (OERs) and practices to facilitate self-directed science learning. Based on interviews and logged data, we illustrate how teachers’ use of OER starkly differed from the typical uses of technology for transmitting information or increasing productivity. These experiences provide insights into ways teachers and professional developers can take advantage of OER to promote self-directed learning when in-person instruction resumes."
Extended myectomy for apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a case report,"Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that predominantly affects the apex of the left ventricle and rarely involves the right ventricular apex or both apexes. Heart transplantation is the traditional treatment for apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Although surgical myectomy approaching the apex has been available for decades, its safety and accuracy greatly depend on the surgeon’s skills and experience."
Assessing the usefulness of policy brief and policy dialogue as knowledge translation tools towards contextualizing the accountability framework for routine immunization at a subnational level in Nigeria,"Evidence suggests that implementing an accountability mechanism such as the accountability framework for routine immunization in Nigeria (AFRIN) will improve routine immunization (RI) performance. The fact that the AFRIN, which was developed in 2012, still had not been operationalized at the subnational level (Ebonyi State) by 2018 may in part account for the poor RI coverage (33%) in 2017. Knowledge translation (KT) is defined as the methods for closing the gaps from knowledge to practice. Policy briefs (useful in communicating research findings to policy-makers) and policy dialogues (that enable stakeholders to understand research evidence and create context-resonant implementation plans) are two KT tools. This study evaluated their usefulness in enabling policy-makers to contextualize AFRIN in Ebonyi State, Nigeria."
"The effect of passive mobilization associated with blood flow restriction and combined with electrical stimulation on cardiorespiratory safety, neuromuscular adaptations, physical function, and quality of life in comatose patients in an ICU: a randomized controlled clinical trial","Intensive care unit-acquired atrophy and weakness are associated with high mortality, a reduction in physical function, and quality of life. Passive mobilization (PM) and neuromuscular electrical stimulation were applied in comatose patients; however, evidence is inconclusive regarding atrophy and weakness prevention. Blood flow restriction (BFR) associated with PM (BFRp) or with electrical stimulation (BFRpE) was able to reduce atrophy and increase muscle mass in spinal cord-injured patients, respectively. Bulky venous return occurs after releasing BFR, which can cause unknown repercussions on the cardiovascular system. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of BFRp and BFRpE on cardiovascular safety and applicability, neuromuscular adaptations, physical function, and quality of life in comatose patients in intensive care units (ICUs)."
Electron-Microscopy Studies of the Structure of Thin Epitaxial Ge2Sb2Te5 Layers Grown on Si(111) Substrates,"For the creation of memory cells of new generation, structurally perfect epitaxial Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) layers and multilayered crystalline structures based on GeTe/Sb2Te3 superlattices grown on Si substrates are of interest. This initiates the studies of specific features of formation of such materials by various methods, including molecular-beam epitaxy. In this study, the structure of a thin (13-nm-thick) epitaxial GST layer to be used for the production of phase-change memory cells is investigated. The layers are grown by molecular-beam epitaxy on Sb-passivated Si(111) substrates. The studies are conducted by transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction analysis of cross- and planar-section samples. The high resolution images of cross-section samples and the diffraction patterns for planar-section thin foils and their bright-field micrographs are obtained. It is found that the layer is composed of structurally perfect crystalline grains consisting mainly of the hexagonal phase and, in some local regions, of the ordered GST cubic phase, whose basal planes are parallel to the substrate surface. From the quantitative analysis of the moiré pattern appearing in bright-field electron-microscopy images, it is established that the grains, for which the GST(\(11\bar {2}0\)) and Si(220) planes are rotated with respect to each other about the growth direction through up to 2°, occupy about 60% of the surface area of the epitaxial layer and 26% of the area is accounted for practically nonrotated grains. The fraction of the area occupied by grains misoriented with respect to the substrate by angles from 2° to 8° is close to 33%, and the grains occupying about 7% of the layer area are rotated through angles larger than 8°. The average angle of rotation angle is about 2.6°. The estimated average dimension of nonrotated grains is about 150 nm and decreases with increasing angle of rotation relative to the substrate. The experimentally established systematic features of the grain structure of the epitaxial GST layer suggest that the Si(111) substrate has an orienting effect upon the formation of the layer."
Method for Predicting the Effective Conductivity of Textured Polycrystals Taking Intergranular Gaps into Consideration,"Сrystallites in real polycrystals are separated from each other by intergranular space, which affects the effective conductivity of polycrystals. This effect increases with decreasing crystal size. A method for predicting the effective conductivity of polycrystalline media, taking the intergranular space into consideration is developed. The method is constructed using the polycrystal model in which crystallites are considered to be inhomogeneous, consisting of a uniform crystalline anisotropic core and a uniform isotropic shell. In this model, the role of the intergranular gaps is played by crystallite shells. The effective polycrystal conductivity is calculated using the generalized effective-field approximation; the effective medium conductivity is taken as the reference parameter of the medium; i.e., the self-consistent solution method is used. Based on the developed method, a formula for the effective conductivity of polycrystals depending on the conductivity tensor of the crystalline core, shell conductivity, and the core volume fraction in crystallites is derived for the case of spherical crystallites with spherical shells. This formula is applied to particular cases of a polycrystalline medium, i.e., a polycrystal with similar crystallites with isotropic core; in this case, the expression for the effective conductivity is identical to the classical Maxwell–Garnett formula; polycrystals with similar crystallites with anisotropic cores at identical orientations of their crystallographic axes; polycrystals with similar crystallites with anisotropic cores at the uniform distribution of orientations of their crystallographic axes in space; and polycrystals with conductive crystallite cores and absolutely nonconductive shells. In the latter case, the effective polycrystal conductivity vanishes, which is completely consistent with the physical meaning."
RF system challenges for future \(\hbox {e}^+ \hbox {e}^-\) circular colliders,"The RF system is the centrepiece of any future circular lepton collider. In particular, the system is required to support the high intensity beams needed for pushing the luminosity at the lower energy regimes of future energy-frontier circular lepton colliders (e.g. for operation in the Z peak and at the WW threshold). Capturing, storing the beam and replacing energy losses from synchrotron radiation demand low frequency, low shunt resistance cavities, low number of cells and high RF power per cell. Controlling the beam both transversely and longitudinally requires sophisticated beam control and timing systems. Additional RF systems are used to ensure transverse stability (feedback systems) and to increase the luminosity (crab cavities). Operation at high energies (such as the ZH and \({\mathrm{t}{\overline{\mathrm{t}}}}\) threshold) requires a very large accelerating voltage, since synchrotron radiation leads to significantly higher energy losses per turn which must be compensated. Since the RF system is to be optimised in size and energy efficiency for varying demands for the different operational modes, the spectrum of R &D challenges covers a wide range of technologies."
Building FAIR Functionality: Annotating Events in Time Series Data Using Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED),"Human electrophysiological and related time series data are often acquired in complex, event-rich environments. However, the resulting recorded brain or other dynamics are often interpreted in relation to more sparsely recorded or subsequently-noted events. Currently a substantial gap exists between the level of event description required by current digital data archiving standards and the level of annotation required for successful analysis of event-related data across studies, environments, and laboratories. Manifold challenges must be addressed, most prominently ontological clarity, vocabulary extensibility, annotation tool availability, and overall usability, to allow and promote sharing of data with an effective level of descriptive detail for labeled events. Motivating data authors to perform the work needed to adequately annotate their data is a key challenge. This paper describes new developments in the Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) system for addressing these issues. We recap the evolution of HED and its acceptance by the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) movement, describe the recent release of HED-3G, a third generation HED tools and design framework, and discuss directions for future development. Given consistent, sufficiently detailed, tool-enabled, field-relevant annotation of the nature of recorded events, prospects are bright for large-scale analysis and modeling of aggregated time series data, both in behavioral and brain imaging sciences and beyond."
A comparison of natural user interface and graphical user interface for narrative in HMD-based augmented reality,"Over the years, the various mediums available for storytelling have progressively expanded, from spoken to written word, then to film, and now to Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). In 2016, the cutting-edge Head-Mounted Display (HMD) AR Microsoft HoloLens was released. However, though it has been several years, the quality of the user experience with narration using HMD-based AR technology has been rarely discussed. The present study explored interactive narrative in HMD-based AR regarding different user interfaces and their influence on users’ presence, narrative engagement and reflection. Inspired by an existing exhibition at the National Holocaust Centre and Museum in the U.K., a HoloLens narrative application, entitled The AR Journey, was developed by the authors using two different interaction methods, Natural User Interface (NUI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI), which were used to perform an empirical study. As revealed from the results of the between-subject design experiment, NUI exhibited statistically significant advantages in creating presence for users without 3D Role Playing Game (RPG) experience, and GUI was superior in creating presence and increasing narrative engagement for users with 3D RPG experience. As indicated by the results of the interviews, the overall narrative experience in HMD-based AR was acceptable, and the branching narrative design was engaging. However, HoloLens hardware issues, as well as virtuality and reality mismatch, adversely affected user experience. Design guidelines were proposed according to the qualitative results."
Revisiting SDG-7 under energy efficiency vision 2050: the role of new economic models and mass digitalization in OECD,"Policies on reducing energy demand should incorporate the newly formed economic models, digitalization, and consumer awareness trends. Therefore, this study analyzes the interaction of the three trends with SDG7 under energy efficiency vision 2050, measuring the energy efficiency of OECD from 2005 to 2017 to enable this inclusion. In this context, four new trends expected to shape future energy demand are identified through extensive consultation with experts from South Asian countries by developing future power demand for the year of 2050. Consequently, the results show a crucial impact of such trends on a future power demand that exceeds the economic potential of techno. Hence, the best-case scenario, “New Trends Efficient,” reduces final energy demand by 78% compared to the South Asian “Baseline” scenario in 2050, whereas the “Worst Case” scenario increases final energy demand by 35%. Therefore, Austria and Korea have the highest energy efficiency score of 0.76 and 0.75, whereas Canada and Chile have the lowest energy efficiency score of 0.41 and 0.42. This paper discusses the ability of digitalization and energy consumer awareness trends in shaping the future energy demand based on SDG 7, emphasizing the importance of energy efficiency vision 2050 in policymaking for effective acquisition."
"Pigment nomenclature in the ancient Near East, Greece, and Rome","This article surveys pigment terminology attested in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, and the Roman Empire. Various source material is available for exploring pigment nomenclature, including archaeological evidence as well as a range of ancient sources, such as lists of medical ingredients, and encyclopedic texts that sought to explore the available corpus of known pigments. While the etymology is not understood for all early pigments, one trend in the Near East was that pigment names could be borrowed from more prestigious natural materials, such as lapis lazuli or gold. In the Greek and Roman worlds, a greater variety of pigments were available especially due to the broader geographic expanse from which to mine or produce pigments. A few trends persist in Greco-Roman pigment nomenclature. Some pigments continue to be named after natural materials. Other pigments are named after factors such as their provenance, color, an innovator, or their process of manufacture."
"Diversity of Archaeocyaths and Sr Chemostratigraphy of the Lower Cambrian of West Transbaikalia, Uda–Vitim and Birami–Yanguda Zones","The morphology of archaeocyaths from the Oldynda Formation of the Uda–Vitim lithofacial zone and the Aikta Formation of the Birami–Yanguda Zone of West Transbaikalia are described. The age of these formations is refined for the first time on the basis of C and Sr isotope chemostratigraphy. Three Archaeocyatha horizons (Uldzuitui of the Atdabanian Stage and Sukhaya Rechka and Khuludyi of the Botomian Stage) are described in the Oldynda Formation instead of the four previously described horizons, and the Kachin Horizon of the Toionian Stage is described in the Aikta Formation. The morphogenesis of archaeocyaths is analyzed: from the forms with simple porosity (Uldzuitui period) to cups with scales, rings, and canals of walls (Sukhaya Rechka–Khuludyi period) to cups with an additional microporous sheath (Kachin period). All stages reflect the blossom and extinction of the archaeocyatha community of the Sayany–Baikal mountainous area. The 87Sr/86Sr ratio and δ13C values of limestones of three horizons of the Oldynda (0.70828–0.70847 and 0.2–2.7‰ PDB, respectively) and Aikta (0.70866–0.70877 and –2.4 to 0.5‰ PDB, respectively) formations coincide with the C and Sr isotopic variations of the Early Cambrian seawater of the Atdabanian, Botomian, and Toionian periods. The C and Sr chemostratigraphic data are consistent with paleontological findings and correspond to the ideas of the formation of the Uda–Vitim island arc system and relation to an epicontinental marine basin of the Siberian Platform in the Early Cambrian."
Some Causes of Inaccuracies of Short-Term Earthquake Prediction Taking into Account Laboratory Modeling,"A series of experiments are carried out with a stick–slip earthquake model consisting of two granite blocks under biaxial compression loading. The mechanical stresses, strains, and acoustic emission are recorded. The model is subjected to calibrated mechanical impacts. The stages of exponential acceleration of motions of the sides of the contact are recorded, but this feature is not universal. The energy of the impacts was lower by three orders of magnitude than the energy accumulated by the model, which indicates a triggering mechanism of slip initiation. A series of impacts resulting in small displacements partially reduced the accumulated energy. If a large displacement was initiated by an impact, its energy was even higher compared to displacements that were not caused by impacts. The experiments revealed the difficulties in solving the problem of reduction of earthquake hazard by elastic pulses."
Assessments of the Forest Carbon Balance in the National Climate Policies of Russia and Canada,"This paper examines the role of forests in national climate policies of two countries very rich in woods: Russia and Canada. Canada has made efforts to reduce direct CO2 emissions in the national economy, intensify forestry, and increase greenhouse gas sequestration by forests. Russia focuses on the verification and recalculation of the carbon sequestration capacity of its forests. Analysis of the Russian and Canadian stationary models used to assess the carbon sequestration capacity of forests (ROBUL and CBM-CFS, respectively) shows that both the Canadian model and the Russian one derived from it reflect the stationary dynamics of forest stands, which inevitably results in a downward CO2 absorption trend. Even if the forest inventory is updated on a regular basis, the predictive components of such models are unable to take into account the variability of forest ecosystems and their adaptation to climate change. Models that describe global carbon fluxes (e.g., ones using FLUXNET and remote sensing data) provide significantly higher net carbon sequestration values and indicate a nondecreasing net carbon accumulation trend in forests. It is concluded that stationary and remote sensing models should be used together to assess net carbon sequestration and formulate key principles of national climate policies in countries rich in forests."
The Nature of Heterogeneity of High-Chromium Garnets in Xenolite of Deformed Lherzolite from Udachnaya Kimberlite Pipe (Yakutia),"Significant variations in the composition of garnets, both within individual grains and in the rock, are found in the xenolith of deformed garnet lherzolite from the Udachnaya kimberlite pipe. The central parts of the grains, corresponding in composition to the garnets of the lherzolite paragenesis, demonstrate a sinusoidal distribution of rare earth elements (REEs). At the same time, the edge portions have a distribution characteristic of garnet mega-crystals from kimberlites. Despite being depleted in Y and HREE, the cores are enriched in light rare earth elements, Nb, Ta, Th, and U relative to garnet from primitive garnet peridotite. In terms of the REE distribution, the model melts, which are in equilibrium with the edge parts of garnet, are close to kimberlite but are significantly enriched in comparison with kimberlite in Nb, Ta, and Hf and depleted in Sr. Melts in equilibrium with the central parts of garnet are characterized by a steeper negative slope in the region of heavy and medium REEs and approach kimberlite in the region of light REEs. Based on the data obtained, several stages in the evolution of deformed garnet lherzolite are distinguished. The first stage involves the interaction of depleted peridotite with a melt similar in composition to carbonatite melts. This stage is associated with the formation of garnet with a sinusoidal REE distribution. At the next stage, which was preceded by the dissolution of garnet grains, garnet rims with increased Ti, Zr, and Y contents were formed and clinopyroxene appeared. At the final stage, garnet melted, caused by the inflow of a water–carbon dioxide fluid with a high potassium content, leading to polymineral inclusions and kelyphite rims."
Finding the Location of Generation Zones of “Voice of the Sea” Microseisms,"The generation zones of “voice of the sea” microseisms of three typhoons were determined from the field data using a two-coordinate laser strainmeter. From analyzing the results of processing the experimental data, it was found that the zones of generation of the “voice of the sea” microseisms are located in the areas of generation of primary microseisms located closer to the surf zone."
Gas-Geochemical Anomalies of Hydrocarbon Gases in the Bottom Sediments of the Lomonosov Ridge and Podvodnikov Basin of the Arctic Ocean,"This paper reports new data on the composition of hydrocarbon gases in bottom sediments of the Laptev–East Siberian marginal shelf transition zone, the continental slope of the Lomonosov Ridge, and Podvodnikov Basin of the Arctic Ocean. Anomalous concentrations of methane and hydrocarbon gases (up to C5 inclusive) have been established. Gas-geochemical indicators of eight genetic groups of hydrocarbon gases have been determined. The oil-and-gas content of the study area has been predicted based on the data obtained."
Stratigraphy of the Okhotsk–Chukotka Belt in the Headwaters of the Malyi Anyui River (the Vicinity of Kupol Deposit): U–Pb and 40Ar/39Ar Age Data,"U–Pb and 40Ar/39Ar age data obtained for volcanic rocks of the Okhotsk–Chukotka Belt in the headwaters of the Malyi Anyui River (the vicinity of Kupol deposit) indicate at least two main pulses of volcanic activity, 98–93 Ma and 90–84 Ma. The conventional stratigraphic models are not consistent with the new data on the age and composition of volcanic units. The spatial relations between volcanic complexes of different ages imply that volcanic units accumulated under conditions of dissected topography. In the absence of obvious petrographic distinctions between the volcanic sequences of different ages, the composition of detailed geological and paleovolcanological maps requires representative precise isotopic age data."
Production of an ultracold mixture of 23Na40K and 40K,"We report on the production of an ultracold mixture of 2.8 × 10423Na40K molecules and 3.3 × 10540K atoms at a temperature of about 250 nK. Compared with previous studies, the number of atoms and molecules improved by a factor of about 2, and the temperature reduced by a factor of about 2. These improvements occur mainly because of the use of a crossed large-volume horizontal dipole trap to load the atoms from a cloverleaf-type magnetic trap, and a large-volume three-beam dipole trap to perform optical evaporative cooling. Besides achieving the mode-matching loading, this method avoids evaporative cooling in a decompressed cloverleaf magnetic trap, which is sensitive to magnetic field fluctuations. We characterize an atom-molecule Feshbach resonance using the ultracold atom-molecule mixture. The enhancement of particle number and temperature significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio, and enables us to refine the location and width of the Feshbach resonance."
"The accessory neural arch: development, morphology, and systematic distribution","The accessory neural arch is an oddly distributed character present in several non-acanthomorph teleostean taxa. Its homology was often implied but never satisfyingly tested. In this study, we attended this pending problem. We analyzed the morphology, development, and systematic distribution of the accessory neural arch in teleosts. Using a comprehensive taxon sampling of cleared and stained specimens, we evaluated if the accessory neural arch fulfils existing homology criteria. We then combined these data with recent genetic phylogenies and ancestral character state estimation to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the accessory neural arch. While its gross morphology and development fit homology criteria, results from ancestral character state estimations suggest multiple independent evolutions within teleosts. Although the accessory neural arch cannot be homologous between several teleostean taxa, the concept of parallelism may explain the presence of such a similar character in a variety of non-acanthomorph teleostean taxa."
COVID-19-associated necrotizing encephalopathy presenting without active respiratory symptoms: a case report with histopathology,"Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a rare complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The condition is typically diagnosed based on characteristic neuroimaging findings in the context of active viral respiratory symptoms. We present a rare case of COVID-19-associated ANE presenting with expressive aphasia and encephalopathy in the absence of active respiratory symptoms. Initial evaluation revealed bilateral thalamic lesions and a mild neutrophilic-predominant pleocytosis on cerebrospinal fluid analysis, the latter of which has not been described in previously published cases. Presence of these atypical features prompted extensive diagnostic evaluation. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing on cerebrospinal fluid did not detect the presence of pathogenic nucleic acids. Thalamic biopsy revealed perivascular neutrophilic inflammation suggestive of small vessel vasculitis with surrounding hemorrhage and necrosis. Ultimately, the diagnosis was made following detection of SARS-CoV-2 serologies and after exclusion of alternative etiologies. The patient was successfully treated with a short course of high-dose methylprednisolone with favorable outcome."
Detection of human herpesviruses in cerebrospinal fluids collected from patients suspected of neuroinfectious diseases,"The full spectrum of human herpesviruses (HHV)-associated neuroinfectious diseases in immunocompetent adults remains unclear. Hence, we sought to elucidate the epidemiology and clinical features of these diseases. The study subjects were patients over 16 years old suspected of neuroinfectious diseases who underwent spinal tap performed by neurologists in our university hospital between April 2013 and March 2018. The presence of seven HHV DNAs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was determined by real-time PCR. HHV DNAs were detected in 33 (10.2%) of the 322 patients. The most frequently detected herpesvirus was varicella zoster virus (VZV) (19 patients), followed by HHV-6 (four patients), herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 (three patients), HSV-2 (three patients), and Epstein-Barr virus (two patients). HHV DNAs were detected in CSF collected from patients with various neuroinfectious diseases, including myelitis, peripheral neuritis, encephalitis, and meningitis. All patients with HSV-1 DNA had encephalitis, whereas all patients with HSV-2 DNA had meningitis. Eleven of the 19 patients with VZV DNA had meningitis. Patients with VZV-associated encephalitis (median age, 80 years) were significantly older than non-encephalitis patients (median age, 60.5 years) (P = 0.046). Although post-herpetic neuralgia was observed in seven (54%) of the 13 patients with VZV and without encephalitis, no such neurological sequela was observed in the four encephalitis patients. In conclusion, HHVs were associated with approximately 10% of neuroinfectious diseases in this cohort. VZV was the most common pathogen, probably due to the large number of VZV meningitis patients. In addition, patients with VZV-associated meningitis were significantly younger than patients with VZV-associated encephalitis."
Real-time detection network for tiny traffic sign using multi-scale attention module,"As one of the key technologies of intelligent vehicles, traffic sign detection is still a challenging task because of the tiny size of its target object. To address the challenge, we present a novel detection network improved from yolo-v3 for the tiny traffic sign with high precision in real-time. First, a visual multi-scale attention module (MSAM), a light-weight yet effective module, is devised to fuse the multi-scale feature maps with channel weights and spatial masks. It increases the representation power of the network by emphasizing useful features and suppressing unnecessary ones. Second, we exploit effectively fine-grained features about tiny objects from the shallower layers through modifying backbone Darknet-53 and adding one prediction head to yolo-v3. Finally, a receptive field block is added into the neck of the network to broaden the receptive field. Experiments prove the effectiveness of our network in both quantitative and qualitative aspects. The mAP@0.5 of our network reaches 0.965 and its detection speed is 55.56 FPS for 512 × 512 images on the challenging Tsinghua-Tencent 100k (TT100k) dataset."
Future Contingency and Classical Indeterminism,"A position that has been called ‘classical indeterminism’ has recently been developed in order to model vagueness: this approach appeals to an object-language ‘determinately’ operator, the semantics of which are defined in such a way as to preserve the principle of bivalence. I suggest that a prominent argument against this strategy, which I call the Field–Williamson argument, fails. The classical indeterminist position in its general form was anticipated by the Aristotelian commentators in their discussions of Aristotle’s famous ‘sea battle’ passage concerning future contingency. But I maintain that, ironically enough, the strategy is less happily applied in this case, where a version of the Field–Williamson argument succeeds."
New insights into the evolution of SPX gene family from algae to legumes; a focus on soybean,"SPX-containing proteins have been known as key players in phosphate signaling and homeostasis. In Arabidopsis and rice, functions of some SPXs have been characterized, but little is known about their function in other plants, especially in the legumes."
Robot End-Effector Mounted Camera Pose Optimization in Object Detection-Based Tasks,"Robots equipped with the vision systems at the end-effector provide a powerful combination in industrial contexts, allowing to execute a wide range of manufacturing tasks, such as inspection applications. While many works are dedicated to machine vision algorithms, the optimization of the vision system pose is not properly addressed. Optimizing the sensor pose, in fact, can increase the object detection performance, avoiding occlusions and collisions in the real working scene. Therefore, the development of an approach capable of optimizing the pose of a vision system is the main objective of this paper. A complete pipeline for such optimization is proposed, composed of the following main components: working scene reconstruction, robot-environment collisions modeling, object detection, sensor pose optimization (exploiting Bayesian Optimization, a state of the art methodology), and collision-free robot motion planning. To validate the proposed approach, experimental tests have been executed considering two object detection-based tasks. A Franka EMIKA Panda robot equipped with an Intel© RealSense D400 at its end-effector has been employed as a robotic platform. Achieved results show the high-fidelity reconstruction of the real working environment for an offline optimization (i.e., performed simulations), as well as the capabilities of the employed Bayesian Optimization-based approach to define the sensor pose. The proposed optimization methodology has been compared with the grid point approach, showing an improved performance for camera pose optimization purposes. An additional experiment has been performed in order to show the possibility to exploit a digital twin (if available) of the working scene instead of the environment reconstruction (to reduce the computational resources and to avoid measurements noise in the 3D reconstruction). Obtained results show the feasibility of the proposed pipeline employing such a digital twin."
Direct propylene epoxidation with oxygen using a photo-electro-heterogeneous catalytic system,"Propylene oxide is a crucial feedstock in the plastic industry. The direct epoxidation of propylene using O2 is considered among the most promising means of producing propylene oxide. Here we report an integrated photo-electro-heterogeneous catalytic system for propylene epoxidation with O2. Bismuth vanadate (or TiO2) photocatalyst and a Co-based electrocatalyst produces H2O2. A titanium silicalite-1 heterogeneous catalyst subsequently epoxidizes propylene to propylene oxide with the in situ-generated H2O2. The proposed system enables propylene oxide production with O2 as the sole oxidizing agent under light irradiation without using H2, a sacrificial agent, or external bias. It stably produces propylene oxide for 24 h with high selectivity (≥98%) under ambient conditions. These results demonstrate the potential of this catalytic system to produce chemical compounds in an environmentally benign manner."
Switchable wetting of oxygen-evolving oxide catalysts,"The surface wettability of catalysts is typically controlled via surface treatments that promote catalytic performance. Here we report on potential-regulated hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity at cobalt-based oxide interfaces with an alkaline solution. The switchable wetting of single particles, directly related to their activity and stability towards the oxygen evolution reaction, was revealed by electrochemical liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy. Analysis of the movement of the liquid in real time revealed distinctive wettability behaviour associated with specific potential ranges. At low potentials, an overall reduction of the hydrophobicity of the oxides was probed. Upon reversible reconstruction towards the surface oxyhydroxide phase, electrowetting was found to cause a change in the interfacial capacitance. At high potentials, the evolution of molecular oxygen, confirmed by operando electron energy-loss spectroscopy, was accompanied by a globally thinner liquid layer. This work directly links the physical wetting with the chemical oxygen evolution reaction of single particles, providing fundamental insights into solid–liquid interfacial interactions of oxygen-evolving oxides."
Silica-supported Fe/Fe–O nanoparticles for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles to amines in the presence of aluminium additives,"The hydrogenation of nitriles to amines represents an important and frequently used industrial process due to the broad applicability of the resulting products in chemistry and life sciences. Despite the existing portfolio of catalysts reported for the hydrogenation of nitriles, the development of iron-based heterogeneous catalysts for this process is still a challenge. Here, we show that the impregnation and pyrolysis of iron(II) acetate on commercial silica produces a reusable Fe/Fe–O@SiO2 catalyst with a well-defined structure comprising the fayalite phase at the Si–Fe interface and α-Fe nanoparticles, covered by an ultrathin amorphous iron(III) oxide layer, growing from the silica matrix. These Fe/Fe–O core–shell nanoparticles, in the presence of catalytic amounts of aluminium additives, promote the hydrogenation of all kinds of nitriles, including structurally challenging and functionally diverse aromatic, heterocyclic, aliphatic and fatty nitriles, to produce primary amines under scalable and industrially viable conditions."

Monitoring and Evaluation of the Lateral Stability of CWR Track,"Continuous welded rail (CWR) track has great advantages of low-cost maintenance, environmental influence, and ride comfort. However, the CWR track is subjected to the longitudinal stresses in rails due to temperature influence as well the inhomogeneous stress accumulation due to train loadings. The stresses cause the accelerated track lateral irregularity accumulation that without timely maintenance can cause track buckling. The present paper present a method of the CWR track lateral stability estimation during its lifecycle using the track geometry monitoring information from the track measurement cars. The methods proposes a systematic approach of track stability evaluation based on multiple criteria of track stability evaluation. It takes into account the lateral resistance of the track, actual temperatures, and the lateral geometry condition of the track. The presented case study of a half-year track geometry monitoring and the track stability evaluation in a track curve shows the practical possibility of the recent detection of the track sections with low lateral stability and buckling prevention."

Clinical recovery of Macaca fascicularis infected with Plasmodium knowlesi,"Kra monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), a natural host of Plasmodium knowlesi, control parasitaemia caused by this parasite species and escape death without treatment. Knowledge of the disease progression and resilience in kra monkeys will aid the effective use of this species to study mechanisms of resilience to malaria. This longitudinal study aimed to define clinical, physiological and pathological changes in kra monkeys infected with P. knowlesi, which could explain their resilient phenotype."
Evaluating effect of metallic ions on aggregation behavior of β-amyloid peptides by atomic force microscope and surface-enhanced Raman Scattering,"Excessive aggregation of β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) is regarded as the hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. Exploring the underlying mechanism regulating Aβ aggregation remains challenging and investigating aggregation events of Aβ in the presence and absence of metallic ions at molecular level would be meaningful in elucidating the role of metal cations on interactions between Aβ molecules. In this study, chemical self-assembled monolayer (SAM) method was employed to fabricate monolayer of β-amyloid peptides Aβ42 on gold substrate with a bolaamphiphile named 16-Mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHA). Firstly, the samples of gold substrate (blank control), the MHA-modified substrate, and the Aβ42-modified substrate were detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to track the self-assembly process. Aggregation behaviors of Aβ42 before and after metallic ions (Zn2+, Ca2+, Al3+) treatment were monitored by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the interaction between Aβ42 and metallic ions (Zn2+, Ca2+, Al3+) was investigated by surface-enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS)."
Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with secondary antibody deficiency: successful clearance following combination casirivimab and imdevimab (REGN-COV2) monoclonal antibody therapy,"There is growing evidence that antibody responses play a role in the resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with primary or secondary antibody deficiency are at increased risk of persistent infection. This challenging clinical scenario is associated with adverse patient outcome and potentially creates an ecological niche for the evolution of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with immune evasion capacity. Case reports and/or series have implied a therapeutic role for convalescent plasma (CP) to secure virological clearance, although concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of CP and its potential to drive viral evolution, and it has largely been withdrawn from clinical use in the UK."
Anterior intrapelvic approach and suprapectineal quadrilateral surface plate for acetabular fractures with anterior involvement: a retrospective study of 34 patients,The purpose of the study is to evaluate the use of the suprapectineal quadrilateral surface (QLS) plates associated with the anterior intrapelvic approach (AIP) to the acetabulum in the surgical treatment of acetabular fractures with anterior involvement.
Machine learning approaches for the prediction of postoperative complication risk in liver resection patients,"For liver cancer patients, the occurrence of postoperative complications increases the difficulty of perioperative nursing, prolongs the hospitalization time of patients, and leads to large increases in hospitalization costs. The ability to identify influencing factors and to predict the risk of complications in patients with liver cancer after surgery could assist doctors to make better clinical decisions."
Biosynthesis and metabolic engineering of 1-hydroxyphenazine in Pseudomonas chlororaphis H18,"1-Hydroxyphenazine (1-OH-PHZ) is a phenazine microbial metabolite with broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against a lot of plant pathogens. However, its use is hampered by the low yield all along. Metabolic engineering of microorganisms is an increasingly powerful method for the production of valuable organisms at high levels. Pseudomonas chlororaphis is recognized as a safe and effective plant rhizosphere growth-promoting bacterium, and faster growth rate using glycerol or glucose as a renewable carbon source. Therefore, Pseudomonas chlororaphis is particularly suitable as the chassis cell for the modification and engineering of phenazines."
Vector-Valued Spaces of Multiplier Statistically Convergent Series and Uniform Convergence,"In this paper, we introduce the spaces of vector-valued sequences containing multiplier (weakly) statistically convergent series. The completeness of such spaces is studied as well as some relations between unconditionally convergent and weakly unconditionally Cauchy series of these spaces. We also obtain generalizations of some results regarding uniform convergence of unconditionally convergent series through the concept of statistical convergence. Finally, we provide a version of the Orlicz–Pettis theorem for \(\lambda \)-multiplier convergent operator series by means of the statistical convergence."
Some q-Supercongruences from a Quadratic Transformation by Rahman,"Inspired by the recent work on q-congruences and a quadratic transformation formula of Rahman, we provide some new q-supercongruences. By taking parameters specialization in one of our results, we obtain a new Ramanujan-type supercongruence, which has the same right-hand side as Van Hamme’s (G.2) supercongruence for \(p\equiv 1 \pmod 4\). We also formulate some related challenging conjectures on supercongruences and q-supercongruences."
Bernstein–Markov Property for Compact Sets in \(\mathbb {C}^d\),"Given a compact set K in \(\mathbb {C}^d.\) We concern with the Bernstein–Markov property of the pair \((K,\mu )\) where \(\mu \) is a finite positive Borel measure with compact support K. In particular, we are able to give a class of \((K,\mu )\) having the Bernstein–Markov property with the measure \(\mu \) satisfies a rather weak density condition. Using this result, we construct a pair \((K,\mu )\) satisfying the Bernstein–Markov property which is not covered by the known results in Bloom (Indiana Univ Math J 46:427–452, 1997) and Bloom and Levenberg (Trans Am Math Soc 351:4573–4567, 1999). Another main result of the note is a weak characterization of Bernstein–Markov property in terms of Chebyshev constants."
Some Characterizations of BMO Spaces via Commutators in Orlicz Spaces on Stratified Lie Groups,"In the paper we study the fractional maximal commutators \(M_{b,\alpha }\) and the commutators of the fractional maximal operator \([b, M_{\alpha }]\) in the Orlicz spaces \(L^{\Phi }(\mathbb {G})\) on any stratified Lie group \(\mathbb {G}\). We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the boundedness of the operators \(M_{b,\alpha }\) and \([b, M_{\alpha }]\) on Orlicz spaces \(L^{\Phi }(\mathbb {G})\) when b belongs to \(BMO(\mathbb {G})\) spaces, whereby some new characterizations for certain subclasses of \(BMO(\mathbb {G})\) spaces are obtained."
On Singularities of Certain Non-linear Second-Order Ordinary Differential Equations,"The method of blowing up points of indeterminacy of certain systems of two ordinary differential equations is applied to obtain information about the singularity structure of the solutions of the corresponding non-linear differential equations. We first deal with the so-called Painlevé example, which passes the Painlevé test, but the solutions have more complicated singularities. Resolving base points in the equivalent system of equations we can explain the complicated structure of singularities of the original equation. The Smith example has a solution with non-isolated singularity, which is an accumulation point of algebraic singularities. Smith’s equation can be written as a system in two ways. We show that the sequence of blow-ups for both systems can be infinite. Another example that we consider is the Painlevé-Ince equation. When the usual Painlevé analysis is applied, it possesses both positive and negative resonances. We show that for three equivalent systems there is an infinite sequence of blow-ups and another one that terminates, which further gives a Laurent expansion of the solution around a movable pole. Moreover, for one system it is even possible to obtain the general solution after a sequence of blow-ups."
"Reflectionless Canonical Systems, I: Arov Gauge and Right Limits","In spectral theory, j-monotonic families of \(2\times 2\) matrix functions appear as transfer matrices of many one-dimensional operators. We present a general theory of such families, in the perspective of canonical systems in Arov gauge. This system resembles a continuum version of the Schur algorithm, and allows to restore an arbitrary Schur function along the flow of associated boundary values at infinity. In addition to results in Arov gauge, this provides a gauge-independent perspective on the Krein–de Branges formula and the reflectionless property of right limits on the absolutely continuous spectrum. This work has applications to inverse spectral problems which have better behavior with respect to a normalization at an internal point of the resolvent domain."
Computing fusion rules for spherical G-extensions of fusion categories,"A G-extension of a fusion category \({\mathcal {C}}\) yields a categorical action of G on the center \(Z({{\mathcal {C}}})\). If the extension admits a spherical structure, we provide a method for recovering its fusion rules in terms of the action. We then apply this to find closed formulas for the fusion rules of extensions of some group theoretical categories and of cyclic permutation crossed extensions of modular categories."
The Extent of Universal Health Coverage for Maternal Health Services in Eastern Uganda: A Cross Sectional Study,"Monitoring essential health services coverage is important to inform resource allocation for the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goal 3.

Behavior of structural lightweight concrete produced with expanded clay aggregate and after exposure to high temperatures,"The residual compressive strength of eight lightweight concrete mixtures containing three commercial grading (Liapor HD 5 N, Liapor HD 7 N, and Liapor 8F) of coarse lightweight aggregate (LWA) were determined after to expose at high temperatures. Eight mixes were produced, two by normal weight aggregate and the rest by different types of LWA. The produced concrete was analyzed after high temperature exposure and the effect of using LWA, the type of LWA, and compaction method was studied. To do so, visual inspection, residual compressive strength, crack pattern, spalling, and thermoanalytical analysis were conducted. Generally, it could be concluded that concrete formulations with LWA behave more advantageous up to 500 °C, compared to those with quartz gravel aggregates. Moreover, this study found that an ideal type of LWA to produce structural concrete was Liapor HD 5 N, which was used for producing the mixes L1 and L3."
Queueing Problems in Emergency Departments: A Review of Practical Approaches and Research Methodologies,"Problems related to patient scheduling and queueing in emergency departments are gaining increasing attention in theory, in the fields of operations research and emergency and healthcare services, and in practice. This paper aims to provide an extensive review of studies addressing queueing-related problems explicitly related to emergency departments. We have reviewed 229 articles and books spanning seven decades and have sought to organize the information they contain in a manner that is accessible and useful to researchers seeking to gain knowledge on specific aspects of such problems. We begin by presenting a historical overview of applications of queueing theory to healthcare-related problems. We subsequently elaborate on managerial approaches used to enhance efficiency in emergency departments. These approaches include bed management, fast-track, dynamic resource allocation, grouping/prioritization of patients, and triage approaches. Finally, we discuss scientific methodologies used to analyze and optimize these approaches: algorithms, priority models, queueing models, simulation, and statistical approaches."
The dependence of truth on being in Asay’s A Theory of Truthmaking,"In this commentary piece, I argue that Asay’s accounts of truth and truthmaking in A Theory of Truthmaking give no role to the idea that truth depends on being. In fact, some of the positions taken in the book are in tension with this idea that has been central to truthmaker theory. I consider how three aspects of Asay’s account relate to the idea that truth depends on being."
Non-intrusive nonlinear model reduction via machine learning approximations to low-dimensional operators,"Although projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) for parameterized nonlinear dynamical systems have demonstrated exciting results across a range of applications, their broad adoption has been limited by their intrusivity: implementing such a reduced-order model typically requires significant modifications to the underlying simulation code. To address this, we propose a method that enables traditionally intrusive reduced-order models to be accurately approximated in a non-intrusive manner. Specifically, the approach approximates the low-dimensional operators associated with projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) using modern machine-learning regression techniques. The only requirement of the simulation code is the ability to export the velocity given the state and parameters; this functionality is used to train the approximated low-dimensional operators. In addition to enabling nonintrusivity, we demonstrate that the approach also leads to very low computational complexity, achieving up to \(10^3{\times }\) in run time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique on two types of PDEs. The domain of applications include both parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs, regardless of the dimension of full-order models (FOMs)."
"Earthen architecture in the Iberian Peninsula: a portrait of vulnerability, sustainability and conservation","For more than a decade, a wide range of Spanish case studies, relating especially to rural inner or abandoned sites and areas, have been analysed by the authors as part of different research projects linked with traditional and monumental architecture, conservation strategies and earthen buildings. On one hand the studies have been undertaken in the framework of a project concerning the conservation of rammed earth in the Iberian Peninsula, including criteria, techniques, results and perspectives and, on the other, by a project about the conservation and rehabilitation of traditional earthen architecture in the Iberian Peninsula, providing guidelines and tools for its sustainable intervention. In all cases the researchers’ efforts focused on enhancing new perspectives and opportunities for rural earthen buildings, analysing landscapes, contexts, constructive features, decay and problems. The final common aim of this research is to stress these crucial topics to improve tangible or intangible opportunities for conservation strategies."
A training plan to implement lung ultrasound for diagnosing pneumonia in children,"Lung ultrasound (LUS) for critical patients requires trained operators to perform them, though little information exists on the level of training required for independent practice. The aims were to implement a training plan for diagnosing pneumonia using LUS and to analyze the inter-observer agreement between senior radiologists (SRs) and pediatric intensive care physicians (PICPs)."
Superquantiles at Work: Machine Learning Applications and Efficient Subgradient Computation,"R. Tyrell Rockafellar and his collaborators introduced, in a series of works, new regression modeling methods based on the notion of superquantile (or conditional value-at-risk). These methods have been influential in economics, finance, management science, and operations research in general. Recently, they have been subject of a renewed interest in machine learning, to address issues of distributional robustness and fair allocation. In this paper, we review some of these new applications of the superquantile, with references to recent developments. These applications involve nonsmooth superquantile-based objective functions that admit explicit subgradient calculations. To make these superquantile-based functions amenable to the gradient-based algorithms popular in machine learning, we show how to smooth them by infimal convolution and detail numerical procedures to compute the gradients of the smooth approximations. We put the approach into perspective by comparing it to other smoothing techniques and by illustrating it on toy examples."
Growth and properties of nanocrystalline TiN—amorphous Si3N4 composite thin films deposited on IN718 and phynox alloy substrates,"TiN/Si3N4 composite thin films were deposited on Inconel718 (IN718) and flexible Phynox alloy substrates by the co-sputtering process at room temperature and 250 °C. The TiN films were sputtered from a Ti target, while the Si3N4 films were sputtered from either a Si or a Si3N4 target. The aim is to prepare composite thin films of nanocrystalline TiN and amorphous Si3N4 under the same conditions of pressure and temperature. This objective was achieved at room temperature and 250 °C substrate temperature on both the substrates mentioned above, as confirmed from x-ray and selected area electron diffraction patterns when the targets used were Ti and Si3N4. Significantly, crystallization of Si3N4 phase was observed under favorable conditions when Si was the target. All the films exhibit columnar microstructure comprising layers of TiN and Si3N4. Films deposited from the Si target crystallize at a lower thickness than those deposited from the Si3N4 target. There is a substrate type, substrate temperature, and deposition time dependence of grain size. The films on Phynox substrates have smaller grain sizes (50–60 nm) in comparison with films on IN718 substrates (100–120 nm). The films deposited on the IN718 substrates display higher surface roughness than the films deposited on the Phynox substrates which, in turn, depended on the target from which the Si3N4 films were deposited. The hardness of composite films in which the Si3N4 is deposited from the Si target is higher than that for the films deposited from the Si3N4 target. The present work, thus, describes a technique for the single layer nanocomposite thin films deposition with properties that can be tuned by the type of target used."
Global asymptotic stability of the active disassembly model of flagellar length control,"Organelle size control is a fundamental question in biology that demonstrates the fascinating ability of cells to maintain homeostasis within their highly variable environments. Theoretical models describing cellular dynamics have the potential to help elucidate the principles underlying size control. Here, we perform a detailed study of the active disassembly model proposed in Fai et al. (elife 8:e42599, 2019). We construct a hybrid system which is shown to be well-behaved throughout the domain. We rule out the possibility of oscillations arising in the model and prove global asymptotic stability in the case of two flagella by the construction of a suitable Lyapunov function. Finally, we generalize the model to the case of arbitrary flagellar number in order to study olfactory sensory neurons, which have up to twenty cilia per cell. We show that our theoretical results may be extended to this case and explore the implications of this universal mechanism of size control."
Porous Media Cleaning by Pulsating Filtration Flow,"A problem of porous media cleaning by a pulsating external flow is studied numerically. We consider a closed domain of porous media, which was initially clogged by an impurity. The purification of such a domain is performed by an external vertical pulsating flow of a pure fluid. The transport of the impurity with immobilization process is modeled into framework of the nonlinear MIM model with saturation of the immobile phase. The clogging of media is taken into account which, in turn, leads to a decrease of the pore volume due to the immobilized impurity on the pores. The one dimensional solution as in the form of vertical seepage was obtained. It is shown that the most effective cleaning is achieved for the maximal possible value of the external flow intensity and can be controlled by the variation of the pulsation frequency and amplitude. However at the high intensities of the external flow the one dimensional solution becomes unstable. The stability problem was solved within the quasistatic approach. The critical curves in the system parameters are obtained and discussed."
Effect of shadowing and background radiation on optical OQAM-FBMC based visible light communication system,"Filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) technique is a capable contender of 5G communication system. Recently it has been introduced to the optical wireless communication. FBMC has several advantages over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing such as low out-of-band distortion, asynchronous transmission and increased spectral efficiency. In this presented work, firstly the effect of shadowing and background radiation is analyzed on FBMC based visible light communication system. The minimization of bit error rate (BER) is done using metaheuristic optimization algorithm to obtain optimum performance of optical FBMC technique. Then estimation technique for shadowing and background radiation noise is proposed. The proposed estimation technique shows 20 percent improvement in the spectral efficiency of FBMC and BER is also improved by 2.5 dB than without estimation. However, computational complexity and PAPR is slightly increased due to extra processing at receiver which can be further reduced by algorithms."
Enhancing echelon-ferrers construction for constant dimension code,"Echelon-Ferrers construction is one of the most powerful methods to improve the lower bounds for constant dimension codes. Although the method was proposed more than 10 years ago, it is still the best construction in a number of cases. In this paper, we remove parts of lifted FDRM codes from the echelon-Ferrers construction, and insert an SC-representation set, which finally improves the Echelon-ferrers construction, to get lower bounds for the following cases: \(A_q(11,4,4),\ A_q(15,4,4)\) and \(A_q(19,4,4)\)."
A new accelerated proximal boosting machine with convergence rate \(O(1/t^2)\),"Boosting algorithms, a well-studied and effective machine learning technology, iteratively combines the output of weak learners to produce a powerful predictive model with performances improved over the single weak learner. Accelerated proximal boosting machine (APBM) is a boosting algorithm built upon the proximal point algorithm and employed Nesterov’s accelerated descent. However, in the acceleration process, the momentum term will accumulate errors, which may cause the algorithm to diverge. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named CAPBM, which incorporates corrected pseudo residual into the design of APBM in boosting process. By applying the corrected pseudo residual to update the momentum sequence, CAPBM can reduce the error generated when fitting the residual, and further ensure the algorithm convergence. Finally, we theoretically prove that CAPBM is convergent with a rate of \(O(1/t^2)\). Numerical experiments on real datasets are carried out to illustrate that the proposed CAPBM algorithm is effective and competitive."
Experimental study on inertial focusing pattern in asymmetric contraction–expansion array microchannel,"The transition of particle equilibrium pattern was investigated in contraction–expansion array (CEA) microchannel. The experimental results showed that, in addition to ordinary trajectory 1 (a focusing band near the center of the channel), another novel trajectory 2 could appear on the side near cavity sidewall. The effects of cavity dimension, Reynolds number, and particle diameter on the inertial focusing pattern of the particles were explored in detail. The equilibrium position of trajectory 1 will shift from the geometric center of the channel to the wall with cavity due to the influence of secondary flow generated by CEA units. The particles of 20 μm and 15 μm showed ideal focusing, while the particles of 10 μm focused in a wild band. It showed that the asymmetric CEA units can be used to regulate the focusing position of particles. Because of the squeezing action of two vortexes at the entrance of the contraction section, the trajectory 2 can be stable once it appears. In addition, the location of trajectory 2 is less affected by particle diameters and Re. In the same structure, trajectory 2 is more likely to appear with small particle diameter and large Re. Finally, we summarized the critical Re of focusing pattern transition. When it is greater than this critical value, trajectory 1 and trajectory 2 will exist in the channels simultaneously. It could be used to guide the design of the CEA channels. This basic research could provide a guidance to the application of microfluidic particle manipulation technique."
"The effect of passive mobilization associated with blood flow restriction and combined with electrical stimulation on cardiorespiratory safety, neuromuscular adaptations, physical function, and quality of life in comatose patients in an ICU: a randomized controlled clinical trial","Intensive care unit-acquired atrophy and weakness are associated with high mortality, a reduction in physical function, and quality of life. Passive mobilization (PM) and neuromuscular electrical stimulation were applied in comatose patients; however, evidence is inconclusive regarding atrophy and weakness prevention. Blood flow restriction (BFR) associated with PM (BFRp) or with electrical stimulation (BFRpE) was able to reduce atrophy and increase muscle mass in spinal cord-injured patients, respectively. Bulky venous return occurs after releasing BFR, which can cause unknown repercussions on the cardiovascular system. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of BFRp and BFRpE on cardiovascular safety and applicability, neuromuscular adaptations, physical function, and quality of life in comatose patients in intensive care units (ICUs)."
Queueing Problems in Emergency Departments: A Review of Practical Approaches and Research Methodologies,"Problems related to patient scheduling and queueing in emergency departments are gaining increasing attention in theory, in the fields of operations research and emergency and healthcare services, and in practice. This paper aims to provide an extensive review of studies addressing queueing-related problems explicitly related to emergency departments. We have reviewed 229 articles and books spanning seven decades and have sought to organize the information they contain in a manner that is accessible and useful to researchers seeking to gain knowledge on specific aspects of such problems. We begin by presenting a historical overview of applications of queueing theory to healthcare-related problems. We subsequently elaborate on managerial approaches used to enhance efficiency in emergency departments. These approaches include bed management, fast-track, dynamic resource allocation, grouping/prioritization of patients, and triage approaches. Finally, we discuss scientific methodologies used to analyze and optimize these approaches: algorithms, priority models, queueing models, simulation, and statistical approaches."
The dependence of truth on being in Asay’s A Theory of Truthmaking,"In this commentary piece, I argue that Asay’s accounts of truth and truthmaking in A Theory of Truthmaking give no role to the idea that truth depends on being. In fact, some of the positions taken in the book are in tension with this idea that has been central to truthmaker theory. I consider how three aspects of Asay’s account relate to the idea that truth depends on being."
Non-intrusive nonlinear model reduction via machine learning approximations to low-dimensional operators,"Although projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) for parameterized nonlinear dynamical systems have demonstrated exciting results across a range of applications, their broad adoption has been limited by their intrusivity: implementing such a reduced-order model typically requires significant modifications to the underlying simulation code. To address this, we propose a method that enables traditionally intrusive reduced-order models to be accurately approximated in a non-intrusive manner. Specifically, the approach approximates the low-dimensional operators associated with projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) using modern machine-learning regression techniques. The only requirement of the simulation code is the ability to export the velocity given the state and parameters; this functionality is used to train the approximated low-dimensional operators. In addition to enabling nonintrusivity, we demonstrate that the approach also leads to very low computational complexity, achieving up to \(10^3{\times }\) in run time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique on two types of PDEs. The domain of applications include both parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs, regardless of the dimension of full-order models (FOMs)."
"Earthen architecture in the Iberian Peninsula: a portrait of vulnerability, sustainability and conservation","For more than a decade, a wide range of Spanish case studies, relating especially to rural inner or abandoned sites and areas, have been analysed by the authors as part of different research projects linked with traditional and monumental architecture, conservation strategies and earthen buildings. On one hand the studies have been undertaken in the framework of a project concerning the conservation of rammed earth in the Iberian Peninsula, including criteria, techniques, results and perspectives and, on the other, by a project about the conservation and rehabilitation of traditional earthen architecture in the Iberian Peninsula, providing guidelines and tools for its sustainable intervention. In all cases the researchers’ efforts focused on enhancing new perspectives and opportunities for rural earthen buildings, analysing landscapes, contexts, constructive features, decay and problems. The final common aim of this research is to stress these crucial topics to improve tangible or intangible opportunities for conservation strategies."
Dissecting the dominant hot spring microbial populations based on community-wide sampling at single-cell genomic resolution,"With advances in DNA sequencing and miniaturized molecular biology workflows, rapid and affordable sequencing of single-cell genomes has become a reality. Compared to 16S rRNA gene surveys and shotgun metagenomics, large-scale application of single-cell genomics to whole microbial communities provides an integrated snapshot of community composition and function, directly links mobile elements to their hosts, and enables analysis of population heterogeneity of the dominant community members. To that end, we sequenced nearly 500 single-cell genomes from a low diversity hot spring sediment sample from Dewar Creek, British Columbia, and compared this approach to 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun metagenomics applied to the same sample. We found that the broad taxonomic profiles were similar across the three sequencing approaches, though several lineages were missing from the 16S rRNA gene amplicon dataset, likely the result of primer mismatches. At the functional level, we detected a large array of mobile genetic elements present in the single-cell genomes but absent from the corresponding same species metagenome-assembled genomes. Moreover, we performed a single-cell population genomic analysis of the three most abundant community members, revealing differences in population structure based on mutation and recombination profiles. While the average pairwise nucleotide identities were similar across the dominant species-level lineages, we observed differences in the extent of recombination between these dominant populations. Most intriguingly, the creek’s Hydrogenobacter sp. population appeared to be so recombinogenic that it more closely resembled a sexual species than a clonally evolving microbe. Together, this work demonstrates that a randomized single-cell approach can be useful for the exploration of previously uncultivated microbes from community composition to population structure."

Green and sustainable preparation of flower-like ZnO nanostructures via soft bio-template approach for the enhancement of biomedical applications,"Investigation on the biomedical applications of flower-like Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanostructures (NSs) synthesized by using aqueous extract of Oryza punctata (red rice) is reported for the first time. For the sustainable preparation of ZnO NSs, the precursors zinc nitrate and the rice extract act as the bio-template material. The optical energy bandgap value for the ZnO NSs was found to be 3.29 eV. The flower-like morphology of the ZnO NSs was confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy analysis. The ZnO NSs showed the potential cytotoxicity activity against MCF-7 cell line and antibacterial properties. Significant antioxidant activity was studied by the bio-prepared ZnO NSs against scavenging of DPPH (di(phenyl)-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) iminoazanium) free radicals. The flower-like ZnO NSs showed a significant anti-arthritic activity with a maximum inhibition of protein denaturation (78.94 ± 1.62%) and membrane protective activity (81.12 ± 1.25%) at a dose of 0.5 mg/mL concentration."
Phase I-metabolism studies of the synthetic cannabinoids PX-1 and PX-2 using three different in vitro models,"Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs), highly metabolized substances, are rarely found unmodified in urine samples. Urine screening relies on SC metabolite detection, requiring metabolism knowledge. Metabolism data can be acquired via in vitro assays, e.g., human hepatocytes, pooled human liver microsomes (pHLM), cytochrome P450 isoforms and a fungal model; or in vivo by screening, e.g., authentic human samples or rat urine. This work describes the comprehensive study of PX-1 and PX-2 in vitro metabolism using three in vitro models. 5F-APP-PICA (PX-1) and 5F-APP-PINACA (PX-2) were studied as they share structural similarity with AM-2201, THJ-2201 and 5F-AB-PINACA, the metabolism of which was described in the literature."

Index appearance record with preorders,"Transforming \(\omega \)-automata into parity automata is traditionally done using appearance records. We present an efficient variant of this idea, tailored to Rabin automata, and several optimizations applicable to all appearance records.

Waiting time for surgery influences the outcome in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus — a population-based study,"Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a disease that comes with a great impact on the patient’s life. The only treatment for iNPH, which is a progressive disease, is shunt surgery. It is previously indicated that early intervention might be of importance for the outcome."
Reducing complication rates for repeat craniotomies in glioma patients: a single-surgeon experience and comparison with the literature,"There is a concern that glioma patients undergoing repeat craniotomies are more prone to complications. The study’s goal was to assess if the complication profiles for initial and repeat craniotomies were similar, to determine predictors of complications, and to compare results with those in the literature."
Attachment and mentalization as predictors of outcome in family therapy for adolescent anorexia nervosa,"Anorexia nervosa-focussed family therapy (FT-AN) is the first-line treatment for adolescent anorexia nervosa (AN), but the predictors of poor treatment response are not well understood. The main aim of this study was to investigate the role of attachment and mentalization in predicting treatment outcome. The secondary aims of the study were to investigate therapeutic alliance at 1 month as a predictor of outcome, and to test the associations between alliance and baseline attachment and mentalization. 192 adolescents with AN and their parents were recruited as they began family therapy in out-patient specialist eating disorder services. Self-report measures of attachment, mentalization, and emotion regulation were completed at the start of treatment by adolescent patients and one of their parents. Self-reported alliance scores were collected at one month. Higher scores on the Certainty Scale of the Reflective Functioning Questionnaire, completed by parents, which indicate over-certainty about mental states, were the strongest predictor of poor outcome (Odds Ratio: 0.42, CI: 0.20–0.87). Similarly, for adolescents, higher Lack of Clarity scores on the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, representing being unclear about one’s feelings, were predictive of positive treatment outcome (OR: 1.10, CI: 1.00–1.21). Higher alliance scores at 1 month predicted positive outcome, and were associated with attachment security and mentalization. These novel findings suggest that, particularly in parents, a tendency towards excessive certainty about mental states in others may predict poor outcome in FT-AN. Further research is warranted to replicate the finding and characterise families at risk of poor outcome."
The Deep Velocity Structure of the Central Kola Peninsula Obtained using the Receiver Function Technique,"New results are presented on the features of the deep velocity structure of two of the three main tectonic blocks that make up the Kola region—Murmansk and Belomorskii—by the P receiver function technique. The research is based on data from the broadband seismic stations Teriberka and Kovda. The results are compared with the models obtained by mutual inversion of PRF and SRF using the data from the stations Apatity and Lovozero. It is shown that the crust has a two-layer structure with the border at a depth of 11 km under the Murmansk block and at a depth of 15 km under the Kola and Belomorskii blocks. The crust thickness of the Murmansk, Belomorskii, and Kola blocks are 35, 33, and 40 km, respectively. The presence of the MLD was revealed in all tectonic structures analyzed for the first time, with a top at a depth of about 70 km for the Murmansk and Belomorskii blocks and 90 km for the Kola block and a bottom at 130–140 km for all structures."
Decoupled evolution of mating biology and social structure in Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants,"Insect societies vary greatly in their social structure, mating biology, and life history. Polygyny, the presence of multiple reproductive queens in a single colony, and polyandry, multiple mating by females, both increase the genetic variability in colonies of eusocial organisms, resulting in potential reproductive conflicts. The co-occurrence of polygyny and polyandry in a single species is rarely observed across eusocial insects, and these traits have been found to be negatively correlated in ants. Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants are well-suited for investigating the evolution of complex mating strategies because both polygyny and polyandry co-occur in this genus. We used microsatellite markers and parentage inference in five South American Acromyrmex species to study how different selective pressures influence the evolution of polygyny and polyandry. We show that Acromyrmex species exhibit independent variation in mating biology and social structure, and polygyny and polyandry are not necessarily negatively correlated within genera. One species, Acromyrmex lobicornis, displays a significantly lower mating frequency compared to others, while another species, A. lundii, appears to have reverted to obligate monogyny. These variations appear to have a small impact on average intra-colonial relatedness, although the biological significance of such a small effect size is unclear. All species show significant reproductive skew between patrilines, but there was no significant difference in reproductive skew between any of the sampled species. We find that the evolution of social structure and mating biology appear to follow independent evolutionary trajectories in different species. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary implications that mating biology and social structure have on life history evolution in Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants."
Electronic properties and reactivity of oxidized graphene nanoribbons and their interaction with phenol,"The effect of the oxidized functional groups on the structural, electronic, and reactivity properties of armchair graphene nanoribbons has been investigated in the framework of the density functional theory. The presence of functional groups near the edges stabilizes the oxidized graphene nanoribbons (OGNRs) more than substituting near the center. Overall, we found slight differences in the electronic properties of OGNRs concerning the pristine ones. The oxygen contribution of functional groups to the DOS is found in the conducting energy bands far from the Fermi level. Consequently, the semiconducting behavior is maintained after doping. Based on the reactivity of OGNRs, the most promising nanostructures were proposed as adsorbents studying the interaction and complexation with phenol, a critical pollutant removed mainly by hydrotreating processes (HDO) to produce bio-oil. Parallel and perpendicular phenol conformations were found towards the OGNRs in the optimized complexes driven by a physisorption process. These results provide significant insights for catalytic processes that use biomass derivatives containing phenolic compounds. The physisorption of streams containing pollutants on OGNRs could be adapted to new technological applications for the remotion of aromatic compounds under environmentally friendly operational conditions."
Earning opportunities and informal payment as influencing factors in medical students’ speciality choice,"The Hungarian primary care system faces a severe shortage of family physicians. Medical students’ perceptions of family medicine need to be known and medical students need to be given appropriate and comprehensible information about this speciality. The expected future salary is an important factor in career choice. Most of the family doctors are self-employed and the practices have a corrected capitation-type financing. Although the majority of health care services are covered by social health insurance and are provided for the insured patients free of charge, informal payment is an existing phenomenon with different motivations and consequences. This study aimed to investigate medical students’ knowledge about their future earning opportunities and their attitudes towards informal payment."
Physiotherapists’ experiences of osteoarthritis guidelines in primary health care – an interview study,"Osteoarthritis is a common joint disease, globally.

To increase compliance to guidelines, implementation was conducted. The aim of the study was to explore physiotherapists’ experiences of osteoarthritis guidelines and their experiences of implementation of the guidelines in primary health care in a region in southern Sweden."
Associations of sickness absence and disability pension due to mental and somatic diagnoses when aged 60–64 with paid work after the standard retirement age; a prospective population-based cohort study in Sweden,"The proportion of people working beyond age 65 is increasing.

Determinants of overall knowledge and health behaviours in relation to hepatitis B and C among ever-married women in Pakistan: evidence based on Demographic and Health Survey 2017–18,"In 2019, around 5 million and 10 million people were affected by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) respectively in Pakistan. On World Hepatitis Day 2019, Pakistan’s Government announced the Prime Minister’s Plan to eliminate HBV and HCV from the country by 2030. In order to achieve this goal, adequate knowledge about HBV and HCV regarding mode of transmission, symptoms of the disease, and awareness about available treatments and vaccines is imperative. The present study aims to investigate the determinants related to overall knowledge about and behaviour in relation to HBV and HCV amongst married women in Pakistan."
Functional status in relation to depression among elderly individuals in Indonesia: a cross-sectional analysis of the Indonesian National Health Survey 2018 among elderly individuals,"Depression among elderly individuals is related to physical illness, functional status, prolonged treatment and other factors. Depression is not effectively treated with medication but can be alleviated by treating the physical illness and improving functional status. Therefore, this study aims to determine the relationship between functional status and depression in elderly individuals in Indonesia."
Narrative responsibility and artificial intelligence,"Most accounts of responsibility focus on one type of responsibility, moral responsibility, or address one particular aspect of moral responsibility such as agency. This article outlines a broader framework to think about responsibility that includes causal responsibility, relational responsibility, and what I call “narrative responsibility” as a form of “hermeneutic responsibility”, connects these notions of responsibility with different kinds of knowledge, disciplines, and perspectives on human being, and shows how this framework is helpful for mapping and analysing how artificial intelligence (AI) challenges human responsibility and sense-making in various ways. Mobilizing recent hermeneutic approaches to technology, the article argues that next to, and interwoven with, other types of responsibility such as moral responsibility, we also have narrative and hermeneutic responsibility—in general and for technology. For example, it is our task as humans to make sense of, with and, if necessary, against AI. While from a posthumanist point of view, technologies also contribute to sense-making, humans are the experiencers and bearers of responsibility and always remain in charge when it comes to this hermeneutic responsibility. Facing and working with a world of data, correlations, and probabilities, we are nevertheless condemned to make sense. Moreover, this also has a normative, sometimes even political aspect: acknowledging and embracing our hermeneutic responsibility is important if we want to avoid that our stories are written elsewhere—through technology."
Development of carbonaceous tin-based solder composite achieving unprecedented joint performance,"Weight reduction and improved strength are two common engineering goals in the joining sector to benefit transport, aerospace, and nuclear industries amongst others. Here, in this paper, we show that the suitable addition of carbon nanomaterials to a tin-based solder material matrix (C-Solder® supplied by Cametics Ltd.) results in two-fold strength of soldered composite joints. Single-lap shear joint experiments were conducted on soldered aluminium alloy (6082 T6) substrates. The soldering material was reinforced in different mix ratios by carbon black, graphene, and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and benchmarked against the pristine C-solder®. The material characterisation was performed using Vickers micro-indentation, differential scanning calorimetry and nano-indentation, whereas functional testing involved mechanical shear tests using single-lap aluminium soldered joints and creep tests. The hardness was observed to improve in all cases except for the 0.01 wt.% graphene reinforced solders, with 5% and 4% improvements in 0.05 carbon black and SWCNT reinforced solders, respectively. The maximum creep indentation was noted to improve for all solder categories with maximum 11% and 8% improvements in 0.05 wt.% carbon black and SWCNT reinforced ones. In general, the 0.05 wt.% nanomaterial reinforced solders promoted progressive cohesion failure in the joints as opposed to instantaneous fully de-bonded failure observed in pristine soldered joints, which suggests potential application in high-performance structures where no service load induced adhesion failure is permissible (e.g. aerospace assemblies). The novel innovation developed here will pave the way to achieving high-performance solder joining without carrying out extensive surface preparations."
Study of the Influence of Ga and In Doping on Organic Residuals in Solution-Processed IGZO Thin Films Deposited at Low-Temperature,"In this work, the synthesis and characterization of IGZO films was carried out from the individual analysis of ZnO films doped at different In3+ and Ga3+ wt.%. The thin films were obtained by solution processes at low temperature (200 °C). The films were characterized by X-ray Diffraction, optical transmittance, FTIR spectroscopy and resistivity. It was found that the variation of doping affected the content of organic residuals in the deposited films. In addition, the fabrication and characterization of Metal–Insulator–Semiconductor capacitors on plastic substrates are presented. Interestingly, there was a correlation in the hysteresis with the doping of In3+ and Ga3+."

"Implications, conflicts, and reductions for Steiner trees","The Steiner tree problem in graphs (SPG) is one of the most studied problems in combinatorial optimization. In the past 10 years, there have been significant advances concerning approximation and complexity of the SPG. However, the state of the art in (practical) exact solution of the SPG has remained largely unchallenged for almost 20 years. While the DIMACS Challenge 2014 and the PACE Challenge 2018 brought renewed interest into Steiner tree problems, even the best new SPG solvers cannot match the state of the art on the vast majority of benchmark instances. The following article seeks to advance exact SPG solution once again. The article is based on a combination of three concepts: Implications, conflicts, and reductions. As a result, various new SPG techniques are conceived. Notably, several of the resulting techniques are (provably) stronger than well-known methods from the literature that are used in exact SPG algorithms. Finally, by integrating the new methods into a branch-and-cut framework, we obtain an exact SPG solver that is not only competitive with, but even outperforms the current state of the art on an extensive collection of benchmark sets. Furthermore, we can solve several instances for the first time to optimality."
Computational aspects of relaxation complexity: possibilities and limitations,"The relaxation complexity \({{\,\mathrm{rc}\,}}(X)\) of the set of integer points X contained in a polyhedron is the smallest number of facets of any polyhedron P such that the integer points in P coincide with X. It is a useful tool to investigate the existence of compact linear descriptions of X. In this article, we derive tight and computable upper bounds on \({{\,\mathrm{rc}\,}}_\mathbb {Q}(X)\), a variant of \({{\,\mathrm{rc}\,}}(X)\) in which the polyhedra P are required to be rational, and we show that \({{\,\mathrm{rc}\,}}(X)\) can be computed in polynomial time if X is 2-dimensional. Further, we investigate computable lower bounds on \({{\,\mathrm{rc}\,}}(X)\) with the particular focus on the existence of a finite set \(Y \subseteq \mathbb {Z}^d\) such that separating X and \(Y \setminus X\) allows us to deduce \({{\,\mathrm{rc}\,}}(X) \ge k\). In particular, we show for some choices of X that no such finite set Y exists to certify the value of \({{\,\mathrm{rc}\,}}(X)\), providing a negative answer to a question by Weltge (2015). We also obtain an explicit formula for \({{\,\mathrm{rc}\,}}(X)\) for specific classes of sets X and present the first practically applicable approach to compute \({{\,\mathrm{rc}\,}}(X)\) for sets X that admit a finite certificate."
Comparison of AI-powered 3D automated ultrasound tomography with standard handheld ultrasound for the visualization of the hands—clinical proof of concept,To assess the ability of a newly developed AI-powered ultrasound 3D hand scanner to visualize joint structures in healthy hands and detect degenerative changes in cadaveric hands.
Happy Cultures? A Multilevel Model of Well-Being with Individual and Contextual Human Values,"Despite the abundant literature in Happiness Science, no paper to date has studied the joint effects of human values on subjective well-being at individual and contextual level. Using European Social Survey data for life satisfaction and Salomon H. Schwartz’s scale for human values with four and ten dimensions, this paper presents novel evidence on the direct effects of individual, regional, and national human values, utilizing two different ways of building cultural indicators of human values. We show that regional factors explain approximately 2% of the dispersion of individual life satisfaction, whereas national factors explain around 12%. The results on the effects of individual human values support Sortheix and Schwartz’s hypothesis, with a significant difference: Individual Conformity has a positive impact on well-being, not the negative sign Sortheix and Schwartz predict for Conservation values. We also find positive direct cultural effects for Benevolence and Conformity and negative effects for Tradition. Additionally, we propose a research agenda for human values and contextual effects on well-being studies."
Semi-quantitative assessment of ischemia with rubidium-82 PET myocardial perfusion imaging,Semi-quantitative scores can be used as an adjunct to visual assessment in rubidium-82 positron emission tomography (82Rb PET). The semi-quantitative cut-off values used in 82Rb PET are derived from single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). It is unknown whether these cut-off values can be extrapolated to 82Rb PET. We compared the semi-quantitative with the visual assessment of ischemia and determined which summed difference score (SDS) score predicts ischemia best.
"Assessing hydrogeochemistry, water quality index (WQI), and seasonal pattern of plankton community in different small and medium reservoirs of Karnataka, India","Changes in aquatic ecosystem due to anthropogenic or natural process are growing concern which requires regular monitoring for water quality to formulate guidelines for their proper management. The present study aimed to understand the limno-biotic status of nine different small (Kanva, Votehole, Anjanapura, and Gayathri) and medium (Jambadahalla, Tunga, Varahi, Shanthisagar, and Boranakanive) reservoirs of Karnataka state of India using physicochemical and the plankton diversity during the three different seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon). The water quality parameters like transparency in terms of secchi disc depth (m), water temperature (°C), pH, EC (μS/cm), dissolved oxygen (mg/l), TDS (mg/l), total alkalinity (mg/l), NO3−-N (mg/l), PO43−-P (mg/l), and SiO2 (mg/l) besides planktonic diversity were measured using standard procedure. The variables were subjected to Pearson’s correlation analysis to determine the relationship among them during three seasons. Further principal component analysis (PCA) was done to explain the variance. The results revealed that all the reservoir water was alkaline in nature with marked seasonal differences and was fairly rich in dissolved oxygen except Gayathri. Electrical conductivity values of all the reservoirs were below the permissible limit (2000 μS/cm) with a noticeable concentration of PO43−-P in all the reservoirs. High silicate content coupled with dominance of Mycocystis sp.  in  most of the reservoirs is an indication of eutrophic condition. Principal component analysis revealed the evidence of anthropogenic factors leading to deterioration of the water quality index of all the reservoirs from “poor” to “unsuitable category” except Tunga reservoir (Good quality). Since all these reservoirs support fisheries and are amenable to enhanced fisheries through fish seed stocking, there is an urgent need to monitor the water quality of these multipurpose reservoirs for conservation of aquatic biodiversity and maintain ecosystem health."
Development characteristics of organic-inorganic pores in the mixed laminated shale of the saline fault lake basin,"The developmental characteristics of organic and inorganic pores in the Paleogene Funing Formation (E1f2) of the Subei Basin were studied by using core description, thin section and SEM examination of argon-polished samples with pore size acquired by quantitative image processing technology. The results show that there are mainly three types of laminated shales: (1) calcareous laminated shale, (2) thin-layered calcareous shale, and (3) layer-massive shale. There are differences in pore types and size distributions among the three types of shales. The organic pores are developed in the organic-rich shale lamina. These pores formed within the organic matter are associated with the asphalt shrinkage with pores developing along the edge and intergranular pores within organic matter associated with pyrite. The organic pores account for approximately 12% of the total pores of the mixed laminated shale. The inorganic pores are mainly intergranular pores, solution pores, and microcracks. The average pore diameter of felsic intergranular pores was found to be larger than that of the carbonate and clay minerals. The intergranular pores accounted for approximately 15.4% of the total pores of the mixed laminated shale. The main pores of shale are intergranular dissolution pores and matrix dissolution pores. The dissolution pores account for 59.8% of the total pores of mixed laminated shale. The structural microfractures and dissolution microfractures are in a half-filled state, with the largest fracture width. The abundance of organic-rich matter and its texture determines the development of organic pores; the degree of diagenesis and evolution determines the development of inorganic pores; and the content of brittle minerals in calcareous shale determines the development of microfractures. The research results in understanding pore structure, types, and reservoir performance of continental mixed laminated shales that are widely developed in China. An understanding of the enrichment mechanism of pores within continental mixed laminated shales is necessary to promote the exploration of continental shale gas reservoirs."
"A research on consistency limits, compaction, and strength properties of sheep wool–fine-grained soil mixtures","Recycling of waste materials has become a major concern for a sustainable life on our planet. So, researchers have been focusing on alternative recycling options in the recent decades. Sheep wool is a natural fiber which is wasted in large amounts every year especially in the middle east region. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the possible effects of adding recycled sheep wool to low and high plastic clays in terms of consistency limits, compaction, and strength properties, aiming to find a possible means of recycling these wasted natural fibers. For this purpose, sheep wool and fine-grained soil samples were collected from Iraq. Then, sheep wool/clay mixtures were prepared by adding 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10% sheep wool to clay by dry weight of clay. Proctor compaction, consistency limit, and unconfined compression tests were performed on these samples. The consistency limits were noticeably increased with increasing sheep wool content without a significant change in plasticity indices of the samples. The maximum dry density was observed to decrease gradually while the optimum moisture content was increasing with increasing sheep wool content, as expected for both types of soils. The unconfined compressive strength of the tested samples was observed to increase up to an optimum level of fiber content for both types of soils and decreased with further fiber addition. The optimum fiber contents were found to be 0.5% and 1% for low and high plastic clays respectively with a more noticeable effect for the latter."
The Deep Velocity Structure of the Central Kola Peninsula Obtained using the Receiver Function Technique,"New results are presented on the features of the deep velocity structure of two of the three main tectonic blocks that make up the Kola region—Murmansk and Belomorskii—by the P receiver function technique. The research is based on data from the broadband seismic stations Teriberka and Kovda. The results are compared with the models obtained by mutual inversion of PRF and SRF using the data from the stations Apatity and Lovozero. It is shown that the crust has a two-layer structure with the border at a depth of 11 km under the Murmansk block and at a depth of 15 km under the Kola and Belomorskii blocks. The crust thickness of the Murmansk, Belomorskii, and Kola blocks are 35, 33, and 40 km, respectively. The presence of the MLD was revealed in all tectonic structures analyzed for the first time, with a top at a depth of about 70 km for the Murmansk and Belomorskii blocks and 90 km for the Kola block and a bottom at 130–140 km for all structures."
Application of Artificial Intelligence Algorithms to Optimal Planning of Offshore Seismic Works,"In this article, we present the algorithm, that allows to optimise the time and cost of marine seismic surveys. The application of a heuristic, algorithm is proposed for solving the traveling salesman problem on a series of graphs, to which the seismic observation system is reduced. The proposed algorithm assumes work with towed equipment and use of bottom stations. The algorithm provides a path close to the minimum, taking into account the real geometry of ships and their speed of passing various sections. The scientific novelty of the work lies in the application of the genetic algorithm for optimal planning, taking into account the closure of the work zones, to the problems of marine geophysics. The use of artificial intelligence methods allowed for the first time to develop a system that provides the ability to promptly adjust work plans depending on the changing meteorological and other conditions, including when working with several vessels using bottom stations. The paper describes the methodology, development of the algorithm and results in the form of applied software, and examples of planning on test data."
Middle Devonian Age of Metamorphism of Garnet Amphibolite at the Sole of the Kempirsai Ophiolite Allochthon (Southern Urals): Results of U–Th–Pb (SIMS) Dating,"Metagabbroid garnet amphibolite formed after high-pressure granulite with an estimated P–T peak of 12–16 kbar at 700–790°C occurs at the sole of the Kempirsai ophiolite allochthon (Southern Urals). Garnet amphibolite includes high-Fe varieties with the assemblages of garnet and relics of pyroxene, as well as high-alumina rocks composed of garnet, pyroxene, corundum, and sapphirine. The Ediacaran and Early–Middle Palaeozoic sequences underlying the allochthon were metamorphosed under the conditions of amphibolite facies. Our studies were aimed at estimation of the peak metamorphic age of garnet amphibolite. The mean 206Pb/238U (SIMS, SHRIMP II) age obtained for the zircons from garnet amphibolite is 392 ± 4 Ma. The estimated age characterizes the timing of metamorphism related to mantle magmatism accompanying obduction."
Paleomagnetic Evidence for the Iceland Plume Paleogeographic Stationarity and Early Cretaceous Manifestation in the High Arctic,"Here we present reconstructions indicating the stationary position and paleogeography of the Iceland plume, as well as its direct connection to the Mesozoic–Cenozoic large igneous provinces of the northern Atlantic and the Arctic. The main evidence for the stationary position of the Iceland hotspot comes from paleomagnetic data for the trap formation of the Franz Josef Land archipelago. Our reconstructions show that the Barents Sea magmatic province included in these traps belongs to the trace of the Iceland plume and formed as part of the High Arctic Large Igneous Province during a single relatively brief event ca. 125 Ma. Older pulses of basaltic magmatism inferred previously for the Franz Josef Land archipelago for the Early and Middle Jurassic period do not have known analogs in adjacent territories of the present-day Arctic."
Geochemistry of Rare Earth Metals in the Ultrabasic–Alkaline–Carbonatite Complex of Kugda (Polar Siberia),"The distribution patterns of rare earth metals (REM) in the rocks of the Kugda massif (Polar Siberia) are assessed. The REM content decreases from early olivinite rocks, containing, on average, 1938 ppm, to the end products of syenite differentiation and increases again in carbonatites. The difference in the distribution coefficients of light and heavy rare earth metals is the reason for the noticeable fractionation of these elements during the evolution of the magmatic system of the Kugda massif. The ratio of light REM to heavy Ce/Yb drops by almost an order of magnitude in later differentiation products. The main process of the Kugda massif formation was continuous crystallization differentiation, characterized by a wide crystallization field of perovskite. An interesting feature of the process is the very early crystallization of perovskite, associated with the high potential of carbon dioxide."
"Paleoclimate Characteristics of the Middle Jurassic Xintiangou Stage in Yunyang Area, Northeast Sichuan Basin, China","Two sections of the Xintiangou Formation were examined in the Yunyang area, Northeastern Sichuan Basin, China. One of them was systematically sampled from bottom to top. Palynology and geochemistry analyses were performed on 20 samples, and Paleoclimatic indicators were extracted. The sporopollen assemblage indicates arid and hot paleoclimate as a whole, and the geochemical index shows hot and humid paleoclimate. Combined with the analysis of sedimentary characteristics, it shows that the sedimentary period of the Xintiangou Formation in the study area is characterized by arid and hot paleoclimate as a whole, and there were fluctuations of relative moist and arid. The humid climate recorded by geochemical indicators may be the illusion that the unconsolidated sediments transported to the shore shallow lake zone experienced strong weathering. When studying the palaeoclimate characteristics of continental basins, it is necessary to analyze all kinds of palaeoclimate proxy indexes in combination with sedimentary facies, and there may be a deviation in using a single palaeoclimate proxy index to invert the palaeoclimate of continental basins."
The Neotectonic Structure of Deception Island (Antarctica) Inferred from the Results of Structural and Geomorphic Analysis,"We present the results of analysis of the Strombolian-type Deception volcano after its explosive caldera-forming eruption. The volcano studied, located in the South Shetland Archipelago (Antarctica), was selected in accordance with the “Strategy for the Development of the Russian Federation Activities in Antarctica for the Period until 2020 and for the Long-term Period until 2030.” On the basis of original structural–geomorphic constructions and literature data, the location of volcano is substantiated, the modern tectonic structure of volcano is revealed, and the influence of geodynamic settings in adjacent regions on the evolution of the volcano is assessed. We applied the structural–geomorphic method, which is developed by the national scientific school and successfully tested in practice. The initial materials were topographic and bathymetric maps of various scales, satellite and ground-penetrating-radar images, the digital elevation model compiled, and published geophysical and geological information. It is concluded that Deception volcano was formed at the intercept between the large Hero Fracture Zone and the regional fault framing the South Shetland Archipelago from its southeast, without the influence of the geodynamic regime of the adjacent Bransfield rift, which is considered by a number of researchers to play a leading role in the evolution of the volcano. The modern volcano structure is characterized by fault-block tectonics with the domination of NE-trending faults."
"Geochemistry, Formation Settings, and Ore Potential of the Volcano-Sedimentary Complexes of Pryangarya, Yenisei Ridge","In the Angara part of the Yenisei Ridge, a sequential section of the metapicrite–basalt sequence and the overlying carbonate rocks of the Gorevskaya suite has been established, which is considered as a single volcanogenic–sedimentary complex formed at the turn of the Late Mesoproterozoic and Early Neoproterozoic in the riftogenic continental marginally continental southwestern paleobasin. In the section of the lower part of the Nizhnerechinskaya strata, metamorphosed picrobasalts and picrites prevail, in the middle and upper ones, there are basalts and ore-bearing Pb–Zn mineralization (Stepanovskoe ore occurrence). Rifting in the Earth’s crust in the Angara region, which occurred in the Late Mesoproterozoic–Early Neoproterozoic, led to the opening of the continental-marginal sea basin. The basalt–picrite volcanism and the accumulation of terrigenous–carbonate deposits, including ore-bearing deposits of the Gorevskaya suite, with the Gorevskoe Pb–Zn deposit, took place subsynchronously. Therefore, the paleobasin is interpreted as a relict of riftogenic nature on the western margin of the Siberian Craton, and the volcanic–sedimentary Nizhnerechinskaya stratum is interpreted as the lower potential stratum level of polymetallic mineralization in the Gorevskoe orefield."
Modeling the Seismicity of the Altai–Sayan–Baikal Region,Numerical modeling of the dynamics of the block structure and the resulting seismicity of the Altai–Sayan–Baikal region has been carried out. The earthquake epicenters obtained in the model are located in the vicinities of all earthquakes with M ≥ 6.0 and most earthquakes with M ≥ 5.0 that have occurred in the region. The Gutenberg–Richter plots for the model and real seismicity have similar slopes. The seismicity obtained in the model gives grounds to argue for the reliability of the previously recognized locations where strong earthquakes are most likely to occur in the region considered. The model of seismicity can be used to assess the regional seismic hazard.
The “Upper Basalts” of the East Chukotka Segment of Okhotsk–Chukotka Belt: the Along Strike Migration of Volcanic Activity or the Overprint by Later Magmatic Event?,"New U–Pb and 40Ar/39Ar isotopic dates on volcanic rocks of the East Chukotka segment of the Okhotsk–Chukotka Belt correspond to 76–71 Ma span, which is partially beyond the conventional lifetime of this volcanic province. This could result from the migration of magmatic loci along the strike of the volcanic belt, and/or from the overprint by a younger magmatic event."
A lightweight automatic sleep staging method for children using single-channel EEG based on edge artificial intelligence,"With the development of telemedicine and edge computing, edge artificial intelligence (AI) will become a new development trend for smart medicine. On the other hand, nearly one-third of children suffer from sleep disorders. However, all existing sleep staging methods are for adults. Therefore, we adapted edge AI to develop a lightweight automatic sleep staging method for children using single-channel EEG. The trained sleep staging model will be deployed to edge smart devices so that the sleep staging can be implemented on edge devices which will greatly save network resources and improving the performance and privacy of sleep staging application. Then the results and hypnogram will be uploaded to the cloud server for further analysis by the physicians to get sleep disease diagnosis reports and treatment opinions. We utilized 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) to build our sleep staging model, named CSleepNet. We tested the model on our childrens sleep (CS) dataset and sleep-EDFX dataset. For the CS dataset, we experimented with F4-M1 channel EEG using four different loss functions, and the logcosh performed best with overall accuracy of 83.06% and F1-score of 76.50%. We used Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz channel EEG to train our model in Sleep-EDFX dataset, and achieved an accuracy of 86.41% without manual feature extraction. The experimental results show that our method has great potential. It not only plays an important role in sleep-related research, but also can be widely used in the classification of other time sequences physiological signals."
Colonial history and global economics distort our understanding of deep-time biodiversity,"Sampling biases in the fossil record distort estimates of past biodiversity. However, these biases not only reflect the geological and spatial aspects of the fossil record, but also the historical and current collation of fossil data. We demonstrate how the legacy of colonialism and socioeconomic factors, such as wealth, education and political stability, impact the global distribution of fossil data over the past 30 years. We find that a global power imbalance persists in palaeontology, with researchers in high- or upper-middle-income countries holding a monopoly over palaeontological knowledge production by contributing to 97% of fossil data. As a result, some countries or regions tend to be better sampled than others, ultimately leading to heterogeneous spatial sampling across the globe. This illustrates how efforts to mitigate sampling biases to obtain a truly representative view of past biodiversity are not disconnected from the aim of diversifying and decolonizing our discipline."
Dosage sensitivity and exon shuffling shape the landscape of polymorphic duplicates in Drosophila and humans,"Despite polymorphic duplicate genes' importance for the early stages of duplicate gene evolution, they are less studied than old gene duplicates. Two essential questions thus remain poorly addressed: how does dosage sensitivity, imposed by stoichiometry in protein complexes or by X chromosome dosage compensation, affect the emergence of complete duplicate genes? Do introns facilitate intergenic and intragenic chimaerism as predicted by the theory of exon shuffling? Here, we analysed new data for Drosophila and public data for humans, to characterize polymorphic duplicate genes with respect to dosage, exon–intron structures and allele frequencies. We found that complete duplicate genes are under dosage constraint induced by protein stoichiometry but potentially tolerated by X chromosome dosage compensation. We also found that in the intron-rich human genome, gene fusions and intragenic duplications extensively use intronic breakpoints generating in-frame proteins, in accordance with the theory of exon shuffling. Finally, we found that only a small proportion of complete or partial duplicates are at high frequencies, indicating the deleterious nature of dosage or gene structural changes. Altogether, we demonstrate how mechanistic factors including dosage sensitivity and exon–intron structure shape the short-term functional consequences of gene duplication."
Jurassic greenhouse ice-sheet fluctuations sensitive to atmospheric CO2 dynamics,"Sea-level proxy records and palaeoclimate models suggest that globally elevated temperatures during the greenhouse climate of the Jurassic were punctuated by poorly understood, transient icehouse events. Here we investigate atmospheric CO2–ice-sheet dynamics as a case study from the Early Jurassic Pliensbachian–Toarcian transition (182.7–180.6 million years ago). Applying the C3 CO2 plant proxy to previously published fossil wood data reveals that CO2 levels during this transition ranged from 250 to 400 ppm. Previously published belemnite δ18O values suggest that sea-level low stands were equivalent to ice volumes up to two-thirds of Antarctica today. Beginning with the Toarcian ocean anoxic event, these ice sheets largely melted when CO2 reached sustained concentrations of ~500–700 ppm. Compared with the Cenozoic East Antarctic Ice Sheet and ice sheets modelled for the Middle Jurassic, Early Jurassic ice sheets exhibit minimal lags (hysteresis) between warming and cooling limbs, suggesting they were thin and located at lower latitudes and elevations with a higher temperature sensitivity to melting. These sensitivities of ice volume to CO2 provide additional constraints on climate models for application to warming transitions in both the past and future."
Climate change impacts on infectious diseases in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East (EMME)—risks and recommendations,"The Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East (EMME) region has rapid population growth, large differences in socio-economic levels between developed and developing countries, migration, increased water demand, and ecosystems degradation. The region is experiencing a significant warming trend with longer and warmer summers, increased frequency and severity of heat waves, and a drier climate. While climate change plays an important role in contributing to political instability in the region through displacement of people, food insecurity, and increased violence, it also increases the risks of vector-, water-, and food-borne diseases. Poorer and less educated people, young children and the elderly, migrants, and those with long-term health problems are at highest risk. A result of the inequalities among EMME countries is an inconsistency in the availability of reliable evidence about the impacts on infectious diseases. To help address this gap, a search of the literature was conducted as a basis for related recommended responses and suggested actions for preparedness and prevention. Since climate change already impacts the health of vulnerable populations in the EMME and will have a greater impact in future years, risk assessment and timely design and implementation of health preparedness and adaptation strategies are essential. Joint national and cross-border infectious diseases management systems for more effective preparedness and prevention are needed, supported by interventions that improve the environment. Without such cooperation and effective interventions, climate change will lead to an increasing morbidity and mortality in the EMME from infectious diseases, with a higher risk for the most vulnerable populations."
Transversality of sections on elliptic surfaces with applications to elliptic divisibility sequences and geography of surfaces,"We consider elliptic surfaces \({\mathcal {E}}\) over a field k equipped with zero section O and another section P of infinite order. If k has characteristic zero, we show there are only finitely many points where O is tangent to a multiple of P. Equivalently, there is a finite list of integers such that if n is not divisible by any of them, then nP is not tangent to O. Such tangencies can be interpreted as unlikely intersections. If k has characteristic zero or \(p>3\) and \({\mathcal {E}}\) is very general, then we show there are no tangencies between O and nP. We apply these results to square-freeness of elliptic divisibility sequences and to geography of surfaces. In particular, we construct mildly singular surfaces of arbitrary fixed geometric genus with K ample and \(K^2\) unbounded."
Sparse polynomial equations and other enumerative problems whose Galois groups are wreath products,"We introduce a new technique to prove connectivity of subsets of covering spaces (so called inductive connectivity), and apply it to Galois theory of problems of enumerative geometry. As a model example, consider the problem of permuting the roots of a complex polynomial \(f(x) = c_0 + c_1 x^{d_1} + \cdots + c_k x^{d_k}\) by varying its coefficients. If the GCD of the exponents is d, then the polynomial admits the change of variable \(y=x^d\), and its roots split into necklaces of length d. At best we can expect to permute these necklaces, i.e. the Galois group of f equals the wreath product of the symmetric group over \(d_k/d\) elements and \({\mathbb {Z}}/d{\mathbb {Z}}\). We study the multidimensional generalization of this equality: the Galois group of a general system of polynomial equations equals the expected wreath product for a large class of systems, but in general this expected equality fails, making the problem of describing such Galois groups unexpectedly rich."
Universal functors on symmetric quotient stacks of Abelian varieties,"We consider certain universal functors on symmetric quotient stacks of Abelian varieties. In dimension two, we discover a family of \({{\mathbb {P}}}\)-functors which induce new derived autoequivalences of Hilbert schemes of points on Abelian surfaces; a set of braid relations on a holomorphic symplectic sixfold; and a pair of spherical functors on the Hilbert square of an Abelian surface, whose twists are related to the well-known Horja twist. In dimension one, our universal functors are fully faithful, giving rise to a semiorthogonal decomposition for the symmetric quotient stack of an elliptic curve (which we compare to the one discovered by Polishchuk–Van den Bergh), and they lift to spherical functors on the canonical cover, inducing twists which descend to give new derived autoequivalences here as well."
MST1 mediates the N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced excitotoxicity in mouse cortical neurons,"Excessive activation of the ionotropic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been shown to cause abnormally high levels of Ca2+ influx, thereby leading to excitotoxic neuronal death. In this study, exposure of mouse primary cortical neurons to NMDA resulted in the cleavage and activation of mammalian sterile 20-like kinase-1 (MST1), both of which were mediated by calpain 1. In vitro cleavage assay data indicated that calpain 1 cleaves out the autoinhibitory domain of MST1  to generate an active form of the kinase. Furthermore, calpain 1 mediated the cleavage and activation of wild-type MST1, but not of MST1 (G339A). Intriguingly, NMDA/calpain-induced MST1 activation promoted the nuclear translocation of the kinase and the phosphorylation of histone H2B in mouse cortical neurons, leading to excitotoxicity. Thus, we propose a previously unrecognized mechanism of MST1 activation associated with NMDA-induced excitotoxic neuronal death."

"Halorubrum salipaludis sp. nov., isolated from the saline–alkaline soil","A novel extremely halophilic archaeon, designated WN019T, was isolated from the natural saline-alkali wetland soil of Binhai new district, Tianjin, China. Cells of WN019T were aerobic, motile, and pleomorphic rod-shaped, 0.5–0.8 µm in width and 2.0–2.5 µm in length, and the growth occurred optimally at 33–37 °C, pH 7.5–8.0, and in the presence of 15.0–20.0% (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison showed that the isolate belonged to the genus Halorubrum and exhibited moderate sequence similarity of 97.8% to Halorubrum saccharovorum JCM 8865T. The major respiratory quinones of strain WN019T were MK-8 and MK-8 (H2), and the major polar lipids were glycolipid (GL), phospholipid (PL), phosphatidylglycerol-sulphate (PGS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylglycerol-phosphate-methyl ester (Me-PGP). The DNA G + C content of the strain was 67.4 mol%. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) value based on whole genome sequences of strain WN019T and Halorubrum saccharovorum JCM 8865T were 87.5% and 35.4%, respectively. Phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic, and genomic analyses suggested that strain WN019T represents a novel species of the genus Halorubrum, for which the name Halorubrum salipaludis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is WN019T (= KCTC 4269T = ACCC 19977T)."

Mössbauer study of some novel iron-bis-glyoxime and iron-tris-glyoxime complexes,"Dioximes as ligands are used as analytical reagents and serve as models for biological systems as well as catalysts in chemical processes. A number of novel mixed complexes of the type [Fe(DioxH)2(amine)2] have been prepared and characterised by FTIR, 57Fe Mössbauer and mass spectroscopy by us. We have found strong Fe–N donor acceptor interactions and iron occurred in low-spin FeII state in all complexes. Later, we have also found that the incorporation of branching alkyl chains (isopropyl) in the complexes alters the Fe–N bond length and results in high-spin iron(II) state [1, 2]. The question arises: can the spin state of iron be manipulated generally by replacing the short alkyl chains with high volume demand ones in Fe-azomethine-amine complexes? To answer the question we have synthetized novel iron-bis-glioxime and iron-tris-gloxime complexes when long chain alkyl or aromatic ligands replaced the short alkyl ones and studied by 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, MS, FTIR, UV-VIS, TG-DTA-DTG and XRD methods. Novel iron-bis-glyoxime and iron-tris-glyoxime type complexes, [Fe(Diethyl-Diox)3(BOH)2], [Fe(Diethyl-Diox)3(BOEt)2] and [Fe(phenyl-Me-Diox)3(BOEt)2], were synthesized similarly as described in [2]. The FTIR, UV-VIS, TG-DTA-DTG and MS measurements indicated that the expected novel complexes could be successfully synthesized."
The temperature dependence of nuclear resonant X-Ray spectra of magnetic iron and cementite,"From low temperatures through the Curie temperatures, the phonon density of states (DOS) was measured for bcc 57Fe, and the partial phonon DOS was measured for cementite, 57Fe3C, by nuclear resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (NRIXS). Nuclear forward scattering (NFS) was used to determine the state of magnetization of 57Fe3C. The changes in phonon DOS with magnetization were assessed, and a linear relationship was found between the temperature dependences of the magnetization and the non-quasiharmonic shifts of phonon frequencies. Following the quasiharmonic approximation (QHA) for non-harmonic phonons, a magnetic quasiharmonic theory is developed to account for how phonon frequencies are altered by changes in magnetization. The formalism explains well the discrepancy between the free energy measurements and predictions of the QHA for both bcc iron and cementite. The physical origin of the magnetic Grüneisen parameters remains a challenge."
Cognitive load decreases cooperation and moral punishment in a Prisoner’s Dilemma game with punishment option,"The present study serves to test whether cooperation and moral punishment are affected by cognitive load. Dual-process theories postulate that moral behavior is intuitive which leads to the prediction that cooperation and moral punishment should remain unaffected or may even increase when cognitive load is induced by a secondary task. However, it has also been proposed that cognitive control and deliberation are necessary to choose an economically costly but morally justified option. A third perspective implies that the effects of cognitive load may depend on the specific processes involved in social dilemmas. In the present study, participants played a simultaneous Prisoner’s Dilemma game with a punishment option. First, both players decided to cooperate or defect. Then they had the opportunity to punish the partners. In the cognitive-load group, cognitive load was induced by a continuous tone classification task while the no-load group had no distractor task. Under cognitive load, cooperation and moral punishment decreased in comparison to the no-load condition. By contrast, hypocritical and antisocial punishment were not influenced by the dual-task manipulation. Increased cognitive load was associated with a bias to punish the partners irrespective of the outcome of the Prisoner’s Dilemma game, suggesting that punishment was applied less purposefully in the cognitive-load condition. The present findings are thus in line with the idea that the availability of cognitive resources does not always have a suppressive effect on moral behaviors, but can have facilitating effects on cooperation and moral punishment."
Restrained expression of canine glucocorticoid receptor splice variants α and P prognosticates fatal disease outcome in SIRS,"Glucocorticoids play a central role in the inflammatory response and alleviate the symptoms in critically ill patients. The glucocorticoid action relies on the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) which translocates into the nucleus upon ligand-binding and regulates transcription of a battery of genes. Although the GR is encoded by a single gene, dozens of its splice variants have been described in diverse species. The GRα isoform encodes the full, functionally active protein that is composed of a transactivation, a DNA-binding, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain. The second most highly expressed receptor variant, the GR-P, is formed by an intron retention that introduces an early stop codon and results in a probably dysfunctional protein with truncated ligand-binding domain. We described the canine ortholog of GR-P and showed that this splice variant is highly abundant in the peripheral blood of dogs. The level of cGRα and cGR-P transcripts are elevated in patients of SIRS and the survival rate is increased with elevated cGRα and cGR-P expression. The ratio of cGRα and cGR-P mRNA did not differ between the survivor and non-survivor patients; thus, the total GR expression is more pertinent than the relative expression of GR isoforms in assessment of the disease outcome."
Molecular surveillance of pneumococcal carriage following completion of immunization with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine administered in a 3 + 1 schedule,"In a cross-sectional study, with the use of molecular methods, we aimed to gain insight into oropharyngeal pneumococcal colonization over time in 1212 Greek children recruited in general pediatric settings throughout the country; they were fully vaccinated with PCV13 (3 + 1 schedule). A single sample was obtained from each child at a time interval of 26 days to 70 months after administration of the 4th (booster) PCV13 dose; sampling time was divided into six time intervals. Carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected by real-time PCR targeting the lytA gene and isolates were serotyped by singleplex real-time PCR assays. Multiple control procedures to avoid false-positive results were applied. We showed an overall S. pneumoniae carriage rate of 48.6%. Serotyping identified typeable isolates in 82% of the total lytA-positive samples. Non-PCV13 serotypes represented 83.8% of total isolates when excluding serogroups with mixed PCV13 and non-PCV13 serotypes. In multivariate analysis daycare/school attendance emerged as the main contributing factor. Notably, serotypes 19A and 3 were the only two PCV13 serotypes the colonization rate of which increased over time (χ2 for trend P < 0.001 and P = 0.012, respectively). The application of the SP2020 gene on lytA-positive serotyped samples showed pneumococcal colonization in 97% of cases, and the overall colonization profile over time closely resembled that of the lytA gene. With the provisions of the methodological approach and age group of our study, the use of the oropharynx emerges as a reliable alternative to the nasopharynx in estimating pneumococcal carriage in epidemiological studies."
Triacontanol modulates salt stress tolerance in cucumber by altering the physiological and biochemical status of plant cells,"Cucumber is an important vegetable but highly sensitive to salt stress. The present study was designed to investigate the comparative performance of cucumber genotypes under salt stress (50 mmol L−1) and stress alleviation through an optimized level of triacontanol @ 0.8 mg L−1. Four cucumber genotypes were subjected to foliar application of triacontanol under stress. Different physiological, biochemical, water relations and ionic traits were observed to determine the role of triacontanol in salt stress alleviation. Triacontanol ameliorated the lethal impact of salt stress in all genotypes, but Green long and Marketmore were more responsive than Summer green and 20252 in almost all the attributes that define the genetic potential of genotypes. Triacontanol performs as a good scavenger of ROS by accelerating the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, CAT) and compatible solutes (proline, glycinebetaine, phenolic contents), which lead to improved gas exchange attributes and water relations and in that way enhance the calcium and potassium contents or decline the sodium and chloride contents in cucumber leaves. Furthermore, triacontanol feeding also shows the answer to yield traits of cucumber. It was concluded from the results that the salinity tolerance efficacy of triacontanol is valid in enhancing the productivity of cucumber plants under salt stress. Triacontanol was more pronounced in green long and marketer green than in summer green and 20252. Hence, the findings of this study pave the way towards the usage of triacontanol @ 0.8 mg L−1, and green long and marketer genotypes may be recommended for saline soil."
The temperature dependence of nuclear resonant X-Ray spectra of magnetic iron and cementite,"From low temperatures through the Curie temperatures, the phonon density of states (DOS) was measured for bcc 57Fe, and the partial phonon DOS was measured for cementite, 57Fe3C, by nuclear resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (NRIXS). Nuclear forward scattering (NFS) was used to determine the state of magnetization of 57Fe3C. The changes in phonon DOS with magnetization were assessed, and a linear relationship was found between the temperature dependences of the magnetization and the non-quasiharmonic shifts of phonon frequencies. Following the quasiharmonic approximation (QHA) for non-harmonic phonons, a magnetic quasiharmonic theory is developed to account for how phonon frequencies are altered by changes in magnetization. The formalism explains well the discrepancy between the free energy measurements and predictions of the QHA for both bcc iron and cementite. The physical origin of the magnetic Grüneisen parameters remains a challenge."

Cognitive load decreases cooperation and moral punishment in a Prisoner’s Dilemma game with punishment option,"The present study serves to test whether cooperation and moral punishment are affected by cognitive load. Dual-process theories postulate that moral behavior is intuitive which leads to the prediction that cooperation and moral punishment should remain unaffected or may even increase when cognitive load is induced by a secondary task. However, it has also been proposed that cognitive control and deliberation are necessary to choose an economically costly but morally justified option. A third perspective implies that the effects of cognitive load may depend on the specific processes involved in social dilemmas. In the present study, participants played a simultaneous Prisoner’s Dilemma game with a punishment option. First, both players decided to cooperate or defect. Then they had the opportunity to punish the partners. In the cognitive-load group, cognitive load was induced by a continuous tone classification task while the no-load group had no distractor task. Under cognitive load, cooperation and moral punishment decreased in comparison to the no-load condition. By contrast, hypocritical and antisocial punishment were not influenced by the dual-task manipulation. Increased cognitive load was associated with a bias to punish the partners irrespective of the outcome of the Prisoner’s Dilemma game, suggesting that punishment was applied less purposefully in the cognitive-load condition.

Leptomeningeal metastasis from melanoma emulating chronic subdural hematoma: a case report,"Melanoma is a disease in which the patient doesn’t know about the primary lesion, and it has a propensity to metastases to any organ in the human body. Amongst melanoma, leptomeningeal metastasis has the least incidence."
Designing a resilience model for pharmaceutical supply chain during crises: a grounded theory approach,"During disasters or crises, the traditional models of supply chain encounter failure and skewedness under the inevitable and unknown pressures. The procurement and transformation of required equipment to the involved areas is considered as one of the main triggers of decreasing damages and losses during crisis. In this regard, a breakdown in pharmaceutical supply chain can lead to intensive, undesired consequences."
Electrokinetic dewatering of mine tailing: influence of solid content and voltage level applied,"The process of disposing the tailings from mining activities generally involves the construction of large storage structures, either because of the large volume of residue generated by industrial processing plants or the difficulties in obtaining grants for new disposal areas. Over the past few years, such storage structures have been maximized to astonishing dimensions, considerably increasing the risk associated with possible rupture. Therefore, new management techniques, such as the integration of several mining areas involved in the exploration, and processing and residue disposal, need to be developed for reducing the generated residue volume and for optimizing the disposal processes of such materials. One of the residue disposal methodologies currently under study is the acceleration of the dewatering/consolidation process of the so-called fine residues, using electrokinetic techniques. In this context, this study conducts electrokinetic dewatering tests on fine bauxite tailing, using samples with initial solid content by weight ranging from 20 to 30%; final values between 43 and 66% are achieved. The estimated power consumption per volume of drained water ranges from 31.4 to 375.2 kWh/m3. The obtained results establish that the utilization of electrokinetic processes in the dewatering of tailings is a technique worthy of further investigation."
A lightweight automatic sleep staging method for children using single-channel EEG based on edge artificial intelligence,"With the development of telemedicine and edge computing, edge artificial intelligence (AI) will become a new development trend for smart medicine. On the other hand, nearly one-third of children suffer from sleep disorders. However, all existing sleep staging methods are for adults. Therefore, we adapted edge AI to develop a lightweight automatic sleep staging method for children using single-channel EEG. The trained sleep staging model will be deployed to edge smart devices so that the sleep staging can be implemented on edge devices which will greatly save network resources and improving the performance and privacy of sleep staging application. Then the results and hypnogram will be uploaded to the cloud server for further analysis by the physicians to get sleep disease diagnosis reports and treatment opinions. We utilized 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) to build our sleep staging model, named CSleepNet. We tested the model on our childrens sleep (CS) dataset and sleep-EDFX dataset. For the CS dataset, we experimented with F4-M1 channel EEG using four different loss functions, and the logcosh performed best with overall accuracy of 83.06% and F1-score of 76.50%. We used Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz channel EEG to train our model in Sleep-EDFX dataset, and achieved an accuracy of 86.41% without manual feature extraction. The experimental results show that our method has great potential. It not only plays an important role in sleep-related research, but also can be widely used in the classification of other time sequences physiological signals."
Climate change impacts on infectious diseases in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East (EMME)—risks and recommendations,"The Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East (EMME) region has rapid population growth, large differences in socio-economic levels between developed and developing countries, migration, increased water demand, and ecosystems degradation. The region is experiencing a significant warming trend with longer and warmer summers, increased frequency and severity of heat waves, and a drier climate. While climate change plays an important role in contributing to political instability in the region through displacement of people, food insecurity, and increased violence, it also increases the risks of vector-, water-, and food-borne diseases. Poorer and less educated people, young children and the elderly, migrants, and those with long-term health problems are at highest risk. A result of the inequalities among EMME countries is an inconsistency in the availability of reliable evidence about the impacts on infectious diseases. To help address this gap, a search of the literature was conducted as a basis for related recommended responses and suggested actions for preparedness and prevention. Since climate change already impacts the health of vulnerable populations in the EMME and will have a greater impact in future years, risk assessment and timely design and implementation of health preparedness and adaptation strategies are essential. Joint national and cross-border infectious diseases management systems for more effective preparedness and prevention are needed, supported by interventions that improve the environment. Without such cooperation and effective interventions, climate change will lead to an increasing morbidity and mortality in the EMME from infectious diseases, with a higher risk for the most vulnerable populations."
Dosage sensitivity and exon shuffling shape the landscape of polymorphic duplicates in Drosophila and humans,"Despite polymorphic duplicate genes' importance for the early stages of duplicate gene evolution, they are less studied than old gene duplicates. Two essential questions thus remain poorly addressed: how does dosage sensitivity, imposed by stoichiometry in protein complexes or by X chromosome dosage compensation, affect the emergence of complete duplicate genes? Do introns facilitate intergenic and intragenic chimaerism as predicted by the theory of exon shuffling? Here, we analysed new data for Drosophila and public data for humans, to characterize polymorphic duplicate genes with respect to dosage, exon–intron structures and allele frequencies. We found that complete duplicate genes are under dosage constraint induced by protein stoichiometry but potentially tolerated by X chromosome dosage compensation. We also found that in the intron-rich human genome, gene fusions and intragenic duplications extensively use intronic breakpoints generating in-frame proteins, in accordance with the theory of exon shuffling. Finally, we found that only a small proportion of complete or partial duplicates are at high frequencies, indicating the deleterious nature of dosage or gene structural changes. Altogether, we demonstrate how mechanistic factors including dosage sensitivity and exon–intron structure shape the short-term functional consequences of gene duplication."
Colonial history and global economics distort our understanding of deep-time biodiversity,"Sampling biases in the fossil record distort estimates of past biodiversity. However, these biases not only reflect the geological and spatial aspects of the fossil record, but also the historical and current collation of fossil data. We demonstrate how the legacy of colonialism and socioeconomic factors, such as wealth, education and political stability, impact the global distribution of fossil data over the past 30 years. We find that a global power imbalance persists in palaeontology, with researchers in high- or upper-middle-income countries holding a monopoly over palaeontological knowledge production by contributing to 97% of fossil data. As a result, some countries or regions tend to be better sampled than others, ultimately leading to heterogeneous spatial sampling across the globe. This illustrates how efforts to mitigate sampling biases to obtain a truly representative view of past biodiversity are not disconnected from the aim of diversifying and decolonizing our discipline."
Jurassic greenhouse ice-sheet fluctuations sensitive to atmospheric CO2 dynamics,"Sea-level proxy records and palaeoclimate models suggest that globally elevated temperatures during the greenhouse climate of the Jurassic were punctuated by poorly understood, transient icehouse events. Here we investigate atmospheric CO2–ice-sheet dynamics as a case study from the Early Jurassic Pliensbachian–Toarcian transition (182.7–180.6 million years ago). Applying the C3 CO2 plant proxy to previously published fossil wood data reveals that CO2 levels during this transition ranged from 250 to 400 ppm. Previously published belemnite δ18O values suggest that sea-level low stands were equivalent to ice volumes up to two-thirds of Antarctica today. Beginning with the Toarcian ocean anoxic event, these ice sheets largely melted when CO2 reached sustained concentrations of ~500–700 ppm. Compared with the Cenozoic East Antarctic Ice Sheet and ice sheets modelled for the Middle Jurassic, Early Jurassic ice sheets exhibit minimal lags (hysteresis) between warming and cooling limbs, suggesting they were thin and located at lower latitudes and elevations with a higher temperature sensitivity to melting. These sensitivities of ice volume to CO2 provide additional constraints on climate models for application to warming transitions in both the past and future."
"Structural analysis and seismic stratigraphy for delineation of Neoproterozoic-Cambrian petroleum system in central and eastern part of Bikaner–Nagaur basin, India","Bikaner–Nagaur basin is located in the northwestern part of India and lies on the rising flank of Punjab platform of Middle Indus basin in Pakistan. Existence of Neoproterozoic-Cambrian petroleum system was confirmed by the exploration activities in the western periphery of the basin, whereas vast areas of central and eastern parts remain unexplored. Knowledge of petroleum system in this unexplored part of the basin is limited due to non-availability of data. Recently, 2525 line km of regional 2D seismic data acquired for the first time by Government of India under National Seismic Program (NSP) unlocks the opportunity for comprehensive understanding of subsurface geology in unexplored part of the basin. Present work aims to interpret recently acquired 2D seismic data and integrate with available surface (outcrop) data, gravity and well data (drilled in western part of basin) for unfolding the petroleum system elements, structural configurations and stratigraphic features in the hitherto central-eastern part of the basin. Two Neoproterozoic-Cambrian hydrocarbon plays: (1) Jodhpur and (2) overlying Bilara/Hanseran Evaporite Group (HEG) were envisaged. Both the plays depicted distinctive seismic characteristics, structural alignment and distribution of reservoir, source and seal. Fluvio-deltaic sandstone within Jodhpur group and shallow marine fractured dolomites within Bilara/HEG showed potential reservoir characteristics whereas organic rich laminated dolomites, stromatolites and argillaceous litho-units within Bilara/HEG group have been predicted as prospective source. The Halite layers within HEG group were considered as effective regional seals. Fault bounded anticlinal structures associated with Cambrian compression have been identified as the main entrapment for hydrocarbon accumulation. The basin witnessed long tectonostratigraphic history with two major compressional phases Structures formed by Cambrian compression are likely to be charged as the time of source maturity and peak expulsion was later, during early Mesozoic period. Overall, the study indicates new opportunities and potential accumulation of hydrocarbon in the unexplored part of the basin."
"Oligosarcomas, IDH-mutant are distinct and aggressive","Oligodendrogliomas are defined at the molecular level by the presence of an IDH mutation and codeletion of chromosomal arms 1p and 19q. In the past, case reports and small studies described gliomas with sarcomatous features arising from oligodendrogliomas, so called oligosarcomas. Here, we report a series of 24 IDH-mutant oligosarcomas from 23 patients forming a distinct methylation class. The tumors were recurrences from prior oligodendrogliomas or developed de novo. Precursor tumors of 12 oligosarcomas were histologically and molecularly indistinguishable from conventional oligodendrogliomas. Oligosarcoma tumor cells were embedded in a dense network of reticulin fibers, frequently showing p53 accumulation, positivity for SMA and CALD1, loss of OLIG2 and gain of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) as compared to primary lesions. In 5 oligosarcomas no 1p/19q codeletion was detectable, although it was present in the primary lesions. Copy number neutral LOH was determined as underlying mechanism. Oligosarcomas harbored an increased chromosomal copy number variation load with frequent CDKN2A/B deletions. Proteomic profiling demonstrated oligosarcomas to be highly distinct from conventional CNS WHO grade 3 oligodendrogliomas with consistent evidence for a smooth muscle differentiation. Expression of several tumor suppressors was reduced with NF1 being lost frequently. In contrast, oncogenic YAP1 was aberrantly overexpressed in oligosarcomas. Panel sequencing revealed mutations in NF1 and TP53 along with IDH1/2 and TERT promoter mutations. Survival of patients was significantly poorer for oligosarcomas as first recurrence than for grade 3 oligodendrogliomas as first recurrence. These results establish oligosarcomas as a distinct group of IDH-mutant gliomas differing from conventional oligodendrogliomas on the histologic, epigenetic, proteomic, molecular and clinical level. The diagnosis can be based on the combined presence of (a) sarcomatous histology, (b) IDH-mutation and (c) TERT promoter mutation and/or 1p/19q codeletion, or, in unresolved cases, on its characteristic DNA methylation profile."
"The ambivalence of slum politics in reactionary times in Recife, Brazil","In this paper, we draw on the distinction between a “politics of negotiation” and a “politics of refusal” in order to highlight the ambivalence of “slum politics” in Recife, Brazil. Slum politics can be a radical politics of collective solidarity as was the case during the military dictatorship when a popular movement rooted in land occupations initiated the institutionalization of an internationally lauded participatory slum governance system. However, as our case shows, slum politics also has an opportunistic and reactionary side when community leaders seek individual advantage from their position as brokers between fellow slum dwellers and political patrons. We conclude that for slum dwellers, a good way for dealing with the internal contradictions of slum politics is engaging in a “politics of refusal” based on memories of destitution, eviction, and struggle, as an alternative to the “politics of negotiation” proposed by reformist political forces and social movements."
Prevalence of lactose intolerance and malabsorption among children of two ethnic groups from the urban areas of Malaysia and its relation to calcium intake and bone health status,"Lactase insufficiency could develop into lactose intolerance (LI) and disrupt the intake of calcium, which is a core nutrient for bone development in children. However, data regarding the prevalence of LI and bone health status (BHS) among Malaysian children are scarcely reported."
Mössbauer study of some novel iron-bis-glyoxime and iron-tris-glyoxime complexes,"Dioximes as ligands are used as analytical reagents and serve as models for biological systems as well as catalysts in chemical processes. A number of novel mixed complexes of the type [Fe(DioxH)2(amine)2] have been prepared and characterised by FTIR, 57Fe Mössbauer and mass spectroscopy by us. We have found strong Fe–N donor acceptor interactions and iron occurred in low-spin FeII state in all complexes. Later, we have also found that the incorporation of branching alkyl chains (isopropyl) in the complexes alters the Fe–N bond length and results in high-spin iron(II) state [1, 2]. The question arises: can the spin state of iron be manipulated generally by replacing the short alkyl chains with high volume demand ones in Fe-azomethine-amine complexes? To answer the question we have synthetized novel iron-bis-glioxime and iron-tris-gloxime complexes when long chain alkyl or aromatic ligands replaced the short alkyl ones and studied by 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, MS, FTIR, UV-VIS, TG-DTA-DTG and XRD methods. Novel iron-bis-glyoxime and iron-tris-glyoxime type complexes, [Fe(Diethyl-Diox)3(BOH)2], [Fe(Diethyl-Diox)3(BOEt)2] and [Fe(phenyl-Me-Diox)3(BOEt)2], were synthesized similarly as described in [2]. The FTIR, UV-VIS, TG-DTA-DTG and MS measurements indicated that the expected novel complexes could be successfully synthesized."

Breast cancer detection from histopathology images with deep inception and residual blocks,"The rapid growth of the network in deep learning, a subset of artificial intelligence has motivated the researchers to develop the tools for medical imaging analysis. Here we have introduced computer aided diagnosis tools for binary class classification and detection for breast cancer on histopathological images. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid deep neural network for image level cancer detection in cancerous and non-cancerous category of histopathology images. The hybrid deep neural network comprises of inception and residual block. The network incorporates the advance multilevel feature map for histopathological images and involve the advantages of inception and residual block. The model proposed combines the sturdiness of inception block and residual block and shows the stability in performance against the existing start-of the art algorithms. The proposed method is trained and validated on two publicly available dataset i.e., Breast Histopathology Images (BHI) and BreakHis. The image level classification has been performed at different magnification level in case of BreakHis dataset. The experimental outcome is evaluated on different performance measures and compared with the conventional Inception model and ResNet model as well as state-of-art breast cancer detection techniques. The proposed approach shows the training accuracy of 0.9642 for Breakhis and 0.8017 for BHI dataset. The model proposed outperforms the existing cancer detection algorithms as well as conventional deep neural networks with obtained accuracy of 0.8521 for BHI and 0.8080,0.8276,0.8655and 0.8580 for 40X,100X,200X and 400X respectively for BreakHis dataset."

Rigid impacts of three-dimensional rocking structures,"Studies of rocking motion aim to explain the remarkable earthquake resistance of rocking structures. State-of-the-art assessment methods are mostly based on planar models, despite ongoing efforts to understand the significance of three-dimensionality. Impacts are essential components of rocking motion. We present experimental measurements of free-rocking blocks on a rigid surface, focusing on extreme sensitivity of impacts to geometric imperfections, unpredictability, and the emergence of three-dimensional motion via spontaneous symmetry breaking. These results inspire the development of new impact models of three-dimensional facet and edge impacts of polyhedral objects. Our model is a natural generalization of existing planar models based on the seminal work of George W. Housner. Model parameters are estimated empirically for rectangular blocks. Finally, new perspectives in earthquake assessment of rocking structures are discussed."
Financial regulation in the age of the platform economy,"Platform businesses allow for collaboration with nontraditional partners and bring together different categories of customers, in the financial context savers and investors or lenders and borrowers, creating large, scalable networks of users. Their entry into finance promises potential benefits to consumers in the form of new products, lower prices, wider choice, and enhanced consumer experience. At the same time, their new business models and technologies potentially threaten the dominant position of traditional financial services providers and create challenges for regulators. Platform businesses can use their preferential access to customer data to skim off high-quality loans, leaving only low-quality customers for other lenders. Their ability to offer complementary nonfinancial services that cannot be supplied by FinTech start-ups and banks can make it difficult or unattractive for customers to switch to alternative providers. This danger is especially acute when BigTech firms have monopoly power in other markets that complement financial services."
Nonassociative black ellipsoids distorted by R-fluxes and four dimensional thin locally anisotropic accretion disks,"We construct nonassociative quasi-stationary solutions describing deformations of Schwarzschild black holes, BHs, to ellipsoid configurations, which can be black ellipsoids, BEs, and/or BHs with ellipsoidal accretion disks. Such solutions are defined by generic off-diagonal symmetric metrics and nonsymmetric components of metrics (which are zero on base four dimensional, 4-d, Lorentz manifold spacetimes but nontrivial in respective 8-d total (co) tangent bundles). Distorted nonassociative BH and BE solutions are found for effective real sources with terms proportional to \(\hbar \kappa \) (for respective Planck and string constants). These sources and related effective nontrivial cosmological constants are determined by nonlinear symmetries and deformations of the Ricci tensor by nonholonomic star products encoding R-flux contributions from string theory. To generate various classes of (non) associative /commutative distorted solutions we generalize and apply the anholonomic frame and connection deformation method for constructing exact and parametric solutions in modified gravity and/or general relativity theories. We study properties of locally anisotropic relativistic, optically thick, could and thin accretion disks around nonassociative distorted BHs, or BEs, when the effects due to the rotation are negligible. Such configurations describe angular anisotropic deformations of axially symmetric astrophysical models when the nonassociative distortions are related to the outer parts of the accretion disks."
Gradient flow and holography from a local Wilsonian cutoff,"We consider the vacuum partition function of a 4d scalar QFT in a curved background as function of bare marginal and relevant couplings. A local UV cutoff \(\Lambda (x)\) transforming under Weyl rescalings allows to construct Weyl invariant kinetic terms including Wilsonian cutoff functions. The local cutoff can be absorbed completely by a rescaling of the metric and the bare couplings. The vacuum partition function satisfies consistency conditions which follow from the Abelian nature of local redefinitions of the cutoff, and which differ from Weyl rescalings. These imply a gradient flow for beta functions describing the cutoff dependence of rescaled bare couplings. The consistency conditions allow to satisfy all but one Hamiltonian constraints required for a holographic description of the flow of bare couplings with the cutoff."
Gravitational waves from preheating in Gauss–Bonnet inflation,"We study gravitational wave production in an expanding Universe during the first stages following inflation, and investigate the consequences of the Gauss–Bonnet term on the inflationary parameters for a power-law inflation model with a GB coupling term. Moreover, we perform the analyses on the preheating parameters involving the number of e-folds \(N_{pre}\), and the temperature of thermalization \(T_{th},\) and show that it’s sensitive to the parameters n, and \(\gamma \), the parameter \(\gamma \) is proposed to connect the density energy at the end of inflation to the preheating energy density. We set a correlation of gravitational wave energy density spectrum with the spectral index \(n_{s}\) detected by the cosmic microwave background experiments. The density spectrum \(\varOmega _{gw}\) shows good consistency with observation for \(\gamma =\) \(10^{3}\) and \(10^{6}\). Our findings suggest that the generation of gravitational waves (GWs) during preheating can satisfy the constraints from Planck’s data."
Study of the Sensitivity of Porous SnO2-Based Thick-Film Elements to the Hydrogen Concentration in Air,"Semiconductor gas sensors based on metal oxides are sensitive and fast with low power consumption. The specific features of the manufacturing technology of such transducers make it possible to reduce their overall dimensions and, thus, open up considerable opportunity for integrating them into portable devices. In the production of semiconductor gas sensors, an important stage is the formation of a metal-oxide sensitive layer, and specifically, the process of combining a highly porous metal-oxide layer with integrated structures. In this paper, the results of studies of the experimental samples of gas-composition transducers with a porous gas-sensitive layer are reported. The gas-sensitive layer is formed by inkjet microprinting of a SnO2-based suspension with subsequent annealing. The sensitivities of the experimental samples of gas-composition transducers with gas-sensitive layers formed from two types of the initial suspension, and specifically, from a suspension based on pure SnO2 and on SnO2 doped with Cr and Nb, are compared. The dependence of variations in the conductivity of an experimental sample of the integrated gas-composition transducer on the H2 concentration in air is obtained. It is established that the gas-sensitive layer based on SnO2 with Cr and Nb additives exhibits a higher sensitivity to variations in the gas concentration to be detected, which is due to the larger specific surface area and less efficient agglomeration of particles."
Effect of Fullerene Encapsulation on Optical and Thermoelectrical Properties of Carbon Nanotubes,"Hybrid systems based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and fullerenes are promising for applications in nanoelectronics. Under small variations in the CNT diameter, the geometric characteristics of fullerenes change. Fullerenes regularly arranged inside a CNT present a set of quantum dots in a one-dimensional superlattice. By varying the fullerene concentration inside the nanotube and the fullerene types, it is possible to modulate the band structure of the CNT–fullerene system and control its electron and phonon characteristics. In this study, the optical and thermoelectric properties of properties of CNTs with encapsulated C60 fullerene molecules are investigated. By the first-principles calculations, the absorption coefficients, optical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and thermoelectric quality factor are determined for a metal CNT with the fullerenes periodically arranged inside CNT at different distances from each other. It is established that, as the spacing between fullerenes is decreased, the optical conductivity of the CNT–C60 system at high frequencies is suppressed. It is shown that the conductance of the structures with fullerenes is lower than the conductance of pure CNT and approximately the same for the spacing between fullerenes 12.3 and 19.7 Å. It is found that, due to the encapsulation of fullerenes, the thermal conductivity of the CNT becomes substantially lower (by a factor of three or four) for the CNT(8,8)–C60 system."
Spin Valves in Microelectronics (A Review),"Layered spin-valve structures are basic elements of micromagnetic devices. Small dimensions, CMOS compatibility, good scalability, and a diversity of operation conditions make spin-valve structures a universal component of modern microelectronics. The aim of this review is to analyze, systematize, and generalize the fundamentals of the operation, experimental data, and application of spin valves. Hard disk drives, magnetoresistive random access memory, spin-transfer nano-oscillators, magnetic biosensors, and various computing systems operating on the basis of stochastic and deterministic logic are reviewed. The key theoretical studies on the giant magnetoresistance and spin transport are considered. Data on different types of hard disk reading heads are systematized and their architecture and parameters are compared. It is shown how modern investigations of nanomagnetic phenomena accelerates the recording density growth. The state of research on the magnetoresistive random access memory is analyzed. The issues of energy efficiency and enhancement of the degree of integration in these devices are discussed. The latest progress in the materials, geometry, and properties of spin-transfer nano-oscillators and the problems and prospects of this technology are considered. The theoretical and experimental studies are analyzed in which the spin-valve structures perform Boolean and non-Boolean logic operations. It is demonstrated how the stochastic nature of the unstable switching of spin valves is used in nonconventional computing systems, specifically, the neuromorphic or Bayesian networks. The principles of operation of spin valves as magnetic biosensors and the advantages of their application are discussed."
Analysis of the Gas Phase Epitaxy of Silicon Carbide as a Basic Process for the Technology of Power Electronics,"Currently, chemical gas deposition is the main method for producing high-quality and reproducible epitaxial layers for commercial silicon carbide (SiC) power devices. Based on the experience of the Electrotechnical University LETI in the synthesis of single-crystalline SiC, an analysis of the current state of silicon carbide gas phase epitaxy (CVD) technology is carried out. It is shown that modern CVD reactors allow growth processes of high-quality SiC epitaxial structures with the following parameters: substrate diameter of up to 200 mm; epitaxial layer thicknesses of 0.1 to 250 μm; and n- and p-type layers with doping levels in the ranges 1014–1019 cm–3 and 1014–1020 cm–3, respectively. At the same time, setting up the technology of the reproducible high-quality growth of epitaxial layers is an individual task for a particular type of reactor. A detailed consideration of the technological factors presented in this paper is required, which in the end determine the achievable parameters of SiC-epitaxial products."
Normally-Off p-Gate Transistor Based on AlGaN/GaN Heterostructures,"Conventional AlGaN/GaN transistors are depletion-mode devices. For most applications, the E-mode, where the channel current is zero at the zero gate voltage, should be implemented. The feasibility of the E-mode opens prospects for designing digital circuits and power devices. A new method for fabricating normally-off E-mode transistors, i.e., the use of p-GaAs layer under the gate, is considered. As a method for forming this layer, plasma-chemical removal of the p-GaN layer outside the gate is chosen. This gives rise to problems of an inhomogeneous etching depth and poor control of the etch rate. The heterostructure with an additional AlN barrier layer which is an etch stop layer is developed. The results of the study of the effect of various heterostructure parameters on the carrier concentration in the channel, and hence, on the transistor’s output characteristics, and the design process is developed. According to the latter, samples of normally-off transistors are fabricated, in which the maximum drain current in the on-state is 350 mA/mm at a gate voltage of 4 V, and the breakdown voltage is ~550 V in the off state at a gate voltage of 0 V."
Prediction of the Effective Permittivity of Foam Polymer Materials,"Porous plastics are used in various fields of industry, including radio- and electrotechnical fields. They are characterized by good heat- and sound proofing, dielectric and mechanical properties, and resistance to various external factors during operation. The problem of predicting the effective permittivity of foam-polymer materials with a large volume fraction of pores, in particular, polyepoxide foam materials, are considered. Two methods for solving it, both based on the matrix composite model are proposed. In the first method, the matrix is considered as a polyepoxide binder, and cavities filled with gas are taken as inclusions. In the second method, polyepoxide walls separating cavities are taken as inclusions, and gas filling cavities are considered as a matrix. To obtain the calculation formulas, the generalized singular approximation of the random field theory is used in both cases. Based on the derived expressions, model calculations of the effective permittivity are performed for macroscopically isotropic foam plastic with polymer binder based on ED-20 and cavities filled with freon, depending on the apparent material density. The calculations in the generalized singular approximations are performed for the case where the matrix is considered as the reference medium and using the self-consistent method. In the calculations using the second approach, two shapes of material cells are considered, i.e., weakly leaked and heavily leaked polyhedron. The dependences calculated by all methods show qualitative agreement with the experimental data."
Investigation of the Dynamic Range of Silicon Photomultiplier Tubes,"For detecting low-intensity optical radiation, multielement avalanche photodetectors, which are called silicon photomultiplier tubes, are increasingly used. However, not all characteristics of these photodetectors have been studied in detail; for example, there is no information on the effect of the supply voltage on the dynamic range. For studying the dynamic range, prototypes of silicon photoelectronic multipliers with a p+–p–n+ structure produced by OAO Integral (Belarus), as well as commercially available photomultipliers Ketek PM 3325 and ON Semi FC 30035, are used as the objects of investigation. It is found that an increase in the supply voltage leads to a decrease in the critical and threshold intensities. It is shown that the dependence of the dynamic range on the supply voltage has a peak. In photodetectors based on silicon photomultiplier tubes, for providing the peak dynamic range of detection, it is necessary to select the photodetector supply voltages corresponding to this peak. The results obtained can find application in developing and designing the devices and optical-radiation detectors based on silicon photomultiplier tubes."
Studies of dynamical behaviours of an imprecise predator-prey model with Holling type II functional response under interval uncertainty,"Our goal in this paper is to examine an imprecise predator-prey model in an interval environment. The present imprecise model is constructed, in part, by modifications to the Lotka–Volterra model with appropriate biology parameters taken as intervals. The Holling type II functional response is considered instead of the Holling Type I functional response, along with the predators’ interaction with themselves. Using a linear parametric representation of the interval, we can represent the imprecise model in a parametric form precisely. Next, we analyse the mathematical properties of the proposed model, like finding equilibrium with various stability conditions and investigating several bifurcations of the system. The justifications of all analytical results for our system are illustrated numerically with the interval-valued data of parameters, and the simulated results are express graphically. Finally, we conclude our work with suggestions and analyse the biological significance of our findings through numerical evaluations."
On the quantum origin of potentials,"The dynamics of a quantum particle is governed by its wavefunction, which in turn is determined by the classical potential to which it is subjected. However the wavefunction itself induces a quantum potential, the particle ‘sees’ the sum of the classical and quantum potentials, and there is no way to separate the two. Therefore in principle, part or whole of an observed potential may be attributable to a quantum potential. We examine this possibility and discuss implications."
Insights into lactic acid bacteria cryoresistance using FTIR microspectroscopy,"Freezing is widely used for bacterial cell preservation. However, resistance to freezing can greatly vary depending on bacterial species or growth conditions. Our study aims at identifying cellular markers of cryoresistance based on the comparison of three lactic acid bacteria (LAB) exhibiting different tolerance to freezing: Carnobacterium maltaromaticum CNCM I-3298, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CFL1. A thorough characterization of their cytoplasmic membrane properties was carried out by measuring their fatty acid composition, membrane fluidity, and lipid phase transition upon cooling from 50 to −50 °C. Vitrification temperatures of the intra- and extra-cellular compartments were also quantified by differential scanning calorimetry. Additionally, the cell biochemical characterization was carried out using a recently developed Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) micro-spectroscopic approach allowing the analysis of live bacteria in an aqueous environment. The multivariate analysis of the FTIR spectra of fresh and thawed cells enabled the discrimination of the three bacteria according to their lipid, protein, and cell wall peptidoglycan components. It also revealed freezing-induced modifications of these three cellular components and an increase in bacteria heterogeneity for the two strains of L. bulgaricus, the freeze-sensitive bacteria. No cellular damage was observed for C. maltaromaticum, the freeze-resistant bacteria. Comparison of the results obtained from the different analytical methods confirmed previously reported cryoresistance markers and suggested new ones, such as changes in the absorbance of specific infrared spectral bands. FTIR microspectroscopy could be used as a rapid and non-invasive technique to evaluate the freeze-sensitivity of LAB."
Colorimetric determination of Listeria monocytogenes using aptamer and urease dual-labeled magnetic nanoparticles and cucurbit[7]uril-mediated supramolecular assembly of gold nanoparticle,"A host–guest colorimetric strategy is described for the detection of Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes). The optical probes were self-assembled based on the supramolecular interactions between the carbonyl groups of cucurbit[7]uril portals and gold nanoparticles (CB[7]-AuNPs). Aptamer and urease modified magnetic nanoparticles were used to specifically recognize and binding to L. monocytogenes, simultaneously hydrolyzing urea to produce ammonium ion (NH4+) that can reverse CB[7] induced AuNPs aggregation. In the presence of L. monocytogenes, the above-mentioned magnetic conjugates preferentially bind to the bacterial surface, which results in blocking the catalytic active sites, thus inhibiting the production of ammonium ions. The normalized absorbance ratio of A700 nm/A525 nm was proportional to the L. monocytogenes concentration ranging from 10 to 106 cfu·mL−1, and the visual determination can be done down to 10 cfu·mL−1.  For spiked food samples  analyzed without pre-enrichment, recoveries of 98.4% to 99.3% were achieved could be verified and RSD were less than 10%. This work may offer a broad prospect for sensitive and specific determination  of pathogens."
Corrosive-coordinate engineering to construct 2D-3D nanostructure with trace Pt as efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting,"The development of efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with excellent catalytic performance and stability plays key roles in the commercialization of water splitting to generate hydrogen energy. Herein, a 2D-3D nanostructure composed of metal hydroxides and Prussian blue analogus (PBA) was in-situ decorated onto the NiFe foam (Pt-NiFe PBA) through a facile and scalable corrosive-coordinate approach. The specifically designed morphology favored the provision of abundant active sites, optimized the reaction pathway, and accelerated mass transport during the electrocatalytic process. Consequently, the as-synthesized Pt-NiFe PBA reached 10 mA cm−2 with small overpotentials of 29 and 210 mV in 1 mol L−1 KOH deionized water for HER and OER, respectively. Remarkably, Pt-NiFe PBA required an overpotential of 21 mV to drive 10 mA cm−2 in seawater containing 1 mol L−1 KOH with prominent durability. Moreover, with the as-synthesized Pt-NiFe PBA as bifunctional electrocatalyst, the Pt-NiFe PBA∥Pt-NiFe PBA electrolyzer needed 1.46 and 1.48 V to drive 10 mA cm−2 in 1 mol L−1 KOH with deionized water and 1 mol L−1 KOH with seawater, respectively. Remarkably, sustainable energies were utilized to power the overall water splitting and stored as easily portable hydrogen energy."
Impact pressure distribution of an SC-CO2 jet used in rock breakage,"The impact pressure distribution of an SC-CO2 jet was studied to determine its mechanism of action. The generation and development of an impact jet were numerically simulated using Fluent, and the effects of the nozzle structure and stand-off distance on the impact jet were studied via I-Scan. It was concluded that the impact pressure of the stagnation region was shaped like a pyramid, and this pressure of the wall jet was wave-like. The impact pressure of the stagnation region was higher, compared with that of the wall jet region. Taking the impact pressure at a stand-off distance of 12 mm as an example, when the pressure ratio was 0.85, the maximum impact pressure in the stagnation region was 41.64 MPa, which is 2.1 times the maximum impact pressure in the other region. The pressure ratio and the stand-off distance significantly affect the impact pressure distribution. When the nozzle pressure ratio increases, the pressure in the stagnation zone will also increase. However, when the stand-off distance was long (> 55 mm), the pressure ratio rarely affected the impact pressure distribution, when a certain distance is reached, the pressure ratio does not even have an impact on the impact pressure distribution. Both the impact pressure decreased with an increase in the stand-off distance."
Decoupled evolution of mating biology and social structure in Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants,"Insect societies vary greatly in their social structure, mating biology, and life history. Polygyny, the presence of multiple reproductive queens in a single colony, and polyandry, multiple mating by females, both increase the genetic variability in colonies of eusocial organisms, resulting in potential reproductive conflicts. The co-occurrence of polygyny and polyandry in a single species is rarely observed across eusocial insects, and these traits have been found to be negatively correlated in ants. Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants are well-suited for investigating the evolution of complex mating strategies because both polygyny and polyandry co-occur in this genus. We used microsatellite markers and parentage inference in five South American Acromyrmex species to study how different selective pressures influence the evolution of polygyny and polyandry. We show that Acromyrmex species exhibit independent variation in mating biology and social structure, and polygyny and polyandry are not necessarily negatively correlated within genera. One species, Acromyrmex lobicornis, displays a significantly lower mating frequency compared to others, while another species, A. lundii, appears to have reverted to obligate monogyny. These variations appear to have a small impact on average intra-colonial relatedness, although the biological significance of such a small effect size is unclear. All species show significant reproductive skew between patrilines, but there was no significant difference in reproductive skew between any of the sampled species. We find that the evolution of social structure and mating biology appear to follow independent evolutionary trajectories in different species. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary implications that mating biology and social structure have on life history evolution in Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants."

"Statistical modeling of methylene blue degradation by yeast-bacteria consortium; optimization via agro-industrial waste, immobilization and application in real effluents","The progress in industrialization everyday life has led to the continuous entry of several anthropogenic compounds, including dyes, into surrounding ecosystem causing arduous concerns for human health and biosphere. Therefore, microbial degradation of dyes is considered an eco-efficient and cost-competitive alternative to physicochemical approaches. These degradative biosystems mainly depend on the utilization of nutritive co-substrates such as yeast extract peptone in conjunction with glucose. Herein, a synergestic interaction between strains of mixed-culture consortium consisting of Rhodotorula sp., Raoultella planticola; and Staphylococcus xylosus was recruited in methylene blue (MB) degradation using agro-industrial waste as an economic and nutritive co-substrate. Via statistical means such as Plackett–Burman design and central composite design, the impact of significant nutritional parameters on MB degradation was screened and optimized. Predictive modeling denoted that complete degradation of MB was achieved within 72 h at MB (200 mg/L), NaNO3 (0.525 gm/L), molasses (385 μL/L), pH (7.5) and inoculum size (18%). Assessment of degradative enzymes revealed that intracellular NADH-reductase and DCIP-reductase were key enzymes controlling degradation process by 104.52 ± 1.75 and 274.04 ± 3.37 IU/min/mg protein after 72 h of incubation. In addition, azoreductase, tyrosinase, laccase, nitrate reductase, MnP and LiP also contributed significantly to MB degradation process. Physicochemical monitoring analysis, namely UV−Visible spectrophotometry and FTIR of MB before treatment and degradation byproducts indicated deterioration of azo bond and demethylation. Moreover, the non-toxic nature of degradation byproducts was confirmed by phytotoxicity and cytotoxicity assays. Chlorella vulgaris retained its photosynthetic capability (˃ 85%) as estimated from Chlorophyll-a/b contents compared to ˃ 30% of MB-solution. However, the viability of Wi-38 and Vero cells was estimated to be 90.67% and 99.67%, respectively, upon exposure to MB-metabolites. Furthermore, an eminent employment of consortium either freely-suspended or immobilized in plain distilled water and optimized slurry in a bioaugmentation process was implemented to treat MB in artificially-contaminated municipal wastewater and industrial effluent. The results showed a corporative interaction between the consortium examined and co-existing microbiota; reflecting its compatibility and adaptability with different microbial niches in different effluents with various physicochemical contents."
"Various forms of the periodic table including the left-step table,  the regularization of atomic number triads and first-member anomalies","The relative virtues of 8- and 18-column periodic tables are discussed, followed by a brief mention of a 32-column table. Next, the left-step periodic table, as first introduced by Janet, is presented, as are the various attractive features of this representation. The advantages include what is termed here as the regularization of atomic number triads and a better rationalization of first-member anomalies. The distinction between simple substance and element is also explained as is the significance of this issue to the left-step table. Finally, I respond to some recent criticisms of previous work that I have published on atomic number triads of elements. It is becoming increasingly acknowledged that the discovery of the periodic table took place at the hands of at least six individuals working independently in different parts of the world (Scerri, A Tale of Seven Scientists, Oxford University Press, New York, 2016). In the intervening 150 or so years since the most well known of these tables were published, by Dmitri Mendeleev, at least 1000 periodic systems have appeared either in print form (Van Spronsen, The Periodic System of Chemical Elements. A History of the First Hundred Years, Elsevier, New York, 1969; Mazurs, Graphic Representations of the Periodic System during One Hundred Years, University Alabama Press, Alabama, 1974) or more recently on the Internet (Leach, https://www.meta-synthesis.com/webbook/35_pt/pt_database.php)."
Numerical nonlinear modeling and simulations of high strength reinforced concrete beams using ANSYS,"This study presents a comprehensive nonlinear material modeling and simulation approach of high-strength concrete (HSC) beams using the versatile finite element (FE) analysis tool ANSYS. Three reinforced concrete (RC) beams of 102 MPa strength, comprising three various percentages of tension steel reinforcement are numerically modeled and validated against the experimentally tested beams available in the literature. The interface bond-slip mechanism between the concrete and steel reinforcements along with the tension stiffening effects between the cracks is deliberately considered in the developed FE model. The mesh-sensitivity study is implemented to determine the ideal element density which influences the nonlinear solution. The load–deflection plots predicted from FEA are corroborated with the experimental curves and the FE models can able to predict closer response with the experimental curves throughout the loading history with sufficient accuracy. Subsequently, theoretical analysis based on ACI 318-19 code is executed to verify the cracking, yielding, and ultimate moments of experimental and numerical models. The ultimate loads and deflections predicted through the FE model show a maximum discrepancy of − 11.15% and − 3.06%, respectively as compared to the experimental results. The yield and ultimate loads achieved based on the ACI code exhibit a closer prediction with the experimental data as compared to the numerical analysis. The graphical contour diagrams of the FE models provide complete and worthy information throughout the beam length. The developed FE model is a valid and reliable tool to analyze the flexural nonlinear response of high-strength RC beams and can be further utilized to explore various parametric studies."

Paradoxical sex-specific patterns of autoantibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Pronounced sex differences in the susceptibility and response to SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence has highlighted the potential importance of autoimmune activation in modulating the acute response and recovery trajectories following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Given that immune-inflammatory activity can be sex-biased in the setting of severe COVID-19 illness, the aim of the study was to examine sex-specific autoimmune reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of extreme clinical disease."
Fatigue and recovery have different effects on knee biomechanics of drop vertical jump between female collegiate and recreational athletes,"Although fatigue is known as one of the risk factors for noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury, the effects of fatigue and recovery can be different based on the level of competition. However, it is unknown whether female recreational athletes are susceptible to fatigue or not, compared to female collegiate athletes with greater physical activity. The purpose of the present study was to examine and clarify the effects of fatigue and recovery on knee biomechanics of the drop vertical jump (DVJ) in female recreational athletes compared to female collegiate athletes."

Pancreatoblastomas and mixed and pure acinar cell carcinomas share epigenetic signatures distinct from other neoplasms of the pancreas,"Pancreatic neoplasms are heterogenous and have traditionally been classified by assessing their lines of cellular differentiation using histopathologic methods, particularly morphologic and immunohistochemical evaluation. These methods frequently identify overlapping differentiation along ductal, acinar, and neuroendocrine lines, raising diagnostic challenges as well as questions regarding the relationship of these neoplasms. Neoplasms with acinar differentiation, in particular, frequently show more than one line of differentiation based on immunolabeling. Genome methylation signatures, in contrast, are better conserved within cellular lineages, and are increasingly used to support the classification of neoplasms. We characterized the epigenetic relationships between pancreatoblastomas, acinar cell carcinomas (including mixed variants), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, solid pseudopapillary neoplasms, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas using a genome-wide array platform. Using unsupervised learning approaches, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, solid pseudopapillary neoplasms, ductal adenocarcinomas, and normal pancreatic tissue samples all localized to distinct clusters based on their methylation profiles, whereas all neoplasms with acinar differentiation occupied a broad overlapping region located between the predominantly acinar normal pancreatic tissue and ductal adenocarcinoma clusters. Our data provide evidence to suggest that acinar cell carcinomas and pancreatoblastomas are similar at the epigenetic level. These findings are consistent with genomic and clinical observations that mixed acinar neoplasms are closely related to pure acinar cell carcinomas rather than to neuroendocrine tumors or ductal adenocarcinomas."
"A catalogue of 1,167 genomes from the human gut archaeome","The human gut microbiome plays an important role in health, but its archaeal diversity remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we report the analysis of 1,167 nonredundant archaeal genomes (608 high-quality genomes) recovered from human gastrointestinal tract, sampled across 24 countries and rural and urban populations. We identified previously undescribed taxa including 3 genera, 15 species and 52 strains. Based on distinct genomic features, we justify the split of the Methanobrevibacter smithii clade into two separate species, with one represented by the previously undescribed ‘Candidatus Methanobrevibacter intestini’. Patterns derived from 28,581 protein clusters showed significant associations with sociodemographic characteristics such as age groups and lifestyle. We additionally show that archaea are characterized by specific genomic and functional adaptations to the host and carry a complex virome. Our work expands our current understanding of the human archaeome and provides a large genome catalogue for future analyses to decipher its impact on human physiology."
Density of type-dependent sets in Krull monoids with analytic structure,"We describe structural and quantitative properties of type-dependent sets in monoids with suitable analytic structure, including simple analytic monoids, introduced by Kaczorowski (Semigroup Forum 94:532–555, 2017. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00233-016-9778-9), and formations, as defined by Geroldinger and Halter-Koch (Non-unique factorizations, Chapman and Hall, Boca Raton, 2006. https://doi.org/10.1201/9781420003208). We propose the notions of rank and degree to measure the size of a type-dependent set in structural terms. We also consider various notions of regularity of type-dependent sets, related to the analytic properties of their zeta functions, and obtain results on the counting functions of these sets."
"Application of a portable near-infrared spectrometer for rapid, non-destructive evaluation of moisture content in Para rubber timber","Predictive models of the moisture content of Para rubber timber were developed and validated using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. A portable NIR spectrometer connected to a smartphone was developed to facilitate real-time moisture content determination of Para rubber timber. An android application was created to control the NIR spectrometer in acquiring, displaying, and processing the spectral data on the smartphone. Three predictive models for determining the moisture content of Para rubber timber were developed using partial least squares regression in the range 0–89% on a dry basis (%db), < 30% db, and > 30% db. The predictive model for moisture content in the range 0–89%db had a correlation coefficient of cross validation (Rcv) of 0.98 and a root-mean-square error of cross validation (RMSECV) of 5.48%. The predictive model for moisture content in the range less than 30%db had values for Rcv and RMSECV of 0.84 and 2.05% db, respectively. Lastly, the predictive model of moisture content in the range greater than 30% db had values for Rcv and RMSECV of 0.85 and 4.57% db, respectively. The performance of the predictive equation for determining the moisture content in Para rubber timber in the range less than 30% db was validated using unknown samples, which were not used in the model development, assigned as an external prediction set, which resulted in a root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 1.44% db. The portable NIR spectrometer connected to a smartphone through an android application is a suitable system for practical application in sawn timber factories because it is cheap and conveniently portable. In addition, the calibration model should be updated and more samples added to cover the variation in growing season and growth area for greater robustness and accuracy of the predictive models."
Optimizing molecules using efficient queries from property evaluations,"Machine learning-based methods have shown potential for optimizing existing molecules with more desirable properties, a critical step towards accelerating new chemical discovery. Here we propose QMO, a generic query-based molecule optimization framework that exploits latent embeddings from a molecule autoencoder. QMO improves the desired properties of an input molecule based on efficient queries, guided by a set of molecular property predictions and evaluation metrics. We show that QMO outperforms existing methods in the benchmark tasks of optimizing small organic molecules for drug-likeness and solubility under similarity constraints. We also demonstrate substantial property improvement using QMO on two new and challenging tasks that are also important in real-world discovery problems: (1) optimizing existing potential SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors towards higher binding affinity and (2) improving known antimicrobial peptides towards lower toxicity. Results from QMO show high consistency with external validations, suggesting an effective means to facilitate material optimization problems with design constraints."
"Rhizophagus proliferus genome sequence reiterates conservation of genetic traits in AM fungi, but predicts higher saprotrophic activity","Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are ubiquitous endosymbionts of terrestrial plants. It helps plants to extract more nutrients from the soil and enhances the plant tolerance to various ecological stress factors. The AM fungal genome sequence helps to identify the gene repertoires that are crucial for adaptation to different habitat and mechanisms for interaction with host plant. The present work comprises the first draft of the genome sequence of Rhizophagus proliferus, which is an important AM species present in biofertilizer consortia for agricultural purpose. The estimated genome size of R. proliferus is ~ 110 Mbps and its genomic assembly is 94.35% complete. Genome mining was carried out to identify putative gene families important for biological functions. A total of 22,526 protein-coding genes were estimated in the genome, with an abundance of kinases and reduced number of glycoside hydrolases as compared to other fungal classes. A striking finding in the R. proliferus genome was higher number of carbohydrate esterases (CE), which may suggest towards presence of higher saprotrophic activity in this species as compared to the previously reported AM fungi, which may indicate towards its role as a link between plants and soil mineral nutrients. The genome sequence and annotation of R. proliferus presented here would serve as an important reference for functional genomics studies required for developing biofertilizer formulations in future. In addition, the findings from this work may also prove important in deciphering molecular mechanisms in AM fungi that govern the host-specific interaction and associated agriculture benefits."
"Lower Callovian of Kanev Dislocations, Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine: Ammonites and Stratigraphy","The Jurassic rocks of the area of Kanev glacial dislocations (Central Ukraine) with the Bathonian coastal marine (lagoon) and the Lower Callovian normal marine sediments have been studied, the upper part of which was unknown to the predecessors. The zonal and infrazonal scale of the Lower Callovian of Kanev dislocations are elaborated by ammonites and include four zones, five subzones, and 14 biohorizons: Elatmae Zone (the upper part: P. elatmae and P. vasily biohorizons); Subpatruus Zone (the uppermost part: Ch. saratovensis (G. toricelli) Biohorizon); Koenigi Zone with the Gowerianum (G. metorchum and G. gowerianum biohorizons), Curtilobum (G. indigestum, G. curtilobum, and G. crucifer biohorizons), and Galilaeii (G. galilaeii, s.l. Biohorizon) subzones; Calloviense Zone with the Calloviense (S. khvalynicum and S. kiselevi biohorizons) and Enodatum (C. enodatum planicerclus, C. e. enodatum, and C. e. aeeta biohorizons) subzones. This scale is compared with those of European Russia and Western Europe. It is found that the base of the Proplanulites koenigi Zone, which was distinguished by Karitzky (1887) in the sections of the north Kanev dislocations, biostratigraphically corresponds to the base of the eponymous Zone, which was distinguished by Buckman (1913) in North Yorkshire and used in a standard scale of Europe. The ammonites of the families Cardioceratidae, Kosmoceratidae, Perisphinctidae, and Macrocephalitidae common in the Early Callovian in the East European marine basin are revised and their evolution and biogeography are analyzed. It is shown that, at the beginning of the Callovian, this vast young epicontinental basin was a “pot” of neoendemic evolution of various groups of ammonites, which migrated from Arctic, West European, and West Tethyan biochorems. The western (Dnieper–Donets) marine area of the basin, which also includes the area of Kanev dislocations, was a main way for migration of marine organisms between the West and East European paleobiogeographic provinces. New species are described: Paracadoceras vasily Gulyaev, sp. nov., Sigaloceras fundator Gulyaev, sp. nov., and S. kiselevi Gulyaev, sp. nov."
"Looking for Ephesian workshops: an integrated petrographic, geochemical, and chrono-typological approach to Late Hellenistic Ephesos lamps","In this pilot study, Late Hellenistic mold-made lamps from Ephesos are investigated by combining chrono-morphological and stylistic features with thin-section petrography and neutron activation analysis. Coeval wares of Ephesian production and clay samples collected around the site as well as published data from the Bonn database are considered local reference material. The results point to a network of local/regional workshops sharing facilities and/or a labor force dedicated to distinct tasks. The whole evidence is consistent with the very beginning of a nucleated workshop industry able to optimize the productivity of mold-made wares and fill the demand of an increased regional and supra-regional market. The typological and compositional variability of the latest phases could suggest a gradual transfer of potting activities towards areas providing better-suited clay sources."
Farmers’ perception of climate change and adaptation strategies: a study of the Lower Gangetic Plain in India,"In this study, an attempt has been made to assess the farmers’ perception of climate change over the last 30 years (1986 to 2015) and adaptation strategies in agriculture along with their determinants in Lower Gangetic Plain, India. A total of 528 households from nine villages have been surveyed in Maldah district located in the Lower Gangetic Plain of India. Spearman’s rho test (Lehmann and D’Abrera 1975; Sneyers 1990) has been used to detect the trends in annual and monthly maximum and minimum temperatures, average temperature and rainfall during the study period. Binary logistic regression model has been employed to assess the influence of farmers’ socio-economic conditions and farm characteristics on the decision to select appropriate adaptation strategies. The farmers in the study area have perceived an increase in annual and summer temperature and decrease in winter temperature during 1986 to 2015. Meanwhile, regarding rainfall variability they have perceived decreasing annual, rainy and dry season rainfall. The outcomes of binary logistic regression models portray that size of land holdings, farming experience, subsidiary income source, access to agricultural information and gross irrigated area to gross cropped area have most significant influence on selection of appropriate adaptation strategies of farmers. The study has recommended region specific policy development and implementation to enhance farmers’ adaptive capacity to mitigate climate change vulnerability."
The Deep Submerged Continental Crust: The Central Arctic and Zealandia in the Southwest Pacific,"A vast area of up to five million square kilometers is located in the Pacific Ocean to the east of Australia. The Earth’s crust up to 10–23 km thick is submerged here to a depth of 1–4 km. This contrasts with the surrounding Southwest Pacific where the crust is submerged up to 5–6 km and has a thickness of 7 km, which is more typical for oceans. As is known from dredging and deep-sea drilling, Zealandia is composed of the continental crust. For a long time, it was close to the sea level and then it subsided into the depths. The same thickness, water depths, and subsidence history are found for some domains in the Central Arctic, Lomonosov Ridge, Podvodnikov Basin, and Mendeleev Ridge. The continental nature of the crust has been proven here by drilling and is suggested by the results of study of the sea floor bedrock. Deep basins of the Central Arctic and Zealandia were formed without intense crustal stretching. Its origin can be explained by the increase in density of gabbroids in the lower crust due to prograde metamorphism."
Myocardial involvement in children with post-COVID multisystem inflammatory syndrome: a cardiovascular magnetic resonance based multicenter international study—the CARDOVID registry,"Recent evidence shows an association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and a severe inflammatory syndrome in children. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data about myocardial injury in children are limited to small cohorts. The aim of this multicenter, international registry is to describe clinical and cardiac characteristics of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 using CMR so as to better understand the real extent of myocardial damage in this vulnerable cohort."
Study of fluid–structure interaction with undulating flow using channel driven cavity flow system,"Fluid–structure interaction (FSI) induced by undulated flows was investigated using a channel driven cavity flow (CDCF) system. The bottom of the cavity section has a flexible plate made of either an aluminum alloy or carbon fiber composite, which interacts with flows in the cavity. Undulating flows were generated by controlling a series of solenoid valves programmed to interrupt the flow at various different frequencies from 0.5  to 1.25 Hz. Mean flow velocity was also varied for each given undulation frequency. The dynamic motion of the flexible test panel, made of aluminum alloy or carbon fiber composite, was measured for transverse deflections using laser displacement sensors. The study showed that the structural response was very dependent on the input flow. The plate vibrational modes had three to five dominant frequencies ranging from the undulated flow frequencies to about 5.0 Hz. Those frequencies were either at or very close to the multiples of the flow frequencies. The most dominant frequency was not always the same as the flow frequency, but it varied depending on the applied flow frequency."
An infant with 49XXXXY syndrome: a case report,"49XXXXY syndrome is the rarest X chromosome aneuploidy, with approximate incidence of 1:85,000–100,000 male births. Worldwide, around 100 cases have been reported. In this report, we describe one such case seen in Sri Lanka."
Development of Cotton-Based Compression Stockings for Class II Compression Requirements,"This work focuses on the development of class II medical compression stockings having improved tactile properties by the use of cotton components in their construction. Nine compression stockings having at least one cotton constituent yarn and three all nylon stockings as reference samples were produced. Irrespective of both the inlay elastane yarn count and ground yarn properties, the water vapor permeability of the compression stockings was mainly governed by the fiber types employed in the inlay yarns. The compression tests performed were promising since the pressure exerted by the compression stockings having cotton components covered the required pressure range."
Deep multimodal learning for municipal solid waste sorting,"Automated waste sorting can dramatically increase waste sorting efficiency and reduce its regulation cost. Most of the current methods only use a single modality such as image data or acoustic data for waste classification, which makes it difficult to classify mixed and confusable wastes. In these complex situations, using multiple modalities becomes necessary to achieve a high classification accuracy. Traditionally, the fusion of multiple modalities has been limited by fixed handcrafted features. In this study, the deep-learning approach was applied to the multimodal fusion at the feature level for municipal solid-waste sorting. More specifically, the pre-trained VGG16 and one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs) were utilized to extract features from visual data and acoustic data, respectively. These deeply learned features were then fused in the fully connected layers for classification. The results of comparative experiments proved that the proposed method was superior to the single-modality methods. Additionally, the feature-based fusion strategy performed better than the decision-based strategy with deeply learned features."
Ultrasensitive analysis of genetic instability related to chemical exposure,"Our concerns have been raised about whether prolonged exposure to ammunition-related chemicals could correlate with genomic instability predisposing to lung carcinogenesis. The group of professional soldiers engaged in routine ammunition analysis and its explosive properties testing. To assess the presence of an innate genetic profile, DNA isolated from swabs was analyzed with LungCarta and HS Lung Panels and MassARRAY Analyzer 4 mass spectrometry. The presence of new somatic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was detected with liquid biopsy technique and circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) isolation, which was further analyzed with UltraSeek Lung Panel. Both genetic profiles obtained for each individual were compared. Genetic analysis revealed that in professional soldiers with long-term exposure to ammunition-related toxic chemicals, new SNPs in genes related to lung carcinogenesis are present. The preliminary data indicate that using modern molecular techniques could be a valuable tool for monitoring the genome instability in context of occupational risk of harmful volatile toxic compounds and improving personnel safety. The analyzed group will be further enlarged, and follow-up studies will be continued."
Observation of magnetic droplets in magnetic tunnel junctions,"Magnetic droplets, a class of highly nonlinear magnetodynamic solitons, can be nucleated and stabilized in nanocontact spin-torque nano-oscillators. Here we experimentally demonstrate magnetic droplets in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). The droplet nucleation is accompanied by power enhancement compared with its ferromagnetic resonance modes. The nucleation and stabilization of droplets are ascribed to the double-CoFeB free-layer structure in the all-perpendicular MTJ, which provides a low Zhang-Li torque and a high pinning field. Our results enable better electrical sensitivity in fundamental studies of droplets and show that the droplets can be utilized in MTJ-based applications and materials science."
Long non-coding RNA-associated competing endogenous RNA axes in the olfactory epithelium in schizophrenia: a bioinformatics analysis,"The etiology of schizophrenia (SCZ), as a serious mental illness, is unknown. The significance of genetics in SCZ pathophysiology is yet unknown, and newly identified mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene transcription may be helpful in determining how these changes affect SCZ development and progression. In the current work, we used a bioinformatics approach to describe the role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-associated competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) in the olfactory epithelium (OE) samples in order to better understand the molecular regulatory processes implicated in SCZ disorders in living individuals. The Gene Expression Omnibus database was used to obtain the OE microarray dataset (GSE73129) from SCZ sufferers and control subjects, which contained information about both lncRNAs and mRNAs. The limma package of R software was used to identify the differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) and mRNAs (DEmRNAs). RNA interaction pairs were discovered using the Human MicroRNA Disease Database, DIANA-LncBase, and miRTarBase databases. In this study, the Pearson correlation coefficient was utilized to find positive correlations between DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs in the ceRNA network. Eventually, lncRNA-associated ceRNA axes were developed based on co-expression relations and DElncRNA-miRNA-DEmRNA interactions. This work found six potential DElncRNA-miRNA-DEmRNA loops in SCZ pathogenesis, including, SNTG2-AS1/hsa-miR-7-5p/SLC7A5, FLG-AS1/hsa-miR-34a-5p/FOSL1, LINC00960/hsa-miR-34a-5p/FOSL1, AQP4-AS1/hsa-miR-335-5p/FMN2, SOX2-OT/hsa-miR-24-3p/NOS3, and CASC2/hsa-miR-24-3p/NOS3. According to the findings, ceRNAs in OE might be promising research targets for studying SCZ molecular mechanisms. This could be a great opportunity to examine different aspects of neurodevelopment that may have been hampered early in SCZ patients."
XPS and structural studies of Fe3O4-PTMS-NAS@Cu as a novel magnetic natural asphalt base network and recoverable nanocatalyst for the synthesis of biaryl compounds,"In this research, natural asphalt as a mineral carbonuous material was converted to sodium natural asphalt sulfonate (Na-NAS) and, then, was linked to Fe3O4 MNPs in order to synthesize the magnetic nanocatalyst. Afterwards, Cupper (I) and Cu (II) was grafted on Fe3O4-PTMS-NAS. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the synthesized the novel magnetic nanocatalyst (Fe3O4-PTMS-NAS@Cu) was successfully used in Suzuki and Stille coupling reactions. The Fe3O4-PTMS-NAS@Cu MNPs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), inductively coupled plasma (ICP), BET and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Besides, sulfonation of natural asphalt, magnetization of catalyst, grafting of Cu (I) and Cu (II) to NAS and catalyst formation were investigated and proved carefully. This nanocatalyst can be comfortably separated from the reaction medium through an external magnetic field and can also be recovered and reused, while maintaining its catalytic activity."
Humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in five different groups of individuals at different environmental and professional risk of infection,"It is partially unknown whether the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection persists with time. To address this issue, we detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in different groups of individuals previously diagnosed with COVID-19 disease (group 1 and 2), or potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection (group 3 and 4), and in a representative group of individuals with limited environmental exposure to the virus due to lockdown restrictions (group 5). The primary outcome was specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the different groups assessed by qualitative and quantitative analysis at baseline, 3 and 6 months follow-up. The seroconversion rate at baseline test was 95% in group 1, 61% in group 2, 40% in group 3, 17% in group 4 and 3% in group 5. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed male gender, close COVID-19 contact and presence of COVID-19 related symptoms strongly associated with serological positivity. The percentage of positive individuals as assessed by the qualitative and quantitative tests was superimposable. At the quantitative test, the median level of SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels measured in positive cases retested at 6-months increased significantly from baseline. The study indicates that assessing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 through qualitative and quantitative testing is a reliable disease surveillance tool."
A rapid and affordable point of care test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 based on hemagglutination and artificial intelligence interpretation,"Diagnostic tests that detect antibodies (AB) against SARS-CoV-2 for evaluation of seroprevalence and guidance of health care measures are important tools for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Current tests have certain limitations with regard to turnaround time, costs and availability, particularly in point-of-care (POC) settings. We established a hemagglutination-based AB test that is based on bi-specific proteins which contain a dromedary-derived antibody (nanobody) binding red blood cells (RBD) and a SARS-CoV-2-derived antigen, such as the receptor-binding domain of the Spike protein (Spike-RBD). While the nanobody mediates swift binding to RBC, the antigen moiety directs instantaneous, visually apparent hemagglutination in the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific AB generated in COVID-19 patients or vaccinated individuals. Method comparison studies with assays cleared by emergency use authorization demonstrate high specificity and sensitivity. To further increase objectivity of test interpretation, we developed an image analysis tool based on digital image acquisition (via a cell phone) and a machine learning algorithm based on defined sample-training and -validation datasets. Preliminary data, including a small clinical study, provides proof of principle for test performance in a POC setting. Together, the data support the interpretation that this AB test format, which we refer to as ‘NanoSpot.ai’, is suitable for POC testing, can be manufactured at very low costs and, based on its generic mode of action, can likely be adapted to a variety of other pathogens."
"Male Monsters Still Stalk, Yet More Violent: A Comparative Analysis of Original Slasher Films and Their Remakes","Since its origins in the mid-1970s, the slasher has been defined as a subgenre of horror in which a serial or mass killer stalks and massacres middle-class youngsters, and preferably attractive young women, using cutting weapons or projectiles. In that regard, the twenty-first century has seen a revival of the slasher, combining the release of original movies with remakes of classic films, adapting the traditional plots to the current context. In this paper, a comparative content analysis is performed on 13 slasher films made during the 1970s and the 1980s and 13 remakes premiered in the new millennium, focusing on the differences stemming from the adaptation of the latter to the new sociocultural context. The results indicate that, although there have been a number of changes, such as higher doses of explicit violence and profanity and in the fight responses of the victims, most of the subgenre’s defining traits have remained intact, whereas others, such as those relating to the defining traits of the victims, should be questioned. The limited differences found between the original films and the remakes provide the basis for drawing interesting conclusions about the subgenre itself, as well as to raise discussions about the different contexts of production and reception."
Stability and local bifurcation analyses of two-wheeled trailers considering the nonlinear coupling between lateral and vertical motions,"The nonlinear dynamics of two-wheeled trailers is investigated using a spatial 4-DoF mechanical model. The non-smooth characteristics of the tire forces caused by the detachment of the tires from the ground and other geometrical nonlinearities are taken into account. Beyond the linear stability analysis, the nonlinear vibrations are analyzed with special attention to the nonlinear coupling between the vertical and lateral motions of the trailer. The center manifold reduction is performed leading to a normal form up to third degree terms. The nature of the emerging periodic solutions, and, thus, the sense of the Hopf bifurcations are verified semi-analytically and numerically. Simplified models of the trailer are also used in order to point out the practical relevance of the study. It is shown that the linearly independent pitch motion affects the sense of the Hopf bifurcations at the linear stability boundary. Namely, the constructed spatial trailer model provides subcritical bifurcations for higher center of gravity positions, while the commonly used simplified mechanical models explore the less dangerous supercritical bifurcations only. Domains of loss of contact of tires are also detected and shown in the stability charts highlighting the presence of unsafe zones. Experiments are carried out on a small-scale trailer to validate the theoretical results. A good agreement can be observed between the measured and numerically determined critical speeds and vibration amplitudes."
"Gender and the pandemic: Associations between caregiving, working from home, personal and career outcomes for women and men","The coronavirus pandemic lockdowns have led to an increase of caregiving and household responsibilities for many employees while working from home. We aimed to investigate whether there was a gender imbalance in the division of household labour within families during the pandemic, and whether this imbalance was associated with gender differences in personal outcomes (work-family conflict, burnout) as well as career-related outcomes (career self-efficacy and aspirations). Participants were 240 heterosexual individuals with or without caregiving responsibilities who lived with a partner and worked from home during the pandemic. They completed self-report questionnaires and indicated the division of domestic tasks within their household, the extent to which they experienced burnout and work-family conflict, and their career aspirations and career self-efficacy. The findings showed a significant gender imbalance, such that female caregivers spent significantly less time on work compared to the other groups and significantly more time on caregiving compared to male caregivers during the lockdown. There was a significant direct effect of caregiving on career outcomes for women, such that the more caregiving women performed during the lockdown relative to other tasks, the more negative their self-reported career outcomes were. Among men, caregiving did not predict career outcomes. Overall, our study showed that the gender imbalance in distributions of caregiving duties during the pandemic is associated with negative personal and professional outcomes for women who are caregivers. Practical implications are discussed accounting for this gender imbalance in the context of the pandemic and its influence on wellbeing and career outcomes, particularly for heterosexual women."
"The involvement of local communities in the conservation process of earthen architecture in the Sahel-Sahara region – the case of Djenné, Mali","Recently, many cultural aspects of some African countries have been in danger of being lost due to cultural disruptions, nonadaptive construction techniques and a lack of adequate conservation systems and strategies. These include the well-known manuscripts of Timbuktu (Tombouctou) as well as architecture, languages, beads, textiles, costumes and other cultural objects. Immaterial heritage, such as oral history, traditional music, instruments and dance, is also affected."
Creating a common priority vector in intuitionistic fuzzy AHP: a comparison of entropy-based and distance-based models,"In the case of conflicting individuals or evaluator groups, finding the common preferences of the participants is a challenging task. This statement also refers to Intuitionistic Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process models, in which uncertainty of the scoring of individuals is well-handled, however, the aggregation of the modified scores is generally conducted by the conventional way of multi-criteria decision-making. This paper offers two options for this aggregation: the relatively well-known entropy-based, and the lately emerged distance-based aggregations. The manuscript can be considered as a pioneer work by analyzing the nature of distance-based aggregation under a fuzzy environment. In the proposed model, three clearly separable conflicting groups are examined, and the objective is to find their common priority vector, which can be satisfactory to all participant clusters. We have tested the model results on a real-world case study, on a public transport development decision-making problem by conducting a large-scale survey involving three different stakeholder groups of transportation. The comparison of the different approaches has shown that both entropy-based and distance-based techniques can provide a feasible solution based on their high similarity in the final ordinal and cardinal outcomes."
Women’s experiences of safety apps for sexualized violence: a narrative scoping review,Sexualized violence against women is a significant human rights problem worldwide. Safety apps have the capacity to provide women with resources to prevent or respond to experiences of sexualized violence.
Development of an observational - perceptual heat strain risk assessment (OPHSRA) index and its validation,The thermal strain can be measured using subjective methods without the use of sensitive equipment. The purpose of the present study was the development and validation of an observational - perceptual heat strain risk assessment (OPHSRA) method.
"Psychological distress, burnout, and coping strategies among Nigerian primary school teachers: a school-based cross-sectional study","The teaching profession is highly stressed job. A high level of stress is associated with poor health outcomes, such as burnout and psychological distress. Therefore, teachers’ use of coping styles becomes imperative. However, relatively little is known about primary school teachers’ psychological distress, burnout, coping strategies, and associated factors in Nigeria. The study investigated psychological distress, burnout, coping strategies among primary schools, and associated factors in Nigeria."

Exploring bycatch diversity of organisms in whole genome sequencing of Erebidae moths (Lepidoptera),"Models estimate that up to 80% of all butterfly and moth species host vertically transmitted endosymbiotic microorganisms, which can affect the host fitness, metabolism, reproduction, population dynamics, and genetic diversity, among others. The supporting empirical data are however currently highly biased towards the generally more colourful butterflies, and include less information about moths. Additionally, studies of symbiotic partners of Lepidoptera predominantly focus on the common bacterium Wolbachia pipientis, while infections by other inherited microbial partners have more rarely been investigated. Here, we mine the whole genome sequence data of 47 species of Erebidae moths, with the aims to both inform on the diversity of symbionts potentially associated with this Lepidoptera group, and discuss the potential of metagenomic approaches to inform on host associated microbiome diversity. Based on the result of Kraken2 and MetaPhlAn2 analyses, we found clear evidence of the presence of Wolbachia in four species. Our result also suggests the presence of three other bacterial symbionts (Burkholderia spp., Sodalis spp. and Arsenophonus spp.) in three other moth species. Additionally, we recovered genomic material from bracovirus in about half of our samples. The detection of the latter, usually found in mutualistic association to braconid parasitoid wasps, may inform on host-parasite interactions that take place in the natural habitat of the Erebidae moths, suggesting either contamination with material from species of the host community network, or horizontal transfer of members of the microbiome between interacting species."
The existence or nonexistence of solutions for some equations involving weighted critical exponents on the unit ball,"In this paper, we extend the results of Brézis and Willem (J Funct Anal 255:2286–2298, 2008) to the equation with single or double weighted critical exponents, including Hardy–Sobolev, Sobolev and Hénon–Sobolev exponents. More precisely, we establish the existence or nonexistence of equation with different coefficient which has an important impact."
The Deep Submerged Continental Crust: The Central Arctic and Zealandia in the Southwest Pacific,"A vast area of up to five million square kilometers is located in the Pacific Ocean to the east of Australia. The Earth’s crust up to 10–23 km thick is submerged here to a depth of 1–4 km. This contrasts with the surrounding Southwest Pacific where the crust is submerged up to 5–6 km and has a thickness of 7 km, which is more typical for oceans. As is known from dredging and deep-sea drilling, Zealandia is composed of the continental crust. For a long time, it was close to the sea level and then it subsided into the depths. The same thickness, water depths, and subsidence history are found for some domains in the Central Arctic, Lomonosov Ridge, Podvodnikov Basin, and Mendeleev Ridge. The continental nature of the crust has been proven here by drilling and is suggested by the results of study of the sea floor bedrock. Deep basins of the Central Arctic and Zealandia were formed without intense crustal stretching. Its origin can be explained by the increase in density of gabbroids in the lower crust due to prograde metamorphism."
Analysis of Degradation Mechanisms of Gate Dielectrics Based on SiO2 in MOS Transistors,"The current mathematical models of gate dielectric degradation are used to determine the value of a device’s operating time to failure depending on its internal properties and operating conditions. These models significantly reduce the time and material costs for testing and processing large amounts of experimental data. Here, the gate dielectrics based on SiO2 in n- and p-channel MOS transistors are investigated. It is found that, when exposed to an electric field, the gate dielectric with the thickness of 5.3 nm most likely degrades according to the thermochemical model (E-model), and the one with a thickness of 7 nm, according to the anode hole injection model (1/E-model). The coefficients are calculated, and the analysis of mathematical models is carried out, which makes it possible to determine the lifetime of gate dielectrics based on SiO2 7 nm thick in n- and p-channel MOS transistors and those that are 5.3 nm thick in n-channel MOS transistors at different values of their area, operating voltage, and temperature. This study can serve as a method for monitoring and determining the quality of the gate dielectrics of the manufactured MOS transistors."
Prediction of Conditions for Chloride–Hydride Epitaxy of Ga1 – yInyAs1 – xPx Layers Isoperiodic with GaAs and GaAs1 – xPx,"For obtaining multicomponent III–V solid solutions, the vapor-phase methods such as the chloride–hydride epitaxy, the epitaxy from organometallic compounds, and the molecular-beam epitaxy are mainly used. The development of optimal technological modes of multicomponent layers and structures, as a rule, requires a lot of time and material costs. In the study, the method of modeling the growth processes of multicomponent solid solutions based on the key physicochemical laws of crystallization of materials and the properties of III–V compounds is proposed. The processes of obtaining four-component In1 – yGayAs1 – xPx solid solutions isoperiodic with GaAs and three-component GaAs0.8P0.2 and GaAs0.6P0.4 solid solutions are analyzed and predicted. The calculated modes are experimentally implemented, and materials are obtained, which correspond to the modern level in quality."
Computing resonance energies directly: method comparison for a model potential,"In contrast to bound states, electronically metastable states or resonances still represent a major challenge for quantum chemistry and molecular physics. The reason lies in the embedding continuum: Bound states represent a many-body problem, while resonances represent a simultaneous scattering and many-body problem. Here we focus on so-called \(\mathcal{{L}}^2\)-methods, which treat the continuum only implicitly, but rather take the ‘decaying state’ perspective and emphasize electron correlation in the decaying state. These methods represent a natural extension of quantum chemistry into the metastable domain and are suitable for, say, modeling electron-induced reactions or resonant photo detachment. The three workhorse \(\mathcal{{L}}^2\)-methods are complex absorbing potentials, the stabilization method, and regularized analytic continuation. However, even for these three methods, making comparisons is less than straightforward as each method works best with a unique blend of electronic structure methods and basis sets. Here we address this issue by considering a model potential. For a model, we can establish a reliable reference resonance energy by using the complex scaling method and a discrete variable representation. Then, we can study the performance of the three workhorse methods as well as effects of more approximate Gaussian basis sets."
Experimental investigation on vibration characteristics of the medium–low-speed maglev vehicle–turnout coupled system,"The steel turnout is one of the key components in the medium–low-speed maglev line system. However, the vehicle under active control is prone to vehicle–turnout coupled vibration, and thus, it is necessary to identify the vibration characteristics of this coupled system through field tests. To this end, dynamic performance tests were conducted on a vehicle–turnout coupled system in a medium–low-speed maglev test line. Firstly, the dynamic response data of the coupled system under various operating conditions were obtained. Then, the natural vibration characteristics of the turnout were analysed using the free attenuation method and the finite element method, indicating a good agreement between the simulation results and the measured results; the acceleration response characteristics of the coupled system were analysed in detail, and the ride quality of the vehicle was assessed by Sperling index. Finally, the frequency distribution characteristics of the coupled system were discussed. All these test results could provide references for model validation and optimized design of medium–low-speed maglev transport systems."
Impact and mitigation of neglecting PPP-RTK correctional uncertainty,"The corrections needed to realize integer ambiguity resolution-enabled precise point positioning (PPP-RTK) at a single-receiver user are often treated as if they are deterministic quantities. The present contribution aims to study and analyze the effect the neglected uncertainty of these corrections, which are subject to time delay, has on the PPP-RTK user ambiguity resolution and positioning performance. Next to the analyses of the estimation results, we emphasize their quality information and show to what extent the assumed positioning precision that the user is provided with differs from the minimum-variance counterpart under an incorrectly specified user stochastic model. We develop and present two alternatives to the fully populated error variance matrix of the PPP-RTK corrections that the user can reconstruct with limited information from the provider so as to properly weigh his corrected data and achieve close-to-optimal performance for high latencies. Supported by numerical results, our study demonstrates that the alternative variance matrices are sufficient enough for the user to obtain improved instantaneous PPP-RTK performance and a realistic precision description in the positioning domain."
Identifying drug-related attributes to personalise antihypertensive agents: the outcome report of patients receiving metoprolol therapy,"Currently, numerous antihypertensive drugs from different pharmacological classes are available; however, blood pressure control is achieved in only less than a third of patients treated for hypertension. Moreover, providing optimal and personalised treatment for hypertension is challenging. Therefore, in this study, we propose a ‘drug-related attributes’ sensitive spectrum. This novel concept can assist clinicians in selecting an optimal antihypertensive drug and improve blood pressure control after examining the attributes of a patient."
"Psychological distress, burnout, and coping strategies among Nigerian primary school teachers: a school-based cross-sectional study","The teaching profession is highly stressed job. A high level of stress is associated with poor health outcomes, such as burnout and psychological distress. Therefore, teachers’ use of coping styles becomes imperative. However, relatively little is known about primary school teachers’ psychological distress, burnout, coping strategies, and associated factors in Nigeria. The study investigated psychological distress, burnout, coping strategies among primary schools, and associated factors in Nigeria."
Women’s experiences of safety apps for sexualized violence: a narrative scoping review,Sexualized violence against women is a significant human rights problem worldwide. Safety apps have the capacity to provide women with resources to prevent or respond to experiences of sexualized violence.
Development of an observational - perceptual heat strain risk assessment (OPHSRA) index and its validation,The thermal strain can be measured using subjective methods without the use of sensitive equipment. The purpose of the present study was the development and validation of an observational - perceptual heat strain risk assessment (OPHSRA) method.
Theoretical studies of MXene-supported single-atom catalysts: Os1/Ti2CS2 for low-temperature CO oxidation,"We report herein a new sulfur-functionalized MXene Ti2C (Ti2CS2)-supported osmium-metal single-atom catalyst (SAC) Os1/Ti2CS2 with high low-temperature catalytic activity for CO oxidation. Using periodic density functional theory calculations, the most stable SAC, Os1/Ti2CS2, has been screened from a series of group 8–11 transition metal SACs M1/Ti2CS2 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu; Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag; Os, Ir, Pt, Au). The calculations show that it is favorable for O2 and CO to be coadsorbed on the Os1 single atom (SA) of Os1/Ti2CS2 and the adsorption energy of the first O2 molecule is slightly higher than that of CO. Moreover, the termolecular co-adsorption of O2 + 2CO on Os1 SA is also possible, which is favorable for CO oxidation on Os1 SA through a novel three-molecule reaction mechanism. Accordingly, four different catalytic mechanisms, the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H), Eley-Rideal (E-R), termolecular Langmuir-Hinshelwood-A (TLH-A) and termolecular Langmuir-Hinshelwood-B (TLH-B), are systematically studied for CO oxidation by O2 on Os1/Ti2CS2. The theoretical studies indicate that the TLH-B mechanism is the most feasible for CO oxidation with the reaction barrier energy of only 0.74 eV, which is far lower than for L-H, E-R and TLH-A with barrier energies of 1.06, 1.09 and 1.47 eV, respectively. The results provide fundamental understanding to the surface chemistry of MXene and designing new sulfur-functionalized two-dimensional MXene catalytic nanomaterials."
No pervasive relationship between species size and local abundance trends,"Although there is some evidence that larger species could be more prone to population declines, the potential role of size traits in determining changes in community composition has been underexplored in global-scale analyses. Here, we combine a large cross-taxon assemblage time series database (BioTIME) with multiple trait databases to show that there is no clear correlation within communities between size traits and changes in abundance over time, suggesting that there is no consistent tendency for larger species to be doing proportionally better or worse than smaller species at local scales."
"A catalogue of 1,167 genomes from the human gut archaeome","The human gut microbiome plays an important role in health, but its archaeal diversity remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we report the analysis of 1,167 nonredundant archaeal genomes (608 high-quality genomes) recovered from human gastrointestinal tract, sampled across 24 countries and rural and urban populations. We identified previously undescribed taxa including 3 genera, 15 species and 52 strains. Based on distinct genomic features, we justify the split of the Methanobrevibacter smithii clade into two separate species, with one represented by the previously undescribed ‘Candidatus Methanobrevibacter intestini’. Patterns derived from 28,581 protein clusters showed significant associations with sociodemographic characteristics such as age groups and lifestyle. We additionally show that archaea are characterized by specific genomic and functional adaptations to the host and carry a complex virome. Our work expands our current understanding of the human archaeome and provides a large genome catalogue for future analyses to decipher its impact on human physiology."
Global warming decreases connectivity among coral populations,"Global warming is killing corals; however, the effects of warming on population connectivity, a process fundamental to reef recovery, are largely unexplored. Using a high-resolution (as high as 200 m), empirically calibrated biophysical model of coral larval dispersal for the southern Great Barrier Reef, we show that the increased larval mortality and reduced competency duration under a 2 °C warming alter dispersal patterns, whereas projected changes in large-scale currents have limited effects. Overall, there was on average a 7% decrease in the distance larvae disperse (among-reef interquartile range (IQR), −10% to −4%), an 8% decrease in the number of connections into each reef (IQR, −11% to −3%) and a 20% increase in local retention (IQR, 0% to +49%). Collectively, these shifts imply that 2 °C of warming will reduce inter-reef connectivity, hampering recovery after disturbances and reducing the spread of warm-adapted genes. Such changes make protections more effective locally, but may require reducing spacing between protected areas."
The Ising triangular-lattice antiferromagnet neodymium heptatantalate as a quantum spin liquid candidate,"Disordered magnetic states known as spin liquids are of paramount importance in both fundamental and applied science. A classical state of this kind was predicted for the Ising antiferromagnetic triangular model, while additional non-commuting exchange terms were proposed to induce its quantum version—a quantum spin liquid. However, these predictions have not yet been confirmed experimentally. Here, we report evidence for such a state in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdTa7O19. We determine its magnetic ground state, which is characterized by effective spin-1/2 degrees of freedom with Ising-like nearest-neighbour correlations and gives rise to spin excitations persisting down to the lowest accessible temperature of 40 mK. Our study demonstrates the key role of strong spin–orbit coupling in stabilizing spin liquids that result from magnetic anisotropy and highlights the large family of rare-earth (RE) heptatantalates RETa7O19 as a framework for realization of these states, which represent a promising platform for quantum applications."
"Origin and significance of noritic blocks in layered anorthosites in the Bushveld Complex, South Africa","Layered mafic–ultramafic intrusions, such as the Rustenburg Layered Suite (RLS) of the Bushveld Complex (South Africa), are the fossilized remnants of upper crustal magmatic plumbing systems and they can be studied to provide important insights into magma chamber dynamics. In this study, we describe the field and petrological relationships, as well as the chemistry (mineral, bulk-rock majors, traces and Sr–Nd isotopes) of 13 blocks that are hosted in a layered sequence of poikilitic anorthosites in the upper Main Zone of the RLS to constrain their petrogenesis. The blocks (olivine-bearing norite, norite and poikilitic norite) are 0.2 to ~ 6 m in size and are rectangular in shape. The blocks are distinct in atomic Mg# (average Mg# 73.9 mol%) and in Sr–Nd isotopes (average initial 87Sr/86Sr of 0.707344 and εNd of − 5.23 at 2.06 Ga) compared to their host anorthosites (average Mg# 61.2 mol%, initial 87Sr/86Sr of 0.707291 and εNd of − 8.31 at 2.06 Ga). We suggest that the blocks represent noritic material that formed in a conduit or staging chamber system below the RLS and were carried into the RLS by carrier magmas (plagioclase slurries). The blocks have Sr–Nd isotopic compositions that can be explained by the assimilation of upper crust, whereas the Sr–Nd isotopic compositions of the host anorthosites can be explained by the assimilation of lower crust. We also develop a numerical model in which we establish the crystallinity and magma flow rate of the plagioclase slurries that carried these cumulate blocks into the RLS."
"What is history? Reflections from the edge of empires, nation-states, and disciplines","Using a comparative, hemispheric perspective on Wayúu history and historicity in the Guajira peninsula, the essay outlines the political aims, projects, and laws of the Wayúu in relation to memory, ritual, ceremony, and territory, as well as empires, nation-states, and disciplines. It questions the primacy of written sources and their interpretation within the discipline of history and asks us to consider what oral traditions teach us about the relation between history, myth, and landscape. It specifies what Wayúu historical narratives tell us concerning aspirations for the future, explains the contexts in which they are mobilized and made public, and discusses the ways that Wayúu historians and intellectuals authorize their representations of the past in relation to kinship and lineage and jurisdiction, as well as how they make use of new technologies in pursuit of political legitimation and cultural preservation."

Embeddings from protein language models predict conservation and variant effects,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants stressed the demand for tools allowing to interpret the effect of single amino acid variants (SAVs) on protein function. While Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) sets continue to expand our understanding of the mutational landscape of single proteins, the results continue to challenge analyses. Protein Language Models (pLMs) use the latest deep learning (DL) algorithms to leverage growing databases of protein sequences. These methods learn to predict missing or masked amino acids from the context of entire sequence regions. Here, we used pLM representations (embeddings) to predict sequence conservation and SAV effects without multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Embeddings alone predicted residue conservation almost as accurately from single sequences as ConSeq using MSAs (two-state Matthews Correlation Coefficient—MCC—for ProtT5 embeddings of 0.596 ± 0.006 vs. 0.608 ± 0.006 for ConSeq). Inputting the conservation prediction along with BLOSUM62 substitution scores and pLM mask reconstruction probabilities into a simplistic logistic regression (LR) ensemble for Variant Effect Score Prediction without Alignments (VESPA) predicted SAV effect magnitude without any optimization on DMS data. Comparing predictions for a standard set of 39 DMS experiments to other methods (incl. ESM-1v, DeepSequence, and GEMME) revealed our approach as competitive with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods using MSA input. No method outperformed all others, neither consistently nor statistically significantly, independently of the performance measure applied (Spearman and Pearson correlation). Finally, we investigated binary effect predictions on DMS experiments for four human proteins. Overall, embedding-based methods have become competitive with methods relying on MSAs for SAV effect prediction at a fraction of the costs in computing/energy. Our method predicted SAV effects for the entire human proteome (~ 20 k proteins) within 40 min on one Nvidia Quadro RTX 8000. All methods and data sets are freely available for local and online execution through bioembeddings.com, https://github.com/Rostlab/VESPA, and PredictProtein."
Safety Profile of Upadacitinib up to 3 Years in Psoriatic Arthritis: An Integrated Analysis of Two Pivotal Phase 3 Trials,"This integrated analysis describes the safety profile of upadacitinib, an oral Janus kinase inhibitor, at 15 and 30 mg once daily for up to 3 years of exposure in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who had a prior inadequate response or intolerance to ≥ 1 non-biologic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug."
Recent advances in terahertz imaging: 1999 to 2021,"We discuss the progress in the field of THz imaging based on time-domain spectroscopy during the last 20 years emphasizing several highlights. These include 3D mapping of the water distribution of plants, THz reflection imaging of samples with arbitrary shape, burn wound imaging and the early diagnosis of diabetic foot disease. These applications greatly benefit from the introduction of fibre-coupled THz time-domain system operated by rugged and portable femtosecond fibre-lasers. THz imaging is a versatile measurement method that has a plethora of practical applications and great promise for the future."
Combination of portal vein embolization and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced gallbladder cancer requiring extended hepatectomy — A novel approach,"Locally advanced gallbladder cancer (GBC) may require extended hepatectomy. Portal vein embolization (PVE) can lead to hypertrophy of future liver remnant (FLR), and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) can be used in this cohort, with additional advantage of downstaging tumors as well as preventing progression while waiting for liver regeneration. Here, we share our experience of combining NACT along with PVE in locally advanced GBC requiring major hepatectomy."
Crambe meal and crude glycerin from biodiesel production in diets for finishing of crossbred cattle in feedlot,"Our hypothesis is that crambe meal can totally substitute soybean meal and crude glycerin can partially replace the corn in the diet without leading to losses of nutrient intake and productive performance. Two assays were performed using heifers and steers. In the first assay, 24 Beefalo-Nellore heifers with 18 months old with 311.5 ± 5.5 kg, and in the second assay, 24 Beefalo-Nellore steers with 18 months old with 317.0 ± 6.4 kg were evaluated. The experiment was carried out in a randomized complete design, in a 2 × 2 factorial scheme, consisting of two energy sources (corn and crude glycerin) and two protein sources (soybean meal and crambe meal). Both assays had 104 experimental days of feedlot. There was no interaction between the variation sources. There was an effect of protein source on nutrient intake for heifers except to neutral detergent fiber intake, which presented effect of energy source. Heifers fed soybean meal showed higher results for total weight gain and daily weight gain. There was observed effect of energy source on rib eye area and subcutaneous fat thickness. Steers fed soybean meal showed higher neutral detergent fiber intake and non-fibrous carbohydrates. Steers fed corn + crude glycerin showed higher results for total weight gain and daily weight gain. The steers fed soybean meal showed higher averages for subcutaneous fat thickness. Crambe meal and crude glycerin can be used as alternative sources of energy and protein to replace 100% of soybean and 50% of corn, respectively, for finishing Beefalo-Nellore cattle in a feedlot."
Performance of bovine genital campylobacteriosis diagnostic tests in bulls from Uruguay: a Bayesian latent class model approach,"The sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of three diagnostic tests for the detection of Campylobacter fetus venerealis (Cfv) using field samples were estimated using a Bayesian latent class model (BLCM), accounting for the absence of a gold standard. The tests included in this study were direct immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Twelve farms from two different populations were selected and bull prepuce samples were collected. The IFAT was performed according to the OIE Manual. The conventional PCR was performed as multiplex, targeting the gene nahE for C. fetus species identification and insertion element ISCfe1 for Cfv identification. The RT-PCR was performed as uniplex: one targeting the gene nahE for C. fetus and the other targeting the insertion ISCfe1 (ISC2) for Cfv. Results from the BLCM showed a median Se of 11.7% (Bayesian credibility interval (BCI): 1.93–29.79%), 53.7% (BCI: 23.1–95.0%), and 36.1% (BCI: 14.5–71.7%) for IFAT, PCR, and RT-PCR respectively. The Sp were 94.5% (BCI: 90.1–97.9%), 97.0% (BCI: 92.9–99.3%), and 98.4% (BCI: 95.3–99.7%) for IFAT, PCR, and RT-PCR respectively. The correlation between PCR and RT-PCR was positive and low in samples from both sampled population (0.63% vs 8.47%). These results suggest that diagnostic sensitivity of the studied tests is lower using field samples than using pure Cfv strains."
"Soil Properties, Litter Dynamics and Biomass Carbon Storage in Three-Bamboo Species of Sub-Himalayan Region of Eastern India","Information on biomass carbon storage in bamboo plantations/groves at local or regional landscapes is crucial to understand its potential in carbon stock management and climate change mitigation. The present work aims to study soil properties, litter dynamics and biomass carbon storage for the three common bamboo species from the Terai region of Indian Eastern Himalayas. Bambusa nutans, Dendrocalamus giganteus and Melocanna baccifera groves were selected for the present study. The soil pH, moisture and electrical conductivity under different bamboo groves of three species varied significantly, but moisture and electrical conductivity responded inconsistently with increasing soil depth. Similarly, the amount of soil available primary nutrients also varied significantly, where soils of M. baccifera grove were quantified with highest amount of these nutrients at all depths. M. baccifera grove produced the highest litter, although the difference with the other two groves was non-significant. The amount of oxidizable soil organic carbon quantified varied significantly among the bamboo groves, with the highest SOC content under the M. baccifera grove. The decomposition rate gradually increased with time, and within 9 months, the entire litter got decomposed. The annual return of nutrients was in the order N > K > P. The total biomass of D. giganteus, B. nutans and M. baccifera was estimated at 270.97, 127.21 and 16.31 Mg ha−1, respectively. Based on the higher R2 and adj R2, and lower AIC and HQC, Model 1 was more appropriate for B. nutans and D. giganteus, whereas Model 2 was suitable for M. baccifera. The ecosystem carbon stock of D. giganteus was significantly (163.28 Mg ha−1) higher than the other two species because of its significantly higher biomass carbon accumulation. This amount of biomass carbon storage and ecosystem carbon stock is comparable with agroforestry and forest ecosystems in the study region or elsewhere. The present study suggests these bamboos can be a feasible option for carbon farming and carbon trading, climate change adaptation and mitigation, apart from its contribution in social and economic contributions to the region’s rural life. Therefore, value addition and nationalizing of bamboo are recommended to improve rural folks’ livelihood. Encouraging value-added bamboo products can be negative feedback to climate change because of their durability and thus permanency of carbon stored in it."
Bifurcation analysis of the predator–prey model with the Allee effect in the predator,"The use of predator–prey models in theoretical ecology has a long history, and the model equations have largely evolved since the original Lotka–Volterra system towards more realistic descriptions of the processes of predation, reproduction and mortality. One important aspect is the recognition of the fact that the growth of a population can be subject to an Allee effect, where the per capita growth rate increases with the population density. Including an Allee effect has been shown to fundamentally change predator–prey dynamics and strongly impact species persistence, but previous studies mostly focused on scenarios of an Allee effect in the prey population. Here we explore a predator–prey model with an ecologically important case of the Allee effect in the predator population where it occurs in the numerical response of predator without affecting its functional response. Biologically, this can result from various scenarios such as a lack of mating partners, sperm limitation and cooperative breeding mechanisms, among others. Unlike previous studies, we consider here a generic mathematical formulation of the Allee effect without specifying a concrete parameterisation of the functional form, and analyse the possible local bifurcations in the system. Further, we explore the global bifurcation structure of the model and its possible dynamical regimes for three different concrete parameterisations of the Allee effect. The model possesses a complex bifurcation structure: there can be multiple coexistence states including two stable limit cycles. Inclusion of the Allee effect in the predator generally has a destabilising effect on the coexistence equilibrium. We also show that regardless of the parametrisation of the Allee effect, enrichment of the environment will eventually result in extinction of the predator population."
TT2 controls rice thermotolerance through SCT1-dependent alteration of wax biosynthesis,"Global warming threatens crop production. G proteins mediate plant responses to multiple abiotic stresses. Here we identified a natural quantitative trait locus, TT2 (THERMOTOLERANCE 2), encoding a Gγ subunit, that confers thermotolerance in rice during both vegetative and reproductive growth without a yield penalty. A natural allele with loss of TT2 function was associated with greater retention of wax at high temperatures and increased thermotolerance. Mechanistically, we found that a transcription factor, SCT1 (Sensing Ca2+ Transcription factor 1), functions to decode Ca2+ through Ca2+-enhanced interaction with calmodulin and acts as a negative regulator of its target genes (for example, Wax Synthesis Regulatory 2 (OsWR2)). The calmodulin–SCT1 interaction was attenuated by reduced heat-triggered Ca2+ caused by disrupted TT2, thus explaining the observed heat-induced changes in wax content. Beyond establishing a bridge linking G protein, Ca2+ sensing and wax metabolism, our study illustrates innovative approaches for developing potentially yield-penalty-free thermotolerant crop varieties."
Planetesimal rings as the cause of the Solar System’s planetary architecture,"Astronomical observations reveal that protoplanetary disks around young stars commonly have ring- and gap-like structures in their dust distributions. These features are associated with pressure bumps trapping dust particles at specific locations, which simulations show are ideal sites for planetesimal formation. Here we show that our Solar System may have formed from rings of planetesimals—created by pressure bumps—rather than a continuous disk. We model the gaseous disk phase assuming the existence of pressure bumps near the silicate sublimation line (at T ~ 1,400 K), water snowline (at T ~ 170 K) and CO snowline (at T ~ 30 K). Our simulations show that dust piles up at the bumps and forms up to three rings of planetesimals: a narrow ring near 1 au, a wide ring between ~3–4 au and ~10–20 au and a distant ring between ~20 au and ~45 au. We use a series of simulations to follow the evolution of the innermost ring and show how it can explain the orbital structure of the inner Solar System and provides a framework to explain the origins of isotopic signatures of Earth, Mars and different classes of meteorites. The central ring contains enough mass to explain the rapid growth of the giant planets’ cores. The outermost ring is consistent with dynamical models of Solar System evolution proposing that the early Solar System had a primordial planetesimal disk beyond the current orbit of Uranus."
No pervasive relationship between species size and local abundance trends,"Although there is some evidence that larger species could be more prone to population declines, the potential role of size traits in determining changes in community composition has been underexplored in global-scale analyses. Here, we combine a large cross-taxon assemblage time series database (BioTIME) with multiple trait databases to show that there is no clear correlation within communities between size traits and changes in abundance over time, suggesting that there is no consistent tendency for larger species to be doing proportionally better or worse than smaller species at local scales."
Global warming decreases connectivity among coral populations,"Global warming is killing corals; however, the effects of warming on population connectivity, a process fundamental to reef recovery, are largely unexplored. Using a high-resolution (as high as 200 m), empirically calibrated biophysical model of coral larval dispersal for the southern Great Barrier Reef, we show that the increased larval mortality and reduced competency duration under a 2 °C warming alter dispersal patterns, whereas projected changes in large-scale currents have limited effects. Overall, there was on average a 7% decrease in the distance larvae disperse (among-reef interquartile range (IQR), −10% to −4%), an 8% decrease in the number of connections into each reef (IQR, −11% to −3%) and a 20% increase in local retention (IQR, 0% to +49%). Collectively, these shifts imply that 2 °C of warming will reduce inter-reef connectivity, hampering recovery after disturbances and reducing the spread of warm-adapted genes. Such changes make protections more effective locally, but may require reducing spacing between protected areas."
The Ising triangular-lattice antiferromagnet neodymium heptatantalate as a quantum spin liquid candidate,"Disordered magnetic states known as spin liquids are of paramount importance in both fundamental and applied science.

The structure of the native CNGA1/CNGB1 CNG channel from bovine retinal rods,"In rod photoreceptors of the retina, the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel is composed of three CNGA and one CNGB subunits, and it closes in response to light activation to generate an electrical signal that is conveyed to the brain. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the closed state of the native rod CNG channel isolated from bovine retina. The structure reveals differences between CNGA1 and CNGB1 subunits. Three CNGA1 subunits are tethered at their C terminus by a coiled-coil region. The C-helix in the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain of CNGB1 features a different orientation from that in the three CNGA1 subunits. The arginine residue R994 of CNGB1 reaches into the ionic pathway and blocks the pore, thus introducing an additional gate, which is different from the central hydrophobic gate known from homomeric CNGA channels. These results address the long-standing question of how CNGB1 subunits contribute to the function of CNG channels in visual and olfactory neurons."
Structure of the human cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated channel,"Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels transduce light-induced chemical signals into electrical signals in retinal cone and rod photoreceptors. Structures of native CNG channels, which are heterotetramers formed by CNGA and CNGB subunits, have not been obtained. In the present study, we report a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human cone CNG channel in the apo closed state. The channel contains three CNGA3 and one CNGB3 subunits. Arg403 in the pore helix of CNGB3 projects into an asymmetric selectivity filter and forms hydrogen bonds with two pore-lining backbone carbonyl oxygens. Arg442 in S6 of CNGB3 protrudes into and occludes the pore below the hydrophobic cavity gate previously observed in homotetrameric CNGA channels. It is interesting that Arg403Gln is a disease mutation, and Arg442 is replaced by glutamine in some animal species with dichromatic or monochromatic vision. These and other unique structural features and the disease link conferred by CNGB3 indicate a critical role of CNGB3 in shaping cone photoresponses."
Engineering CAR-T cells to activate small-molecule drugs in situ,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells represent a major breakthrough in cancer therapy, wherein a patient’s own T cells are engineered to recognize a tumor antigen, resulting in activation of a local cytotoxic immune response. However, CAR-T cell therapies are currently limited to the treatment of B cell cancers and their effectiveness is hindered by resistance from antigen-negative tumor cells, immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, eventual exhaustion of T cell immunologic functions and frequent severe toxicities. To overcome these problems, we have developed a novel class of CAR-T cells engineered to express an enzyme that activates a systemically administered small-molecule prodrug in situ at a tumor site. We show that these synthetic enzyme-armed killer (SEAKER) cells exhibit enhanced anticancer activity with small-molecule prodrugs, both in vitro and in vivo in mouse tumor models. This modular platform enables combined targeting of cellular and small-molecule therapies to treat cancers and potentially a variety of other diseases."
Convergent evolution of bacterial ceramide synthesis,"The bacterial domain produces numerous types of sphingolipids with various physiological functions. In the human microbiome, commensal and pathogenic bacteria use these lipids to modulate the host inflammatory system. Despite their growing importance, their biosynthetic pathway remains undefined since several key eukaryotic ceramide synthesis enzymes have no bacterial homolog. Here we used genomic and biochemical approaches to identify six proteins comprising the complete pathway for bacterial ceramide synthesis. Bioinformatic analyses revealed the widespread potential for bacterial ceramide synthesis leading to our discovery of a Gram-positive species that produces ceramides. Biochemical evidence demonstrated that the bacterial pathway operates in a different order from that in eukaryotes. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses support the hypothesis that the bacterial and eukaryotic ceramide pathways evolved independently."
"What is history? Reflections from the edge of empires, nation-states, and disciplines","Using a comparative, hemispheric perspective on Wayúu history and historicity in the Guajira peninsula, the essay outlines the political aims, projects, and laws of the Wayúu in relation to memory, ritual, ceremony, and territory, as well as empires, nation-states, and disciplines. It questions the primacy of written sources and their interpretation within the discipline of history and asks us to consider what oral traditions teach us about the relation between history, myth, and landscape.

Systematic molecular evolution enables robust biomolecule discovery,"Evolution occurs when selective pressures from the environment shape inherited variation over time. Within the laboratory, evolution is commonly used to engineer proteins and RNA, but experimental constraints have limited the ability to reproducibly and reliably explore factors such as population diversity, the timing of environmental changes and chance on outcomes. We developed a robotic system termed phage- and robotics-assisted near-continuous evolution (PRANCE) to comprehensively explore biomolecular evolution by performing phage-assisted continuous evolution in high-throughput. PRANCE implements an automated feedback control system that adjusts the stringency of selection in response to real-time measurements of each molecular activity. In evolving three distinct types of biomolecule, we find that evolution is reproducibly altered by both random chance and the historical pattern of environmental changes. This work improves the reliability of protein engineering and enables the systematic analysis of the historical, environmental and random factors governing biomolecular evolution."
Functions of digital learning within the international mobility programme – perspectives of university students and staff from Europe,"This paper is based on research studies conducted in the academic community of students and staff members (teachers, researchers and administrative staff) from 16 European universities that focus on digital learning in international mobility. The context of our qualitative study is digital learning during an international mobility scheme when university staff and students do not go abroad for their mobility programme but take courses offered by a partner university from home. By taking the perspectives of both of these academic groups, we aimed to arrive at a clearer understanding of how the digital environment supports digital learning within mobility, ascertain the functions of digital learning and describe the opportunities and challenges that are presented to students engaged in international mobility. Empirical data was gathered using questionnaires and focus group interviews. This study puts forward the assertion that distinctive features of learning in a digital environment within international mobility are systems thinking, self-directed learning and focus on course content. Digital learning environments support motivation to learn, and independence in gaining knowledge. In international digital learning, the online courses of which are characterized by their innovative pedagogical and assessment practices, students and staff become more autonomous in their learning, and more willing to open up to meeting the challenges encountered in various educational settings. Digital learning in the context of mobility means giving meaning to one’s own activity in a digital environment and extension of the course content, meaning oral expression such as discussing and interacting with teachers and peers."
From Kajihara’s transformation formula to deformed Macdonald–Ruijsenaars and Noumi–Sano operators,"Kajihara obtained in 2004 a remarkable transformation formula connecting multiple basic hypergeometric series associated with A-type root systems of different ranks. By specialisations of his formula, we deduce kernel identities for deformed Macdonald–Ruijsenaars (MR) and Noumi–Sano (NS) operators. The deformed MR operators were introduced by Sergeev and Veselov in the first order case and by Feigin and Silantyev in the higher order cases. As applications of our kernel identities, we prove that all of these operators pairwise commute and are simultaneously diagonalised by the super-Macdonald polynomials. We also provide an explicit description of the algebra generated by the deformed MR and/or NS operators by a Harish-Chandra type isomorphism and show that the deformed MR (NS) operators can be viewed as restrictions of inverse limits of ordinary MR (NS) operators."
The relative Whitney trick and its applications,"We introduce a geometric operation, which we call the relative Whitney trick, that removes a single double point between properly immersed surfaces in a 4-manifold with boundary.Using the relative Whitney trick we prove that every link in a homology sphere is homotopic to a link that is topologically slice in a contractible topological 4-manifold. We further prove that any link in a homology sphere is order k Whitney tower concordant to a link in \(S^3\) for all k. Finally, we explore the minimum Gordian distance from a link in \(S^3\) to a homotopically trivial link. Extending this notion to links in homology spheres, we use the relative Whitney trick to make explicit computations for 3-component links and establish bounds in general."
An expansion formula for quantum cluster algebras from unpunctured triangulated surfaces,"We generalize Musiker–Schiffler–Williams’ expansion formula to quantum cluster algebras from unpunctured surfaces. In particular, we give a combinatorial proof of the positivity for such class of quantum cluster algebras."
Localized Chern characters for 2-periodic complexes,"For a two-periodic complex of vector bundles, Polishchuk and Vaintrob have constructed its localized Chern character. We explore some basic properties of this localized Chern character. In particular, we show that the cosection localization defined by Kiem and Li is equivalent to a localized Chern character operation for the associated two-periodic Koszul complex, strengthening a work of Chang, Li, and Li. We apply this equivalence to the comparison of virtual classes of moduli of \({\varepsilon }\)-stable quasimaps and moduli of the corresponding LG \({\varepsilon }\)-stable quasimaps, in full generality."
Automorphisms of n-Ary Groups,"Isotopies and autotopies of n-ary groups are described. As a consequence, we obtain various characterizations of the group of automorphisms of n-ary groups. We also determine the number of automorphisms of a given n-ary group."
New Approximations for the Higher Order Coefficients in an Asymptotic Expansion for the Barnes G-Function,"In this paper, we provide new formulas for determining the coefficients appearing in the asymptotic expansion for the Barnes G-function as n tends to infinity for certain classes of asymptotic expansion for the Barnes G-function. We remark that our formulas can be used to approximate the coefficients appearing in an asymptotic expansion of the “random matrix factor” from the Keathing-Snaith conjecture and the coefficients appearing in an asymptotic expansion of the “Lévy-Khintchine type representation of the reciprocal of the Barnes G-function”."
The existence or nonexistence of solutions for some equations involving weighted critical exponents on the unit ball,"In this paper, we extend the results of Brézis and Willem (J Funct Anal 255:2286–2298, 2008) to the equation with single or double weighted critical exponents, including Hardy–Sobolev, Sobolev and Hénon–Sobolev exponents. More precisely, we establish the existence or nonexistence of equation with different coefficient which has an important impact."
Exploring bycatch diversity of organisms in whole genome sequencing of Erebidae moths (Lepidoptera),"Models estimate that up to 80% of all butterfly and moth species host vertically transmitted endosymbiotic microorganisms, which can affect the host fitness, metabolism, reproduction, population dynamics, and genetic diversity, among others. The supporting empirical data are however currently highly biased towards the generally more colourful butterflies, and include less information about moths. Additionally, studies of symbiotic partners of Lepidoptera predominantly focus on the common bacterium Wolbachia pipientis, while infections by other inherited microbial partners have more rarely been investigated. Here, we mine the whole genome sequence data of 47 species of Erebidae moths, with the aims to both inform on the diversity of symbionts potentially associated with this Lepidoptera group, and discuss the potential of metagenomic approaches to inform on host associated microbiome diversity. Based on the result of Kraken2 and MetaPhlAn2 analyses, we found clear evidence of the presence of Wolbachia in four species. Our result also suggests the presence of three other bacterial symbionts (Burkholderia spp., Sodalis spp. and Arsenophonus spp.) in three other moth species. Additionally, we recovered genomic material from bracovirus in about half of our samples. The detection of the latter, usually found in mutualistic association to braconid parasitoid wasps, may inform on host-parasite interactions that take place in the natural habitat of the Erebidae moths, suggesting either contamination with material from species of the host community network, or horizontal transfer of members of the microbiome between interacting species."
"Household Earnings and Income Volatility in the UK, 2009–2017","We study the volatility of sources of individual and household level income in the UK in the years 2009-2017, following the Great Recession and government austerity. We find that the volatility of (pre-tax) earnings and disposable income has fallen for the working-age in this period, largely due to fewer negative and large earnings shocks. For older individuals, we also find a fall in the volatility of private income, mainly due to fewer positive and large income shocks. Taxes and transfers help stabilise incomes, with social security cash benefits and income-dependent refundable tax credits reducing household private income volatility by around a quarter for the working age, and 40 percent for those aged 60 or over. However, over the sample period, taxes and benefits became less well correlated with earnings, reducing their ability to counteract swings in labour income. The findings illustrate the consequences of fiscal retrenchment and the cut-backs to welfare benefits on the stability of incomes."

"In vitro proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 14T for benign and malignant ovary: Part I, signal processing by the nonparametric fast Padé transform","The present study deals with two different kinds of time signals, encoded by in vitro proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with a high external static magnetic field, 14.1T (Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer). These time signals originate from the specific biofluid samples taken from two patients, one with benign and the other with malignant ovarian cysts. The latter two diagnoses have been made by histopathologic analyses of the samples. Histopathology is the diagnostic gold standard in medicine. The obtained results from signal processing by the nonparametric derivative fast Padé transform (dFPT) show that a number of resonances assignable to known metabolites are considerably more intense in the malignant than in the benign specimens. Such conclusions from the dFPT include the recognized cancer biomarkers, lactic acid and choline-containing compounds. For example, the peak height ratio for the malignant-to-benign samples is about 18 for lactate, Lac. This applies equally to doublet Lac(d) and quartet Lac(q) resonating near 1.41 and 4.36 ppm (parts per million), respectively. For the choline-containing conglomerate (3.19-3.23 ppm), the dFPT with already low-derivative orders (2nd, 3rd) succeeds in clearly separating the three singlet component resonances, free choline Cho(s), phosphocholine PC(s) and glycerophosphocholine GPC(s). These constituents of total choline, tCho, are of critical diagnostic relevance because the increased levels, particularly of PC(s) and GPC(s), are an indicator of a malignant transformation. It is gratifying that signal processing by the dFPT, as a shape estimator, coheres with the mentioned histopathology findings of the two samples. A very large number of resonances is identifiable and quantifiable by the nonparametric dFPT, including those associated with the diagnostically most important low molecular weight metabolites. This is expediently feasible by the automated sequential visualization and quantification that separate and isolate sharp resonances first and subsequently tackle broad macromolecular lineshape profiles. Such a stepwise workflow is not based on subtracting nor annulling any part of the spectrum, in sharp contrast to controversial customary practice in the MRS literature. Rather, sequential estimation exploits the chief derivative feature, which is a faster peak height increase of the thin than of the wide resonances. This is how the dFPT simultaneously improves resolution (linewidth narrowing) and reduces noise (background flattening). Such a twofold achievement makes the dFPT-based proton MRS a high throughput strategy in tumor diagnostics as hundreds of metabolites can be visualized/quantified to offer the opportunity for a possible expansion of the existing list of a handful of cancer biomarkers."
Boundary element methods for the wave equation based on hierarchical matrices and adaptive cross approximation,"Time-domain Boundary Element Methods (BEM) have been successfully used in acoustics, optics and elastodynamics to solve transient problems numerically. However, the storage requirements are immense, since the fully populated system matrices have to be computed for a large number of time steps or frequencies. In this article, we propose a new approximation scheme for the Convolution Quadrature Method powered BEM, which we apply to scattering problems governed by the wave equation. We use \({\mathscr {H}}^2\)-matrix compression in the spatial domain and employ an adaptive cross approximation algorithm in the frequency domain. In this way, the storage and computational costs are reduced significantly, while the accuracy of the method is preserved."
New insights into different surfactants’ impacts on sludge fermentation: Focusing on the particular metabolic processes and microbial genetic traits,"Surfactants were expected to exhibit positive effects on the waste activated sludge (WAS) disposal. However, the systematic comparison of different categories of surfactants on the WAS fermentation and the functional mechanisms, especially microbial metabolic traits, have not yet been precisely explored. This study revealed the positive effects of different surfactants on the volatile fatty acid (VFA) production, which followed the order of alkyl polysaccharides (APG)>sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS)>hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (HTAB). Mechanistic exploration found that the presence of different surfactants improved solubilization and hydrolysis steps, and then contributed to the subsequent acidification with different efficiencies. The functional microorganisms associated with VFA generation were enriched in surfactant-conditioned reactors. Metagenomic analysis further indicated that the key genes involved in the particular process of VFA generation were over-expressed. The simultaneous bioavailable substrate improvement, functional bacterial enrichment, and metabolic activity upregulation induced by different surfactants jointly contributed to VFA promotion during WAS fermentation. This study could provide a comprehensive realization of surfactants’ impacts on the WAS fermentation process, and more importantly, it reminded the public to discern the distinct interplaying effects induced by different chemicals in regulating the WAS disposal and resource recovery."
On Characterization of Hilbert Transform of Riemannian Surface with Boundary,"Let (M, g) be a smooth compact orientable two-dimensional Riemannian manifold (surface) with a smooth metric tensor g and a smooth connected boundary \(\Gamma \). The Hilbert transform H associated with (M, g) acts in \(C(\Gamma ;\mathbb R)\) by \(H: \Re \eta \mapsto \Im \eta \), where \(\eta =w|_\Gamma \) is the trace of a function w holomorphic in M. We provide characteristic conditions on an operator H defined on a curve \(\Gamma \) to be the Hilbert transform of a surface. In fact, the characterization of H is reduced to one of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map \(\Lambda _g\) of the surface (M, g), which is related to the Hilbert transform by \(H=J\Lambda _g\), where J is integration along \(\Gamma \). In contrast to the known characterization of \(\Lambda _g\) by Henkin and Michel in terms of multidimensional complex analysis, our one makes use of the Commutative Banach Algebra theory."
Hausdorff Operators on Weighted Banach Spaces of Type \(H^{\infty }\),"Some criteria for the continuity of Hausdorff operators on weighted Banach spaces of analytic functions with sup-norms are presented. The operator is defined in a different way on spaces of entire functions and on spaces of analytic functions on the disc. Both cases are analyzed. Our results complement recent work by Stylogiannis and Galanopoulos, and by Mirotin."
Approximation in Weighted Analytic Besov Spaces and in Generalized Fock Spaces,"We study weighted analytic Besov spaces in the unit disk, and prove that the analytic polynomials are dense in weighted analytic Besov spaces if the non-radial super-biharmonic weight function satisfies certain smoothness and growth condition. We then study sufficient conditions on weight functions to ensure the norm approximation of a given function in a generalized weighted Fock space by its dilated functions."
Theoretical studies of MXene-supported single-atom catalysts: Os1/Ti2CS2 for low-temperature CO oxidation,"We report herein a new sulfur-functionalized MXene Ti2C (Ti2CS2)-supported osmium-metal single-atom catalyst (SAC) Os1/Ti2CS2 with high low-temperature catalytic activity for CO oxidation. Using periodic density functional theory calculations, the most stable SAC, Os1/Ti2CS2, has been screened from a series of group 8–11 transition metal SACs M1/Ti2CS2 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu; Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag; Os, Ir, Pt, Au). The calculations show that it is favorable for O2 and CO to be coadsorbed on the Os1 single atom (SA) of Os1/Ti2CS2 and the adsorption energy of the first O2 molecule is slightly higher than that of CO. Moreover, the termolecular co-adsorption of O2 + 2CO on Os1 SA is also possible, which is favorable for CO oxidation on Os1 SA through a novel three-molecule reaction mechanism. Accordingly, four different catalytic mechanisms, the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H), Eley-Rideal (E-R), termolecular Langmuir-Hinshelwood-A (TLH-A) and termolecular Langmuir-Hinshelwood-B (TLH-B), are systematically studied for CO oxidation by O2 on Os1/Ti2CS2. The theoretical studies indicate that the TLH-B mechanism is the most feasible for CO oxidation with the reaction barrier energy of only 0.74 eV, which is far lower than for L-H, E-R and TLH-A with barrier energies of 1.06, 1.09 and 1.47 eV, respectively. The results provide fundamental understanding to the surface chemistry of MXene and designing new sulfur-functionalized two-dimensional MXene catalytic nanomaterials."
Coarse infinite-dimensionality of hyperspaces of finite subsets,"We consider infinite-dimensional properties in coarse geometry for hyperspaces consisting of finite subsets of metric spaces with the Hausdorff metric. We see that several infinite-dimensional properties are preserved by taking the hyperspace of subsets with at most n points. On the other hand, we prove that, if a metric space contains a sequence of long intervals coarsely, then its hyperspace of finite subsets is not coarsely embeddable into any uniformly convex Banach space. As a corollary, the hyperspace of finite subsets of the real line is not coarsely embeddable into any uniformly convex Banach space. It is also shown that every (not necessarily bounded geometry) metric space with straight finite decomposition complexity has metric sparsification property."
Impact of injection rate ramp-up on nucleation and arrest of dynamic fault slip,"Fluid injection into underground formations reactivates preexisting geological discontinuities such as faults or fractures. In this work, we investigate the impact of injection rate ramp-up present in many standard injection protocols on the nucleation and potential arrest of dynamic slip along a planar pressurized fault. We assume a linear increasing function of injection rate with time, up to a given time \(t_c\) after which a maximum value \(Q_m\) is achieved. Under the assumption of negligible shear-induced dilatancy and impermeable host medium, we solve numerically the coupled hydro-mechanical model and explore the different slip regimes identified via scaling analysis. We show that in the limit when fluid diffusion time scale \(t_w\) is much larger than the ramp-up time scale \(t_c\), slip on an ultimately stable fault is essentially driven by pressurization at constant rate. Vice versa, in the limit when \(t_c/t_w \gg 1\), the pressurization rate, quantified by the dimensionless ratio \(\dfrac{Q_m t_w}{t_c Q^*}\) with \(Q^*\) being a characteristic injection rate scale, does impact both nucleation time and arrest distance of dynamic slip. Indeed, for a given initial fault loading condition and frictional weakening property, lower pressurization rates delay the nucleation of a finite-sized dynamic event and increase the corresponding run-out distance approximately proportional to \(\propto \left( \dfrac{Q_m t_w}{t_c Q^*}\right) ^{-0.472}\). On critically stressed faults, instead, the ramp-up of injection rate activates quasi-static slip which quickly turn into a run-away dynamic rupture. Its nucleation time decreases non-linearly with increasing value of \(\dfrac{Q_m t_w}{t_c Q^*}\) and it may precede (or not) the one associated with fault pressurization at constant rate only."
Identifying drug-related attributes to personalise antihypertensive agents: the outcome report of patients receiving metoprolol therapy,"Currently, numerous antihypertensive drugs from different pharmacological classes are available; however, blood pressure control is achieved in only less than a third of patients treated for hypertension. Moreover, providing optimal and personalised treatment for hypertension is challenging. Therefore, in this study, we propose a ‘drug-related attributes’ sensitive spectrum. This novel concept can assist clinicians in selecting an optimal antihypertensive drug and improve blood pressure control after examining the attributes of a patient."
Experimental investigation on vibration characteristics of the medium–low-speed maglev vehicle–turnout coupled system,"The steel turnout is one of the key components in the medium–low-speed maglev line system. However, the vehicle under active control is prone to vehicle–turnout coupled vibration, and thus, it is necessary to identify the vibration characteristics of this coupled system through field tests. To this end, dynamic performance tests were conducted on a vehicle–turnout coupled system in a medium–low-speed maglev test line. Firstly, the dynamic response data of the coupled system under various operating conditions were obtained. Then, the natural vibration characteristics of the turnout were analysed using the free attenuation method and the finite element method, indicating a good agreement between the simulation results and the measured results; the acceleration response characteristics of the coupled system were analysed in detail, and the ride quality of the vehicle was assessed by Sperling index. Finally, the frequency distribution characteristics of the coupled system were discussed. All these test results could provide references for model validation and optimized design of medium–low-speed maglev transport systems."
Ontological accounting and aboutness: on Asay’s A Theory of Truthmaking,"In this paper, I first present an overview of Asay’s A Theory of Truthmaking, highlighting what I take to be some of its most attractive features, especially his re-invigoration of the ontological understanding of truthmaking and his defence of ontology-first truthmaking over explanation-first truthmaking. Then, I articulate what I take to be a puzzling potential inconsistency: (a) he appeals to considerations to do with aboutness in criticising how well ontological views account for truth while (b) ruling out aboutness from the right account of truthmaking. He argues, instead, that necessitation is both necessary and sufficient for truthmaking (§3.3). I suggest that adding aboutness to one’s account in the right way is not just compatible with but important for ontology-first truthmaking. I do all this to invite Asay to clarify his position on these matters. Overall, Asay’s worldview displays the fruitfulness of an ontologically serious approach to metaphysics that puts truthmaking centre-stage."
Strategic bidding in price coupled regions,"With the emerging deregulated electricity markets, a part of the electricity trading takes place in day-ahead markets where producers and retailers place bids in order to maximize their profit. We present a price-maker model for strategic bidding from the perspective of a producer in Price Coupled Regions (PCR) considering a capacitated transmission network between local day-ahead markets. The aim for the bidder is to establish a production plan and set its bids taking into consideration the reaction of the market. We consider the problem as deterministic, that is, the bids of the competitors are known in advance. We are facing a bilevel optimization problem where the first level is a Unit Commitment problem, modeled as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), and the second level models a market equilibrium problem through a Linear Program. The problem is first reformulated as a single level problem. Properties of the optimal spot prices are studied to obtain an extended formulation that is linearized and tightened using new valid inequalities. Several properties of the spot prices allow to reduce significantly the number of binary variables. Two novel heuristics are proposed, the first applicable in PCR, the second for general formulations with Special Ordered Sets (SOS) of type 1. Our computational experiments highlights the risk of a loss for the bidder if some aspects usually not considered in the literature, such as Price Coupled Regions, or an accurate UC problem, are not taken into account. They also show that the reformulation techniques, combined with new valid inequalities, allow to solve much larger instances than the current state-of-the-art. Finally, our experiments also show that the proposed heuristics deliver very high quality solutions in a short computation time."
Analysis of primary metabolites of Morchella fruit bodies and mycelium based on widely targeted metabolomics,"As a medicinal and edible homologous fungi, Morchella is rich in multiple metabolites. The metabolite is a kind of essential substance with active components. In this study, Morchella fruit bodies and mycelium were selected to identify their metabolite components. The primary metabolites of the two experimental groups were analyzed using a method of widely targeted metabolome based on UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. A total of 354 different metabolites were characterized, including 188 upregulated ones and 166 downregulated ones in the fruit bodies. Further, the main 20 metabolic pathways of the metabolites were analyzed. The first 9 ones are tyrosine metabolites, thyroid hormone biosynthetic pathway, phenylalanine metabolites, linoleic metabolites synthetic pathway, glycerophosphate metabolic pathway, choline in tumors, methyl butyl metabolites, arginine synthetic pathway, arginine and proline metabolites. This study provides theoretical basis for the analysis of metabolic pathway of Morchella fruit bodies and mycelium that serve for further research of their medicinal mechanism and effective components."
Probing the self-diffusion process in Aluminium,"An in-depth understanding of the diffusion process in liquid metals is a key to design and engineering new high-performance materials. In this study, using molecular dynamics simulations supplemented with the embedded atom potential, we investigate/compare the self-diffusion process in liquid Aluminium. To understand the self-diffusion process, we analyse the radial distribution functions, velocity distributions, mean square displacements, and self-diffusion coefficients at various temperatures well above the melting temperature of Aluminium in the temperature range of 1000 K to 1800 K. As a key result, in both the \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) phases, the self-diffusion coefficients show a non-linear variation with rise in temperatures in the range of 1000 K to 1200 K. From 1300 K to 1800 K, the self-diffusion coefficients increase more or less monotonically with rise in temperature. We found that a higher temperature in the range of 1300 K to 1800 K leads to a greater self-diffusion coefficient, suggesting the more violent movement of the atoms around their equilibrium positions. The results presented in this work can help to understand the differences in the self-diffusion process in the technologically relevant Al phases."
The effect of moisture on the properties of cement-bonded particleboards made with non-traditional raw materials,"The paper presents research into the changes of properties in cement-bonded particleboards caused by moisture saturation over the course of 504 h. Three particleboard variants were tested, all at the age of 18 months. The first is a standard production-line board manufactured by CIDEM Hranice, a.s. (identified as CP-R). The other two variants were modified by by-products of the particleboard manufacturing process—dust (CP-D) and a particulate mixture (CP-P). The experiment observed changes in the boards’ dimensions, volume, and mass. The effect of moisture on their basic material properties was also investigated. While the boards were being saturated by water, changes in their structure were examined using an optical microscope. It was found that the boards behave differently depending on their composition. Also there were differences in the dynamics of the property changes. The modified particleboards are more susceptible to dimensional and volume changes. Both, volume and mass undergo the most significant changes during the first 24 h. Cracks and air voids inside the wood chips begin to close upon contact with water as a result of swelling. It was observed by optical microscopy that this process occurs within 3 to 5 min since immersion in the water bath. Between 24 and 96 h the rate at which the air voids and pores are closing begins to decrease and there is a difference in the dynamics of mass and volume changes as well. Wet–dry cycling of the boards was analysed as well. Temperature and moisture fluctuations negatively affected particleboard behaviour and properties. Strength dropped up to 50%. Wider cracks in structure of the particleboards were detected by optical microscopy, namely in ITZ (internal transition zone) of cement matrix and spruce chips."
P2X7 receptor: the regulator of glioma tumor development and survival,"P2X7 is an ionotropic nucleotide receptor, forming the cation channel upon ATP stimulation. It can also function as a large membrane pore as well as transmit ATP-dependent signal without forming a channel at all. P2X7 activity in somatic cells is well-known, but remains poorly studied in glioma tumors. The current paper presents the comprehensive study of P2X7 activity in C6 and glioma cell line showing the wide range of effects the receptor has on glioma biology. We observed that P2X7 stimulation boosts glioma cell proliferation and increases cell viability. P2X7 activation promoted cell adhesion, mitochondria depolarization, and reactive oxygen species overproduction in C6 cells. P2X7 receptor also influenced glioma tumor growth in vivo via activation of pro-survival signaling pathways and ATP release. Treatment with Brilliant Blue G, a selective P2X7 antagonist, effectively inhibited glioma tumor development; decreased the expression of negative prognostic cancer markers pro-survival and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins; and modulated the immune response toward glioma tumor in vivo. Finally, pathway-specific enrichment analysis of the microarray data from human patients also showed an upregulation of P2X7 receptor in gliomas from grades I to III. The presented results shed more light on the role of P2X7 receptor in the biology of this disease."
Machine learning reveals complex effects of climatic means and weather extremes on wheat yields during different plant developmental stages,"Rising weather volatility poses a growing challenge to crop yields in many global breadbaskets. However, empirical evidence regarding the effects of extreme weather conditions on crop yields remains incomplete. We examine the contribution of climate and weather to winter wheat yields in Ukraine, a leading crop exporter with some of the highest yield variabilities observed globally. We used machine learning to link daily climatic data with annual winter wheat yields from 1985 to 2018. We differentiated the impacts of long-term climatic conditions (e.g., temperature) and weather extremes (e.g., heat waves) on yields during the distinct developmental stages of winter wheat. Our results suggest that climatic and weather variables alone explained 54% of the wheat yield variability at the country level. Heat waves, tropical night waves, frost, and drought conditions, particularly during the reproductive and grain filling phase, constitute key factors that compromised wheat yields in Ukraine. Assessing the impacts of weather extremes on crop yields is urgent to inform strategies that help cushion farmers against growing production risks because these extremes will likely become more frequent and intense with climate change."
Improved tolerance of recombinant Chlamydomonas rainhardtii with putative 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde decarboxylase from Pyropia yezoensis to nitrogen starvation,"In a previous study, a putative 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) was highly expressed in a mutant strain of Pyropia yezoensis, which exhibited an improved growth rate compared to its wild strain. To investigate the functional role of the putative ACMSD (Pyacmsd) of P. yezoensis, the putative Pyacmsd was cloned and expressed in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Recombinant C. reinhardtii cells with Pyacmsd (Cr_Pyacmsd) exhibited enhanced tolerance compared to control C. reinhardtii cells (Cr_control) under nitrogen starvation. Notably, Cr_Pyacmsd cells showed accumulation of lipids in nitrogen-enriched conditions. These results demonstrate the role of Pyacmsd in the generation of acetyl-coenzyme A. Thus, it can be used to enhance the production of biofuel using microalgae such as C. reinhardtii and increase the tolerance of other biological systems to nitrogen-deficient conditions."
The human symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron promotes diet-induced obesity by regulating host lipid metabolism,"The gut microbiome plays an important role in lipid metabolism. Consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) alters the bacterial communities in the gut, leading to metabolic disorders. Several bacterial species have been associated with diet-induced obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndrome. However, the mechanisms underlying the control of lipid metabolism by symbiotic bacteria remain elusive. Here, we show that the human symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron aggravates metabolic disorders by promoting lipid digestion and absorption. Administration of B. thetaiotaomicron to HFD-fed mice promoted weight gain, elevated fasting glucose levels, and impaired glucose tolerance. Furthermore, B. thetaiotaomicron treatment upregulated the gene expression of the fatty acid transporter and increased fatty acid accumulation in the liver. B. thetaiotaomicron inhibits expression of the gene encoding a lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4), thereby increasing lipase activity in the small intestine. In particular, we found that B. thetaiotaomicron induced the expression of hepcidin, the master regulator of iron metabolism and an antimicrobial peptide, in the liver. Hepcidin treatment resulted in a decrease in ANGPTL4 expression in Caco-2 cells, whereas treatment with an iron chelator restored ANGPTL4 expression in hepcidin-treated cells. These results indicate that B. thetaiotaomicron-mediated regulation of iron storage in intestinal epithelial cells may contribute to increased fat deposition and impaired glucose tolerance in HFD-fed mice."
"Differential Rotation of the Sun, Helioseismology Data, and Estimation of the Depth of Superconvection Cells","The pixel-to-pixel (p2p) artifact, which occurs due to the discrete nature of matrix receivers, sets an independent frequency standard. For this reason, this effect can be used to study the differential rotation of the Sun based on tracers such as solar faculae. The results are in good agreement with ground-based observations of sunspots and radial velocities; however, they are significantly overestimated when compared with the helioseismological data. This may be due to the fact that magnetic tracers (sunspots, faculae) are captured by the supergranulation grid, which, due to the presence of the leptocline in the upper part of the convective zone, rotates faster than the topmost surface layers of the Sun, the angular velocity of which is recorded by helioseismological methods. Knowledge of the leptocline structure makes it possible to use such a model to estimate the depth of the lower, densest boundary of the superconvection cell (approximately 30 Mm)."
Hemispheric Specialization of the Primate Inferior Parietal Lobule,
Superfast Stellar Pulsations of Hot Stars,"The results of studies of superfast line profile variability in spectra of early-type star on minute and second time scales are reviewed. The spectra of bright OBA stars were obtained with the 6-meter BTA telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory (SAO, Russia). Additionally selected OBA stars were observed with the 1-m telescope of SAO and with the 1.25-m telescope of the Crimean Astronomical Station of SAI, Russia. The variations of the line profiles are analyzed. Regular line profiles variations (LPVs) of the H, HeI, FeII, NII, OII, and SiII in spectra of program stars with periods from 10 to ~120 minutes and amplitudes of 1–2% of the continuum level were detected. The short-time transient quasi-regular LPVs with periods from 1 to 10 minutes and lifetime in the interval 20–100 minutes were also registered. The periods of such transients appeared to be variable. Their frequencies can change up to 20% during their lifetime. A nature of such transients is unknown and a similarity of their generation to that for the five-minute solar oscillations is an open question. A connection between irregular LPVs and local magnetic fields generating the stellar micro-flares is proposed."
"Numerical Simulation of Sub-Terahertz Emission of the Flare Chromosphere: the Event of July 4, 2012","The temporal evolution of thermal bremsstrahlung sub-THz emission from a flare chromosphere and transition region is analyzed based on the F-CHROMA solar flare model database (https://www.fchroma.org) and solar flare observations with the RT-7.5 radio telescope at 93 and 140 GHz on July 4, 2012. The model is based on the RADYN numerical code, which describes the response of chromospheric background plasma to the action of a beam of accelerated electrons in the form of a triangular pulse. The positive slope of the spectrum in the sub-THz frequency range has been formed over the entire burst. A thin layer of low temperature and high plasma density (the so-called chromospheric condensation) appears. It moves to the region of higher altitudes and effectively absorbs the sub-THz emission. It is shown based on the RНESSI hard X-ray observations that the chromospheric thermal plasma cannot provide the observed sub-THz emission fluxes during the solar flare on July 4, 2012. The cause of the obtained discrepancy is discussed."
Interpretation of the Harmonic Structure of Jupiter Radiation in the Decameter Wave Range,"The harmonic structure of the dynamic spectrum of Jupiter’s decameter radio emission observed during a noise storm on November 12, 2012, by the Uran-2 radio telescope (Poltava, Ukraine) is interpreted based on the effect of double plasma resonance with ion-cyclotron harmonics. According to the proposed model, ion-cyclotron waves are effectively generated at frequencies close to the frequency of the lower hybrid resonance in the upper ionosphere of Jupiter, in those regions of source elongation along the magnetic field lines, where the condition of double plasma resonance is satisfied. Extraordinary electromagnetic radiation arises due to the scattering of cyclotron waves by streams of suprathermal electrons. Comparison of the theoretical emission spectrum and the observed dynamic spectrum gives estimates of the plasma distribution in the generation region and the source coordinates."
The Origin of Time Delays between Sub-Terahertz and Soft X-ray Emission from Solar Flares,"The time delays between sub-terahertz (sub-THz) and soft X-ray (SXR) emission from solar flares with a positive spectrum slope at frequencies of >100 GHz are considered. Based on a cross-correlation analysis of the time profiles of sub-THz and SXR emission from 11 flare events obtained from the KOSMA (230 GHz), SST (212 GHz), and RT-7.5 (93 GHz) telescopes, as well as the GOES satellite in channel 1–8 Å, we identified two main types of sub-THz events. Type I includes four X-class events with a well-defined Neupert effect, i.e., the sub-THz flux outpaces the SXR flux by 2–9 min. Type II includes seven M-class flares, in which the time profiles behave similarly and the delays do not exceed 30 s. The different mechanisms of radio emission in different layers of the solar atmosphere may be responsible for the positive slope of the sub-THz spectrum of flares."
Active Longitudes at the Solar Cycle Maxima,The dynamics of “active longitudes” in the years of maxima of 11-year cycles was studied via the decomposition of a series of sunspot numbers into natural orthogonal functions. It was found that three components of the decomposition are sufficient to describe 90% of the variations in the studied series. Four active longitudes are distinguished according to the first decomposition component (82% contribution). Their power changes with the course of the secular cycle of solar activity. The observed effect of the alternation of more enhanced sunspot formation between active longitudes may be associated with global fluctuations in the shape of the toroidal field. The drift of active longitudes in the southern hemisphere and its absence in the northern one in the Carrington coordinate system has been established.
Magnetic-Field Concentration and the Twisted Solar Coronal Loops,"The magnetostatic equilibrium of axisymmetric, cylindrical magnetic flux ropes in the solar corona is considered. The conditions for the concentration of strong (hundreds of gauss) magnetic fields in neutralized (shielded) and non-neutralized (unshielded) flux ropes in which the azimuthal component of the magnetic field in the outer region is either, respectively, zero or continuous on the boundary lateral surface, are discussed. On the example of the generalized, force-free, magnetic Gold–Hoyle configuration, it is shown that non-neutralized flux ropes, in contrast to neutralized ones, are capable of providing a magnetic-field concentration tens of times higher than the background field values at a relatively low (<10) number of turns of magnetic-field lines around the tube axis. The origin of twisted magnetic fields in the solar corona is discussed based on the results."
Estimation of the Energy Flux of Torsional Alfvén Waves in the Lower Solar Atmosphere Based on Measurements of the Doppler Velocities,"The wave-energy flux of torsional Alfvén waves in the stratified solar atmosphere is considered. It is shown that the solar chromospheric stratification should be taken into account in the estimation of the wave-energy flux. Otherwise, the flux will be underestimated by two to three times for wave periods larger than a few minutes. The physical nature and consequences of the results are discussed."
Detection of Optical Flares on the Selected G-M Dwarfs from Long-term Photometric Series,"We have carried out a search for flares from the analysis of light curves for 12 active G, K, and M dwarfs. As sources of data we used ground-based observations in 2000–2020 from the photometric databases ASAS, SuperWASP, KWS. Events of low-amplitude brightening (∆V < 0.25 mag), which possibly could be flares, were revealed for 11 stars. A large number of such increases in brightness were found on K dwarfs. Events of increasing in V-magnitudes to 0.5 mag or more were detected on light curves of one G star, BE Cet, and two M dwarfs. For three flares we could follow their development with time. We have estimated the duration of these flares; they lasted more than an hour, but less than 3 hours. In most cases we could not determine a lifetime of the suggested flares, but we believe that most of the probable flares on the investigated cool dwarfs are short-lived, on the order of several minutes."
Analysis of the Properties of SEP Events and Their Solar Sources Taking Into Account of the Magneto-Morphological Classification of Active Regions,"We studied 87 events of solar cosmic rays, i.e., solar energetic particle (SEP) emissions associated with solar flares of at least M5 class (according to the GOES classification) that occurred during solar cycle 23. A relationship between the spectral parameters of the SEP events and the microwave (MW) emission properties of the related solar flares was analysed. The peak frequency of the MW spectrum was used as an indicator of the acceleration processes during solar flares, which may characterize both the strength of magnetic field in the emission source and the intensity of the accelerated particle flux. The magneto-morphological classification (MMC) was applied to take into account the features of the magnetic topology of the active regions (ARs) that generated flares. Our analysis showed that most of ARs, associated with SEP events with large proton flux, violated at least one of the empirical laws established for sunspot groups (Hale’s law, Joy’s law, or another). The relationships between the spectral properties of electrons and protons and the properties of MW radiation were analyzed and discussed, taking into account the MMC of ARs generated flares associated with SEP events."
Origin of the Continuous Component of the Variation in the Solar and Stellar Activity Spectra,"Analysis of time series of a solar-activity tracer indicates that the spectrum of fluctuation activity, in addition to the main activity cycle, also contains a continuous spectrum of variation. A similar continuous spectrum of variation is characteristic of the observed tracers of stellar activity. The origin of the continuous spectrum of variation in stellar activity has so far been little discussed in terms of dynamo theory. This paper describes various ideas about the origin of this spectrum. It may be the result of the nonlinear processes accompanying the generation of the main activity cycle due to the dynamo mechanism. Direct excitation of a continuous spectrum not associated with the main cycle is also possible. A possible connection between the continuous spectrum of activity and the concept of dynamic chaos in small dynamo models is discussed."
Studies of the Fine Structure of the Solar Photosphere at Pulkovo Observatory,"The study of the fine structure of the solar atmosphere is an important problem in solar physics. There is an opinion that the fundamental physical mechanisms in the solar plasma are related to the processes occurring on the smallest spatial scales (Stenflo, 2012). In turn, elements of the fine photospheric structure observed in the continuum are closely related to the structure of the magnetic field (Rachkovsky et al., 2005). Fine magnetic elements are physically important from the point of view that they contain large amounts of energy in electric currents, which can significantly contribute to both heating of the solar atmosphere and the release of flare energy. The article reviews little-known facts from stratospheric and ground-based studies of the fine photospheric structure performed at Pulkovo Observatory."
Does the interface with plantation forests provide suitable habitat for axis deer (Axis axis) to avoid systematic hunting pressure in a protected area of north-eastern Argentina?,"Axis deer (Axis axis), an introduced invasive species of growing concern around the globe, have rapidly expanded through the southern cone countries in South America. Despite increasing culling efforts over 14 years, axis deer remained abundant at El Palmar National Park in north-eastern Argentina. We tested whether this continued abundance possibly reflected control failures as a result of adjacent plantation forests providing a safe-haven refuge for deer. We carried out a cross-sectional survey of deer faecal pellet groups and tracks in 77 matched pairs of 25 m2 plots deployed at random over the park–plantation interface and assessed the presence of deer trails along the 14.2-km wire fence between both land-use types. The relative odds of having at least one pellet group (occupancy) were 4.5 (95% CI 1.5 to 18.3) times higher among park plots than plantation plots. Using generalized linear mixed models, the relative odds of occupancy decreased significantly with increasing distance to the main permanent water course, but it was 83% lower in plantation plots than in the park plots. Principal component analysis of shrub cover, plant structure and plant height revealed greater shelter within the park. Deer trails were spatially aggregated up to 2300 m and were directly associated with deer occupancy. These results indicate that, in El Palmar National Park interface, plantation forests do not provide a refuge or selected habitat, and suggest instead that the environmental characteristics and diversity of habitats within the protected area are relevant for the effectiveness of the exotic ungulate management program."
A case report of exophytic nasal papilloma with acute dacryocystitis as the first symptom,This study aims to explore a case of exophytic nasal papilloma with acute dacryocystitis as the first symptom.
The effect of moisture on the properties of cement-bonded particleboards made with non-traditional raw materials,"The paper presents research into the changes of properties in cement-bonded particleboards caused by moisture saturation over the course of 504 h. Three particleboard variants were tested, all at the age of 18 months. The first is a standard production-line board manufactured by CIDEM Hranice, a.s. (identified as CP-R). The other two variants were modified by by-products of the particleboard manufacturing process—dust (CP-D) and a particulate mixture (CP-P). The experiment observed changes in the boards’ dimensions, volume, and mass. The effect of moisture on their basic material properties was also investigated. While the boards were being saturated by water, changes in their structure were examined using an optical microscope. It was found that the boards behave differently depending on their composition. Also there were differences in the dynamics of the property changes. The modified particleboards are more susceptible to dimensional and volume changes. Both, volume and mass undergo the most significant changes during the first 24 h. Cracks and air voids inside the wood chips begin to close upon contact with water as a result of swelling. It was observed by optical microscopy that this process occurs within 3 to 5 min since immersion in the water bath. Between 24 and 96 h the rate at which the air voids and pores are closing begins to decrease and there is a difference in the dynamics of mass and volume changes as well. Wet–dry cycling of the boards was analysed as well. Temperature and moisture fluctuations negatively affected particleboard behaviour and properties. Strength dropped up to 50%. Wider cracks in structure of the particleboards were detected by optical microscopy, namely in ITZ (internal transition zone) of cement matrix and spruce chips."
Diatom response to environmental gradients in the high mountain lakes of the Colombia’s Eastern Range,"A survey of 60 high mountain lakes of Colombia’s Eastern Range was performed to evaluate the response of surface-sediment diatoms to environmental variables. In each one of these lakes, water samples were taken for physical and chemical characterization, and diatoms were collected from the superficial bottom sediment at the deepest part. Multivariate statistical analyses were made to determine the relationships between environmental and biological data, specifically which environmental variables explain the diatom distribution. For each of these significant environmental variables, optima and ecological tolerances were calculated using the weighted-average method, which allowed for the classification of the species according to their environmental preferences. The lakes showed a wide range of environmental gradients in variables such as pH, alkalinity, and nutrients. In addition, the depth of the lakes was a direct determinant of the light environment of the water column. A total of 339 diatom taxa were identified belonging mainly to the genera Eunotia and Pinnularia. Variables related to pH-alkalinity gradient, trophic condition (nitrates and phosphorus), and physical factors (radiation at the bottom) had a significant effect on diatom composition. Despite the fact that the total organic carbon environmental range was high, the effect of this variable on diatom species composition was not significant. In conclusion, the diatoms of the studied lakes showed a significant ecological relationship with environmental variables which are potentially important in environmental reconstruction. Diatoms in the study sites can provide useful and independent quantitative information to investigate the recent impacts of global change on tropical high mountain ecosystems."
Lockdown Experiences of 10–13 Year Olds in New Zealand,"The implementation of lockdowns that include the closure of educational facilities for face to face teaching has been one of the strategies used internationally to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Research suggests lockdowns are associated with negative impacts on children’s psycho-social functioning, Most research, however, has been conducted in countries where extended lockdown periods have been in place and has primarily used parent/child survey to gain insight into lockdown effects. The current study was conducted in the context of New Zealand’s initial 7-week national lockdown which allowed examination of the impact of a relatively short lockdown period. Participants (n = 139) aged 10 to 13 years from one school were interviewed face to face about their experiences during lockdown immediately following the re-opening of schools. Participants’ self-concept was also evaluated to gain an understanding of their psycho-social skills after lockdown. Qualitative analysis identified positive and negative features of lockdown from children’s perspectives. Analysis also focused on changes to children’s relationships with close family members during lockdown. The findings have implications for identifying how to optimise lockdown experiences for children."
Rounded atelectasis after exposure to refractory ceramic fibres (RCF),"Refractory Ceramic fibres (RCF) are man-made mineral fibres used in high performance thermal insulation applications. Analogous to asbestos fibres, RCF are respirable, show a pleural drift and can persist in human lung tissue for more than 20 years after exposure. Pleural changes such as localised or diffuse pleural thickening as well as pleural calcification were reported."
"Designing thickness of subgrade for flexible pavements incorporating waste foundry sand, molasses, and lime","This paper presents the efficacy of industrial wastes such as molasses (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) and waste foundry sand (10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%) stabilized clayey soil blended with lime (3%, 6%, 9%, and 12%). The objective of the current research was to develop a composite soil subgrade material for designing the thickness for flexible pavements. Various laboratory tests such as differential free swell, consistency limits, compaction characteristics, and California bearing ratio (CBR) tests were conducted on soil incorporating waste foundry sand and molasses (with/without lime) to find their efficacy to be used as a subgrade material. The laboratory tests revealed that the differential free swell and consistency limits of clayey soil decreased and CBR values increased on adding optimum amount of molasses (10%), waste foundry sand (20%), and lime (9%) alone and in combination with each other. Based on CBR values, the thickness of flexible pavement was designed using IITPAVE software and was also assessed to meet the required criteria based on the IRC: 37-2018 recommendations. The results of the software analysis showed a reduction in the pavement thickness for various values of commercial vehicles per day (1000, 2000, and 5000) for all combinations. The maximum reduction in layer thickness and construction costs is noticed when clayey soil is blended with molasses (10%), waste foundry sand (20%), and lime (3%) in combination with each other. This novel technique of strengthening geotechnical characteristics of subgrade soil is not only helpful for reducing the pavement thickness but is a very cost-effective and also solves the disposal problem of waste foundry sand and molasses."
FTH promotes the proliferation and renders the HCC cells specifically resist to ferroptosis by maintaining iron homeostasis,"Ferroptosis is a newly identified type of programmed cell death, which preferentially targets iron-rich cancer cells such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ferritin heavy chain (FTH) is a major iron storing nanocage to store redox-inactive iron, and harbors ferroxidase activity to prevent the iron-mediated production of ROS. Our previous studies have demonstrated that FTH acts as a protective role to increase the cellular resistance to ferroptosis. However, the specific role of FTH in the development of HCC and ferroptosis resistance remains unclear."
Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO) Coated CP-Ti: Wear Performance on Reciprocating Mode and Chondrogenic–Osteogenic Differentiation,"Biocompatible oxide coatings obtained by plasma electrolyte oxidation (PEO) have been used to improve the surface properties of bone grafts made of titanium. However, few studies explore the occurrence of wear in reciprocating mode. The chondrogenic differentiation over coatings obtained by PEO has not been explored either. These coatings tend to induce the osseointegration by contributing to the osteogenic differentiation behaviour, however, there is no evidence of their influence on the formation of cartilaginous matrix. Thus, this work aimed to investigate the behaviour of cell viability and differentiation (osteogenic and chondrogenic) and the tribological properties of coatings obtained by PEO at different voltages on the CP-Ti substrate for future applications in tissue engineering field. The morphology and structure of the coatings were characterised by scanning electron microscopy, profilometry and X-ray diffraction, respectively. The chemical composition of the coatings was analysed by energy dispersive spectroscopy and Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry. Wear resistance was evaluated in a tribometer, in ball-on-plate configuration and in reciprocating mode. The biological behaviour was characterised by cell viability, adhesion and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells assays. The results showed that the formation of the rutile phase in Ti-PEO250V and Ti-PEO300V coatings influenced the superior wear resistance behaviour, in relation to Ti-PEO200V. Furthermore, it was found that the increase in the applied voltage caused an increase in the incorporation of Ca and P elements in the coatings. Besides this, biological results indicated that all obtained coatings were not cytotoxic, allowing adhesion and consequently cell differentiation in osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages."
Developmental Assets in South African Adolescents Exposed to Violence: a Qualitative Study on Resilience,"Violence exposure is associated with psychological and behavioural maladjustment in adolescents. Yet, not all adolescents exposed to violence experience negative symptoms. Resilience is an outcome that is in part determined by multiple protective factors, or developmental assets, that protect adolescents from the negative influence of encountered stressors and allow them to attain positive developmental outcomes. A qualitative study was conducted to acquire an in-depth understanding of the developmental assets across different layers in the ecological system that promote positive psychological and behavioural functioning in South African adolescents exposed to violence. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with a multi-ethnic group (black, white, and people of mixed heritage) of South African adolescents (boy: n = 17; girl: n = 13; age: 14–19 years) from seven schools in Cape Town. Adolescents reported both internal and external assets that helped them adaptively cope with violence exposure. The internal assets entailed individual characteristics and skills, including commitment to learning, positive values, positive identity, social competencies, and emotional insight. The external assets were boundaries and expectations, social support from adolescents’ peers, family, school, and community, and adolescents’ constructive use of time. The findings of the study may inform strengths-based interventions to enhance emotional and behavioural skills in adolescents at risk for violence exposure. Moreover, involving key stakeholders in the interventions from major developmental domains can be particularly helpful to optimise the social support that are needed for adolescents to be resilient."
Estimating proportion of days covered (PDC) using real-world online medicine suppliers’ datasets,"The proportion of days covered (PDC) is used to estimate medication adherence by looking at the proportion of days in which a person has access to the medication, over a given period of interest. This study aimed to adapt the PDC algorithm to allow for plausible assumptions about prescription refill behaviour when applied to data from online pharmacy suppliers."
Deciphering Solar Magnetic Activity: 140 Years of the ‘Extended Solar Cycle’ – Mapping the Hale Cycle,"We investigate the occurrence of the “extended solar cycle” (ESC) as it occurs in a host of observational data spanning 140 years. Investigating coronal, chromospheric, photospheric, and interior diagnostics, we develop a consistent picture of solar activity migration linked to the 22-year Hale (magnetic) cycle using superposed epoch analysis (SEA) and previously identified Hale cycle termination events as the key time for the SEA. Our analysis shows that the ESC and Hale cycle, as highlighted by the terminator-keyed SEA, is strongly recurrent throughout the entire observational record studied, some 140 years. Applying the same SEA method to the sunspot record confirms that Maunder’s butterfly pattern is a subset of the underlying Hale cycle, strongly suggesting that the production of sunspots is not the fundamental feature of the Hale cycle, but the ESC is. The ESC (and Hale cycle) pattern highlights the importance of \(55^{\circ }\) latitude in the evolution, and possible production, of solar magnetism."
The monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) as a potential pest for agriculture in the Mediterranean basin,"The monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) has been introduced in the last decades to many cities in many parts of the world. For most of this time it has been restricted primarily to urban areas, but it is starting to spread to rural habitats. In its native range, the monk parakeet is considered a pest for agriculture, consuming a wide variety of crops such as grains, fruits, and vegetables. However, there is very little information about its potential role as a pest for agriculture in the areas where it is exotic. Here we conducted an experimental survey of the impact of the monk parakeet on corn in SE Spain using camera traps. The monk parakeet was the animal that produced the highest damage, being responsible for 98.6% of the time employed by all animals consuming corn. The percentage of cobs damaged ranged from 36.8 to 100% depending on the cultivar, whereas the crop loss (measured as the length of the cob consumed with respect to the total length of the cob) ranged from 17.7 to 71.1%. The results suggest that the monk parakeet may be a serious pest for agriculture in the Mediterranean basin if their populations continue growing."
A study of the phosphorylation proteomic skin characteristics of Tan sheep during the newborn and er-mao stages,"In this experiment, in order to study the formation mechanism of the lamb fur of Tan sheep, skin samples were collected from Tan sheep at the newborn and er-mao stages. Then, the phosphorylated proteomes of the skin samples of Tan sheep at the two different stages were compared and analyzed using a TMT labeled quantitative phosphorylation proteomic technique. A total of 2806 phosphorylated proteins were identified, including 8184 phosphorylation sites. The results of this study’s quantitative analysis showed that when compared with the skin samples at the er-mao stage, the phosphorylation levels of 171 sites had been upregulated in the skin samples at newborn stage. Meanwhile, 125 sites had been downregulated at the same stage. As shown by the results of the functional enrichment analysis of the differentially phosphorylated proteins, they had been mainly enriched in the cysteine and methionine metabolism. In addition, the phosphorylation levels of KAP4.7 and KAP13.1 had also varied during the different skin stages. These results indicated that the cysteine metabolism pathways, as well as the phosphorylation modifications of the keratin associated proteins in the skin, played important roles in the formation of the er-mao stage fur of the Tan sheep. Therefore, the findings of this study provided a new angle for interpreting the formation mechanism of er-mao stage fur properties."
Crack Occurrence in Bodies with Gradient Polyconvex Energies,"In a set of infinitely many reference configurations differing from a chosen fit region \({\mathscr {B}}\) in the three-dimensional space and from each other only by possible crack paths, a set parameterized by special measures, namely curvature varifolds, energy minimality selects among possible configurations of a continuous body those that are compatible with assigned boundary conditions of Dirichlet-type. The use of varifolds allows us to consider both “material phase"" (cracked or non-cracked) and crack orientation. The energy considered is gradient polyconvex: it accounts for relative variations of second-neighbor surfaces and pressure-confinement effects. We prove existence of minimizers for such an energy. They are pairs of deformations and curvature varifolds. The former ones are taken to be SBV maps satisfying an impenetrability condition. Their jump set is constrained to be in the varifold support."
Effect of microchannel protrusion on the bulk acoustic wave-induced acoustofluidics: numerical investigation,"Acoustofluidics inside the microchannel has already found its wide applications recently. Acoustic streaming and radiation force are two underlying mechanisms that determine the trajectory of microparticles and cells in the manipulation. Critical particle size of viscous effects is found to be about 1.6 µm in the conventional rectangular microchannel (W × H = 380 m × 160 m) at the frequency of 2 MHz, below which the acoustic streaming dominants, and is independent of the driving voltage. In order to effectively adjust such a critical size, a approach is proposed and evaluated numerically to enhance the acoustic streaming by adding some protrusions (i.e., in the shape of a wedge, rod, half-ellipse) to the middle of the top or bottom wall. It is found that the resonant frequency and acoustic pressure will decrease and the acoustic streaming velocity will increase significantly, respectively, with the increase of protrusion height (up to 30 µm while keeping the width the same as 8 µm). Subsequently, trajectory motion patterns of microparticles have apparent changes in comparison to those inside the rectangular microchannel, and acoustic streaming can even dominate the motion of large microparticles (i.e., 10 µm). As a result, the critical particle size could be increased up to 72.5 µm. Furthermore, different protrusion shapes (i.e., wedge, rod, half-ellipse) on the top wall were compared. The sharpness of protrusion at its tip seems to determine the acoustic streaming velocity. The wedge attached to the bottom wall had higher resonant frequency and lower acoustic streaming velocity compared with the top wedge in the same dimension. The patterns of acoustic streaming and microparticle trajectory motion in the microchannel with dual wedges on the top and bottom walls are not the superposition of those of the top and bottom wedge individually. In summary, the geometry of the microchannel has a significant effect on the induced acoustofluidics by the bulk acoustic waves. A much larger acoustic streaming velocity is produced at the tip of the protrusion to change the critical size of microparticles between acoustic streaming and radiation force. It suggests that more applications of acoustofluidics (i.e., mixing and sonoporation) to microparticles and cells in various sizes are feasible by designing an appropriate geometry of the microchannel."
"Chemical composition, antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of Murraya paniculata (L.) Jack leaf essential oil from Assam, India: the effect of oil on cellular morphology of micro-organisms","Murraya paniculata (L.) Jack is commonly cultivated as ornamental plant in Assam and has been used as spice and phytomedicine traditionally for many healthcare purposes. The therapeutic potential and chemical constituents of the essential oil of M. paniculata leaf was investigated against several pathogenic microbial species and human cancer cell lines. 29 chemical compounds were identified by GC–MS analysis from the essential oil representing 97.62% of the oil. The major compound identified was caryophyllene (20.93%). Leaf essential oil exhibited promising antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis (MIC = 4 µg/mL) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC = 4 µg/mL). Best anticancer activity of the oil was observed for HeLa cells (IC50 = 6.28 μg/mL). Further, scanning electron microscopic studies revealed that the oil kills micro-organisms with the deformation of cellular morphology on treatment of the oil. Thus, the essential oil of M. paniculata leaf can be an excellent alternative for development of new antimicrobials and anticancer chemotherapeutic agents for the pharmaceutical industries."
Analysis of primary metabolites of Morchella fruit bodies and mycelium based on widely targeted metabolomics,"As a medicinal and edible homologous fungi, Morchella is rich in multiple metabolites. The metabolite is a kind of essential substance with active components. In this study, Morchella fruit bodies and mycelium were selected to identify their metabolite components. The primary metabolites of the two experimental groups were analyzed using a method of widely targeted metabolome based on UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. A total of 354 different metabolites were characterized, including 188 upregulated ones and 166 downregulated ones in the fruit bodies. Further, the main 20 metabolic pathways of the metabolites were analyzed. The first 9 ones are tyrosine metabolites, thyroid hormone biosynthetic pathway, phenylalanine metabolites, linoleic metabolites synthetic pathway, glycerophosphate metabolic pathway, choline in tumors, methyl butyl metabolites, arginine synthetic pathway, arginine and proline metabolites. This study provides theoretical basis for the analysis of metabolic pathway of Morchella fruit bodies and mycelium that serve for further research of their medicinal mechanism and effective components."
On the Existence of Linearly Oscillating Galaxies,"We consider two classes of steady states of the three-dimensional, gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system: the spherically symmetric Antonov-stable steady states (including the polytropes and the King model) and their plane symmetric analogues. We completely describe the essential spectrum of the self-adjoint operator governing the linearized dynamics in the neighborhood of these steady states. We also show that for the steady states under consideration, there exists a gap in the spectrum. We then use a version of the Birman-Schwinger principle first used by Mathur to derive a general criterion for the existence of an eigenvalue inside the first gap of the essential spectrum, which corresponds to linear oscillations about the steady state. It follows in particular that no linear Landau damping can occur in the neighborhood of steady states satisfying our criterion. Verification of this criterion requires a good understanding of the so-called period function associated with each steady state. In the plane symmetric case we verify the criterion rigorously, while in the spherically symmetric case we do so under a natural monotonicity assumption for the associated period function. Our results explain the pulsating behavior triggered by perturbing such steady states, which has been observed numerically."
Designing business model taxonomies – synthesis and guidance from information systems research,"Classification is an essential approach in business model research. Empirical classifications, termed taxonomies, are widespread in and beyond Information Systems (IS) and enjoy high popularity as both stand-alone artifacts and the foundation for further application. In this article, we focus on the study of empirical business model taxonomies for two reasons. Firstly, as these taxonomies serve as a tool to store empirical data about business models, we investigate their coverage of different industries and technologies. Secondly, as they are emerging artifacts in IS research, we aim to strengthen rigor in their design by illustrating essential design dimensions and characteristics. In doing this, we contribute to research and practice by synthesizing the diffusion of business model taxonomies that helps to draw on the available body of empirical knowledge and providing artifact-specific guidance for building taxonomies in the context of business models."
A mixed clustering-based approach for a territorial hydrological regionalization,"Population growth, the intensification of human activities, the impact of natural hazards related to water and climate change, directly and indirectly, affect the availability of water resources. This requires rational and sustainable management of water resources. Thus, it is essential to conduct a comprehensive assessment of available water resources based on current and future needs. This assessment involves collecting and processing hydrological data to provide reliable information on water resources’ status and evolution. However, the non-availability and lack of hydrological data constrain the process of this assessment. Therefore, we propose in this work to adopt a clustering analysis based-regionalization approach combining multivariate data analysis (PCA) and clustering algorithms (HAC and KM) to delineate watersheds’ homogeneous clusters. Clustering analysis produces groups of watersheds based on their similarity which will allow the transfer of data from gauged sites to ungauged sites. At the end of the present study, 6 clusters of watersheds were identified. These identified clusters have their characteristics in terms of surface, perimeter, length of the equivalent rectangle, time of concentration, and land use. Based on result validation indicators (cross-validation approach), the studied catchment areas have been assigned to the clusters that represent them the best."
Assessment of rock drillability by the method of analytic hierarchy process combined with fuzzy comprehensive evaluation,"Comprehensively and reliably assessing the rock drillability is a vital prerequisite for guiding the rapid construction of pile foundation engineering. This paper studies rock drillability and its evaluation method. We established a grading standard of influencing factors by analyzing the factors that influence drilling, according to the physical–mechanical properties of rock and actual drilling characteristics. Based on the hierarchy of these factors, a two-layer fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model is proposed. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to determine the weight of each stage factor, the fuzzy sets method is used to determine the membership function, and the influencing factors are ranked. This model was applied to the construction of the 2nd Humen Bridge Project. The results show that the physical properties of rock have the greatest impact on drillability, and the weight is 0.443. The content of quartz and iron in the physical properties is the prime factor affecting the rock drillability. The results of assessment and calculation are in line with the site conditions, which validate the feasibility and practicability of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method for the rock drillability established in this paper. This study can also serve as guidelines for other rock-drilling engineering."
Boolean Satisfiability Methods for Modern Computer-Aided Design Problems in Microelectronics,"The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) methods are one of the efficient approaches used to solve the problems of Boolean matching and the equivalence checking of digital circuits. In combination with classic routing algorithms and optimization techniques, these methods demonstrate better results than the classic routing algorithms in terms of the speed of operation and the quality of the results. In this paper, the modern practice of using the SAT methods in computer-aided design systems for VLSI is analyzed. The examples of modern SAT approaches to the problems of routing and the formal equivalence checking of digital circuits’ descriptions within the technological mapping as a part of the FPGA design flow are considered. The algorithm of the detailed routing of the FPGA switching blocks using the satisfiability problem is developed and presented. The results of its work are demonstrated on the example of the programmable logic block of the integrated circuit 5400TP094 made in Russia. The block has the island architecture, where the configurable logic blocks and switching blocks form a regularly repeated layout template. The properties of the chosen classic architecture allow us to expand the region of the presented algorithm to the entire class of island style of FPGA. The algorithm is tested on the project benchmarks ISCAS-85, ISCAS-89, and LGSynth-89. The comparison of the developed SAT-based algorithm with the well-known routing algorithm Pathfinder is presented by the criteria of the elapsed time and the achieved degree of routed nets in the switching blocks. It is specified that the considered Boolean satisfiability methods for the routing problem are capable to prove the circuit’s unroutability, unlike the Pathfinder algorithm whose results can only implicitly indicate it. The paper demonstrates that the application of a more efficient SAT solver significantly accelerates the work of the suggested detailed routing algorithm."
Improving the Performance of a Multibit Arithmetic Logic Unit,"In modern microprocessors, the arithmetic logic units (ALUs) with the accelerated transfer organization, which are faster than ALUs with the sequential organization of arithmetic transfer, are widely used to reduce time costs. However, as the input data capacity increases, the operating time of such ALUs increases linearly with an increase in the number of bits. Developing an efficient ALU to deliver better performance than the existing known solutions is a pressing challenge. In this study, ALUs with the sequential and accelerated organization of arithmetic transfer are analyzed. A multidigit ALU is developed to increase the operating speed. All the ALU schemes were modeled in the CAD Altera Quartus-II environment. The number of gates and the maximum delay in the ALU circuit simulation report are compared for 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits. A results verification scheme is implemented to confirm the reliability of the developed ALU. It is found that when performing operations with 64-bit operands, the developed ALU reduces the maximum delay by 53% compared to ALUs with the sequential organization of the arithmetic transfer and by 35.5% compared to ALUs with the accelerated organization of the arithmetic transfer."
Functionality of the Acousto-Optic Delay Lines outside the Cutoff Frequency,"An acousto-optic delay line (AODL) is an effective tool for signal processing in the time domain. A smoothly controlled signal delay over a wide time interval allows high-performance radar simulators to be built based on an AODL. This paper considers the AODL’s design and marks the parameters that determine the limit of using its capabilities. The features of the photoelastic interaction in an AODL are investigated for the case when the duration of the input pulse is shorter than the time of crossing the optical beam by an elastic wave packet. It is found that under these conditions the duration of the output response is determined by the time taken to cross the optical beam by an elastic wave packet and does not depend on the duration of the input action. It is shown that the AODL response to the input action in the form of a rectangular pulse is determined as the sum of three terms. In this case, the first term is determined by the process of entry of the elastic wave packet into the optical beam; the second, by the process of propagation of the elastic wave packet in the aperture of the optical beam; and the third, by the process of the exit of the elastic wave packet from the aperture of the optical beam. The corresponding equations for calculating the parameters of the pulse at the output of the AODL are obtained. It is shown that for a sufficiently short input pulse duration, the parameters of the output signal contain information on the energy-geometric characteristics of the laser radiation. The established provisions and patterns are confirmed by the numerical calculations. The numerical simulation results are tested on the AODL prototype with direct detection. A comparative analysis of the results of the theoretical and experimental studies show that AODL can also be used at frequencies above the boundary, both in terms of its main functional purpose and for solving a number of other radio engineering problems."
Experimental study on seepage-induced concentrated leak erosion in sand under triaxial testing conditions,"Seepage-induced engineering geology disasters such as sinkholes, foundation pits, and road collapses have resulted in massive economic losses and serious casualties in recent decades, with a major mechanism involved being sand internal erosion. In this research, a novel flexible-wall triaxial test apparatus is developed based on the conventional triaxial device to simulate concentrated leak erosion in sand using artificial quartz sand soil samples. Erosion tests are performed under different hydraulic gradients to study the variations of eroded soil mass and permeability. The results indicate that by increasing the applied hydraulic gradient, the position of the sunken portion (where large quantities of quartz sand particles are missing) elevates in the sample. Furthermore, particle loss rate and permeability coefficient show major variations under different hydraulic gradients. As the hydraulic gradient increases, the erosion rate of quartz sand content increases significantly accompanied by an increase in permeability. However, the start-up time and the duration of soil mass erosion as well as the variation in the permeability coefficient decrease. This study provides valuable insight into the mechanisms coupling the stress state, hydraulic gradient, and concentrated leak erosion phenomenon in sand."
Passive earth pressure against rigid retaining wall based on Kötter’s equation,"To study the shape of sliding fracture surface of the soil with the mode of translational mode for retaining wall, model tests were conducted. The deformation and shear strain of granular sand were analyzed by particle image velocimetry. The tests show that the slip failure surface is a concave surface, with the lower part passing through the wall heel and the upper part sliding out from the top of the soil. The horizontal displacement increases continuously, the shear strain of soil increases correspondingly, and the clear shear fracture zone gradually forms on the sliding surface. The shape of the slip surface is approximately a logarithmic spiral surface at ultimate state. Based on the test results, the failure surface is assumed to be logarithmic spiral. The distribution of soil counterforce at the sliding interface obeys Kötter’s equation, and a mechanical model is put forward for analysis. The resultant passive thrust and the logarithmic spiral fracture curve shape can be obtained by an optimization algorithm. According to the moment balance condition, the height of the acting point of the resultant thrust can be obtained. Then, the pressure distribution along the wall is induced based on the soil counterforce distribution of the sliding curve by using the level element layer method. The resultant passive thrust calculated by the integral optimization approach is consistent with that calculated by the level layer method. With the growing of the internal friction and the wall-soil friction, the resultant passive thrust buildups. Compared with the popular theoretical calculation approaches, it is apparent that the passive earth pressure coefficient calculated by the present approach is smaller, and a better optimization solution can be obtained. The distribution law of passive earth pressure induced by the present approach agrees with the existing theoretical approach. With the increase of depth, the passive earth pressure strength rises, and the strength of lower soil layer rises obviously."
"Morphometric and Reproductive Features of the Two-Streaked Snake-Eyed Skink (Ablepharus bivittatus (Menetries 1832), Reptilia, Scincidae) in the Talysh Mountains","The results of a study on the morphometric and reproductive characteristics of the two-streaked snake-eyed skink, Ablepharus bivittatus, in the mountain-xerophytic belt of the Talysh Mountains are presented. Animals were collected in May 2018 and May 2019 in the vicinity of the villages of Khanegah-e-Oliya, Minaabad, Mirzanek, and Anbaran, all near the town of Namin, Namin region, Ardabil Province, Islamic Republic of Iran. Some females were kept in the laboratory for egg laying. The body length of adult males in the population studied was 39.1–47.3 mm; that of females was 42.4–54.4 mm, and that of young lizards (yearlings) was 30.5–39.0 mm. Sexual dimorphism is marked in two dimensions and five indices. Pregnant females had a body length of 42.4–53.7 mm. In the oviducts, females contained from one to four eggs. The captured females laid eggs in laboratory conditions from May 20 to June 11. Clutches contained 2–4 eggs. The eggs had a length of 8.2–11.9 mm, width of 3.9–5.9 mm, and had a mass of 0.165–0.210 g. The egg survival rate during incubation was 72%. Young lizards in the laboratory hatched in the period from July 9 to 18. Incubation lasted 43–56 days. The body length (SVL) of juveniles immediately upon hatching was 20.6–24.0 mm, and the tail was 26.8–38 mm in length. The weight of newborn lizards was 0.185–0.256 g. The data obtained are compared to the results of other studies."
"On Time and Environment of Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis Jäger 1839 (Mammalia, Rhinoceratidae) in Altai and Northeastern Russia","The remains of the extinct Merck’s rhinoceros (Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis (Jäger 1839)), well studied in Western Europe, are rare in Russia. However, thanks to the work of a number of researchers, the geography of the finds and the reconstructed range of the species have been significantly expanded. The time of the optimal existence of Merck’s rhinoceros in Yakutia is now recognized as the Middle Pleistocene; the latest finds, dating from the beginning of the late Pleistocene, are known from the southeast of Western Siberia. We provide new radiocarbon dates for the root of a tooth and bone tissue from a previously unstudied lower jaw of the Merck’s rhinoceros from Altai (AltR), whose taxonomic identity we confirm using genomic analysis. Both dates provide an age estimate of around 40 thousand years, which corresponds to the Karginsky time (MIS 3), and are the youngest for the species on the territory of Russia. The pollen spectrum from the soil filling the bone canal characterizes plant communities of open landscapes with forest areas on the upland or in the floodplain, and reflects either local features of the environment or communities of the cold stage within the Karginsky interstadial. A second Merck’s rhinoceros from the Chondon River (ChR), in extreme northeast Yakutia, was determined by previous researchers to have lived either 45–70 thousand years ago or during the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene. Considering what habitats were available in the region, we propose that the ChR could have lived during the last—Kazantsevo—interglacial (MIS 5e) or later. Both finds, AltR and ChR, extend the temporal range of the species existence."
"Breeding Biology of the Crested Auklet (Aethia cristatella, Alcidae, Charadriiformes) in the Northern Part of the Sea of Okhotsk","The breeding biology of the crested auklet, Aethia cristatella, was studied over the period 1989–2019 on Talan Island, Tauiskaya Bay, Sea of Okhotsk. In the early 1990s, the breeding population numbered about 950 000 individuals. In subsequent years, their numbers decreased to 35 000–70 000 individuals in 2016–2017. The onset of egg laying varied from May 18 to June 2 depending on ice conditions, the long-term average being May 22nd. Hatching of chicks lasted from June 19th to July 7th, the average date being June 26th. The weight of hatchlings was 20–40 g (average 31.4). The maximum weight of chicks in the nest averaged between years from 156 to 296 g. By the time of departure to the sea, it amounted to 134–289 g, while the average chick growth rates among the nests varied from 3.5 to 7.4 g/day. Young birds left the island at the end of July to August, at an average age of 30–36 days. Some of them reached the sea, successfully flying off the slope, while the others descended to the ground and significantly lost weight. The average weight of the chicks captured on the ground varied from 109 to 177 g, and in some individuals from 80 to 270 g. There were flying birds among them, but probably those that failed to reach the sea, with a wing length of no less than 120 mm and a weight of no less than 180 g. Their share in favorable years exceeded 60%. Among the others, there were depressive and unhealthy individuals, often still covered with fluff, with a small weight and short wings. In unfavorable years, the vast majority were such, while the total number of the young birds encountered increased multifold. The reproductive success varied from 0 to 90.6% (on average, 35.6), and the egg hatching success ranged from 0 to 95% (on average, 66.1), while the fledging success ranged from 0 to 96.7% (on average, 44.5). The breeding success rates declined markedly beginning in 2007, and since 2014 zero breeding success has become regular. The main limiting factor of the reproductive success of crested auklets was the availability and abundance of their food in Tauiskaya Bay. Over the last few years, the food supply has noticeably worsened due to climatic and hydrological changes in the northern part of the Sea of Okhotsk. Among the land and avian predators that inhabit the Talan Island and contribute to the death rate of crested auklet adults, chicks, egg clutches, and fledging are the peregrine falcon, Steller’s sea eagle, the raven, the slate-baked gull, the ermine, the red fox, and three species of voles. The most noticeable damage to the population is caused by the peregrine falcon, with crested auklets amounting to 30–60% of its bird diet obtained on the island during the entire season."
Implemented Reproduction of the Taimyr Wild Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in Pyasina Migratory Flows in the 2006–2007 Reproductive Cycle,"The results of studying the implemented reproduction of local migratory flows of the Taimyr wild reindeer population in the middle reaches of the Pyasina River, at the border of the western and central parts of the Taimyr Peninsula (71°30′–71°43′ N), Siberia, in the postnatal period in 2007, are presented. Comparison of reproduction in two different migratory flows has shown a lower fecundity in the Puropyasina branch of the reindeer population, with 47 calves per 100 adult females recorded. These rates were 64 calves per 100 adult females in the second, Tareya–Pyasina local branch. In both migratory flows studied (n = 546) with various levels of barrenness, animals of all reproductive ages, ranging from two to 16 years, were involved in breeding in different age groups. However, the maximum contribution to reproduction belongs to seven-year-old females, the most numerous and fecund generation in both flows."
Influence of Social Conditions on Humoral Adaptive Immunity in Bank (Clethrionomys glareolus) and Gray-Sided (Clethrionomys rufocanus) Voles: An Experimental Study,"The effect of the population density on humoral adaptive immunity in bank (Clethrionomys glareolus) and gray-sided (C. rufocanus) voles has been studied. We used 20-, 40-, and 60-day-old voles born in a vivarium from females captured in the field (May–August). The rearing of voles in the brood groups after the end of lactation modeled a high population density without the possibility of dispersal. The low density was modeled by isolated rearing of the animals after weaning. Тhe number of spleen antibody-forming cells, formed in response to the administration of sheep erythrocytes, was considered an indicator of humoral immunity. We studied animals at the age of 20, 40, and 60 days. Regardless of the population density, the humoral immunity was higher in the bank vole. There were no sex differences in either species. The effect of the density of the social environment on the immunity depended on the species and birth dates of individuals. Without taking into account the birth dates, this indicator was higher for red voles kept in brood groups. The sensitivity of the immune system to social stimuli depended on the birth date of individuals. Regardless of the rearing conditions, voles born in May had a similar level of immunity in all age groups. These differences appeared at the age of 60 days in individuals born in June and at the age of 40 days in individuals born in July and August. The immunity of the gray-sided vole depended on the population density only indirectly, through thermoregulation conditions. In isolated two-month-old individuals of this species born in August, low ambient temperatures caused immunosuppression. The formation of the immune system of both vole species competed with growth processes without influencing maturation."
Home Range Use by a Male Siberian Musk Deer (Moschus moschiferus L.) in Central Sikhote-Alin,"Movements of male musk deer in coniferous forests of the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve were studied in 2014–2015 to identify relationships between the home range use and environmental factors and the social environment. The methodology included multiple-day snow tracking, visual observations of musk deer individuals accustomed to humans, radiotracking, and habitat analysis. GIS technologies and mathematical data processing were used as well. The following home range usage variant was identified: the musk deer male maintains the size (1.02–1.1 km2) and shape of its home range for a long time by redistributing its activity within the general activity center of the home range (39% of its size). The home ranges of male musk deer neighbors overlap with the home range of the resident by 64.7–65.5%; and the activity center is overlapped by 53.5%. The amount of main forages (epiphytic lichens) in the home ranges exceeded the needs of the musk deer by 60–300 times in various periods; food is available throughout the entire study area. In such conditions, the distribution of male musk deer activities and scent marks, as well as its movement patterns, are primarily determined by the social environment, including the distribution of females and visits of male neighbors to activity cores. Contacts between males are mostly remote. The distribution of musk deer trajectoryes includes wide ‘patrolling belts’ and a central system that connects local activity cores. This structure is consistent both with relief forms and the boundaries of plant communities. The musk deer male spends more than 84% of the time in the activity center of its home range due to frequent visits of male neighbors. As a result, the resident male forms modules as functional elements of the structure; within these modules, the studied musk deer maintains its life activities and ensures the territorial protection of its home range in the form of a “watch,” thus creating barriers against incursions of male neighbors."
"The Importance of Hauling Grounds in the Life of the Baikal Seals (Pusa sibirica Gmelin 1788, Pinnipedia): 2. Behavior on Hauling Grounds","Based on the literature record, some forms of the behavior of the Baikal seal (Pusa sibirica) are described, both on coastal hauling grounds and in their immediate vicinity. This includes territorial behavior, social relationships, thermoregulation behavior, play, and other forms of behavior on the hauling grounds; the animals making feeding trips are characterized. Special attention is paid to sleep and nutrition, as well as molting. An attempt is made to assess the use of different sensory organs (vision, smell, hearing, etc.) in their life on the hauling grounds. The effectiveness of preying on fish is noted to be determined by using both vision and vibrissae. Several characteristic postures of the seal are described."
Nuclear Physical Properties of Austenitic Nickel and Manganese Steels under Neutron Irradiation in Nuclear Fission (Fast) and Fusion Reactors,"The nuclear physical properties of austenitic chromium-nickel steel EK-164 (Fe–16Cr–19Ni–2Mo–2Mn–Nb–Ti–B) and its manganese-based modifications EK-164Mn (Fe–16Cr–20Mn–2Mo–Nb–Ti–B) and EK-164MnW (Fe–16Cr–20Mn–2W–Nb–Ti–B) under irradiation (up to 5 effective years) in the neutron spectra of fast power (BN-600) and thermonuclear (DEMO-C) reactors and after irradiation (nuclear cooling up to 1000 years) were determined. The investigations were based on using the ACDAM-2.0 calculation complex with consideration of the elemental (alloying and impurity) compositions of steels and typical neutron spectra of fission (BN-600) and fusion (DEMO-C) reactors. The entire set of nuclear physical characteristics of steels (primary radiation damage; transmutation of elements; radiogenic accumulation of elements, including hydrogen, helium, and boron; γ-dose rate; radioactivity; nuclear energy release; isotope contributions) is obtained and their comparative analysis is performed. The time intervals for fulfilling the criteria of low activation of steels after irradiation (γ-dose rate less than 10 mSv/h, radioactivity less than 1010 Bq/kg, energy release less than 10 W/m3) were determined."
Stationary Operated Lithium In-Vessel Elements of a Tokamak,The concept of plasma facing elements (PFE) of a stationary fusion tokamak reactor based on the use of stagnant or slow-flowing liquid lithium enclosed in a capillary-porous structure which allows integrating the advantages of liquid metal with the possibility of its uniform distribution over the surface and ensuring a high stability under the influence of magnetohydrodynamic forces is considered in this study. Heat removal is provided by thermal conductivity through the PFE structure to the coolant. Development of the PFE design includes the creation and testing of a series of models of experimental devices such as a limiter and a divertor target with external systems of lithium refilling/change and heat removal designed for research in modeling conditions of bench installations and the T-11M tokamak. The paper presents the design and main parameters of such devices.
Neutron Collimator for the Diagnostic System of Neutral Particle Analyzers of the ITER Tokamak,"A neutron collimator is developed to attenuate the neutron flux and reduce the residual induced activity in the interportal space of the diagnostic system of neutral particle analyzers of the ITER tokamak reactor. The collimator is installed in the port plug of the ITER vacuum vessel in front of an inlet to the vacuum pipeline of the diagnostic system. The collimator design has a cellular structure with 80% transparency for the neutral atom beam that goes out of the plasma and is recorded by the analyzers. However, because of increased scattering of neutrons in the collimator, their flux in the interportal room in the service zone of diagnostic systems of equatorial port no. 11 is significantly reduced and allows the equivalent dose rate in this zone to be decreased by several times. Thermal analysis showed that, during the reactor operation in modes with generation of the maximum power of 500 MW, the plasma radiation will cause the heating of the collimating grid to a temperature not exceeding 250°C, which makes it possible to select the stainless steel (316L(N)-ITER grade) as a material for manufacturing the collimator. In this case the cyclic strength of the collimator meets the ITER requirements, and it can be used without replacement during the entire deuterium-tritium experiment of the tokamak reactor."
Molten Metal Transport along the Surface under the Effect of Plasma Flows Typical of Transient Processes in Tokamaks,"The metal surface erosion under powerful plasma pulse flows typical of transient processes in tokamaks, ELMs, and plasma disruptions and simulated on a quasistationary plasma accelerator (QSPA) is studied. The hillock relief formation on the molten metal surface over which the plasma flow parallel to the surface moves and also the formation of metal jets moving in the direction of the plasma flow are considered. On the basis of the motion of the jets, the molten metal transport along the surface and the erosion of this surface are explained."
Discharge Chamber Plasma-Chemical Conditioning in Magnetic Confinement Fusion Devices (Review),"Plasma-chemical deposition of a protective coating on the first wall of a fusion device using a chemically active gas (precursor) remains to date one of the primary ways to protect the plasma against cooling impurities. This method has proved effective and does not require the use of additional and expensive equipment. The process in which a boron-containing gas is used as a precursor is referred to as boronization. This paper considers various aspects of using carborane for boronization, including the structure and properties of resultant boron-carbon films; results of boronization for different fusion devices and different precursors; effect of boronization on working plasma pulses; boronization in a low-temperature glow discharge plasma as compared to that in a high-temperature plasma of fusion devices at working pulses with ohmic, ECR, and ICR plasma heating; and the possibility of using boronization during operation of fusion devices."
"Impact of Deuterium Plasma Flux on Fusion Reactor Materials: Radiation Damage, Surface Modification, Erosion","Results of the complex experimental research of plasma impact on fusion reactor materials are presented. The near-wall plasma of a tokamak reactor is simulated on the linear plasma device LENTA (National Research Center Kurchatov Institute). Plasma fluence of 1022–1023 cm–2 to the material surface is provided at 1012–1013 cm–3 of plasma density in steady-state operation of the device, thus simulating the continuous regime of the fusion reactor plasma-wall conditions. The neutron effect on the first wall material (radiation damage) is also simulated by irradiation with high-energy ions accelerated by a cyclotron to MeV-range energies. The work is centered mainly on tungsten being a candidate for coating of the divertor region in the tokamak reactor. Samples irradiated at doses of 1021–1023 ion/cm2 to a high damage level from 0.1 to 80–100 displacements per atom characteristic of a durable operation of the reactor have been obtained on the cyclotron at the National Research Center Kurchatov Institute. Helium, carbon, and nitrogen ions and protons whose defect generation mechanisms are very different have been used in irradiations. Erosion data (erosion rate, erosion yield), swelling characteristics (profilometry), and microstructure changes (SEM) of the damaged surface layer are given for tungsten preirradiated with fast nitrogen ions. Proton-irradiated silicon carbide SiC has also been studied in deuterium plasma, and changes in its microstructure are found."
Numerical Study of Plasma Discharges in KTM Tokamak in Autumn Campaign 2019,The work presents some simulation results of discharge scenarios at the KTM facility during the autumn campaign 2019. The parameters for providing the plasma breakdown phase of the tokamak are estimated. The experimental data of plasma discharges in the KTM are confirmed by the numerical simulation results. The discharge 3669 is simulated in the mode of given currents in poloidal field coils. The simulation data show that the plasma current exceeds 100 kA. Some recommendations for the achievement of higher plasma discharge parameters are proposed.
Instabilities in Technical Superconductors,"Characteristic regularities of development of thermoelectrodynamic processes in current-carrying elements of superconducting magnet systems are discussed. It is shown that, under certain conditions, the process of penetration of a magnetic flux can acquire an avalanche-like character, much like the development of a chain reaction of neutron fission. As a result, the inevitable increase in temperature can destroy the superconducting state of the current-carrying element. Analysis of nonisothermal states is compared with the results of the existing theory that neglects stable finite overheating before the occurrence of unstable states. The mode of penetration of an external magnetic field into a thermally insulated superconductor, when the errors of isothermal approximation are the most significant, is considered."
Implemented Reproduction of the Taimyr Wild Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in Pyasina Migratory Flows in the 2006–2007 Reproductive Cycle,"The results of studying the implemented reproduction of local migratory flows of the Taimyr wild reindeer population in the middle reaches of the Pyasina River, at the border of the western and central parts of the Taimyr Peninsula (71°30′–71°43′ N), Siberia, in the postnatal period in 2007, are presented. Comparison of reproduction in two different migratory flows has shown a lower fecundity in the Puropyasina branch of the reindeer population, with 47 calves per 100 adult females recorded. These rates were 64 calves per 100 adult females in the second, Tareya–Pyasina local branch. In both migratory flows studied (n = 546) with various levels of barrenness, animals of all reproductive ages, ranging from two to 16 years, were involved in breeding in different age groups. However, the maximum contribution to reproduction belongs to seven-year-old females, the most numerous and fecund generation in both flows."
Multicriteria Collision Risk Ranking of Aircraft by Data from an Onboard Radar Station,"An option of multicriteria collision risk ranking of aircraft by data from an onboard radar station (OBRS) is proposed. This method can be used as a basis for developing an autonomous aircraft collision avoidance system in areas of heavy air traffic. Within this problem, criteria and indicators determining a conflict situation are considered. It is proposed to use the following indicators: distance of the aircraft’s closest approach to the radar carrier aircraft, time of reaching the collision area boundary, distance to the controlled aircraft, and time before possible encounter. Four-stage procedures of aircraft ranking according to these indicators, which provide reliable prevention of their collisions, are recommended. Specific relations are derived for implementing the proposed option of aircraft ranking in the antenna coordinate system based on measurements carried out by OBRS and an autonomous navigation system."
Numerical Analysis of Parameters of Pseudosurface Acoustic Waves in Lithium Niobate and Tantalate Crystals,"The results of the analysis and calculation of the propagation parameters of leaky surface acoustic waves in lithium niobate and tantalate crystals are presented. Test structures for analysis based on the finite-element method using the COMSOL Multiphysics package are described. A method is proposed to determine the key parameters needed for the design of devices based on surface acoustic waves. The phase velocity of the wave, the coefficient of electromechanical coupling, and the coefficient of reflection from a single electrode for industrially used piezoelectric substrates are calculated. The calculated key parameters can be used to design resonators and filters based on leaky surface acoustic waves. It is shown that the calculated data are in agreement with the literature data. The calculated results are compared with the experimental data using an example of a ladder filter."
Monopulse Lasers Based on Yttrium Aluminum Garnet with Neodynium Ion with Resonators Based on an Optical Circuit of a Four-Pass Amplifier with Transverse Diode Pumping,The results of application in monopulse lasers based on yttrium aluminum garnet resonators with Nd3+ ions based on the optical scheme of a four-pass amplifier with one-sided lateral pumping of the active element by monospectral laser diode arrays are presented. The proposed resonator schemes make it possible to increase the output energy of single pulses of laser radiation. Monospectral gratings with efficient heat removal from laser diodes are capable of ensuring the operability of lasers with an increase in the repetition rate of monopulses and an expansion of the ambient temperature range.
Anomalous Photoresponse of Heavily Doped GaAs/AlAs Superlattices with Electric Domains,The strong effect of weak interband illumination on tunneling transport in doped GaAs/AlAs superlattices was found under conditions of electric domain formation. The photoresponse at voltages below the threshold one (before the domain formation) did not observe. The phenomenon is referred to strong carrier depletion inside the triangular high-field domain. The domain modes transformations under the illumination were also found.
Chaos synchronization with coexisting global fields,"We investigate the phenomenon of chaos synchronization in systems subject to coexisting autonomous and external global fields by employing a simple model of coupled maps. Two states of chaos synchronization are found: (i) complete synchronization, where the maps synchronize among themselves and to the external field, and (ii) generalized or internal synchronization, where the maps synchronize among themselves but not to the external global field. We show that the stability conditions for both states can be achieved for a system of minimum size of two maps. We consider local maps possessing robust chaos and characterize the synchronization states on the space of parameters of the system. The state of generalized synchronization of chaos arises even when the drive and the local maps have the same functional form. This behavior is similar to the process of spontaneous ordering against an external field found in nonequilibrium systems."
Nondestructive in situ detection of microbubble defects in the screen by optical coherence tomography,"Touching screens as a key component of smart devices play a vital role in exerting normal function and user experience. Usually, defective products containing deep tiny cracks, impurities, or microbubbles generated in the manufacturing process are difficult to be detected by the present methods. The existence of such tiny defects potentially damages the integrated function of smart devices, even jeopardizes the health of users. The precise identification of microscopic defects buried in deep touching screens is great in demand. In this work, we built a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) system with suitable imaging depth and spatial resolution and carried out nondestructive imaging of endogenic micro-bubbles generated in the bonding process of the screen. Using SD-OCT, we obtained in situ 2D, 3D imaging of microbubbles to show quantitative information of the defects including exact size, shape, and spatial location, which help to analyze the occurring stage of bubble defects in the manufacturing process with improving accuracy. This provides a useful tool for the quality monitoring of the screen in industrial manufacture, which cannot be attainable by the common approaches."
Dynamic snap-through phenomena and nonlinear vibrations of bistable asymmetric cross-ply composite-laminated square plates with two potential wells under center base excitation,"The dynamic snap-through phenomena and nonlinear vibrations with two potential wells are investigated for a bistable asymmetric cross-ply composite-laminated square plates. The center of the plate is fixed supported. The four edges of the plate are free. A base excitation is given at the center of the plates. The Hamilton’s principle is employed to establish the partial differential governing equations of motions for the bistable plates. Three equilibrium configurations corresponding to two stable configurations and one unstable configuration can be determined by solving the nonlinear static equations. The static bifurcation diagrams are obtained, of which the type is super-critical pitchfork bifurcation. Absolute value of critical temperature difference of bifurcation increases with the increase of the quantity of layers. Two energy potential wells are determined based on two stable configurations. The potential energy curves are determined. The potential curve consists of two potential wells and one potential barrier. Threshold that is the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of the potential energy curve adds with the adding of the quantity of layers. The influence of the base excitation amplitude on the dynamic snap-through phenomena and nonlinear vibrations is studied. The dynamic snap-through occurs accompanying with the periodic vibration, the quasi-periodic vibration and the chaotic vibration in the dynamic environments."
Molecular response for nematic superconducting media in a hollow cylinder: a numerical approach,"In the context of the Ginzburg–Landau formalism proposed by Barci et al. in 2016 for nematic superconductivity, and by performing a numerical treatment based on the shooting method, we analyze the behaviour of the radial distribution of the nematic order parameter when the superconducting order parameter reaches the typical non-trivial saddle point. We consider the cases of a hollow cylindrical domain, with a disk or an annular domain as its cross section, whether the order parameter is subjected to Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions. We conclude that depending on the corresponding situation a non trivial solution holds if certain relations between the radii are satisfied. Moreover, we observe a saturation effect on each instance that constitutes a purely geometrical consequence on the relation between the typical sizes and shapes of the samples. These conclusions can be useful for further experimental realizations and extensions to the interaction of the nematic (superconducting) order parameters with electromagnetic fields."
An investigation on microscopic chaos controlling of identical chemical reactor system via adaptive controlled hybrid projective synchronization,"In this manuscript, a methodology is designed to investigate the microscopic chaos adaptive controlling in the dynamics of the chaotic chemical reactor system (CR-system) using hybrid projective synchronization (HPS) technique. Initially, an adaptive control design (ACD) has been presented and analyzed in a systematic manner for controlling the microscopic chaos phenomenon found in the CR-system which is essentially in accordance with Lyapunov stability analysis (LSA). The necessary asymptotic stability criterion for the state vectors of the discussed CR-system with uncertain parameters is determined by designing suitable control functions and simplified parameter updating law. Additionally, numerical simulation results using MATLAB software have been performed to illustrate the effective presentation of the proposed strategy. Simulation outcomes complement that the primary objective of controlling chaos in CR-system is attained both analytically and computationally. Furthermore, a comparative study with earlier published literature has been done."
Noise Robust Automatic Scoring Based on Deep Neural Network Acoustic Models with Lattice-Free MMI and Factorized Adaptation,"Automatic scoring based on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been widely used in L2 (second language) speaking tests. In this paper, novel noise robust automatic scoring methods for L2 speaking tests based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) models with lattice-free Maximum Mutual Information (MMI) and factorized adaptation were proposed. Noise robust Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP) algorithms using lattice free MMI were implemented to improve the reliability of automatic scoring for L2 speaking tests through better utilizing sequential training power of lattice free MMI models. Factorized adaptation for DNN acoustic models was introduced to further improve performances of the proposed GOP scores in real speaking test environments by categorizing factors that cause mismatches between acoustic models and test data. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are noise robust and outperform conventional methods in assessment for speaking tests in real classroom environments."
Elephant herding with whale optimization enabled ORB features and CNN for Iris recognition,"Iris biometrics is one of the frequently used biometrics for security purposes, and it provides the appropriate tools for identifying humans. Deep learners when used along with iris recognition can improve accuracy, automatic learning, and generalization ability. Despite the advantages of deep learners, some problems like time complexity and computational efforts exist in deep learners. In order to solve these obstacles, this paper intends to develop the intelligent iris recognition model based on the concepts merged with multi-objective feature selection and deep learning. The main phases of the proposed model involve (a) Pre-processing, (b) Iris Segmentation, (c) optimal ORB point selection and feature vector generation, and (d) optimal recognition. Here, the pre-processing of the image is performed by filtering and contrast enhancement techniques. Further, the iris segmentation is done by few approaches such as reflection moving, iris localization, and Hough-transform-based segmentation. Once the segmentation of the iris is finished, feature extraction is carried out by optimized Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB) features concerning on multi-objective function. Finally, the optimized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for iris recognition. Here, the hybrid algorithm with the integration of two meta-heuristic algorithms like Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) called Elephant Herding with Whale Optimization Algorithm (EH-WOA) is utilized for performing the optimized ORB feature selection and optimized CNN. The experiments are conducted on a benchmark datasets like IIT Delhi (IITD) Iris database, and MMU iris dataset to analyze the performance of the proposed model over the different network structures for accurate iris recognition. Through the experimental analysis, the proposed optimized CNN + EH-WOA had better values in terms of accuracy, which is 0.98% higher than SVM, 0.92% higher than KNN, 0.88% higher NN, and 0.85% higher than CNN respectively for the learning % as 75 for MMU iris dataset. Similarly, several performance measures have considered for showing the efficiency of the designed model."

Designing business model taxonomies – synthesis and guidance from information systems research,"Classification is an essential approach in business model research. Empirical classifications, termed taxonomies, are widespread in and beyond Information Systems (IS) and enjoy high popularity as both stand-alone artifacts and the foundation for further application. In this article, we focus on the study of empirical business model taxonomies for two reasons. Firstly, as these taxonomies serve as a tool to store empirical data about business models, we investigate their coverage of different industries and technologies. Secondly, as they are emerging artifacts in IS research, we aim to strengthen rigor in their design by illustrating essential design dimensions and characteristics. In doing this, we contribute to research and practice by synthesizing the diffusion of business model taxonomies that helps to draw on the available body of empirical knowledge and providing artifact-specific guidance for building taxonomies in the context of business models."
"New Siluro-Devonian Anomalocystitids (Echinodermata, Stylophora) from Bolivia and Canada, and a Reevaluation of Skeletal Homologies in Mitrates","Two new mitrate stylophorans are described from the upper part of the Santa Rosa Formation (Lochkovian) in the Central Subandean Zone of Bolivia and from the Jupiter Formation (Cybèle Member, late Llandovery) of Anticosti Island (Canada). Both stylophorans are identified as allanicytidiine anomalocystitids. The new Bolivian mitrate, Perikefalea racheboeufi gen. and sp. nov. is characterized by a strongly reduced number of plates (five) on its upper thecal surface and a strong spike on its posterior median marginal. The morphology of P. racheboeufi suggests relatively strong affinities with Occultocystis, from the Lower Devonian Talacasto Formation of Argentina. Although incompletely preserved, the Anticosti mitrate, Perikefalea? cybeleae sp. nov., represents the first stylophoran described in the Silurian of North America and the first report of post-Ordovician Allanicytidiinae outside of (peri) Gondwanan regions. Skeletal homologies in mitrates (marginals, infracentrals, posterior spines, adorals, supracentrals) are reevaluated, so as to describe the plate pattern of Perikefalea. This revision was prompted by new fossil evidence from the Furongian–Tremadocian interval suggesting that (1) mitrates derive from “Phyllocystis” jingxiensis-like cornutes with wide marginals, a posteriorly open marginal frame (loss of M5 and \({\text{M}}_{5}^{'}\)), a zygal plate in central position, and confluent, sutured M3 and G; (2) anomalocystitids derive from Mitrocystites-like mitrocystitidans by modification of two marginals (digital and glossal) into posterior spines. Two distinct terminologies are tentatively proposed for supracentrals in Allanicytidiinae and Anomalocystitinae, because the highly standardized plate patterns of their Siluro-Devonian representatives were possibly acquired independently in the two clades."
"Sea Lilies of the Genus Bathycrinus (Crinoidea, Bathycrinidae) from the Yap and Palau Trenches","Two species of the genus Bathycrinus were found in the Yap and Palau trenches. B. longicolumnalis n. sp. differs from other Bathycrinus species in having strongly bent lateral wings on the primibrachials and very elongate mesistele columnals. Ratio of length to diameter in the most elongate columnal is 7.1. The knobby processes are present in B. longicolumnalis sp. nov. from upper hadal zone (6445–7170 m), and they absent in B. kirilli from lower hadal zone (7970–8720 m). A similar difference has been previously noted between the upper and lower hadal Bathycrinus inhabiting the North Pacific trenches: B. rozhnovi and B. longipinnus from the depths 5595–7245 m are with knobby processes, while B. kirilli and B. volubilis from the depths 8175–9735 m lack this processes. The hadal echinoderm fauna of the Palau and Yap trenches includes 19 species. Of these, 15 species are known from the Palau Trench and 10 species—from the Yap Trench."
"Two Coils in the Morphology of Myelodactylids (Crinoidea, Disparida): the Morphogenetic Basis of Their Formation and Adaptation Potential","In myelodactylids, the coil of the mesostele and the crown with a proxistele coiled in the same plane in the opposite direction result from the two fundamental processes in the evolution of echinoderms, which happened when their free-floating ancestor settled at the bottom and became attached to the ground by the ventral side of the anterior end of the body. The coil of the mesostele emerged due to the tendency of the stem to curve from the ventral to the dorsal side in the larvae, after they became attached, by the ventral side of the preoral lobe, and the growth vector changed from horizontal to vertical. The curvature of the proxistele, together with the crown in the same larval plane but in the opposite direction, from the dorsal side to the ventral, appeared during the paedomorphic delay in the process of elevation (torsion) in the ontogeny of myelodactylids. The coiling of the mesostele and the curvature of the proxistele with the crown in the E‑BC plane determine the conformity of this plane to the larval plane in pentaradiate echinoderms, and the approximate conformity of the E ray to the dorsal side of the larva, and the interray BC to its ventral side. The morphology of myelodactylids shows that their stem in the feeding position stretched along slightly compacted ground, resting on cirri, and the crown extended at a slight acute angle over the stem downstream. In cases of danger, the stem coiled with its lower side inward, so that the crown was protected inside the coil by cirri. The coil of Zuravlicrinus milicinae gen. et sp. nov. from the Silurian of the Urals, and Valimocrinus terentyevi gen. et sp. nov. from the Ordovician of the Leningrad Region, coiled while growing around stems of other crinoids, and could not uncoil. Both genera, as well as Musicrinus Donovan, are known only from stem fragments and are tentatively assigned to myelodactylids. The finding of the genus Eomyelodactylus in China shows its spread far beyond North America. Findings of myelodactylids in Siberia show significant differences from other myelodactylids, allowing them to be assigned to a new genus Imagdacrinus gen .nov."
"Paleogene Molluscan Communities in the Kopet-Dagh Basin, NE Iran","Molluscan fossils have long been considered as an essential group for the paleoecological interpretations of the Paleogene stratigraphic successions. The distribution of bivalve and gastropod fossils in the Kopet-Dagh Mountains’ Paleogene successions, Chehelkaman and Khangiran formations, has been studied in this research. The fossil contents of the investigated intervals are categorized into four paleo-societies. They include Turriteline (gastropods of subfamily Turritellinae, by Allmon, 2011)—Pycnodonte community at the top of Chehelkaman Formation representative the terminal part of the Upper Paleocene, Flemingostrea–Ferganea community representing the lower layers of the Lower Eocene deposits and base of the Khangiran Formation, assemblages of Turkostrea spp., defining the middle part of the Early Eocene and Sokolowia community indicating the Lutetian—early Priabonian age for the upper part of the Khangiran Formation. Besides, the first appearance of Ferganea ferganensis previously had been reported only from the Upper Eocene–Oligocene deposits, is recorded from the Early Eocene, here. The faunal contents approve a shallow foreshore environment during Paleogene sequences' deposition in the Kopet-Dagh Basin. Accordingly, three regressive and two transgressive phases were proposed for the Kopet-Dagh basin’s Paleogene deposits in Iran."
Leaves of Ettingshausenia cuneifolia (Bronn) Stiehler (Angiospermae) and Associated Carpels and Stamens from the Turonian of Southern Kazakhstan,"An assemblage of plant fossils from the Kyzyl-Jar locality (southern Kazakhstan, Turonian) including polymorphic leaves of Ettingshausenia cuneifolia (Angiospermae), dispersed carpels, and solitary stamens, is studied. The morphology of the E. cuneifolia leaves resembles that of representatives of the Platanaceae. The dispersed carpels, Platanocarpelia kyzyljarica gen. et sp. nov. (Platanaceae), have an oval ovary with a long persistent style, and lack a hair tuft at the carpel base. Solitary stamens are morphologically similar to those of the extant genus Platanus. E. cuneifolia leaves show significant damage by various agents, mainly arthropods. The problem of classification of these plant fossils is discussed."
Traces of Sublethal Injuries in Upper Cretaceous Echinoid Tests from the Vicinity of Volsk (Lower Volga Region),"Three species of echinoids Conulus matesovi Moskvin, Echinocorys ovata (Leske) and Micraster corbovis Forbes from Turonian and Campanian deposits of Lower Volga region, with traces of the sublethal injuries in the tests, are described. Such injuries are of particular interest as they are not related to commensalism, predation, parasitism, or other effects of different animals, but are the result of a mechanical collision of echinoid tests with empty shells of inoceramids, which resulted in a foreign object being embedded and remaining in the tests but did not lead to their destruction or the death of the organism. Formation conditions and taphonomic aspects of the occurrences are considered. Possible mechanisms of sublethal injuries are analyzed."
"History of Studies of the Female Woolly Mammoth Mummy Yuka (Mammuthus primigenius (Blumenbach, 1799))","The paper reviews history of studies and research areas on a frozen mummy of the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) found in 2010 in Oyogoss Yar, about 30 km west of the Kondratyeva River mouth, northern Yakutia. Introduced to the scientific literature as the Yuka Mammoth, it became the first, partly preserved carcass of female woolly mammoth of adolescent age found in the world, which lived about 39 000 calendar years BP, during relatively warm period (MIS 3, Molotkovskian, or Leningrad Interstadials).The multidisciplinary study of Yuka by various approaches (anatomical-morphological, palynological, paleobotanical, microbiological, computer tomography, and radiocarbon dating methods) yielded fundamentally new data on this proboscidean species. The paper evaluates systematic studies of this unique specimen, from identification of its age and studies of skeletal morphology, ontogenetic development and environmental conditions to reporting the presence of viable bacteria in Yuka’s soft tissues. This paper also features the discovery of the preserved brain and analysis of its structure, as well as a revelation of unique morphology of the trunk, for the first time for this species. The paleobotanical data indicated predomination of open herbaceous landscapes during Yuka’s life. New features of the species morphology were revealed: delayed eruption of the permanent tusks (I) and different number of nail plates and phalanges on the forelegs. The presence of viable bacteria strains of Bacillus genus was recorded in Yuka’s tissues."
Structural Analysis of InAs1−xSbx Epilayer Considering Occurrence of Crystallographic Tilt Exploiting High-Resolution X-Ray Diffraction,"InAs1−xSbx epilayer has nonlinearity bandgap energy between 180 and 350 meV according to the relative composition x of Sb at room temperature. For this reason, the wavelengths operating as a photodetector are in the mid-infrared (3–5 μm) and long-wavelength infrared range (8–12 μm). Photodetectors of these wavelengths can be used in the fields of pollutant detection, infrared thermal imaging, lidars, or optical countermeasures. Since the bandgap energy of InAs1−xSbx epilayer changes according to the relative composition of Sb, the measurement of InAs1−xSbx epilayer composition is crucial for predicting device characteristics. In this study, high-resolution X-ray diffraction was used to measure the mean composition of specimens without damaging the specimens of InAs1−xSbx epilayer. InAs1−xSbx thin films were grown epitaxially on the GaSb substrate having a similar lattice constant as the thin films by utilizing the molecular beam epitaxy method at various growth temperature conditions. Here, tilt of the growth direction in InAs1−xSbx thin films was observed despite having no off-cut angle of the GaSb substrate. Cases considering and not considering the tilt of the growth direction were analyzed to show a 3% difference in the relative composition of Sb in InAs1−xSbx thin films. Accordingly, this study revealed that the growth tilt of the epilayer must be taken into account when measuring the precise composition of InAs1−xSbx thin films grown on a GaSb substrate using high-resolution X-ray diffraction."
Simultaneous enhancement of strength and ductility in friction stir processed 2205 duplex stainless steel with a bimodal structure: experiments and crystal plasticity modeling,"Achieving excellent strength-ductility synergy is a long-lasting research theme for structural materials. However, attempts to enhance strength usually induce a loss of ductility, i.e., the strength-ductility trade-off. In the present study, the strength-ductility trade-off in duplex stainless steel (DSS) was overcome by developing a bimodal structure using friction stir processing (FSP). The ultimate tensile strength and elongation were improved by 140% and 109%, respectively, compared with those of the as-received materials. Plastic deformation and concurrent dynamic recrystallization (DRX) during FSP were responsible for the formation of bimodal structure. Incompatible deformation resulted in the accumulation of dislocations at the phase boundaries, which triggered interpenetrating nucleation between the austenite and ferrite phases during DRX, leading to a bimodal structure. The in situ mechanical responses of the bimodal structure during tensile deformation were investigated by crystal plasticity finite element modeling (CPFEM). The stress field distribution obtained from CPFEM revealed that the simultaneous enhancement of strength and ductility in a bimodal structure could be attributed to the formation of a unique dispersion-strengthened system with the austenite and ferrite phases. It is indicated that the present design of alternating fine austenite and coarse ferrite layers is a promising strategy for optimizing the mechanical properties of DSSs."
Post-transcriptional gene silencing of the chalcone synthase gene CHS causes corolla lobe-specific whiting of Japanese gentian,Post-transcriptional gene silencing of the chalcone synthase gene CHS specifically suppresses anthocyanin biosynthesis in corolla lobes and is responsible for the formation of a stripe type bicolor in Japanese gentian.
Fuglede’s theorem in generalized Orlicz–Sobolev spaces,"In this paper, we show that Orlicz–Sobolev spaces \(W^{1,\varphi }(\varOmega )\) can be characterized with the ACL- and ACC-characterizations. ACL stands for absolutely continuous on lines and ACC for absolutely continuous on curves. Our results hold under the assumptions that \(C^1(\varOmega )\) functions are dense in \(W^{1,\varphi }(\varOmega )\), and \(\varphi (x,\beta ) \ge 1\) for some \(\beta > 0\) and almost every \(x \in \varOmega \). The results are new even in the special cases of Orlicz and double phase growth."
Epigenetic features improve TALE target prediction,"The yield of many crop plants can be substantially reduced by plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria. The infection strategy of many Xanthomonas strains is based on transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), which are secreted into the host cells and act as transcriptional activators of plant genes that are beneficial for the bacteria.The modular DNA binding domain of TALEs contains tandem repeats, each comprising two hyper-variable amino acids. These repeat-variable diresidues (RVDs) bind to their target box and determine the specificity of a TALE.All available tools for the prediction of TALE targets within the host plant suffer from many false positives. In this paper we propose a strategy to improve prediction accuracy by considering the epigenetic state of the host plant genome in the region of the target box."
Cue overlap supports preretrieval selection in episodic memory: ERP evidence,"People often want to recall events of a particular kind, but this selective remembering is not always possible. We contrasted two candidate mechanisms: the overlap between retrieval cues and stored memory traces, and the ease of recollection. In two preregistered experiments (Ns = 28), we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to quantify selection occurring before retrieval and the goal states — retrieval orientations — thought to achieve this selection. Participants viewed object pictures or heard object names, and one of these sources was designated as targets in each memory test. We manipulated cue overlap by probing memory with visual names (Experiment 1) or line drawings (Experiment 2). Results revealed that regardless of which source was targeted, the left parietal ERP effect indexing recollection was selective when test cues overlapped more with the targeted than non-targeted information, despite consistently better memory for pictures. ERPs for unstudied items also were more positive-going when cue overlap was high, suggesting that engagement of retrieval orientations reflected availability of external cues matching the targeted source. The data support the view that selection can act before recollection if there is sufficient overlap between retrieval cues and targeted versus competing memory traces."
Developmental Assets in South African Adolescents Exposed to Violence: a Qualitative Study on Resilience,"Violence exposure is associated with psychological and behavioural maladjustment in adolescents. Yet, not all adolescents exposed to violence experience negative symptoms. Resilience is an outcome that is in part determined by multiple protective factors, or developmental assets, that protect adolescents from the negative influence of encountered stressors and allow them to attain positive developmental outcomes. A qualitative study was conducted to acquire an in-depth understanding of the developmental assets across different layers in the ecological system that promote positive psychological and behavioural functioning in South African adolescents exposed to violence. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with a multi-ethnic group (black, white, and people of mixed heritage) of South African adolescents (boy: n = 17; girl: n = 13; age: 14–19 years) from seven schools in Cape Town. Adolescents reported both internal and external assets that helped them adaptively cope with violence exposure. The internal assets entailed individual characteristics and skills, including commitment to learning, positive values, positive identity, social competencies, and emotional insight. The external assets were boundaries and expectations, social support from adolescents’ peers, family, school, and community, and adolescents’ constructive use of time. The findings of the study may inform strengths-based interventions to enhance emotional and behavioural skills in adolescents at risk for violence exposure. Moreover, involving key stakeholders in the interventions from major developmental domains can be particularly helpful to optimise the social support that are needed for adolescents to be resilient."
Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO) Coated CP-Ti: Wear Performance on Reciprocating Mode and Chondrogenic–Osteogenic Differentiation,"Biocompatible oxide coatings obtained by plasma electrolyte oxidation (PEO) have been used to improve the surface properties of bone grafts made of titanium. However, few studies explore the occurrence of wear in reciprocating mode. The chondrogenic differentiation over coatings obtained by PEO has not been explored either. These coatings tend to induce the osseointegration by contributing to the osteogenic differentiation behaviour, however, there is no evidence of their influence on the formation of cartilaginous matrix. Thus, this work aimed to investigate the behaviour of cell viability and differentiation (osteogenic and chondrogenic) and the tribological properties of coatings obtained by PEO at different voltages on the CP-Ti substrate for future applications in tissue engineering field. The morphology and structure of the coatings were characterised by scanning electron microscopy, profilometry and X-ray diffraction, respectively. The chemical composition of the coatings was analysed by energy dispersive spectroscopy and Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry. Wear resistance was evaluated in a tribometer, in ball-on-plate configuration and in reciprocating mode. The biological behaviour was characterised by cell viability, adhesion and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells assays. The results showed that the formation of the rutile phase in Ti-PEO250V and Ti-PEO300V coatings influenced the superior wear resistance behaviour, in relation to Ti-PEO200V. Furthermore, it was found that the increase in the applied voltage caused an increase in the incorporation of Ca and P elements in the coatings. Besides this, biological results indicated that all obtained coatings were not cytotoxic, allowing adhesion and consequently cell differentiation in osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages."
Lockdown Experiences of 10–13 Year Olds in New Zealand,"The implementation of lockdowns that include the closure of educational facilities for face to face teaching has been one of the strategies used internationally to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Research suggests lockdowns are associated with negative impacts on children’s psycho-social functioning, Most research, however, has been conducted in countries where extended lockdown periods have been in place and has primarily used parent/child survey to gain insight into lockdown effects. The current study was conducted in the context of New Zealand’s initial 7-week national lockdown which allowed examination of the impact of a relatively short lockdown period. Participants (n = 139) aged 10 to 13 years from one school were interviewed face to face about their experiences during lockdown immediately following the re-opening of schools. Participants’ self-concept was also evaluated to gain an understanding of their psycho-social skills after lockdown. Qualitative analysis identified positive and negative features of lockdown from children’s perspectives. Analysis also focused on changes to children’s relationships with close family members during lockdown. The findings have implications for identifying how to optimise lockdown experiences for children."
The type of gastrectomy and modified frailty index as useful predictive indicators for 1-year readmission due to nutritional difficulty in patients who undergo gastrectomy for gastric cancer,"Patients who undergo gastrectomy for gastric cancer (GC) are likely to have nutritional difficulty after surgery. Readmission due to nutritional difficulty is common in such patients. Thus, in this study, we aim to identify the predictive indicators for readmission due to nutritional difficulty in patients who underwent gastrectomy for GC."
Improvement in textured hole-entry hybrid journal bearing system by using multi-objective genetic algorithm,"In the past few decades, various studies have been performed by using textured surfaces in bearings to improve static performance characteristics friction and improve load-carrying capacity of the bearing. Surface texture also results in changes in dynamic performance characteristics of the journal bearing. The present work aims to improve the dynamic performance parameter and stability with the help of optimized textured design. As the calculation of bearing stiffness and damping parameter is quite a complex procedure, therefore, to obtain optimum texture parameter, a multi-objective genetic algorithm is used. A finite element model with the use of a genetic algorithm is developed to improve bearing performance parameters. With the use of optimum texture dimensions up to 25% improvement in the value of stability parameter is observed. It is expected that the results will be quite helpful for the bearing designer to make a stable and efficient bearing."
FTH promotes the proliferation and renders the HCC cells specifically resist to ferroptosis by maintaining iron homeostasis,"Ferroptosis is a newly identified type of programmed cell death, which preferentially targets iron-rich cancer cells such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ferritin heavy chain (FTH) is a major iron storing nanocage to store redox-inactive iron, and harbors ferroxidase activity to prevent the iron-mediated production of ROS. Our previous studies have demonstrated that FTH acts as a protective role to increase the cellular resistance to ferroptosis. However, the specific role of FTH in the development of HCC and ferroptosis resistance remains unclear."
Non-standard neutrino and Z′ interactions at the FASERν and the LHC,"We study the impact of non-standard neutrino interactions in the context of a new gauge boson Z′ in neutral-current deep-inelastic scattering performed in ForwArd Search ExpeRiment-ν (FASERν) and in monojet production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We simulate the neutral-current deep-inelastic neutrino-nucleon scattering νN → νN at FASERν in the presence of an additional Z′ boson, and estimate the anticipated sensitivities to the gauge coupling in a wide range of Z′ mass. At the LHC, we study the effect of Z′ on monojet production, which can be enhanced in regions with large missing transverse momenta. We then use the recent results from ATLAS with an integrated luminosity of 139 fb−1 to improve the limits on the gauge coupling of Z′. We interpret such limits on Z′ gauge couplings as bounds on effective non-standard neutrino interactions. We show that the FASERν and the LHC results cover the medium and high energy scales, respectively, and complement one another."
"Notes on massless scalar field partition functions, modular invariance and Eisenstein series","The partition function of a massless scalar field on a Euclidean spacetime manifold ℝd−1 × 𝕋2 and with momentum operator in the compact spatial dimension coupled through a purely imaginary chemical potential is computed. It is modular covariant and admits a simple expression in terms of a real analytic SL(2, ℤ) Eisenstein series with s = (d + 1)/2. Different techniques for computing the partition function illustrate complementary aspects of the Eisenstein series: the functional approach gives its series representation, the operator approach yields its Fourier series, while the proper time/heat kernel/world-line approach shows that it is the Mellin transform of a Riemann theta function. High/low temperature duality is generalized to the case of a non-vanishing chemical potential. By clarifying the dependence of the partition function on the geometry of the torus, we discuss how modular covariance is a consequence of full SL(2, ℤ) invariance. When the spacetime manifold is ℝp × 𝕋q+1, the partition function is given in terms of a SL(q + 1, ℤ) Eisenstein series again with s = (d + 1)/2. In this case, we obtain the high/low temperature duality through a suitably adapted dual parametrization of the lattice defining the torus. On 𝕋d+1, the computation is more subtle. An additional divergence leads to an harmonic anomaly."
Free energy landscape and kinetics of phase transition in two coupled SYK models and the corresponding wormhole-two black hole switching,"We propose that the thermodynamics and the kinetics of the phase transition between wormhole and two black hole described by the two coupled SYK model can be investigated in terms of the stochastic dynamics on the underlying free energy landscape. We assume that the phase transition is a stochastic process under the thermal fluctuations. By quantifying the underlying free energy landscape, we study the phase diagram, the kinetic time and its fluctuations in details, which reveal the underlying thermodynamics and kinetics. It is shown that the first order phase transition between wormhole and two black hole described by two coupled SYK model is analogous to the Van der Waals phase transition. Therefore, the emergence of wormhole and two black hole phases, the phase transition and associated kinetics can be quantitatively addressed in our free energy landscape and kinetic framework through the dependence on the barrier height and the temperature."
Vacuum correlators at short distances from lattice QCD,"Non-perturbatively computing the hadronic vacuum polarization at large photon virtualities and making contact with perturbation theory enables a precision determination of the electromagnetic coupling at the Z pole, which enters global electroweak fits. In order to achieve this goal ab initio using lattice QCD, one faces the challenge that, at the short distances which dominate the observable, discretization errors are hard to control. Here we address challenges of this type with the help of static screening correlators in the high-temperature phase of QCD, yet without incurring any bias. The idea is motivated by the observations that (a) the cost of high-temperature simulations is typically much lower than their vacuum counterpart, and (b) at distances x3 far below the inverse temperature 1/T, the operator-product expansion guarantees the thermal correlator of two local currents to deviate from the vacuum correlator by a relative amount that is power-suppressed in (x3 T). The method is first investigated in lattice perturbation theory, where we point out the appearance of an O(a2 log(1/a)) lattice artifact in the vacuum polarization with a prefactor that we calculate. It is then applied to non-perturbative lattice QCD data with two dynamical flavors of quarks. Our lattice spacings range down to 0.049 fm for the vacuum simulations and down to 0.033 fm for the simulations performed at a temperature of 250 MeV."
Two-photon exchange in leptophilic dark matter scenarios,"In leptophilic scenarios, dark matter interactions with nuclei, relevant for direct detection experiments and for the capture by celestial objects, could only occur via loop-induced processes. If the mediator is a scalar or pseudo-scalar particle, which only couples to leptons, the dominant contribution to dark matter-nucleus scattering would take place via two-photon exchange with a lepton triangle loop. The corresponding diagrams have been estimated in the literature under different approximations. Here, we present new analytical calculations for one-body two-loop and two-body one-loop interactions. The two-loop form factors are presented in closed analytical form in terms of generalized polylogarithms up to weight four. In both cases, we consider the exact dependence on all the involved scales, and study the dependence on the momentum transfer. We show that some previous approximations fail to correctly predict the scattering cross section by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, we quantitatively show that form factors in the range of momentum transfer relevant for local galactic dark matter, can be significantly smaller than their value at zero momentum transfer, which is the approach usually considered."
Diatom response to environmental gradients in the high mountain lakes of the Colombia’s Eastern Range,"A survey of 60 high mountain lakes of Colombia’s Eastern Range was performed to evaluate the response of surface-sediment diatoms to environmental variables. In each one of these lakes, water samples were taken for physical and chemical characterization, and diatoms were collected from the superficial bottom sediment at the deepest part. Multivariate statistical analyses were made to determine the relationships between environmental and biological data, specifically which environmental variables explain the diatom distribution. For each of these significant environmental variables, optima and ecological tolerances were calculated using the weighted-average method, which allowed for the classification of the species according to their environmental preferences. The lakes showed a wide range of environmental gradients in variables such as pH, alkalinity, and nutrients. In addition, the depth of the lakes was a direct determinant of the light environment of the water column. A total of 339 diatom taxa were identified belonging mainly to the genera Eunotia and Pinnularia. Variables related to pH-alkalinity gradient, trophic condition (nitrates and phosphorus), and physical factors (radiation at the bottom) had a significant effect on diatom composition. Despite the fact that the total organic carbon environmental range was high, the effect of this variable on diatom species composition was not significant. In conclusion, the diatoms of the studied lakes showed a significant ecological relationship with environmental variables which are potentially important in environmental reconstruction. Diatoms in the study sites can provide useful and independent quantitative information to investigate the recent impacts of global change on tropical high mountain ecosystems."
Spatio-temporal analysis of the extent of an extreme heat event,"Evidence of global warming induced from the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere suggests more frequent warm days and heat waves. The concept of an extreme heat event (EHE), defined locally based on exceedance of a suitable local threshold, enables us to capture the notion of a period of persistent extremely high temperatures. Modeling for extreme heat events is customarily implemented using time series of temperatures collected at a set of locations. Since spatial dependence is anticipated in the occurrence of EHE’s, a joint model for the time series, incorporating spatial dependence is needed. Recent work by Schliep et al. (J R Stat Soc Ser A Stat Soc 184(3):1070–1092, 2021) develops a space-time model based on a point-referenced collection of temperature time series that enables the prediction of both the incidence and characteristics of EHE’s occurring at any location in a study region. The contribution here is to introduce a formal definition of the notion of the spatial extent of an extreme heat event and then to employ output from the Schliep et al. (J R Stat Soc Ser A Stat Soc 184(3):1070–1092, 2021) modeling work to illustrate the notion. For a specified region and a given day, the definition takes the form of a block average of indicator functions over the region. Our risk assessment examines extents for the Comunidad Autónoma de Aragón in northeastern Spain. We calculate daily, seasonal and decadal averages of the extents for two subregions in this comunidad. We generalize our definition to capture extents of persistence of extreme heat and make comparisons across decades to reveal evidence of increasing extent over time."
Structural Analysis of InAs1−xSbx Epilayer Considering Occurrence of Crystallographic Tilt Exploiting High-Resolution X-Ray Diffraction,"InAs1−xSbx epilayer has nonlinearity bandgap energy between 180 and 350 meV according to the relative composition x of Sb at room temperature. For this reason, the wavelengths operating as a photodetector are in the mid-infrared (3–5 μm) and long-wavelength infrared range (8–12 μm). Photodetectors of these wavelengths can be used in the fields of pollutant detection, infrared thermal imaging, lidars, or optical countermeasures. Since the bandgap energy of InAs1−xSbx epilayer changes according to the relative composition of Sb, the measurement of InAs1−xSbx epilayer composition is crucial for predicting device characteristics. In this study, high-resolution X-ray diffraction was used to measure the mean composition of specimens without damaging the specimens of InAs1−xSbx epilayer. InAs1−xSbx thin films were grown epitaxially on the GaSb substrate having a similar lattice constant as the thin films by utilizing the molecular beam epitaxy method at various growth temperature conditions. Here, tilt of the growth direction in InAs1−xSbx thin films was observed despite having no off-cut angle of the GaSb substrate. Cases considering and not considering the tilt of the growth direction were analyzed to show a 3% difference in the relative composition of Sb in InAs1−xSbx thin films. Accordingly, this study revealed that the growth tilt of the epilayer must be taken into account when measuring the precise composition of InAs1−xSbx thin films grown on a GaSb substrate using high-resolution X-ray diffraction."
The origin of the genus Cannabis,"Chloroplast markers (cp markers) are the useful instrument for cannabis (syn. hemp, Cannabis sativa L.) to study relationships of accessions between different geographic origins. In an alignment of three published plastomes 38 chloroplast polymorphisms were identified from which 8 cp markers were used to study relationships of 53 cannabis accessions by high-resolution-melting analyis (HRMA). The marker set could distinguish six haplotypes (‘A’ to ‘F’) in the cannabis collection, where haplotypes ‘A’ and ‘F’ dominated with 34% and 50% of the individuals, respectively. A majority of populations (37) were homogeneous regarding the haplotype, 12 accessions were constituted of two haplotypes and 4 accessions of three haplotypes. Most of the European fibre cultivars consisted of the ‘F’-type (e.g. ‘Fibrimon’, Fibrimon 21’, Juso 14’, ‘Fasamo’ and ‘Schurig’), some were mixed ‘A/F’-types (e.g. ‘Fibrimon 21’, ‘Superfibra’, ‘Lorrin 110’, ‘Futura’, ‘Havelländische’). The Italian ‘Carmagnola in Selezione’ was exceptional in being a pure ‘A’-type. In the heterogenous populations, expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.06 to 0.41. The populations were well differentiated by this marker set locating 79% of the variation among populations (AMOVA). By comparison with plastomes from the closest related genus Humulus, haplotype ‘B’ could be identified as haplotype of the common ancestor of both genera. The haplotype ‘B’ is rare with a frequency of only 4% in the populations analysed. Unfortunately, the true geographic origin of most samples was unclear. However, amongst all published plastomes, only two were classified as haplotype ‘B’, both pointing independently back to Yunnan province (China), indicating Yunnan as the region of origin of the genus Cannabis."
"Notes on massless scalar field partition functions, modular invariance and Eisenstein series","The partition function of a massless scalar field on a Euclidean spacetime manifold ℝd−1 × 𝕋2 and with momentum operator in the compact spatial dimension coupled through a purely imaginary chemical potential is computed. It is modular covariant and admits a simple expression in terms of a real analytic SL(2, ℤ) Eisenstein series with s = (d + 1)/2. Different techniques for computing the partition function illustrate complementary aspects of the Eisenstein series: the functional approach gives its series representation, the operator approach yields its Fourier series, while the proper time/heat kernel/world-line approach shows that it is the Mellin transform of a Riemann theta function. High/low temperature duality is generalized to the case of a non-vanishing chemical potential. By clarifying the dependence of the partition function on the geometry of the torus, we discuss how modular covariance is a consequence of full SL(2, ℤ) invariance. When the spacetime manifold is ℝp × 𝕋q+1, the partition function is given in terms of a SL(q + 1, ℤ) Eisenstein series again with s = (d + 1)/2. In this case, we obtain the high/low temperature duality through a suitably adapted dual parametrization of the lattice defining the torus. On 𝕋d+1, the computation is more subtle. An additional divergence leads to an harmonic anomaly."
Vacuum correlators at short distances from lattice QCD,"Non-perturbatively computing the hadronic vacuum polarization at large photon virtualities and making contact with perturbation theory enables a precision determination of the electromagnetic coupling at the Z pole, which enters global electroweak fits. In order to achieve this goal ab initio using lattice QCD, one faces the challenge that, at the short distances which dominate the observable, discretization errors are hard to control. Here we address challenges of this type with the help of static screening correlators in the high-temperature phase of QCD, yet without incurring any bias. The idea is motivated by the observations that (a) the cost of high-temperature simulations is typically much lower than their vacuum counterpart, and (b) at distances x3 far below the inverse temperature 1/T, the operator-product expansion guarantees the thermal correlator of two local currents to deviate from the vacuum correlator by a relative amount that is power-suppressed in (x3 T). The method is first investigated in lattice perturbation theory, where we point out the appearance of an O(a2 log(1/a)) lattice artifact in the vacuum polarization with a prefactor that we calculate. It is then applied to non-perturbative lattice QCD data with two dynamical flavors of quarks. Our lattice spacings range down to 0.049 fm for the vacuum simulations and down to 0.033 fm for the simulations performed at a temperature of 250 MeV."
Two-photon exchange in leptophilic dark matter scenarios,"In leptophilic scenarios, dark matter interactions with nuclei, relevant for direct detection experiments and for the capture by celestial objects, could only occur via loop-induced processes. If the mediator is a scalar or pseudo-scalar particle, which only couples to leptons, the dominant contribution to dark matter-nucleus scattering would take place via two-photon exchange with a lepton triangle loop. The corresponding diagrams have been estimated in the literature under different approximations. Here, we present new analytical calculations for one-body two-loop and two-body one-loop interactions. The two-loop form factors are presented in closed analytical form in terms of generalized polylogarithms up to weight four. In both cases, we consider the exact dependence on all the involved scales, and study the dependence on the momentum transfer. We show that some previous approximations fail to correctly predict the scattering cross section by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, we quantitatively show that form factors in the range of momentum transfer relevant for local galactic dark matter, can be significantly smaller than their value at zero momentum transfer, which is the approach usually considered."
Non-standard neutrino and Z′ interactions at the FASERν and the LHC,"We study the impact of non-standard neutrino interactions in the context of a new gauge boson Z′ in neutral-current deep-inelastic scattering performed in ForwArd Search ExpeRiment-ν (FASERν) and in monojet production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We simulate the neutral-current deep-inelastic neutrino-nucleon scattering νN → νN at FASERν in the presence of an additional Z′ boson, and estimate the anticipated sensitivities to the gauge coupling in a wide range of Z′ mass. At the LHC, we study the effect of Z′ on monojet production, which can be enhanced in regions with large missing transverse momenta. We then use the recent results from ATLAS with an integrated luminosity of 139 fb−1 to improve the limits on the gauge coupling of Z′. We interpret such limits on Z′ gauge couplings as bounds on effective non-standard neutrino interactions. We show that the FASERν and the LHC results cover the medium and high energy scales, respectively, and complement one another."
Free energy landscape and kinetics of phase transition in two coupled SYK models and the corresponding wormhole-two black hole switching,"We propose that the thermodynamics and the kinetics of the phase transition between wormhole and two black hole described by the two coupled SYK model can be investigated in terms of the stochastic dynamics on the underlying free energy landscape. We assume that the phase transition is a stochastic process under the thermal fluctuations. By quantifying the underlying free energy landscape, we study the phase diagram, the kinetic time and its fluctuations in details, which reveal the underlying thermodynamics and kinetics. It is shown that the first order phase transition between wormhole and two black hole described by two coupled SYK model is analogous to the Van der Waals phase transition. Therefore, the emergence of wormhole and two black hole phases, the phase transition and associated kinetics can be quantitatively addressed in our free energy landscape and kinetic framework through the dependence on the barrier height and the temperature."
Investigation of possible underlying mechanisms behind water-induced glucose reduction in adults with high copeptin,"Elevated copeptin, a surrogate marker of vasopressin, is linked to low water intake and increased diabetes risk. Water supplementation in habitual low-drinkers with high copeptin significantly lowers both fasting plasma (fp) copeptin and glucose. This study aims at investigating possible underlying mechanisms. Thirty-one healthy adults with high copeptin (> 10.7 pmol·L−1 (men), > 6.1 pmol−1 (women)) and 24-h urine volume of < 1.5L and osmolality of > 600 mOsm·kg−1 were included. The intervention consisted of addition of 1.5 L water daily for 6 weeks. Fp-adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), fp-cortisol, 24-h urine cortisol, fasting and 2 h (post oral glucose) insulin and glucagon were not significantly affected by the water intervention. However, decreased (Δ baseline-6 weeks) fp-copeptin was significantly associated with Δfp-ACTH (r = 0.76, p < 0.001) and Δfp-glucagon (r = 0.39, p = 0.03), respectively. When dividing our participants according to baseline copeptin, median fp-ACTH was reduced from 13.0 (interquartile range 9.2–34.5) to 7.7 (5.3–9.9) pmol L−1, p = 0.007 in the top tertile of copeptin, while no reduction was observed in the other tertiles. The glucose lowering effect from water may partly be attributable to decreased activity in the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis."
Antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity of electrosprayed chitosan nanoparticles against endodontic pathogens and Balb/c 3T3 fibroblast cells,"The aims of this study were to synthesize highly positively charged chitosan nanoparticles (Ch-Np) using the electrospraying technique, and to test their antimicrobial activity against endodontic pathogens, and cytotoxicity against fibroblast cells. Ch-Np were synthesized from low molecular weight chitosan (LMW-Ch) using the electrospraying technique, and characterized. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated against Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans in their planktonic state using a Time-Kill Test performed by using broth micro-dilution technique, and against biofilm biomass using a microtiter plate biofilm assay. The cytotoxicity was evaluated using Balb/c 3T3 fibroblast cells with the standard MTT assay. Electrospraying of LMW-Ch produced Ch-Np with an average size of 200 nm, and a surface charge of 51.7 mV. Ch-Np completely eradicated S. mutans and E. faecalis in the planktonic state and showed fungistatic activity against C. albicans. Furthermore, it significantly reduced the biofilm biomass for all the tested microbial species [S. mutans (p = 0.006), E. faecalis (p < 0.0001), and C. albicans (p = 0.004)]. When tested for cytotoxicity using 3T3 cells, Ch-Np showed no cytotoxicity. In conclusion, the highly positively charged, colloidal dispersion of Ch-Np are effective as a biocompatible endodontic antimicrobial agent."
Discrepancy of particle passage in 101 mask batches during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany,"During the first wave of Covid-19 infections in Germany in April 2020, clinics reported a shortage of filtering face masks with aerosol retention> 94% (FFP2 & 3, KN95, N95). Companies all over the world increased their production capacities, but quality control of once-certified materials and masks came up short. To help identify falsely labeled masks and ensure safe protection equipment, we tested 101 different batches of masks in 993 measurements with a self-made setup based on DIN standards. An aerosol generator provided a NaCl test aerosol which was applied to the mask. A laser aerosol spectrometer measured the aerosol concentration in a range from 90 to 500 nm to quantify the masks’ retention. Of 101 tested mask batches, only 31 batches kept what their label promised. Especially in the initial phase of the pandemic in Germany, we observed fluctuating mask qualities. Many batches show very high variability in aerosol retention. In addition, by measuring with a laser aerosol spectrometer, we were able to show that not all masks filter small and large particles equally well. In this study we demonstrate how important internal and independent quality controls are, especially in times of need and shortage of personal protection equipment."
Designing a multi-epitope vaccine to provoke the robust immune response against influenza A H7N9,"A new strain of Influenza A Virus (IAV), so-called ""H7N9 Avian Influenza"", is the first strain of this virus in which a human is infected by transmitting the N9 of influenza virus. Although continuous human-to-human transmission has not been reported, the occurrence of various H7N9-associated epidemics and the lack of production of strong antibodies against H7N9 in humans warn of the potential for H7N9 to become a new pandemic. Therefore, the need for effective vaccination against H7N9 as a life-threatening viral pathogen has become a major concern. The current study reports the design of a multi-epitope vaccine against Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) proteins of H7N9 Influenza A virus by prediction of Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), Helper T lymphocyte (HTL), IFN-γ and B-cell epitopes. Human β-defensin-3 (HβD-3) and pan HLA DR-binding epitope (PADRE) sequence were considered as adjuvant. EAAAK, AAY, GPGPG, HEYGAEALERAG, KK and RVRR linkers were used as a connector for epitopes. The final construct contained 777 amino acids that are expected to be a recombinant protein of about ~ 86.38 kDa with antigenic and non-allergenic properties after expression. Modeled protein analysis based on the tertiary structure validation, docking studies, and molecular dynamics simulations results like Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), Gyration, Root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) and Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) showed that this protein has a stable construct and capable of being in interaction with Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), TLR8 and m826 antibody. Analysis of the obtained data the demonstrates that suggested vaccine has the potential to induce the immune response by stimulating T and Bcells, and may be utilizable for prevention purposes against Avian Influenza A (H7N9)."
Does the interface with plantation forests provide suitable habitat for axis deer (Axis axis) to avoid systematic hunting pressure in a protected area of north-eastern Argentina?,"Axis deer (Axis axis), an introduced invasive species of growing concern around the globe, have rapidly expanded through the southern cone countries in South America. Despite increasing culling efforts over 14 years, axis deer remained abundant at El Palmar National Park in north-eastern Argentina. We tested whether this continued abundance possibly reflected control failures as a result of adjacent plantation forests providing a safe-haven refuge for deer. We carried out a cross-sectional survey of deer faecal pellet groups and tracks in 77 matched pairs of 25 m2 plots deployed at random over the park–plantation interface and assessed the presence of deer trails along the 14.2-km wire fence between both land-use types. The relative odds of having at least one pellet group (occupancy) were 4.5 (95% CI 1.5 to 18.3) times higher among park plots than plantation plots. Using generalized linear mixed models, the relative odds of occupancy decreased significantly with increasing distance to the main permanent water course, but it was 83% lower in plantation plots than in the park plots. Principal component analysis of shrub cover, plant structure and plant height revealed greater shelter within the park. Deer trails were spatially aggregated up to 2300 m and were directly associated with deer occupancy. These results indicate that, in El Palmar National Park interface, plantation forests do not provide a refuge or selected habitat, and suggest instead that the environmental characteristics and diversity of habitats within the protected area are relevant for the effectiveness of the exotic ungulate management program."
Investigation of atovaquone-induced spatial changes in tumour hypoxia assessed by hypoxia PET/CT in non-small cell lung cancer patients,"Tumour hypoxia promotes an aggressive tumour phenotype and enhances resistance to anticancer treatments. Following the recent observation that the mitochondrial inhibitor atovaquone increases tumour oxygenation in NSCLC, we sought to assess whether atovaquone affects tumour subregions differently depending on their level of hypoxia."
An improved approximation algorithm for the reversal and transposition distance considering gene order and intergenic sizes,"In the comparative genomics field, one of the goals is to estimate a sequence of genetic changes capable of transforming a genome into another. Genome rearrangement events are mutations that can alter the genetic content or the arrangement of elements from the genome. Reversal and transposition are two of the most studied genome rearrangement events. A reversal inverts a segment of a genome while a transposition swaps two consecutive segments. Initial studies in the area considered only the order of the genes. Recent works have incorporated other genetic information in the model. In particular, the information regarding the size of intergenic regions, which are structures between each pair of genes and in the extremities of a linear genome."
Optic neuropathy secondary to granulomatosis with polyangiitis in a patient with Graves’ disease: a case report,"Dysthyroid optic neuropathy is the most commonly suspected diagnosis of optic neuropathy in Graves’ patients; however, other causes need to be ruled out. We present a unique case of optic neuropathy secondary to hypertrophic pachymeningitis with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, which was suspected to be antithyroid drug related."
Multiple Genitorurinary Abnormalities and Ectopic Kidney in a Patient with Thrombocytopenia with Absent Radii (TAR) Syndrome: a Case Report and Literature Review,"The thrombocytopenia-absent radius (TAR) syndrome is a congenital malformation syndrome characterized by bilateral absence of the radii and thrombocytopenia. TAR syndrome has been associated with multiple genitorurinary abnormalities but its association with ectopic kidney is unusual. We reported a case of a 6-year-old boy with TAR syndrome who presented to the emergency department with high-grade fever, dysuria, and severe lower abdominal pain. A review of his past medical history reveals 4 episodes of urinary tract infection within the last year. Urgent computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was performed; it showed an ectopic left kidney with malrotation with no stone or hydronephrosis. The patient was treated successfully with antibiotics. Knowledge of this atypical genitourinary abnormality in TAR syndrome patients will help to ascertain urologic complications related to ectopic kidneys and allow its appropriate management."
Hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency: real-world experience from the Icatibant Outcome Survey in Spain,"The Icatibant Outcome Survey (IOS) is an international registry monitoring the use of icatibant, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist indicated for the acute treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks. Our goal was to assess disease characteristics and icatibant treatment outcomes in patients with HAE due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (HAE type 1 or 2 (HAE-1/2)) from Spain relative to other countries participating in IOS."
Some Consistency Rules for Graph Matching,"Graph matching is a comparison process of two objects represented as graphs through finding a correspondence between vertices and edges. This process allows defining a similarity degree (or dissimilarity) between the graphs. Generally, graph matching is used for extracting, finding and retrieving any information or sub-information that can be represented by graphs. In this paper, a new consistency rule is proposed to tackle with various problems of graph matching. After, using the proposed rule as a necessary and sufficient condition for the graph isomorphism, we generalize it for subgraph isomorphism, homomorphism and for an example of inexact graph matching. To determine whether there is a matching or not, a backtracking algorithm called CRGI2 is presented who checks the consistency rule by exploring the overall search space. The tree-search is consolidated with a tree pruning technique that eliminates the unfruitful branches as early as possible. Experimental results show that our algorithm is efficient and applicable for a real case application in the information retrieval field. On the efficiency side, due to the ability of the proposed rule to eliminate as early as possible the incorrect solutions, our algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in the literature. For the application side, the algorithm has been successfully tested for querying a real dataset that contains a large set of e-mail messages."
Elements in Pointed Invariant Cones in Lie Algebras and Corresponding Affine Pairs,"In this note, we study in a finite dimensional Lie algebra \({\mathfrak g}\) the set of all those elements x for which the closed convex hull of the adjoint orbit contains no affine lines; this contains in particular elements whose adjoint orbits generates a pointed convex cone \(C_x\). Assuming that \({\mathfrak g}\) is admissible, i.e., contains a generating invariant convex subset not containing affine lines, we obtain a natural characterization of such elements, also for non-reductive Lie algebras. Motivated by the concept of standard (Borchers) pairs in QFT, we also study pairs (x, h) of Lie algebra elements satisfying \([h,x]=x\) for which \(C_x\) pointed. Given x, we show that such elements h can be constructed in such a way that \(\mathop {\mathrm{ad}}\nolimits h\) defines a 5-grading, and characterize the cases where we even get a 3-grading."
Digital topics on cultural heritage investigated: how can data-driven and data-guided methods support to identify current topics and trends in digital heritage?,"In research and policies, the identification of trends as well as emerging topics and topics in decline is an important source of information for both academic and innovation management. Since at present policy analysis mostly employs qualitative research methods, the following article presents and assesses different approaches – trend analysis based on questionnaires, quantitative bibliometric surveys, the use of computer-linguistic approaches and machine learning and qualitative investigations. Against this backdrop, this article examines digital applications in cultural heritage and, in particular, built heritage via various investigative frameworks to identify topics of relevance and trendlines, mainly for European Union (EU)-based research and policies. Furthermore, this article exemplifies and assesses the specific opportunities and limitations of the different methodical approaches against the backdrop of data-driven vs. data-guided analytical frameworks. As its major findings, our study shows that both research and policies related to digital applications for cultural heritage are mainly driven by the availability of new technologies. Since policies focus on meta-topics such as digitisation, openness or automation, the research descriptors are more granular. In general, data-driven approaches are promising for identifying topics and trendlines and even predicting the development of near future trends. Conversely, qualitative approaches are able to answer “why” questions with regard to whether topics are emerging due to disruptive innovations or due to new terminologies or whether topics are becoming obsolete because they are common knowledge, as is the case for the term “internet”."
Non-invasive mapping of cortical categorization function by repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation,"Over the past years navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (nrTMS) had become increasingly important for the preoperative examination and mapping of eloquent brain areas. Among other applications it was demonstrated that the detection of neuropsychological function, such as arithmetic processing or face recognition, is feasible with nrTMS. In order to investigate the mapping of further brain functions, this study aims to investigate the cortical mapping of categorization function via nrTMS. 20 healthy volunteers purely right-handed, with German as mother tongue underwent nrTMS mapping using 5 Hz/10 pulses. 52 cortical spots spread over each hemisphere were stimulated. The task consisted of 80 pictures of living and non-living images, which the volunteers were instructed to categorize while the simulation pulses were applied. The highest error rates for all errors of all subjects were observed in the left hemisphere’s posterior middle frontal gyrus (pMFG) with an error rate of 60%, as well as in the right pMFG and posterior supra marginal gyrus (pSMG) (45%). In total the task processing of non-living objects elicited more errors in total, than the recognition of living objects. nrTMS is able to detect cortical categorization function. Moreover, the observed bihemispheric representation, as well as the higher error incidence for the recognition of non-living objects is well in accordance with current literature. Clinical applicability for preoperative mapping in brain tumor patients but also in general neuroscience has to be evaluated as the next step."

"Simulation-Based and Risk-Informed Assessment of the Effectiveness of Tsunami Evacuation Routes Using Agent-Based Modeling: A Case Study of Seaside, Oregon","Typically, tsunami evacuation routes are marked using signs in the transportation network and the evacuation map is made to educate people on how to follow the evacuation route. However, tsunami evacuation routes are usually identified without the support of evacuation simulation, and the route effectiveness in the reduction of evacuation risk is typically unknown quantitatively. This study proposes a simulation-based and risk-informed framework for quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of evacuation routes in reducing evacuation risk. An agent-based model is used to simulate the tsunami evacuation, which is then used in a simulation-based risk assessment framework to evaluate the evacuation risk. The route effectiveness in reducing the evacuation risk is evaluated by investigating how the evacuation risk varies with the proportion of the evacuees that use the evacuation route. The impacts of critical risk factors such as evacuation mode (for example, on foot or by car) and population size and distribution on the route effectiveness are also investigated. The evacuation risks under different cases are efficiently calculated using the augmented sample-based approach. The proposed approach is applied to the risk-informed evaluation of the route effectiveness for tsunami evacuation in Seaside, Oregon. The evaluation results show that the route usage is overall effective in reducing the evacuation risk in the study area. The results can be used for evacuation preparedness education and hence effective evacuation."
Evolution of the N-Terminal Regulation of Cardiac Troponin I for Heart Function of Tetrapods: Lungfish Presents an Example of the Emergence of Novel Submolecular Structure to Lead the Capacity of Adaptation,Troponin-based Ca2+ regulation of striated muscle contraction emerged approximately 700 million years ago with largely conserved functions during evolution. Troponin I (TnI) is the inhibitory subunit of troponin and has evolved into three muscle type-specific isoforms in vertebrates. Cardiac TnI is specifically expressed in the adult heart and has a unique N-terminal extension implicating a specific value during natural selection. The N-terminal extension of cardiac TnI in higher vertebrates contains β-adrenergic-regulated protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation sites as a mechanism to enhance cardiac muscle relaxation and facilitate ventricular filling. Phylogenic studies showed that the N-terminal extension of cardiac TnI first emerged in the genomes of early tetrapods as well as primordial lobe-finned fishes such as the coelacanth whereas it is absent in ray-finned fish. This apparently rapid evolution of β-adrenergic regulation of cardiac function suggests a high selection value for the heart of vertebrate animals on land to work under higher metabolic demands. Sequencing and PKA phosphorylation data showed that lungfish cardiac TnI has evolved with an amphibian-like N-terminal extension with prototype PKA phosphorylation sites while its overall structure remained fish like. The data demonstrate that the submolecular structure of TnI may evolve ahead of the whole protein for cardiac muscle contractility to adapt to new environmental conditions. Understanding the evolution of the β-adrenergic regulation of TnI and cardiac adaptation to the increased energetic demands of life on land adds knowledge for the treatment of human heart diseases and failure.
The role of the West Florida Shelf topography on the Loop Current system variability,"The evolution of the Loop Current (LC) system under the interaction with the complex topography of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) is examined. Focusing on the eastern GoM, we study the sole effects of the West Florida Shelf (WFS) topography on the LC system variability. We conduct numerical experiments using the free-running Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM), at 1/25° horizontal resolution and 26 hybrid vertical layers. A simulation with realistic topography (Control run) has been performed over 8 years and we analyze the last 5-year period (2007–2011). Modified topography with a deeper and smoother continental shelf is then introduced and we perform a 5-year simulation over the same study period. In addition, we perform two independent experiments with the same topographic modifications that are initialized from fields during minimum and maximum LC northernmost extension. The results show that in the case of the modified shelf, the LC tends to extend farther into the GoM, with a predominant westward axis tilt, and rarely retracts south of 26° N even after Loop Current Eddy (LCE) shedding events. The results also suggest that although the LC can be in the vicinity of the southwestern tip of the modified WFS, it is not prevented from extending northward, as it usually happens in the simulation with realistic topography. Finally, the evolution of the LC into the GoM is influenced by lower layer processes associated with the bottom topography in the southwestern WFS and western Straits of Florida. More specifically, lower layer intensified/weakened positive potential vorticity signature promotes retracted/extended LC phases."
Does a prior hysterectomy complicate transvaginal/transumbilical hybrid NOTES cholecystectomy?—a comparative analysis of prospectively collected data,"Hysterectomy alters the anatomy of the posterior vaginal vault used as access for transvaginal/transumbilical hybrid NOTES cholecystectomy (NC), creating potential consequences for the feasibility and complication rate of the procedure. Therefore, the aim of our retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was to analyze the postoperative course after NC in previously hysterectomized (PH) patients compared with patients who had not undergone hysterectomy (NH)."
"Machine learning thermobarometry and chemometry using amphibole and clinopyroxene: a window into the roots of an arc volcano (Mount Liamuiga, Saint Kitts)","The physical and chemical properties of magma govern the eruptive style and behaviour of volcanoes. Many of these parameters are linked to the storage pressure (P) and temperature (T) of the erupted magma, and the chemistry of the melt phase (X). However, reliable single-phase thermobarometers (P, T) and chemometers (X) which can recover this information remain elusive. We present a suite of new single-phase amphibole and clinopyroxene thermobarometers and chemometers, calibrated using random forest machine learning. These calibrations are used to track the range of pre-eruptive conditions, over the course of a millennial eruptive cycle, on an island arc volcano (Mount Liamuiga, Saint Kitts, Eastern Caribbean). We unpick the recent history of Mount Liamuiga, a stratovolcano that produces a dacitic eruption from the upper crust (~ 2 kbar) prior to the Lower Mansion Series eruptive sequence. This precedes a systematic increase in the temperature of crystallisation recovered by amphibole and clinopyroxene in the middle to upper crust (1.2 ± 0.5 to 5.6 ± 2.4 kbar), which correlates with a remarkable progression of matrix plagioclase chemistry to a less-evolved (more anorthitic) composition in time. Prediction of melt chemistry (SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, Na2O, K2O, FeO, MgO, TiO2) in equilibrium with clinopyroxene and amphibole delineate a liquid line of descent concordant with measured groundmass and whole rock chemistry. We also show that the regression strategy, as opposed to the abject insensitivity to pressure, has hindered previous calibrations of amphibole-only barometers. By applying our new calibrations, we construct a quantitative picture of the magma plumbing system beneath an arc volcano."
Real-World Outcomes Among Crizotinib-Treated Patients with ROS1-Positive Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Community Oncology-Based Observational Study,"Crizotinib was the first oral targeted therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), on 11 March 2016, for c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1)-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Data to support long-term clinical benefit in a real-world setting are limited."
Quantum coherence in electrically pumped organic interferometric emitters,"Electrically pumped organic semiconductors have been demonstrated to yield nearly diffraction-limited beam divergences and high-visibility double-slit interferograms characteristic of laser emission. This coherent emission has been measured and quantified in detail but no explanation has been advanced on the origin of this emission. Here, the origin of this emission is explained in terms of probability amplitudes à la Dirac. More specifically, in terms of Dirac’s identities applicable to quanta “absolutely indistinguishable from one another.” In addition, this elucidation enables the cohesive understanding of sources applicable to quantum entanglement experiments."
Multiscale mechanisms underpin the ecological uniqueness of local fish assemblages in tropical coastal seascapes,"Multiscale processes through dynamic boundaries drive the local contributions (LCBD; uniqueness in species composition and abundance) and species contributions (SCBD; individual species abundance variation) to fish beta diversity in coastal seascapes. We partitioned LCBD into LCBDRepl (replacement) and LCBDAbDiff (abundance difference), and used model-based approaches to investigate whether seascape size influences environmental and spatial drivers of LCBD, and effects of species (distribution, prevalence, and coastal dependence) on SCBD. Three large bays (bay level) and three zones per bay (zone level), southeastern Brazil, were seascape models during 1 year. At the bay level, more locations had higher LCBD, related to species composition, lower water transparency, and much less to flood/high tides and higher number of estuaries. LCBDRepl was also prevalent and stronger positive effects of transparency and mangrove cover reinforced the importance of environmental filtering and alternative habitats driving local contributions to replacement processes in larger seascapes. Species richness influenced positively LCBD primarily at the zone level, and negative effects of vegetal cover and primarily human settlements suggested species loss under lower heterogeneity. Also, more similar LCBDRepl and LCBDAbDiff evidenced the increasing local contributions to abundance differences in smaller species pools. At both levels, larger- and finer-scale spatial effects evidenced possible influences of dispersal and biotic interactions, respectively, on LCBDRepl and LCBDAbDiff. SCBD was positively related to species prevalence at locations and distribution at both levels. Therefore, multiscale mechanisms dependent and irrespective of seascape size support the critical importance of habitat availability, complexity, and variety to beta diversity of coastal fishes."
Marine turf of an invasive alga expels lugworms from the lower shore,"Bare sandy flats at and below low tide level of the Wadden Sea (eastern North Sea, European Atlantic) were observed in 2020 to have been invaded by an introduced grass-like alga, Vaucheria cf. velutina (Xanthophyceae). A dense algal turf accumulated and stabilized mud, where resident seniors of the lugworm Arenicola marina had reworked rippled sand. Algae and worms were incompatible. Initially, rising patches with algal turf alternated with bare pits where lugworms crowded. Their bioturbation inhibited young algae, while the felt of established algal rhizoids clogged feeding funnels of worm burrows. Eventually, a mosaic pattern of competitors gave way to a coherent algal turf without lugworms. Concomitantly, a rich small-sized benthic fauna took advantage of the novel algal turf. This exotic Vaucheria may have the potential for drastically altering the ecological web at the lower shore."
Increased levels of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 in the hippocampus of subjects with bipolar disorder: a postmortem study,"Bipolar 
disorder shares symptoms and pathological pathways with other neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Since TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a neuropathological marker of frontotemporal dementia and it is involved in synaptic transmission, we explored the role of TDP-43 as a molecular feature of bipolar disorder (BD). Homogenates were acquired from frozen hippocampus of postmortem brains of bipolar disorder subjects. TDP-43 levels were quantified using an ELISA-sandwich method and compared between the postmortem brains of bipolar disorder subjects and age-matched control group. We found higher levels of TDP-43 protein in the hippocampus of BD (n = 15) subjects, when compared to controls (n = 15). We did not find associations of TDP-43 with age at death, postmortem interval, or age of disease onset. Our results suggest that protein TDP-43 may be potentially implicated in behavioral abnormalities seen in BD. Further investigation is needed to validate these findings and to examine the role of this protein during the disease course and mood states."
The gullible genius: fast learners fall for fake news,"In many animals, decision-making is influenced by social learning, i.e. the acquisition of insights through the observation of other individuals’ behaviours. In cases where such socially obtained information conflicts with personally acquired knowledge, animals must weigh up one form of information against the other. Previous studies have found that individual animals differ consistently in how they trade-off socially versus personally acquired knowledge, but why this is so remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate whether an animal’s cognitive profile affects its decision to use either prior personal or new, conflicting social information, using the Italian wall lizard (Podarcis siculus) as our model species. We trained lizards to associate one of two colour cues with food, and subsequently allowed them to observe a conspecific trained for the opposite colour. After social demonstrations, lizards overall tended to use the ‘fake’, non-rewarding social information, but some individuals were more likely to do so than others. Lizards that showed faster spatial learning were more likely to copy social information even in the presence of reliable previous knowledge. Our study highlights the existence of significant inter-individual variation in social learning in a lizard, possibly mirroring variation in cognitive abilities."
Caudate lobe amebic abscesses: percutaneous image-guided aspiration or drainage,"Amebic liver abscess is the most common type of liver abscess on a worldwide basis, with caudate lobe being a relatively uncommon location for its occurrence. Abscess in caudate lobe of liver is often considered a challenging location for image-guided percutaneous drainage due to its difficult-to-access location along with close relationship with major vessels at porta hepatis."
The key regulator LcERF056 enhances salt tolerance by modulating reactive oxygen species-related genes in Lotus corniculatus,"The APETALA2/ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) family are important regulatory factors involved in plants’ response to environmental stimuli. However, their roles in salt tolerance in Lotus corniculatus remain unclear."
Splanchnic venous thrombosis in a nephrotic patient following COVID-19 infection: a case report,"As the COVID-19 pandemic spread worldwide, case reports and small series identified its association with an increasing number of medical conditions including a propensity for thrombotic complications. And since the nephrotic syndrome is also a thrombophilic state, its co-occurrence with the SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely to be associated with an even higher risk of thrombosis, particularly in the presence of known or unknown additional risk factors. Lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are the most common manifestations of COVID-19-associated hypercoagulable state with other venous or arterial sites being much less frequently involved. Although splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) has been reported to be 25 times less common than usual site venous thromboembolism (VTE) and rarely occurs in nephrotic patients, it can have catastrophic consequences. A small number of SVT cases have been reported in COVID-19 infected patients in spite of their number exceeding 180 million worldwide."
Collapse of quasi-two-dimensional symmetrized Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupled Bose–Einstein condensate,"Here, we study the collapse process of quasi-two-dimensional Bose–Einstein condensate with symmetrized Dresselhaus spin–orbit coupling. We show that at a sufficiently strong spin–orbit coupling the arising spin-dependent velocity compensates the attraction between particles and can prevent the collapse of the condensate. As a result, spin–orbit coupling can lead to a stable condensate rather than the collapse process."
Multiphysics design of programmable shape-memory alloy-based smart structures via topology optimization,"We present a novel multiphysics and multimaterial computational design framework for shape-memory alloy-based smart structures. The proposed framework uses topology optimization to optimally distribute multiple material candidates within the design domain, and leverages a nonlinear phenomenological constitutive model for shape-memory alloys (SMAs), along with a coupled transient heat conduction model. In most practical scenarios, SMAs are activated by a nonuniform temperature field or a nonuniform stress field. This framework accurately captures the coupling between the phase transformation process and the evolution of the local temperature field. Thus, the resulting design framework is able to optimally tailor the two-way shape-memory effect and the superelasticity response of SMAs more precisely than previous algorithms that have relied on the assumption of a uniform temperature distribution. We present several case studies, including the design of a self-actuated bending beam and a gripper mechanism. The results show that the proposed framework can successfully produce SMA-based designs that exhibit targeted displacement trajectories and output forces. In addition, we present an example in which we enforce material-specific thermal constraints in a multimaterial design to enhance its thermal performance. In conclusion, the proposed framework provides a systematic computational approach to consider the nonlinear thermomechanical response of SMAs, thereby providing enhanced programmability of the SMA-based structure."
Advanced solution framework for time-dependent reliability-based design optimization under fuzzy and interval uncertainties,"The problem which is actually being addressed in this study includes two parts: One is on establishing time-dependent reliability-based design optimization (tRBDO) formulation under fuzzy and interval uncertainties to obtain the optimal design parameter solution for the time-dependent structure. The other is on presenting a serial single-loop optimization (SSLO) strategy to estimate the optimal design parameter. For addressing the optimal design parameter of the time-dependent structure involving fuzzy and interval uncertainties, a novel tRBDO model with the constraint of time-dependent failure possibility (TDFP) based on the possibility theory of the safety measure is proposed. For evaluating the optimal design parameter, the established SSLO method converts the original triple-loop optimization which is TDFP-index-based approach into a sequence of deterministic optimization, interval value corresponding to the worst case scenario, the estimation of time instant, and the minimum most probable point. Iterative searching step is not needed to find the minimum most probable point at each iteration step in the proposed SSLO strategy; therefore, the computational time is extremely reduced. Several examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach."
Cognitive mechanisms of statistical learning and segmentation of continuous sensory input,"Two classes of cognitive mechanisms have been proposed to explain segmentation of continuous sensory input into discrete recurrent constituents: clustering and boundary-finding mechanisms. Clustering mechanisms are based on identifying frequently co-occurring elements and merging them together as parts that form a single constituent. Bracketing (or boundary-finding) mechanisms work by identifying rarely co-occurring elements that correspond to the boundaries between discrete constituents. In a series of behavioral experiments, I tested which mechanisms are at play in the visual modality both during segmentation of a continuous syllabic sequence into discrete word-like constituents and during recognition of segmented constituents. Additionally, I explored conscious awareness of the products of statistical learning—whole constituents versus merged clusters of smaller subunits. My results suggest that both online segmentation and offline recognition of extracted constituents rely on detecting frequently co-occurring elements, a process likely based on associative memory. However, people are more aware of having learnt whole tokens than of recurrent composite clusters."
The effect of obstructed action efficacy on reward-based decision-making in healthy adolescents: a novel functional MRI task to assay frustration,"Frustration is common in adolescence and often interferes with executive functioning, particularly reward-based decision-making, and yet very little is known about how incidental frustrating events (independent of task-based feedback) disrupt the neural circuitry of reward processing in this important age group. While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 45 healthy adolescents played a card game in which they had to guess between two options to earn points, in low- and high-stake conditions. Functioning of button presses through which they made decisions was intermittently blocked, thereby increasing frustration potential. Neural deactivation of the precuneus, a Default Mode Network region, was observed during obstructed action blocks across stake conditions, but less so on high- relative to low-stake trials. Moreover, less deactivation in goal-directed reward processing regions (i.e., caudate), frontoparietal “task control” regions, and interoceptive processing regions (i.e., somatosensory cortex, thalamus) were observed on high-stake relative to low-stake trials. These findings are consistent with less disruption of goal-directed reward seeking during blocked action efficacy in high-stake conditions among healthy adolescents. These results provide a roadmap of neural systems critical to the processing of frustrating events during reward-based decision-making in youths and could help to characterize how frustration regulation is altered in a range of pediatric psychopathologies."
Post-error slowing in anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders,"Altered brain response to errors in anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) suggests cognitive control abnormalities across both types of illness, but behavioral metrics of cognitive control function have yet to be compared in patients selected from these different diagnostic categories. Thus, we examined post-error slowing (PES), a behavioral adjustment that typically occurs after a mistake, in children and adolescents with and without a primary anxiety disorder (N = 103 anxiety and N = 28 healthy controls) and adolescents and adults with and without OCD (N = 118 OCD and N = 60 healthy controls) using a go/no-go task. Primary analyses tested for differences in PES between diagnostic groups (anxiety, OCD, healthy), controlling for age, overall reaction time, and overall accuracy. Results indicated that patients with anxiety disorders exhibited more post-error slowing than both patients with OCD and healthy volunteers. In contrast, participants with OCD did not differ from healthy volunteers in post-error slowing. In subgroup analyses restricted to adolescent participants (ages 13–17 years), more post-error slowing was observed in the anxiety disorders group compared with either the OCD or healthy groups. These data suggest that excessive post-error slowing, an index of behavioral adjustment following errors, may uniquely characterize patients with anxiety disorders relative to healthy individuals and those with OCD."
Severe leaf-vein infestation upregulates antioxidant and photosynthetic activities in the lamina of Ficus religiosa,"Pipaldiplosis pipaldiplosis forms galls on the midribs and veins of the leaves of Ficus religiosa, but how these leaf-vein infestations can affect the antioxidant defense mechanism and photosynthetic performance of the interveinal lamina is unknown. Therefore, we investigated ROS, antioxidant potential and photosynthesis in the lamina of F. religiosa infected by leaf-vein gall P. pipaldiplosis. The H2O2 content rose rapidly upon mild infection and thereafter decreased with increasing the intensity of infection. Severe leaf-vein infestation significantly up-regulated the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and guaiacol peroxidase. Correlation between H2O2 and antioxidant enzymes clearly indicates that ROS plays a crucial role in plant defense mechanism against P. pipaldiplosis. Leaf-vein galls remarkably altered the minimum and maximal fluorescence intensities, density of active reaction centers, light harvesting efficiency, electron transfer rate, dissipation energy, maximum quantum yield of primary PSII photochemistry, quantum yield of electron transport and performance index on cross section basis in the lamina of infected leaves. The results indicate that during the mild infection, reaction centers act as energy dissipating units (inactive form) to prevent photoinactivation and reconvert to energy conserving units (active form) during the severe infection. More severe infection results in complete obstruction of leaf-veins which ultimately cause death of the leaves. In conclusion, P. pipaldiplosis-induced oxidative stress decreases photosynthesis in leaf lamina during the mild infection. In contrast, the rate of photosynthesis increased during the severe leaf vein infestation to compensate the loss of photo-assimilates caused by P. pipaldiplosis."
Plant seeds and their use as test organisms for the assessment of toxicity of a model xenobiotic,"Human nutrition depends on several crop species, which may be targets for anthropogenic contamination. This is a special concern, since the impairment of food growth can jeopardize human sustainability, and the use of contaminated resources such as soil or water can be a problem to consider. Chemical contaminants may be from varied classes, including pharmaceutical drugs, which are used for human and veterinary medicines, aquaculture and agriculture. Among these, the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) is used in aquaculture and human medicine, being capable of causing deleterious effects on plants. This pharmaceutical is often detected in water samples, some of which are sometimes used to irrigate crop fields. The present study intended to: (i) assess the feasibility of using simple plant-based tests (radish, Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus; and kale, Brassica oleracea) in ecotoxicity testing, using two different media (modified Steinberg, SM; and distilled water, DW); and (ii) to test if CIP can adversely impact seed germination, early development features (leaf area, stem length, and weight) and biochemical parameters related to photosynthesis (chlorophyll a, b and total, as well as carotene content) of the two plant species. The obtained results, despite preliminary, suggest that both media can be used in germination tests, since no observable effects were detected in plants germinating in both media. CIP caused no pattern of significative alterations in growth/development in both media. Photosynthetic pigments were differently affected by the two media, being the contents of Chlorophyll b and total Chlorophyll the most responsive parameters. However, no biochemical effects were reported for germination time and rates. In conclusion, both SM and DW can be used to perform germination tests in R. raphanistrum subsp. sativus and B. oleracea. Considering the entire set of data, it is possible to conclude that CIP did not cause comprehensive alterations in both growth/development and photosynthetic parameters, without being possible to exclude the occurrence of other significant alterations that were, however, not studied in these assays. These two data sets must be complimented in the future by analysing more physiological parameters that may be deleteriously altered by CIP, in alternative plant species. Nevertheless, it is clear from the here-obtained results that both plants are refractory to the putative adverse short and medium-term effects caused by CIP, under the selected test conditions."
"The do’s, don’ts and don’t knows of redressing differential attainment related to race/ethnicity in medical schools","Systematic and structural inequities in power and privilege create differential attainment whereby differences in average levels of performance are observed between students from different socio-demographic groups.

Ultrastructural changes in cristae of lymphoblasts in acute lymphoblastic leukemia parallel alterations in biogenesis markers,"We explored the link between mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial morphology using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in lymphoblasts of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and compared these characteristics between tumors and control samples. Gene expression of mitochondrial biogenesis markers was analysed in 23 ALL patients and 18 controls and TEM for morphology analysis was done in 15 ALL patients and 9 healthy controls. The area occupied by mitochondria per cell and the cristae cross-sectional area was observed to be significantly higher in patients than in controls (p-value = 0.0468 and p-value< 0.0001, respectively). The mtDNA copy numbers, TFAM, POLG, and c-myc gene expression were significantly higher in ALL patients than controls (all p-values< 0.01). Gene Expression of PGC-1α was higher in tumor samples. The analysis of the correlation between PGC-1α expression and morphology parameters i.e., both M/C ratio and cristae cross-sectional area revealed a positive trend (r = 0.3, p = 0.1). The increased area occupied by mitochondria and increased cristae area support the occurrence of cristae remodelling in ALL. These changes might reflect alterations in cristae dynamics to support the metabolic state of the cells by forming a more condensed network. Ultrastructural imaging can be useful for affirming changes occurring at a subcellular organellar level."

Theodicy in a Deterministic Universe: God and the Problem of Suffering in Vyāsatīrtha’s Tātparyacandrikā,"The classical traditions of Vedānta in India explored the problem of why an omnipotent being like God would permit sentient beings to suffer in His creation. This article explores the solution provided to the problem of suffering by the sixteenth-century philosopher Vyāsatīrtha. Vyāsatīrtha argued that there is a satisfying explanation of why God would permit suffering to both exist and to be unevenly distributed among the individual souls trapped in transmigratory existence. He claims that we can only reconcile the idea of an independent, omnipotent God with the existence of suffering by assuming that God’s treatment of the individual souls is based primarily in their eternal, immutable ethical natures and not purely on their conduct/karma as some earlier philosophers suggested. The article is based on original translations of the passages in the Tātparyacandrikā where Vyāsatīrtha makes these arguments against his Advaita and Viśiṣṭādvaita opponents."
Ground Validation Experiment and Spectral Detection Capability Evaluation of Mars Mineralogical Spectrometer (MMS) Aboard HX-1 Orbiter,"As a hyperspectral imager aboard the orbiter “HX-1” of China’s first Mars mission, the Mars Mineralogical Spectrometer (MMS) is designed with hyperspectral and multispectral operation modes to survey the mineral types and their distribution on the surface of Mars, and to study the overall chemical composition and evolution history of Mars. The multispectral modes of MMS are different from hyperspectral modes on the bands selection, spatial and spectral resolution, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) etc. So the spectral detection capability of each mode of MMS is also different. The ground validation experiment of MMS is conducted to evaluate the hyperspectral and multispectral data quality and detection capabilities. The main conclusions include: (1) The measured hyperspectra of typical mineral samples obtained by MMS agree well with the data acquired by the Standard Comparison Spectrometers (SCS) under the same measurement conditions, and the spectral uncertainty between MMS and SCS is less than 7% in the key spectral ranges (\(0.7\sim2.2~\upmu \text{m}\)). For some typical minerals, the absorption band positions deviation between MMS and SCS are within \(0.69\sim14.86~\text{nm}\), which are within the spectral resolution limits of MMS. (2) The six sets of band combinations designed for MMS multispectral modes are slightly superior to CRISM’s multispectral mode in terms of spectral resolutions and bands selection, the water-containing minerals will be more accurately distinguished and identified, such as montmorillonite and kaolinite. Besides, the SNR of each multispectral mode is greater than 400 in the 500–2600 nm spectral range, which meets the requirements for the subtle spectral characteristics of water-containing minerals. (3) Benefiting from the MMS ground validation experiment and the experience of the OMEGA and CRISM, it is recommended that MMS first adopt the spatial continuous 52-sample or 104-sample (spatial resolution is about \(0.53\sim1.06~\text{km}\)) multispectral operation mode for typical minerals global mapping and finding target areas of interest. Then the 208-sample multispectral mode (spatial resolution is about \(\sim265~\text{m}\)) or 26-sample hyperspectral mode can be used to survey target areas of interest for the subtle mineral types characteristics and distribution. At last, 26-sample hyperspectral mode could be used to monitor the atmospheric composition of Mars by limb observations."
Point process simulation of generalised inverse Gaussian processes and estimation of the Jaeger integral,"In this paper novel simulation methods are provided for the generalised inverse Gaussian (GIG) Lévy process. Such processes are intractable for simulation except in certain special edge cases, since the Lévy density associated with the GIG process is expressed as an integral involving certain Bessel functions, known as the Jaeger integral in diffusive transport applications. We here show for the first time how to solve the problem indirectly, using generalised shot-noise methods to simulate the underlying point processes and constructing an auxiliary variables approach that avoids any direct calculation of the integrals involved. The resulting augmented bivariate process is still intractable and so we propose a novel thinning method based on upper bounds on the intractable integrand. Moreover, our approach leads to lower and upper bounds on the Jaeger integral itself, which may be compared with other approximation methods. The shot noise method involves a truncated infinite series of decreasing random variables, and as such is approximate, although the series are found to be rapidly convergent in most cases. We note that the GIG process is the required Brownian motion subordinator for the generalised hyperbolic (GH) Lévy process and so our simulation approach will straightforwardly extend also to the simulation of these intractable processes. Our new methods will find application in forward simulation of processes of GIG and GH type, in financial and engineering data, for example, as well as inference for states and parameters of stochastic processes driven by GIG and GH Lévy processes."
Rationality determination method and mechanical behavior of underground utility tunnels in a ground fissure environment,"To study the evolution law and internal mechanism of the mechanical behavior of the structure and surrounding strata of an underground utility tunnel under the dislocation of ground fissures, and the failure mode of the tunnel structure, based on theoretical analysis and model tests, this study proposes a new method for determining the rationality of model test parameters and selecting the optimal dislocation rate, and then carries out an underground pipe gallery model test under multiple influencing factors such as dislocation displacement and mutual angle. First, by comparing the theoretical solution of the internal force of the pipe gallery structure under initial conditions, the rationality of the model test parameters can be preliminarily verified. Second, the physical unidirectional compression experiments of the geological structure of ground fissures at high, medium, and low speeds were carried out, and it was observed that the low speed (0.0005 mm/s) could better reflect the active characteristics of ground fissures in Xi’an. Based on the above experimental parameters, the mechanical behavior of underground pipe gallery under the influence of orthogonal (90°) and oblique (45°) was studied, and the following conclusions were obtained. (1) The structural strain at the top of the upper plate changes from tension to compression with an increase in the cross momentum when it was orthogonal and from tension to compression when it was oblique. (2) With the increase in staggered momentum, the contact pressure near the top of the structure near the ground fracture at the orthogonal and oblique angles increases considerably, and both angles demonstrate a void at the bottom of the upper pipe gallery structure. (3) The soil near the ground fissure is more severely affected by the dislocation, and the stress disturbance at the far end was the smallest. (4) With an increase in dislocation displacement, the law of surface subsidence was consistent between the orthogonal and oblique, i.e., the upper surface deformation showed a convex distribution. The lower plate showed a concave distribution. Based on the above conclusions, through in-depth summary and analysis, the longitudinal failure mode of the pipe gallery structure under orthogonal and oblique crossings was obtained: extrusion failure mode of the pipe gallery structure under an orthogonal condition and torsion–tension–extrusion failure under an oblique condition."
Climate Sensitivity to an Increase in the Carbon Dioxide Concentration in the Atmosphere Decreases with an Increase in the Water Vapor Concentration upon Warming,"With climate warming, a feature of the atmosphere reaction is that the concentration of water vapor (H2O) increases very sharply directly in the lowest near-surface layers of the troposphere with a uniform distribution of the increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) along the height. Due to the significant overlap of their spectral absorption bands in the ranges of ~ 4–5, ~ 9–11, and ~ 12–18 µm, the absorption of thermal radiation from the surface with an increase in temperature is not proportional to the increase in their absolute concentrations. Therefore, the fraction of surface thermal radiation absorbed by CO2 in the overlapping sections of the absorption bands of the atmospheric transparency window increases little with warming (at its current level of more than 415 ppmV) due to an increase in absorption by the sharp increase in the concentration of H2O molecules directly in the lowest near-surface layers of the troposphere. As a result, a significant increase in the H2O concentration in the lowest near-surface layers during warming significantly increases the absorption of thermal radiation from the surface, reducing the effect of an increase in the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere on the thermal regime of the planet, as well as on climate sensitivity."
Variations in the Solar Magnetic Fields and their Influence on Coronal Mass Ejections and Type-II Radio Bursts,"The parameters of type-II radio bursts (RBIIs) and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with them (the so-called radio-loud CMEs (RL CMEs)) in solar cycles 23 and 24 (1997–2017) are analyzed based on data from ground-based and space-borne observations. The dependences of these parameters on the strength of the global magnetic field (GMF) in the region of RBIIs and the degree of GMF structural variability are also studied. The results show that both the polar and nonpolar components of the solar GMF decrease from cycle 23 to cycle 24. At the same time, the GMF structure becomes more chaotic. Since the GMF magnitude is lower in cycle 24, the dependences of all parameters of RL CMEs and RBIIs are shifted toward lower values of the GMF. Most events form under a stable GMF structure. While the total number of CMEs increased from 13 924 in cycle 23 to 15 074 in cycle 24, the number of RL CMEs decreased from 338 in cycle 23 to 180 in cycle 24. Parameters of RL CMEs and PBIIs differ in cycles 23 and 24 and the nature of their change corresponds to powerful CMEs and the dynamics of magnetic fields above 100 G. The presence of separate groups of RL CMEs and RBIIs in the dependencies on the GMF magnitude and structural variability can serve as evidence of different kinds of RBIIs, the formation of which requires completely different conditions."
Estimating the Energy of Solar and Stellar Superflares,"We discuss the current observations of the most powerful non-steady phenomena on solar-like stars. While remaining within even the most extreme solar ideas, it is very problematic to get the flare energy more than (3–5) × 1034 erg, which is apparently an absolute upper limit for solar-type flares. For explanation of the higher flare energy, about of 1036 erg, one need to adopt that spots with the magnetic field strength of a few kG should cover more than 30% of a hemisphere. This estimate leads to a mean magnetic field around 1 kG. New observational evidences for a presence of the strong magnetic fields on solar-like stars appeared recently. We discuss to what extent it is necessary to change the mechanisms of convection and dynamo with a corresponding change in the models of the atmosphere. We consider possible ways of solving the problem of the energy of superflares."
Solar Activity and Climate Change at the End of the Ice Age and Transition to the Holocene,"The heliospheric modulation potential is reconstructed for the period from 12 000 to 8000 BC based on the content of the cosmogenic isotope 10Be in layers of the GISP2 ice core of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The results are compared with the heliospheric modulation potential reconstructed earlier from radiocarbon data and with data on climate change. In particular, we show that the cooling during the Younger Dryas (~10 700–9700 BC) may have caused by low solar activity. Two periods of high solar activity are distinguished at the early Holocene, near 9600–9400 and 8900–8400 BC, which indicates the possible effect of variations in the solar activity on the Earth’s climate change."
Relationship between the Horizontal Gradient of the Vertical Magnetic Field and the Horizontal Electric Current on the Photosphere in a Model Active Region of the Sun,"Based on data obtained from numerical modeling of an active region (AR) of the Sun with the codes of radiation magnetohydrodynamics (MURaM), the horizontal gradient of the vertical component of the magnetic field on three layers in the vicinity of the photosphere \({{\nabla }_{h}}{{B}_{z}}\) and the horizontal component of the electric current density \({{j}_{h}}\) for the AR of the flare were calculated. It was found that ≈90% of the calculated pixels contain \({{j}_{h}}\) and \({{\nabla }_{h}}{{B}_{z}}\) of the same order, but these quantities are weakly correlated. The correlation coefficient is calculated for several groups of pixels that are distinguished by the magnitude of the horizontal current and the magnetic-field configuration. The correlation coefficients for these cases did not exceed 0.34 for the lower layer and 0.54 for the upper one. The contours of the strong \({{j}_{h}}\) and \({{\nabla }_{h}}{{B}_{z}}\) (in units of electric current density) are also weakly correlated. The result may indicate that caution must be taken when the horizontal-field gradient is used for approximation of the horizontal current in the photosphere (in particular, in the development of methods for the forecasting of flares). In additional, the probability-density functions \(PDF({{\left| {{{j}_{h}}} \right|} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\left| {{{j}_{h}}} \right|} {\left| {{{j}_{z}}} \right|}}} \right. \kern-0em} {\left| {{{j}_{z}}} \right|}})\) in AR photosphere are constructed. They show that the median value of the ratio of the horizontal current to the vertical current is 3.5. This is consistent with the few estimates of various components of currents in real solar ARs and indicates the importance of the further study of horizontal currents."
Solar Activity Level in 1611–1613: Sunspot Groups and Areas,"Early telescopic sunspot observations provide unique information extending our knowledge on solar activity back to the seventeenth century. In our work, we analyse sunspot parameters reconstructed from observations in the 1610s. Comparing distributions of historical and modern sunspot group areas, the fraction of small sunspots apparently missing in historic drawings was estimated. We suggest that reports might lack from 20 to 85% of sunspot groups depending on the style of observations. The number of sunspot groups corrected for the fraction of lost spots indicates that the period of 1612–1613 apparently belongs to a cycle of a secular maximum."
Long-Term Variations in Coronal Hole Areas and Occurrence of Magnetic Storms with Gradual Commencements,"In this paper we studied long-term variations in the areas of coronal holes (CHs) reconstructed on the basis of synoptic Hα charts for the period 1887–2016 and occurrences of magnetic storms with gradual commencements. It was found that the temporal variations in mean yearly values of the CH areas in the northern and southern hemispheres are characterized by a pronounced ∼11-year periodicity, but they differ markedly on a multidecadal time scale. The wavelet spectra of the CH areas in the southern hemisphere, unlike those of the northern one, demonstrate persistent periodicities of ∼30–35 years, which are also observed in geomagnetic activity and climatic characteristics. The results of cross-wavelet analysis revealed a link between annual occurrences of magnetic storms with gradual commencements and variations in CH areas in both hemispheres. The obtained results allow us to conclude that the evolution of solar coronal holes may be considered as a possible factor of the formation of multidecadal cycles in geomagnetic activity, as well as climatic cycles."
Effect of Explosive Processes on the Sun on the Inclination Angles of Magnetic Field Lines in Sunspot Umbrae,"In this paper, we study the effect of explosive processes (EPs) on the Sun on the magnetic properties of sunspot umbrae in active regions (ARs). Explosive processes include the formation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and/or flares. As a characteristic of the field in sunspot umbrae, we chose here the inclination angles of the field lines to the radial direction from the center of the Sun αmin (the minimal angle within sunspot umbra) and 〈α〉 (the average angle within sunspot umbra). It is shown that EPs in such ARs can significantly affect both the nature of the change with time in αmin and 〈α〉 in sunspot umbra and the nature of their oscillations. Most significantly, the behavior of the angles αmin and 〈α〉 in the sunspot shadow after the onset of flare changes during the event are associated with the emergence of the fastest considered CME and with a powerful solar flare. Our preliminary analysis showed that the strongest and sharpest changes in αmin and 〈α〉 occur in sunspot umbra with the smallest sizes and/or in sunspots that are closest to the site of EP occurrence. Presumably, the reason for the change in the behavior of the inclination angles of the field lines after the flare onset is the effect of the horizontal Lorentz force on the magnetic tubes emerging from the spot shadows. The electric currents participating in the formation of such a force arise during the transformation of the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere during the formation of a CME and/or the occurrence of a flash. A preliminary analysis included the oscillation features of αmin and 〈α〉 in the AR with observed various EPs and, separately, for comparison, in an AR with a sunspot group in the absence of such processes. The αmin and 〈α〉 values were found with vector measurements of the photospheric field with the SDO/HMI instrument."
Convolutional Neural Network Training Optimization for Low Point Density Image Recognition,"Methods for structure optimization of convolutional neural network used for low point density images recognition are proposed to accelerate the training and new images recognition, as well as to reduce the training and recognition procedures resource consumption. Optimized neural network showed a significant increase in speed without accuracy drop in the low point density images recognition, as well as a significantly reduced overfitting tendency."
Calculations of Settings in the Protection and Blocking Circuits of the Power Supply System of Electromagnetic Windings and the Duration of Plasma Discharges in T-15MD Tokamak,"At the present time, the construction of the T-15MD Tokamak is being completed at the National Research Center Kurchatov Institute. The magnet system of the Tokamak T-15MD should provide generation and confinement of the hot plasma in the divertor configuration. The design plasma parameters are as follows: major radius of 1.48 m, minor radius of 0.67 m, elongation of 1.7–1.9 and triangularity of 0.3–0.4, plasma current of 2 MA, toroidal magnetic field on the plasma axis of 2 T. The electromagnetic system includes toroidal and poloidal coils. The installation will be equipped with the auxiliary plasma heating and current drive in quasi-stationary discharges lasting hundreds of seconds. Scenarios of quasi-stationary plasma discharges are determined by the capabilities of the electromagnetic system to create and maintain an equilibrium magnetic configuration of the plasma column. Trouble-free operation of the power supply is provided by the protection and blocking system. This work is devoted to calculations of the maximum duration of currents in toroidal and poloidal windings in order to avoid their overheating, as well as the duration and scenarios of quasi-stationary plasma discharges."
On the Choice of Electron Cyclotron Heating Frequency for T-15MD Tokamak,"Electron cyclotron heating is one of the methods of additional plasma heating and noninductive current drive in the T-15MD tokamak. One to eight gyrotrons with a total power up to 7 MW will be used. The frequency of the microwave used depends on the parameters of the experimental scenarios in which the heating will be used and on the physical tasks for which it is intended. This article provides justification for the choice of the gyrotron frequency f1 ≅ 82.6 GHz for the start-up phase and for the first plasma experiments and considers the possibility of using this frequency at the stage of full-scale experiments. In order to provide flexibility of the Т-15MD ECH system, it is proposed to consider the possibility of the development of a gyrotron complex based on two-frequency gyrotrons with f1 ~ 82.6 GHz and f2 in the range of ~102–110 GHz."
A new roadmap for the breeding of disease-resistant and high-yield crops,"Breeding of disease-resistant and high-yield crops is essential to meet the increasing food demand of the global population. However, the breeding of such crops remains a significant challenge for scientists and breeders. Two recent discoveries may help to overcome this challenge: the discovery of a novel molecular framework to fine-tune disease resistance and yields that includes epigenetic regulation of antagonistic immune receptors, and the discovery of a Ca2+ sensor-mediated immune repression network that enables the transfer of subspecies-specific and broad-spectrum disease resistance. These breakthroughs provide a promising roadmap for the future breeding of disease resistant crops."
Towards quality assurance: implementation of a POCUS image archiving system in a high-volume community emergency department,"Quality assurance review is an integral part of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) programs but may not be routine practice in community hospitals. Lack of image acquisition and documentation can result in suboptimal patient care. In cases with an adverse outcome and no record of images, there is no mechanism for quality improvement."
Metabolic adjustments in forage oat (Avena sativa L.) genotypes under different sowing windows,"The current investigation was aimed to study the influence of planting dates (9 Oct, 24 Oct, 13 Nov, 26 Nov, 11 Dec, and 26 Dec) and maturity stages (40, 50, and 60 DAS) on nitrogen metabolic enzymes and biochemical constituents. The experiment was laid out in randomized block design during the winter season of 2019 by using two oat genotypes (OL-10 and OL-11) with variable growing ability. The activity pattern of studied enzymes revealed upregulated nitrate assimilation during optimum (Oct 24) and sub-optimum (Oct 9 and Nov 13) planting dates but a reverse trend was observed during late planting dates; LPD (Nov 26, Dec 11, and Dec 26). The environmental constraints during LPD resulted in the accrual of nitrate above toxic levels (> 2000 ppm). The regression analysis depicted a significant relationship of nitrate assimilating enzymes and nitrate–N with temperature and sunshine hour. Examination of ammonia assimilation and transaminases suggested that the enzyme activities got uplifted during late planting dates but were stable or slightly low at optimum and sub-optimum ones. Additionally, OL-10 proved to be an N-efficient genotype in comparison with the OL-11 genotype because of its high N assimilation potential. Therefore, gaining a better understanding of planting time is crucial for sustainable livestock production."
"Evolution, Functional Morphology and Paedomorphism in the Gogiid-Ascocystitid Lineage (Eocrinoidea; Cambrian-Ordovician)","Gogiid eocrinoids (Lower and Middle Cambrian) are basal echinoderms that document development of pentamerism, origin and emplacement of primitive respiratory structures (epispires), development of blastozoan stalks/stems and exothecal brachioles. By Lower Ordovician they (gogiids) show reduction in epispires. By Middle Ordovician epispires are lost and hollowed longitudinal and latitudinal rays across the sutural plates align into (especially) thecal-length respiratory structures that define the Ascocystitidae. These flexible animals can attain thecal lengths of 180 mm and internal volumes of 60+ cc which argues for some type of internal body fluid circulation—probably by muscular constriction."
A Review on Knowledge and Research of Interstitial Sea Cucumber,"The interstitial environment of sandy bottoms is an enigmatic habitat that forms unique ecosystems containing significant numbers of biodiversity. One of the lesser known marine invertebrate that inhabit this environment are sea cucumbers. The relative scarcity and lack of attention paid on these species have been the main obstacles to research and hence, knowledge of their taxonomy, biology, and ecology is limited. Thus, this review attempts to summarize the up-to-date overview of available knowledge on the diversity, distribution and the biology of interstitial sea cucumbers."
Paleoecological Conditions of Yuka Mammoth’s Habitat and the Yano-Indigirka Lowland’s Vegetation Patterns during the Late Pleistocene,"The vegetation, widespread during the life of a young female mammoth “Yuka”, about 34 300 yr ago (GrA-53289) was reconstructed as a complex of phytocenoses confined to coastal water and floodplain habitats. The main pastures were herb-gramineous floodplain meadows. Here, floodplain shrub communities of birches and alder forests grew, the reservoir was of an lake or swamp, as indicated by the corresponding vegetation. In the presented work, a new method of reconstruction of specific paleophytocenoses is proposed, which makes it possible to take a fresh look at the nature of the vegetation cover of the Late Pleistocene of Yakutia."
Sea Lilies in Spring: Crinoid Diversification during the Early Ordovician,"The many Early Ordovician crinoid discoveries over the past 30 years signal a largely undocumented crinoid radiation. The new crinoid diversity totals more than five times the previous known Early Ordovician list as of the year 2000. Camerate, cladid, and disparid clades had emerged by the second half of the Tremadocian Series, early during this time. Many key crinoid features such as their distinctive arms and standard cup plating originated by the end of the Early Ordovician, the Floian Stage. These new finds will provide data for character analysis in phylogenetic reconstructions, particularly those aimed at identifying early branching within the crinoid tree. Early Ordovician crinoids were among the earliest-known benthic invertebrates to exploit food resources high above the substrate. Significantly, they were also among the largest known faunal elements during this time. A tentative listing of Early Ordovician crinoids and their distributions is provided; this compendium is subdivided into time slices with Laurentian and global stratigraphic units."
"Morphology, Individual Age, DNA and Sex of the Yuka Mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) from Northern Yakutia, Russia","A partial carcass of the woolly mammoth, Mammuthus primigenius, named “Yuka Mammoth,” was found thawed from the Pleistocene Yedoma (permafrost) deposits of the Oyogos Yar bluff on the coast of the Dmitry Laptev Strait. Yuka’s AMS calibrated radiocarbon date yielded the date between ~40 100–39 000 calendar years BP. The mDNA analyses demonstrated that Yuka clusters with previously published Siberian woolly mammoths falling into clade 1 and represents ancestral to a haplotype shared by two ~18 500 14C yr old mammoths, including the Yukagir Mammoth that was discovered ~140 km from the Yuka’s site. The hide morphology in the genital area suggests that Yuka was a female. The teeth generation (DP3/dp3-Dp4/dp4) and their state of wear, season of her death (autumn) and confirmed earlier the dental development delay in infants allowed to estimate Yuka’s age as 5.5 yr old juvenile. Yuka’s tusks suggests that yuka was not older than 5.5 years woolly mammoth specimens with the similar dental age. Yuka’s missing body parts and the damage of the hide suggests that it was hunted by cave lions, but she managed to escape into a mudhole, where she died and was partially scavenged."
"Geo- and Archaeo-heritage in the Mount Vulture Area: List, Data Management, Communication, and Dissemination. A Preliminary note","Knowledge and management of areas with various cultural and natural assets represent both a challenge and an opportunity: a challenge, since it is not so trivial to analyse and to correlate different assets in the same geographic area, and an opportunity, since it represents a chance for scientific cooperation, communication, and dissemination of activities in territorial and cultural enhancement and for approaching themes and topics that are often socially a bit known, or unknown. At the same time, this will lead to having more awareness of peculiarities present in one’s territory and consequently to operate in such a way for geoconservation. The Area of Multidisciplinary Interest (AMI) can offer copious literature on its cultural heritage, even if it is often referred to as specific and/or expert end users. A multidisciplinary approach to the cultural and environmental heritage and to its communication/dissemination is required to avoid dispersal of knowledge. The Mount Vulture area, in southern Italy, has been chosen as an example of testing the possibility to work out, on the trail of previous similar studies, multicultural subjects to enhance the cultural heritage of territory, for use by both geo and non-geo end users. The Vulture is a strato-volcano whose activity was developed in Middle Pleistocene times, and thus, its genesis and evolution are therefore linked to the recent deformation activity affecting the south-Apennine chain. Some Vulture areas have represented the ideal habitat for life, hunting, and gathering activities in prehistoric times. Many sites of interest have provided palaeontological and archaeological materials allowing a deeper knowledge of the environmental context of the human presence during Palaeolithic and Mesolithic times. Topics as human, environment, and landscape evolutions are here proposed and designed for students with a different educational degree."
The Axial Complex of Echinoderms Represents the Kidney and Is Homologous to the Hemichordate Heart-Kidney,"The question of the presence of kidneys in echinoderms is a subject of discussion. Many guides state the absence of a special excretory organ in the echinoderms. However, there is a special excretory organ (kidney) in echinoderms. It is the axial complex. The blood network of the axial complex is represented by the system of haemocoelic spaces, which lie between the folds of the coelothelium of axial coelom. This haemocoelic capillary system is an axial organ. Contractions of the heart, which is enclosed into the pericardial coelom on the aboral side of the body, provides directional movement of the blood. The heart accepts the blood from two aboral haemal rings: the gastric ring and the genital ring. Haemocoelic spaces of the axial organ are separated from the axial coelom by the basal lamina. The surface of this basal lamina from the side of coelom is covered by the coelothelial lining, which contains the podocytes and epithelial-muscle cells. The extracellular diaphragms are stretched between the processes of the podocytes. Contractions of the heart and epithelial-muscle cells create the pressure, which provides the ultrafiltration of liquid from the haemocoel to the axial coelom. The coelomic liquid with the products of excretion is removed from the axial coelom to the environment via the pores of madreporic plate. The hemichordate heart-kidney consists of the proboscis coelom, which develops from the left axocoel of tornaria, the pericardium, which develops from the right axocoel, the heart, and the so-called glomerulus, i.e., a network of haemocoelic spaces between the folds of the proboscis coelom. The fluid is filtered from the haemocoelic spaces of the glomerulus through the basal lamina, passes between the finger-like processes of the podocytes, and reaches the proboscis coelom, from which it is excreted to the environment via the coelomoduct. The axial complex of Echinodermata is an undoubted homologue of the heart-kidney of Hemichordata. It is formed from the homologous larval coeloms, has a significant similarity in the structure, and is analogous in function. Probably, the excretory organ based on the dissymmetric preoral coeloms was formed in the common ancestor of hemichordates and echinoderms. It represents the most important synapomorphy of Ambulacraria."
Branched Holdfasts of Stemmed Echinoderms from the Middle Ordovician of the Leningrad Region,"As a result of examination of the collection of holdfasts of stemmed echinoderms from the Ordovician of the Leningrad oblast, Russia, all holdfasts are divided into two large groups: “unbranched” and “branched.” Three morphotypes of branched holdfasts are identified and described in detail. Morphogenetic transitions between morphotypes and their relationship with the peculiarities of the evolution of stemmed echinoderms in the Ordovician evolutionary radiation were identified."
Variations in the Solar Magnetic Fields and their Influence on Coronal Mass Ejections and Type-II Radio Bursts,"The parameters of type-II radio bursts (RBIIs) and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with them (the so-called radio-loud CMEs (RL CMEs)) in solar cycles 23 and 24 (1997–2017) are analyzed based on data from ground-based and space-borne observations. The dependences of these parameters on the strength of the global magnetic field (GMF) in the region of RBIIs and the degree of GMF structural variability are also studied. The results show that both the polar and nonpolar components of the solar GMF decrease from cycle 23 to cycle 24. At the same time, the GMF structure becomes more chaotic. Since the GMF magnitude is lower in cycle 24, the dependences of all parameters of RL CMEs and RBIIs are shifted toward lower values of the GMF. Most events form under a stable GMF structure. While the total number of CMEs increased from 13 924 in cycle 23 to 15 074 in cycle 24, the number of RL CMEs decreased from 338 in cycle 23 to 180 in cycle 24. Parameters of RL CMEs and PBIIs differ in cycles 23 and 24 and the nature of their change corresponds to powerful CMEs and the dynamics of magnetic fields above 100 G. The presence of separate groups of RL CMEs and RBIIs in the dependencies on the GMF magnitude and structural variability can serve as evidence of different kinds of RBIIs, the formation of which requires completely different conditions."
Climate Sensitivity to an Increase in the Carbon Dioxide Concentration in the Atmosphere Decreases with an Increase in the Water Vapor Concentration upon Warming,"With climate warming, a feature of the atmosphere reaction is that the concentration of water vapor (H2O) increases very sharply directly in the lowest near-surface layers of the troposphere with a uniform distribution of the increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) along the height. Due to the significant overlap of their spectral absorption bands in the ranges of ~ 4–5, ~ 9–11, and ~ 12–18 µm, the absorption of thermal radiation from the surface with an increase in temperature is not proportional to the increase in their absolute concentrations. Therefore, the fraction of surface thermal radiation absorbed by CO2 in the overlapping sections of the absorption bands of the atmospheric transparency window increases little with warming (at its current level of more than 415 ppmV) due to an increase in absorption by the sharp increase in the concentration of H2O molecules directly in the lowest near-surface layers of the troposphere. As a result, a significant increase in the H2O concentration in the lowest near-surface layers during warming significantly increases the absorption of thermal radiation from the surface, reducing the effect of an increase in the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere on the thermal regime of the planet, as well as on climate sensitivity."
Estimating the Energy of Solar and Stellar Superflares,"We discuss the current observations of the most powerful non-steady phenomena on solar-like stars. While remaining within even the most extreme solar ideas, it is very problematic to get the flare energy more than (3–5) × 1034 erg, which is apparently an absolute upper limit for solar-type flares. For explanation of the higher flare energy, about of 1036 erg, one need to adopt that spots with the magnetic field strength of a few kG should cover more than 30% of a hemisphere. This estimate leads to a mean magnetic field around 1 kG. New observational evidences for a presence of the strong magnetic fields on solar-like stars appeared recently. We discuss to what extent it is necessary to change the mechanisms of convection and dynamo with a corresponding change in the models of the atmosphere. We consider possible ways of solving the problem of the energy of superflares."
Solar Activity and Climate Change at the End of the Ice Age and Transition to the Holocene,"The heliospheric modulation potential is reconstructed for the period from 12 000 to 8000 BC based on the content of the cosmogenic isotope 10Be in layers of the GISP2 ice core of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The results are compared with the heliospheric modulation potential reconstructed earlier from radiocarbon data and with data on climate change. In particular, we show that the cooling during the Younger Dryas (~10 700–9700 BC) may have caused by low solar activity. Two periods of high solar activity are distinguished at the early Holocene, near 9600–9400 and 8900–8400 BC, which indicates the possible effect of variations in the solar activity on the Earth’s climate change."
Long-Term Variations in Coronal Hole Areas and Occurrence of Magnetic Storms with Gradual Commencements,"In this paper we studied long-term variations in the areas of coronal holes (CHs) reconstructed on the basis of synoptic Hα charts for the period 1887–2016 and occurrences of magnetic storms with gradual commencements. It was found that the temporal variations in mean yearly values of the CH areas in the northern and southern hemispheres are characterized by a pronounced ∼11-year periodicity, but they differ markedly on a multidecadal time scale. The wavelet spectra of the CH areas in the southern hemisphere, unlike those of the northern one, demonstrate persistent periodicities of ∼30–35 years, which are also observed in geomagnetic activity and climatic characteristics. The results of cross-wavelet analysis revealed a link between annual occurrences of magnetic storms with gradual commencements and variations in CH areas in both hemispheres. The obtained results allow us to conclude that the evolution of solar coronal holes may be considered as a possible factor of the formation of multidecadal cycles in geomagnetic activity, as well as climatic cycles."
Effect of Explosive Processes on the Sun on the Inclination Angles of Magnetic Field Lines in Sunspot Umbrae,"In this paper, we study the effect of explosive processes (EPs) on the Sun on the magnetic properties of sunspot umbrae in active regions (ARs). Explosive processes include the formation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and/or flares. As a characteristic of the field in sunspot umbrae, we chose here the inclination angles of the field lines to the radial direction from the center of the Sun αmin (the minimal angle within sunspot umbra) and 〈α〉 (the average angle within sunspot umbra). It is shown that EPs in such ARs can significantly affect both the nature of the change with time in αmin and 〈α〉 in sunspot umbra and the nature of their oscillations. Most significantly, the behavior of the angles αmin and 〈α〉 in the sunspot shadow after the onset of flare changes during the event are associated with the emergence of the fastest considered CME and with a powerful solar flare. Our preliminary analysis showed that the strongest and sharpest changes in αmin and 〈α〉 occur in sunspot umbra with the smallest sizes and/or in sunspots that are closest to the site of EP occurrence. Presumably, the reason for the change in the behavior of the inclination angles of the field lines after the flare onset is the effect of the horizontal Lorentz force on the magnetic tubes emerging from the spot shadows. The electric currents participating in the formation of such a force arise during the transformation of the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere during the formation of a CME and/or the occurrence of a flash. A preliminary analysis included the oscillation features of αmin and 〈α〉 in the AR with observed various EPs and, separately, for comparison, in an AR with a sunspot group in the absence of such processes. The αmin and 〈α〉 values were found with vector measurements of the photospheric field with the SDO/HMI instrument."
Solar Activity Level in 1611–1613: Sunspot Groups and Areas,"Early telescopic sunspot observations provide unique information extending our knowledge on solar activity back to the seventeenth century. In our work, we analyse sunspot parameters reconstructed from observations in the 1610s. Comparing distributions of historical and modern sunspot group areas, the fraction of small sunspots apparently missing in historic drawings was estimated. We suggest that reports might lack from 20 to 85% of sunspot groups depending on the style of observations. The number of sunspot groups corrected for the fraction of lost spots indicates that the period of 1612–1613 apparently belongs to a cycle of a secular maximum."
Relationship between the Horizontal Gradient of the Vertical Magnetic Field and the Horizontal Electric Current on the Photosphere in a Model Active Region of the Sun,"Based on data obtained from numerical modeling of an active region (AR) of the Sun with the codes of radiation magnetohydrodynamics (MURaM), the horizontal gradient of the vertical component of the magnetic field on three layers in the vicinity of the photosphere \({{\nabla }_{h}}{{B}_{z}}\) and the horizontal component of the electric current density \({{j}_{h}}\) for the AR of the flare were calculated. It was found that ≈90% of the calculated pixels contain \({{j}_{h}}\) and \({{\nabla }_{h}}{{B}_{z}}\) of the same order, but these quantities are weakly correlated. The correlation coefficient is calculated for several groups of pixels that are distinguished by the magnitude of the horizontal current and the magnetic-field configuration. The correlation coefficients for these cases did not exceed 0.34 for the lower layer and 0.54 for the upper one. The contours of the strong \({{j}_{h}}\) and \({{\nabla }_{h}}{{B}_{z}}\) (in units of electric current density) are also weakly correlated. The result may indicate that caution must be taken when the horizontal-field gradient is used for approximation of the horizontal current in the photosphere (in particular, in the development of methods for the forecasting of flares). In additional, the probability-density functions \(PDF({{\left| {{{j}_{h}}} \right|} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\left| {{{j}_{h}}} \right|} {\left| {{{j}_{z}}} \right|}}} \right. \kern-0em} {\left| {{{j}_{z}}} \right|}})\) in AR photosphere are constructed. They show that the median value of the ratio of the horizontal current to the vertical current is 3.5. This is consistent with the few estimates of various components of currents in real solar ARs and indicates the importance of the further study of horizontal currents."
Lactobacillus plantarum-derived metabolites sensitize the tumor-suppressive effects of butyrate by regulating the functional expression of SMCT1 in 5-FU-resistant colorectal cancer cells,"A critical obstacle to the successful treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) is chemoresistance. Chemoresistant CRC cells contribute to treatment failure by providing a mechanism of drug lethargy and modifying chemoresistance-associated molecules. The gut microbiota provide prophylactic and therapeutic effects by targeting CRC through anticancer mechanisms. Among them, Lactobacillus plantarum contributes to the health of the host and is clinically effective in treating CRC. This study confirmed that 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-resistant CRC HCT116 (HCT116/5FUR) cells acquired butyrate-insensitive properties. To date, the relationship between 5-FU-resistant CRC and butyrate resistance has not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that the acquisition of butyrate resistance in HCT116/5FUR cells was strongly correlated with the inhibition of the expression and function of SMCT1, a major transporter of butyrate in colonocytes. L. plantarum-cultured cell-free supernatant (LP) restored the functional expression of SMCT1 in HCT116/5FUR cells, leading to butyrate-induced antiproliferative effect and apoptosis. These results suggest that LP has a synergistic effect on the SMCT1/butyrate-mediated tumor suppressor function and is a potential chemosensitizer to overcome dual 5-FU and butyrate resistance in HCT116 cells."
Gold nanoparticle-DNA aptamer-assisted delivery of antimicrobial peptide effectively inhibits Acinetobacter baumannii infection in mice,"Acinetobacter baumannii causes multidrug resistance, leading to fatal infections in humans. In this study, we showed that Lys AB2 P3-His-a hexahistidine-tagged form of an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) loaded onto DNA aptamer-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNP-Apt)-can effectively inhibit A. baumannii infection in mice. When A. baumannii-infected mice were intraperitoneally injected with AuNP-Apt loaded with Lys AB2 P3-His, a marked reduction in A. baumannii colonization was observed in the mouse organs, leading to prominently increased survival time and rate of the mice compared to those of the control mice treated with AuNP-Apt or Lys AB2 P3-His only. This study shows that AMPs loaded onto AuNP-Apt could be an effective therapeutic tool against infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria in humans."
"Potent antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of TICbf-14, a peptide with increased stability against trypsin","The poor stability of peptides against trypsin largely limits their development as potential antibacterial agents. Here, to obtain a peptide with increased trypsin stability and potent antibacterial activity, TICbf-14 derived from the cationic peptide Cbf-14 was designed by the addition of disulfide-bridged hendecapeptide (CWTKSIPPKPC) loop. Subsequently, the trypsin stability and antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of this peptide were evaluated. The possible mechanisms underlying its mode of action were also clarified. The results showed that TICbf-14 exhibited elevated trypsin inhibitory activity and effectively mitigated lung histopathological damage in bacteria-infected mice by reducing the bacterial counts, further inhibiting the systemic dissemination of bacteria and host inflammation. Additionally, TICbf-14 significantly repressed bacterial swimming motility and notably inhibited biofilm formation. Considering the mode of action, we observed that TICbf-14 exhibited a potent membrane-disruptive mechanism, which was attributable to its destructive effect on ionic bridges between divalent cations and LPS of the bacterial membrane. Overall, TICbf-14, a bifunctional peptide with both antimicrobial and trypsin inhibitory activity, is highly likely to become an ideal candidate for drug development against bacteria."
Integrated zone picking and vehicle routing operations with restricted intermediate storage,"The competitiveness of a retailer is highly dependent on an efficient distribution system. This is especially true for the supply of stores from distribution centers. Stores ask for high flexibility when it comes to their supply. This means that fast order processing is essential. Order processing affects different subsystems at the distribution center: orders are picked in multiple picking zones, transferred to intermediate storage, and delivered via dedicated tours. These processing steps are highly interdependent. The schedule for picking needs to be synchronized with the routing decisions to ensure availability of orders at the DC’s loading docks when their associated tours are scheduled. Concurrently, intermediate storage represents a bottleneck as capacity for order storage is limited. The simultaneous planning of picking and routing operations with restricted intermediate storage is therefore relevant for retail practice but has not so far been considered within an integrated planning approach. Our work addresses this task and discusses an integrated zone picking and vehicle routing problem with restricted intermediate storage. We present a comprehensive model formulation and introduce a general variable neighborhood search for simultaneous consideration of the given planning stages. We also present two alternative sequential approaches that are motivated by the prevailing planning situation in industry. Numerical experiments and a case study show the need for an integrated planning approach to obtain practicable results. Further, we identify the impact of the main problem characteristics on overall planning and provide valuable insights for the application of these findings in industry."
High-Order Linearly Implicit Structure-Preserving Exponential Integrators for the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation,"A novel class of high-order linearly implicit energy-preserving integrating factor Runge–Kutta methods are proposed for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Based on the idea of the scalar auxiliary variable approach, the original equation is first reformulated into an equivalent form which satisfies a quadratic energy. The spatial derivatives of the system are then approximated with the standard Fourier pseudo-spectral method. Subsequently, we apply the extrapolation technique/prediction–correction strategy to the nonlinear terms of the semi-discretized system and a linearized energy-conserving system is obtained. A fully discrete scheme is gained by further using the integrating factor Runge–Kutta method to the resulting system. We show that, under certain circumstances for the coefficients of a Runge–Kutta method, the proposed scheme can produce numerical solutions along which the modified energy is precisely conserved, as is the case with the analytical solution and is extremely efficient in the sense that only linear equations with constant coefficients need to be solved at every time step. Numerical results are addressed to demonstrate the remarkable superiority of the proposed schemes in comparison with other existing structure-preserving schemes."
"Williamsia soli sp. nov., an actinobacterium isolated from soil at a thermal power plant in Yantai, China","Strain C17T, a novel strain belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria, was isolated from a thermal power plant in Yantai, Shandong Province, China. Cells of strain C17T were Gram stain positive, aerobic, pink, non-motile and round with neat edges, showing optimum growth at 28 °C. Phylogenetically, strain C17T was a member of the class Actinobacteria, order Mycobacteriales, family Gordoniaceae. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons revealed that the related strains were Williamsia faeni JCM 17784 T and Williamsia limnetica KCTC 19981 T with pairwise sequence similarity of 98.5% for both strains. According to the draft genome sequence, the DNA G + C content was 64.7%. The average amino acid identity (AAI), average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values between genome sequences of strain C17T and the closest type strain W. faeni JCM 17784 T were 77.5, 77.9, and 20.7%, respectively. Predominant fatty acids were C16:0 (31.7%) and C18:1ω9c (26.8%). The major menaquinone was MK-9. The diagnostic phospholipids were phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), and phosphatidylinositol (PI). Therefore, the combined phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data indicated that strain C17T was considered to represent a novel species of the genus Williamsia. Williamsia soli sp. nov. was proposed for strain C17T (= KCTC 49567 T = MCCC 1K04355T)."
Trends in Mortality after Intensive Care of Patients with Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Finland in 2003–2019: A Finnish Intensive Care Consortium study,"Previous studies suggest that case mortality of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) has decreased during the last decades, but most studies have been unable to assess case severities among individual patients. We aimed to assess changes in severity-adjusted aSAH mortality in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs)."
Big Data/AI in Neurocritical Care: Maybe/Summary,"Big data (BD) and artificial intelligence (AI) have increasingly been used in neurocritical care. “BD” can be operationally defined as extremely large datasets that are so large and complex that they cannot be analyzed by using traditional statistical modeling. “AI” means the ability of machines to perform tasks similar to those performed by human intelligence. We present a brief overview of the most commonly applied AI techniques to perform BD analytics and discuss some of the recent promising examples in the field of neurocritical care. The latter include the following: cognitive motor dissociation in disorders of consciousness, hypoxic-ischemic injury following cardiac arrest, delayed cerebral ischemia and vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage, and monitoring of intracranial pressure. It is imperative that we develop multicenter collaborations to tackle BD. These collaborations will allow us to share data, combine predictive algorithms, and analyze multiple and cumulative sources of data retrospectively and prospectively. Once AI algorithms are validated at multiple centers, they should be tested in randomized controlled trials investigating their impact on clinical outcome. The neurocritical care community must work to ensure that AI incorporates standards to ensure fairness and health equity rather than reflect our biases present in our collective conscience."
Improvement of hydriding kinetics of LaNi5-type metal alloy through substitution of nickel with tin followed by palladium deposition,"Hydrogen absorption performances of LaNi5 alloy are sensitive to the surface reactions with poisonous gases, such as oxygen, readily forming oxides/hydroxides. In this study, we report the studies on the hydrogen absorption behaviour of AB5-type hydrogen storage alloys, formed by LaNi(5–x)Snx (X = 0.2) followed by electroless Pd deposition. The uncoated and Pd-coated materials were characterized using scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Brunauer–Emmet–Teller. XRD analyses indicated that both LaNi5 and LaNi4.8Sn0.2 alloys crystallize in CaCu5-type crystal structure, while SEM analysis and particle size distribution histograms showed increment in particle size upon Sn incorporation. Palladium particles on the surface of the materials were detected by AAS and EDS analyses. Furthermore, substitution of a small fraction of Ni by Sn leads to an increase in hydrogen absorption capacity even without activation. Moreover, a decrease in hydrogen absorption rate was observed for LaNi4.8Sn0.2 alloy and this was related to an increment in the crystalline unit cell volume. Kinetic curves of Pd-coated alloys show superior absorption kinetics compared to their uncoated counterparts due to high affinity of Pd for hydrogen."
A User Prioritisation Algorithm for Horizontal Handover in Dense WLANs,"This paper proposes an algorithm that enhances horizontal handover (HO) in dense wireless local area networks (WLANs), which is implemented in a software-defined wireless networking (SDWN)-based architecture. The algorithm considers the concept of user prioritisation, classifying the WLAN stations (STAs) into two categories representing high and low priorities respectively, and always attempts to guarantee the best quality of experience (QoE) to the high priority users. The architecture that implements the algorithm leverages the flexibility, programmability, and centralised nature of SDWN to efficiently manage the HO process. Moreover, the paper presents a performance evaluation campaign that demonstrates significant achievements against a state-of-the-art solution in terms of the provided QoE, throughput and delay. Finally, we discuss the importance of considering user prioritisation in a HO algorithm for dense WLAN"
Point process simulation of generalised inverse Gaussian processes and estimation of the Jaeger integral,"In this paper novel simulation methods are provided for the generalised inverse Gaussian (GIG) Lévy process. Such processes are intractable for simulation except in certain special edge cases, since the Lévy density associated with the GIG process is expressed as an integral involving certain Bessel functions, known as the Jaeger integral in diffusive transport applications. We here show for the first time how to solve the problem indirectly, using generalised shot-noise methods to simulate the underlying point processes and constructing an auxiliary variables approach that avoids any direct calculation of the integrals involved. The resulting augmented bivariate process is still intractable and so we propose a novel thinning method based on upper bounds on the intractable integrand. Moreover, our approach leads to lower and upper bounds on the Jaeger integral itself, which may be compared with other approximation methods. The shot noise method involves a truncated infinite series of decreasing random variables, and as such is approximate, although the series are found to be rapidly convergent in most cases. We note that the GIG process is the required Brownian motion subordinator for the generalised hyperbolic (GH) Lévy process and so our simulation approach will straightforwardly extend also to the simulation of these intractable processes. Our new methods will find application in forward simulation of processes of GIG and GH type, in financial and engineering data, for example, as well as inference for states and parameters of stochastic processes driven by GIG and GH Lévy processes."
Ground Validation Experiment and Spectral Detection Capability Evaluation of Mars Mineralogical Spectrometer (MMS) Aboard HX-1 Orbiter,"As a hyperspectral imager aboard the orbiter “HX-1” of China’s first Mars mission, the Mars Mineralogical Spectrometer (MMS) is designed with hyperspectral and multispectral operation modes to survey the mineral types and their distribution on the surface of Mars, and to study the overall chemical composition and evolution history of Mars. The multispectral modes of MMS are different from hyperspectral modes on the bands selection, spatial and spectral resolution, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) etc. So the spectral detection capability of each mode of MMS is also different. The ground validation experiment of MMS is conducted to evaluate the hyperspectral and multispectral data quality and detection capabilities. The main conclusions include: (1) The measured hyperspectra of typical mineral samples obtained by MMS agree well with the data acquired by the Standard Comparison Spectrometers (SCS) under the same measurement conditions, and the spectral uncertainty between MMS and SCS is less than 7% in the key spectral ranges (\(0.7\sim2.2~\upmu \text{m}\)). For some typical minerals, the absorption band positions deviation between MMS and SCS are within \(0.69\sim14.86~\text{nm}\), which are within the spectral resolution limits of MMS. (2) The six sets of band combinations designed for MMS multispectral modes are slightly superior to CRISM’s multispectral mode in terms of spectral resolutions and bands selection, the water-containing minerals will be more accurately distinguished and identified, such as montmorillonite and kaolinite. Besides, the SNR of each multispectral mode is greater than 400 in the 500–2600 nm spectral range, which meets the requirements for the subtle spectral characteristics of water-containing minerals. (3) Benefiting from the MMS ground validation experiment and the experience of the OMEGA and CRISM, it is recommended that MMS first adopt the spatial continuous 52-sample or 104-sample (spatial resolution is about \(0.53\sim1.06~\text{km}\)) multispectral operation mode for typical minerals global mapping and finding target areas of interest. Then the 208-sample multispectral mode (spatial resolution is about \(\sim265~\text{m}\)) or 26-sample hyperspectral mode can be used to survey target areas of interest for the subtle mineral types characteristics and distribution. At last, 26-sample hyperspectral mode could be used to monitor the atmospheric composition of Mars by limb observations."
Splanchnic venous thrombosis in a nephrotic patient following COVID-19 infection: a case report,"As the COVID-19 pandemic spread worldwide, case reports and small series identified its association with an increasing number of medical conditions including a propensity for thrombotic complications. And since the nephrotic syndrome is also a thrombophilic state, its co-occurrence with the SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely to be associated with an even higher risk of thrombosis, particularly in the presence of known or unknown additional risk factors. Lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are the most common manifestations of COVID-19-associated hypercoagulable state with other venous or arterial sites being much less frequently involved. Although splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) has been reported to be 25 times less common than usual site venous thromboembolism (VTE) and rarely occurs in nephrotic patients, it can have catastrophic consequences. A small number of SVT cases have been reported in COVID-19 infected patients in spite of their number exceeding 180 million worldwide."
"Ontological modeling of the International Classification of Functioning, Disabilities and Health (ICF): Activities&Participation and Environmental Factors components","The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is a classification of health and health-related states developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to provide a standard and unified language to be used as a reference model for the description of health and health-related states. The concept of functioning on which ICF is based is that of a “dynamic interaction between a person’s health condition, environmental factors and personal factors”. This overall model has been translated into a classification covering all the main components of functioning. However, the practical use of ICF has highlighted some formal problems, mainly concerning conceptual clarity and ontological coherence."
Exploring the perspectives of primary care providers on use of the electronic Patient Reported Outcomes tool to support goal-oriented care: a qualitative study,"Digital health technologies can support primary care delivery, but clinical uptake in primary care is limited. This study explores enablers and barriers experienced by primary care providers when adopting new digital health technologies, using the example of the electronic Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) tool; a mobile application and web portal designed to support goal-oriented care. To better understand implementation drivers and barriers primary care providers’ usage behaviours are compared to their perspectives on ePRO utility and fit to support care for patients with complex care needs."
Descent three-term DY-type conjugate gradient methods for constrained monotone equations with application,"As it is known that, not all conjugate gradient (CG) methods satisfy descent property, a necessary condition for attaining global convergence result. In this article, we propose three different sufficient-descent conjugate gradient projection algorithms for constrained monotone equations. Using Dai–Yuan (DY) conjugate gradient parameter, we generate three satisfied sufficient-descent directions. Under suitable conditions, global convergence of the algorithms is established. Numerical examples using benchmark test functions indicate that the algorithms are effective for solving constrained monotone nonlinear equations. Moreover, we also extend the method to solve \(\ell _1\)-norm regularized problems to decode a sparse signal in compressive sensing. Performance comparisons show that the proposed methods are practical, efficient and competitive with the compared methods."
Spousal and living related kidney transplantation: our center experience,"Kidney transplantation is the most preferred type of renal displacement therapy for end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients.

Collecting Digital Evidence from Online Sources: Deficiencies in Current Polish Criminal Law,"The importance of digital evidence, especially online content, is continuously increasing due to the proliferation of digital technologies in socio-economic life. However, the legal means of criminal evidence gathering in Polish legislation remain unchanged and do not take into account some contemporary challenges. In various countries, traditional rules of evidence gathering were created in the context of a physical world. These rules may be insufficient to safeguard the forensic soundness of evidence gathering methods. Inadequacies of current procedures may be especially visible in the context of transborder digital evidence gathering from online open sources. This article describes the practical shortcomings of Polish criminal evidence law in the context of digital evidence with particular attention to online open-source materials. Empirical data indicate that existing legal limitations are bypassed in practice to enable evidence collection. This unfortunately often happens at the expense of the forensic soundness of digital evidence."
Isokinetic and functional shoulder outcomes after arthroscopic capsulolabral stabilization,"Shoulder stability is secured by dynamic and static stabilizers. Rotator cuff is responsible for dynamic stabilization. In cases of shoulder instability their activity is disturbed. Capsulolabral repair restores mainly static stabilization. This surgery treatment technique of shoulder instability was first described by Bankart in 1923. His idea, with further modifications, is commonly used up to this day. Evaluation of muscle shoulder recovery after stabilization should be one of the important criteria to allow patient to return to sport and work. However, not much isokinetic assessment after capsulolabral repair was described. The aim of this study were the following: the comparative assessment of the shoulder rotatory strength in patients following arthroscopic capsulolabral repair of unilateral anterior traumatic instability and clinical assessment with comparison of pre and post-operative results."

Pain fingerprinting using multimodal sensing: pilot study,"Pain is a complex phenomenon, the experience of which varies widely across individuals. At worst, chronic pain can lead to anxiety and depression. Cost-effective strategies are urgently needed to improve the treatment of pain, and thus we propose a novel home-based pain measurement system for the longitudinal monitoring of pain experience and variation in different patients with chronic low back pain. The autonomous nervous system and audio-visual features are analyzed from heart rate signals, voice characteristics and facial expressions using a unique measurement protocol. Self-reporting is utilized for the follow-up of changes in pain intensity, induced by well-designed physical maneuvers, and for studying the consecutive trends in pain. We describe the study protocol, including hospital measurements and questionnaires and the implementation of the home measurement devices. We also present different methods for analyzing the multimodal data: electroencephalography, audio, video and heart rate. Our intention is to provide new insights using technical methodologies that will be beneficial in the future not only for patients with low back pain but also patients suffering from any chronic pain."
"Modeling the Sensitive Element of the Sandwich Construction of a Capacitive Micromechanical Accelerometer, Taking into Account the Change in the Dielectric Constant","By using the capacitive measurement principle, high-performance micromechanical accelerometers provide low noise and power consumption, cost efficiency, and reliability. Capacitive sensors based on changes in the gap between the electrodes, as a rule, require closed-loop control, which increases the level of complexity of the measurement circuit and increases power consumption. Capacitive sensitive elements with a change in the electrode overlap area have a good linearity of the capacitance versus displacement and a large measurement range, but they are more difficult to manufacture. This paper presents and investigates a model of a sensitive element of a sandwich design of a capacitive micromechanical accelerometer, the functioning of which is based on the use of a change in the relative dielectric constant of the dielectric of capacitors due to the introduction of a movable inertial mass between the electrodes of the capacitors, moving under the action of acceleration. As a result, there is a change in capacitance in the output measuring circuit. It is shown that the considered model is sensitive to acceleration and resistant to temperature changes, with low residual mechanical stress in the sensitive element. The modeling and calculations are performed using the Ansys and SolidWorks software. It is found that the movement of the moving mass along the axis of sensitivity X is more than five times the movement of the moving mass along the nonworking axes, and the change in the capacitance between the electrodes along the axis X is almost 2500 times more than the changes in capacitance between electrodes along the nonworking axes Z and Y. Calculations have shown that for all values of the acting acceleration (up to 30 g), the mechanical stress in the sensitive element is much less than the ultimate strength of silicon, equal to 440 MPa. It is found that variation of the temperature from –40 to 85°C leads to minor changes in capacitance along the working axis (0.0025–0.003 pF). This indicates the temperature stability of the investigated micromechanical accelerometer sensing element. The results of the analysis show that the developed and investigated model of the sensitive element of the sandwich design ensures the sensitivity of the micromechanical accelerometer and the stability of its parameters."
FPGA Routing Architecture Estimation Models and Methods,"The problem of analyzing and evaluating the structure of FPGA routing resources at the early stages of the design flow is of a great interest for researchers. Until now, an approach, consisting of running the full design flow (logic synthesis, placement, routing) on a set of test circuits with a subsequent estimation of various parameters for each FPGA architecture being analyzed, had been dominant. Despite the high accuracy, this approach has a long runtime and requires lots of computing resources, as well as CAD tuned to the analyzed FPGA architecture. Modern FPGA contains more than a million logical gates, therefore, the application of such an approach is inefficient. Today, more attention is paid to the development of various models, which allows the evaluation of the structure of the routing resources at early stages without using the benchmark circuits. In this work, an overview of the existing models and methods for analyzing the structure of FPGA routing resources is presented. A comparison of the methods and models is performed, the estimation of their efficiency and possibility of application for designing domestic FPGA is made. It is found that the most optimal approach for analyzing arbitrary structures of the routing resources FPGA is the development and application of mixed methods. This will allow to obtain accurate models as well as to significantly reduce the development and market entry time."
Method and Hardware and Software for Measuring the Height of Aircraft and Descending Objects More Accurately,"For the safe maneuvering, descent, and landing of ultralight aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and parachute equipment, increased accuracy in determining their height is required. In this study, a critical analysis of the existing methods of measuring height is carried out to determine the most accurate method. Particular attention is paid to the barometric method. In order to reduce measurement errors, intelligent altitude sensors are developed and a prototype barometric altimeter is constructed based on them. In the process of computer and model modeling, it is found that several intelligent height sensors must be used in the altimeter design, and the location of the sensors on the aircraft significantly affects the measurement accuracy. The developed method for measuring altitude using such sensors includes hardware-software compensation for the errors caused by atmospheric phenomena and aerodynamic parameters of the aircraft’s structure. Hardware and software tools for processing the measured data, as well as software for the functioning of an intelligent pressure sensor, automatic data processing, and the information output to the altimeter display, are developed. The proposed method and hardware and software for measuring the height in real operating conditions show a significant reduction in errors that do not exceed 1 m when moving in an air stream at speeds up to 8 m/s and 5 m at speeds up to 70 m/s."
Memristor Logic in Digital Circuitry,"For the development of the market of modern microelectronics, methods are required that allow continuously increasing the productivity and energy efficiency of semiconductor products and, at the same time, reducing the required minimum area of the crystal while maintaining its functionality. Therefore, the integration of nonvolatile elements (memristors) and CMOS technologies, as well as the creation of methods for synthesizing digital circuits with smmristor functional units—memristor logic (MeMOS logic)—are urgent problems. The paper proposes a block method for the synthesis of hybrid MeMOS circuits, using minterm maps, which makes it possible to simultaneously synthesize a MeMOS circuit and optimize it. Examples of the synthesis of combinational (Exclusive OR) and sequential (RS-trigger) schemes. The existing and new variants of solutions to problems of the synthesis of combinational and sequential integrated circuits with memristors are considered. It is shown that the average power dissipated RS-trigger is 7.7 μW for the standard logic and 2.2 μW for the memristor logic. The power consumption of the XOR circuit is 13 μW for the standard logic and 9.2 μW for the memristor logic."
Investigation of the Process of the Electrodeposition of a Tin–Lead Alloy with a High Lead Content,"In the process of manufacturing multichip modules based on chipless ICs with a matrix arrangement of contact pads, due to the large number of sequentially performed soldering operations, the melting temperature of the solder in the first operation should be at least 270°C. With a large number of small contact pads and a large distance between them, the formation of a solder layer of the given thickness is possible mainly only by electrodeposition. This paper presents the results of studying the process of the electrodeposition of a tin–lead alloy with a high lead content (more than 80% by weight) for the formation of a solder layer with a melting point of more than 270°C, intended for mounting crystals with a matrix arrangement of the contact pads in the technology of manufacturing multichip modules. The composition of the fluoroborate electrolyte is proposed, which ensures obtaining the given chemical composition of the alloy. The dependence of the chemical composition of the alloy on the current density during its formation is established. The value of the optimal current density is determined to be (1–1.2) A/dm2. At this current density, dense fine-grained layers with a melting point of about 290–295°C are formed."
Stochastic Optimization of the RLC Model of the Package Output in Order to Increase Its Reliability at High Frequencies,"The scattering matrix of a multipole (or S-parameters) is widely used to describe electrical circuits in the form of a black box. The application of S-parameters allows us to characterize the circuit in any frequency range. However, the standard circuit simulators do not work with S-parameters. In addition, the more outputs a circuit has and the larger the frequency range that needs to be characterized the larger the matrix that has to be solved. This paper considers the classical model of the package output based on its own capacitance, inductance, and capacitance of the connection between adjacent outputs, which can be built based on the existing S-parameters. However, as this model cannot take into account the RF and microwave effects, it is inaccurate at high frequencies. The optimization method for a classical model based on a stochastic optimization algorithm is presented in order to achieve greater model accuracy at high frequencies. The use of this optimization makes it possible to increase the accuracy of the model at high frequencies by a factor of more than 3 in comparison with the classical RLC model."
Design Principles of Airborne Multibeam Receiving APAA Satellite Communication Systems,"The use of active phased antenna arrays (APAAs) makes it possible to redistribute the information capacity of the communication system by scanning independent beams with electronic control. The process of creating APAAs is a solution to a multifactorial problem under the conditions of a significant number of requirements and restrictions imposed on onboard APAAs as part of a spacecraft. In this study the options for constructing multibeam receiving antenna systems based on APAAs are considered. The criteria for choosing radiators for antennas of various ranges and purposes are presented. The estimates of the energy characteristics of the APAA Ka-, C-, and S-bands are given. Recommendations for ensuring the electromagnetic compatibility of communication systems are given. It is shown that the use of phase shifters based on gallium arsenide field-effect transistors with a Schottky gate in a passive connection makes it possible to reduce the power consumption in control circuits without harming the technical parameters."
Informativeness of the Spectral and Morphometric Characteristics of the Canopy-Gap Structure Based on Remote Sensing Data,"The differences in morphometric features of the canopy-gap structure of the three dominant forest types in the Valuevsky Forest Park were investigated with high-resolution and detailed-resolution remote sensing data. The forest-community groups (deciduous forest with a predominance of lime, deciduous forest with a predominance of birch or aspen, and coniferous forest with a predominance of spruce or pine) were classified according to the random forest method based on Sentinel-2/MSI multispectral satellite images. The better classificaton accuracy was 0.96 (k = 0.88). The Sentinel-2 data were used to create a layer of segments: spectrally homogeneous forest parcels. The forest gaps were obtained via cluster analysis with Resurs-P1 Geoton panchromatic data and visual interpretation of the clusters. Eight morphometric parameters were calculated for each gap. The differences were analyzed at the segment level (the Mann–Whitney U-test) and for all gap sets of each forest-community group (the Kruskal–Wallis H-test). The highest U-test values for the average values of morphometric features at the level of forest-community segments were obtained for the gap area (U = 24), gap perimeter (U = 19.3), gap-shape complexity index (U = 19.0), and the ratio of the perimeter to the gap area (U = 18.7). The highest values of the H-test at the level of individual gaps were calculated for the fractal dimension of the gap (H = 2229.2), the ratio of the perimeter to gap area (H = 2064.9), and the gap area (H = 1718.4). Analysis of the calculated and published data made it possible to find the possible reasons for the differences in the gap structure and gap parameters of coniferous, small-leaved, and lime communities of the model territory."
The Role of Vegetation in the Regulation of Heavy Metal Fluxes in the Subtaiga Forest Ecosystems of the Center of the East European Plain,"In the methodology of critical loads, woody vegetation is considered to be the main source of ecosystem buffer capacity for potential pollution. However, the role of vegetation in the regulation of heavy-metal (HM) fluxes in forest ecosystems is still poorly studied. This paper analyses factors that affect the biogeochemical sustainability of forest ecosystems with respect to the influx of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, and Cd) based on the example of subtaiga ecosystems of the southern Meshchera (Ryazan oblast): the patterns of their translocation and accumulation in plant organs, the species composition of vegetation and geochemical specialization of species; the rate of biological productivity of forest stands; and the organization of forest lands, including the proportion of anthropogenically disturbed areas. The study results are based on materials from the soil and biogeochemical sampling in 2013–2014, inventory data, and balance studies. It is shown that the Cd accumulation in stemwood may be determined by its transport in the xylem sap in the form of free ions, while the Cu accumulation is associated with the acceptor function of the xylem, which requires Cu-containing enzymes for the lignification of its cells. Schematic maps were constructed for the annual immobilization of HMs in the trunk and tree butt biomass. It has been determined that the spatial patterns of HM accumulation in phytomass significantly depend on the species structure of the stands. The maximum level of Cu accumulation was found in plots dominated by arid-anionic pines, while the maximum levels of Zn and Cd accumulation were recorded for plots dominated by more humid-cationic species, birch and aspen. The spatial heterogeneity of the stand bioproductivity significantly depends on the landscape structure of the area: features of buried morphostructures and the surface relief. The results of balance studies show that the phytomass of subtaiga ecosystems can immobilize up to 46% of atmospheric depositions of biophile elements (Cu and Zn) and less than 10% of atmospheric input of toxic Cd. In addition, Zn is deficient in the southern Meshchera, while Cu and, in particular, Cd are abundant in this area."
Modeling the Forest Cover of the Vengeri River Basin (Sakhalin Island) with Remote-Sensing Data,"The study concerns mapping of the actual vegetation cover of the Vengeri River basin (eastern coast of the central Sakhalin) with an area of more than 33 000 ha. A cartographic model has been created with the use of the algorithm of stepwise discriminant analysis based on the original geobotanical data, a digital elevation model, and the spectral data of Landsat 5 images. Nine physiognomical vegetation types were recognized: three of them are nonforest (open rock vegetation, alpine tundra, and alpine meadows), while six feature different kinds of forests: fir–spruce forests (Abies sachalinensis, Picea ajanensis), larch forests and sparse stands (Larix cajanderi), shrub thickets (Pinus pumila, Dushekia fruticosa), Erman’s birch forests (Betula ermanii), and broad-leaved and riparian deciduous forests (Alnus hirsuta, Betula platyphylla, Chosenia arbutifolia, Populus suaveolens, Salix udensis). The dependence between the physiognomical types of the forest and the syntaxa of traditional Russian dominant (ecophytocoenotic) and floristic classification systems was determined. Forest communities evolved on 89.1% of the river basin; the largest area was covered by larch forests and open woodlands (natural sparse forests) (33.32%). The landscape and climatic conditions of the region allow the existence of fir–spruce forests, which are typical of the zone, but they account for as little as 11.23% of the entire territory. The widespread distribution of larch forests results from the natural pyrogenic transformation of the dark coniferous forests. Under the conditions of the strongly rugged mountain relief, it was impossible to decode and model the vegetation areas situated on the shadowed northern slopes automatically. The paper proposes that the reconstruction should be performed with visual decoding of high-resolution images and field-study data."
Vertical-Fractional Structure of Aboveground Phytomass of the Tree Layer of Pine Forests in the Northern Ural Foothills (Komi Republic),"The results are presented for the vertical distribution of the aboveground phytomass in ripe and overripe pine taiga of Northern Ural foothills. The study demonstrates that the distribution of separate phytomass fractions of trees in the vertical profile of the tree layer can be described mathematically. The aboveground phytomass of pine forests can reach 17–26 m, depending on the forest type. The majority of organics is the wood biomass of the stem, which accumulates at a layer of 0–4 m above ground. The thickness of the crown layer in pine forests of different types can reach 15–26 m, while most of the assimilating apparatus are accumulated within the 8–24 m zone. An index of the leaf surface in different pine forests can reach 4.9–5.2 ha ha–1. The vertical distribution profile depends on the structure and composition of the pine forests, although the maximum in most pine forest types is located in the uppermost part of the crowns layer."
Consequences of the Outbreaks of the Poplar Leaf Miner and Other Mining Microlepidoptera in St. Petersburg,"The poplar leaf miner Phyllonorycter populifoliella, a well-known pest from the Gracillariidae family, was first recorded in St. Petersburg in the middle of the last century. This species had its first outbreak in 1991–1999, followed by death of a significant part of poplars in the city and suburbs. Despite the prominence of this pest group, there are limited data on the effect on the host-plant state from mining-insect damage to the trees’ assimilation apparatuses. The changes in the radial growth of the Berlin poplar Populus × berolinensis (70–80 years), which was intensely damaged during the outbreak, and the white poplar Populus alba (the average age is 100 years) were compared, and the damage to the latter was much less severe. The growth of white poplar slightly decreased during the outbreak (1991–1998), from 4.79 mm (1942–1990) to 3.61 mm (1991–1998), and then quickly recovered to the initial values and up to 4.86 mm (1999–2018). The growth of the Berlin poplar over the same time periods fell sharply, from 6.29 to 2.45 and 1.80 mm, respectively. It was shown that the growth of Berlin poplar sharply decreased within 5–7 years from the beginning of the outbreak and that the low growth levels persisted afterwards. This indicated that there may be irreversible consequences for poplars in the case of prolonged and intense damage by mining pests. The significant impact of mining pests on the plantation state requires monitoring and measures to control the spread of pests of this group. The problem is further aggravated by the appearance of three species of invasive mining Lepidoptera, the lime leaf miner Ph. issikii, the horse-chestnut leaf miner Cameraria ohridella, and the leaf blotch miner moth Acrocercops brongniardella, on the territory of St. Petersburg and the surrounding territories."
Formation of Vegetative Cover in Quarries after Forest Recultivation in the Middle Taiga Subzone of the Komi Republic,"The paper presents a study of characteristics of the formation of the vegetative cover after forest recultivation with the traditional technology (the planting of forest culture without any improvement of the technogenic substrate) on exhausted quarries of construction materials situated within the middle taiga subzone of the northeastern part of European Russia. It was found that forest recultivation helps decrease the time of forest stands formation by minimizing the lengthy initial period of tree introduction. On the 13th year of managed succession, the average height of pine trees was found to be 3 m, the canopy density was 0.2–0.3, and the crown density was 2.3–2.9. The substrate conditions affect the growth and overall preservation of the spruce, as well as the structure and texture of the ground vegetation. The biometric characteristics of pines on sandy loam quarries are better than those on sandy or loamy quarries. The grass communities are comprised of meadow and ruderal species, which are typical for the technogenic ecotopes of taiga zone. They are well-developed on loamy substrates but get scattered on sandy loam and sand substrates. The moss layer is well-developed on substrates with coarser textures. After the first 13 years of managed succession, the following features were observed: the formation of a vertical structure of the vegetative communities; the introduction of forest species into the ground vegetation, including the dominant species of the grass, shrub and moss layers of the natural pine forests; increases in species diversity and the projective cover, balancing of the communities' floristic structures, and primitive soil formation."
"Invasion of the Zebra Mussel Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771) (Dreissenidae) in Lake Ladoga","In May 2019, the invasive mollusk Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771) was found in Volkhov Bay of Lake Ladoga by means of an unmanned underwater vehicle. The age of some mollusks reached five years, indicating the successful introduction of this species. Underwater video filming made it possible to reveal the features of the distribution of the mollusk in the part of the water area investigated. Mollusks were located singly and more often on the lateral surface of large boulders; they were much less common on pebbles and soft ground. The alternation of the areas of coarse material and sand, characteristic of the littoral of Volkhov Bay, preconditioned the heterogeneity of the distribution of the invader. The highest population density of the zebra mussel was observed at the depths exceeding 4.5 m. The development of adult mollusks in the low-mineralized water of Lake Ladoga indicates its possible naturalization and does not exclude the further spread of the species under the conditions of a changing climate in this water body."
News loopholing: Telegram news as portable alternative media,"This paper deals with foreign state-run media outlets that disseminate Persian language news targeted to the Iranian public. More specifically, it focuses on the mobile news app Telegram by undertaking a content analysis of a sample of the top 400 most viewed stories across four channels, i.e., BBC Persian, Voice of America’s Persian language service VOA Farsi, Radio Farda, and Iran International television channel. It also offers a topic modelling of all news stories posted. Results show that most of the news coverage centered on politics, particularly with an emphasis on internal Iranian issues, while a few other channels repeatedly urged their followers to submit not only their email addresses and other private information, but also photographs and/or videos of anti-government protests. Conceptually, I consider these channels as portable alternative media, as opposed to state-run news media, since the Iranian public seeks them out as sources of political information that assist them in better understanding world news and, most importantly, news about their own country. The Telegram instant messaging app is related to the meso dimension of alternative media, meaning that it is characterized by the unique production and dissemination means it utilizes. This paper concludes by highlighting the implications of foreign state-run news outlets using news loopholing to disseminate information, while simultaneously collecting private information about their users and/or potentially risking their safety."
On the extremal compatible linear connection of a generalized Berwald manifold,"Generalized Berwald manifolds are Finsler manifolds admitting linear connections such that the parallel transports preserve the Finslerian length of tangent vectors (compatibility condition). It is known (Vincze in J AMAPN 21:199–204, 2005) that such a linear connection must be metrical with respect to the averaged Riemannian metric given by integration of the Riemann-Finsler metric on the indicatrix hypersurfaces. Therefore the linear connection (preserving the Finslerian length of tangent vectors) is uniquely determined by its torsion. If the torsion is zero then we have a classical Berwald manifold. Otherwise, the torsion is some strange data we need to express in terms of the intrinsic quantities of the Finsler manifold. The paper presents the idea of the extremal compatible linear connection of a generalized Berwald manifold by minimizing the pointwise length of its torsion tensor. It is uniquely determined because the number of the Lagrange multipliers is equal to the number of the equations for the compatibility of the linear connection with the Finslerian metric. Using the reference element method, the extremal compatible linear connection can be expressed in terms of the canonical data as well. It is an intrinsic algorithm to check the existence of compatible linear connections on a Finsler manifold because it is equivalent to the existence of the extremal compatible linear connection."
Risk-associated management disparities in acute myocardial infarction,"Despite improvements in the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI), risk-associated management disparities may exist. We investigated this issue including temporal trends in a large MI cohort (n = 179,291) registered 2005–2017 in SWEDEHEART. Multivariable models were used to study the associations between risk categories according to the GRACE 2.0 score and coronary procedures (timely reperfusion, invasive assessment ≤ 3 days, in-hospital coronary revascularization), pharmacological treatments (P2Y12-blockers, betablockers, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone-system [RAAS]-inhibitors, statins), structured follow-up and secondary prevention (smoking cessation, physical exercise training). High-risk patients (n = 76,295 [42.6%]) experienced less frequent medical interventions compared to low/intermediate-risk patients apart from betablocker treatment. Overall, intervention rates increased over time with more pronounced increases seen in high-risk patients compared to lower-risk patients for in-hospital coronary revascularization (+ 23.6% vs. + 12.5% in patients < 80 years) and medication with P2Y12-blockers (+ 22.2% vs. + 7.8%). However, less pronounced temporal increases were noted in high-risk patients for medication with RAAS-blockers (+ 8.5% vs. + 13.0%) and structured follow-up (+ 31.6% vs. + 36.3%); pinteraction < 0.001 for all. In conclusion, management of high-risk patients with MI is improving. However, the lower rates of follow-up and of RAAS-inhibitor prescription are a concern. Our data emphasize the need of continuous quality improvement initiatives."
Sputum microbiota profiles of treatment-naïve TB patients in Uganda before and during first-line therapy,"Information on microbiota dynamics in pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in Africa is scarce. Here, we sequenced sputa from 120 treatment-naïve TB patients in Uganda, and investigated changes in microbiota of 30 patients with treatment-response follow-up samples. Overall, HIV-status and anti-TB treatment were associated with microbial structural and abundance changes. The predominant phyla were Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria and Actinobacteria, accounting for nearly 95% of the sputum microbiota composition; the predominant genera across time were Prevotella, Streptococcus, Veillonella, Haemophilus, Neisseria, Alloprevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Gemella, and Rothia. Treatment-response follow-up at month 2 was characterized by a reduction in abundance of Mycobacterium and Fretibacterium, and an increase in Ruminococcus and Peptococcus; month 5 was characterized by a reduction in Tannerella and Fusobacterium, and an increase in members of the family Neisseriaceae. The microbiota core comprised of 44 genera that were stable during treatment. Hierarchical clustering of this core’s abundance distinctly separated baseline (month 0) samples from treatment follow-up samples (months 2/5). We also observed a reduction in microbial diversity with 9.1% (CI 6–14%) of the structural variation attributed to HIV-status and anti-TB treatment. Our findings show discernible microbiota signals associated with treatment with potential to inform anti-TB treatment response monitoring."
"The impact of temperature on the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Tokyo, Japan","Assessing the impact of temperature on COVID-19 epidemiology is critical for implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, few studies have accounted for the nature of contagious diseases, i.e., their dependent happenings. We aimed to quantify the impact of temperature on the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Tokyo, Japan, employing two epidemiological measurements of transmissibility and severity: the effective reproduction number (\(R_{t}\)) and case fatality risk (CFR). We estimated the \(R_{t}\) and time-delay adjusted CFR and to subsequently assess the nonlinear and delayed effect of temperature on \(R_{t}\) and time-delay adjusted CFR. For \(R_{t}\) at low temperatures, the cumulative relative risk (RR) at the first temperature percentile (3.3 °C) was 1.3 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1–1.7). As for the virulence to humans, moderate cold temperatures were associated with higher CFR, and CFR also increased as the temperature rose. The cumulative RR at the 10th and 99th percentiles of temperature (5.8 °C and 30.8 °C) for CFR were 3.5 (95% CI: 1.3–10.0) and 6.4 (95% CI: 4.1–10.1). Our results suggest the importance to take precautions to avoid infection in both cold and warm seasons to avoid severe cases of COVID-19. The results and our proposed approach will also help in assessing the possible seasonal course of COVID-19 in the future."
A novel mechanism to generate metallic single crystals,"Generally, the evolution of metallic single crystals is based on crystal growth. The single crystal is either produced by growing a seed single crystal or by sophisticated grain selection processes followed by crystal growth. Here, we describe for the first time a fully new mechanism to generate single crystals based on thermo-mechanically induced texture formation during additive manufacturing. The single crystal develops due to two different mechanisms. The first step is a standard grain selection process due to directional solidification, leading to a pronounced fiber texture. The second and new mechanism bases on successive thermo-mechanically induced plastic deformations and texture formation in FCC crystals under compression. During this second step, the columnar grain structure transforms into a single crystal by rotation of individual grains. Thus, the single crystal forms step by step by merging the originally columnar grain structure. This novel, stress induced mechanism opens up completely new perspectives to fabricate single crystalline components and to accurately adjust the orientation according to the load."
Ultrastructural changes in cristae of lymphoblasts in acute lymphoblastic leukemia parallel alterations in biogenesis markers,"We explored the link between mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial morphology using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in lymphoblasts of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and compared these characteristics between tumors and control samples. Gene expression of mitochondrial biogenesis markers was analysed in 23 ALL patients and 18 controls and TEM for morphology analysis was done in 15 ALL patients and 9 healthy controls. The area occupied by mitochondria per cell and the cristae cross-sectional area was observed to be significantly higher in patients than in controls (p-value = 0.0468 and p-value< 0.0001, respectively). The mtDNA copy numbers, TFAM, POLG, and c-myc gene expression were significantly higher in ALL patients than controls (all p-values< 0.01). Gene Expression of PGC-1α was higher in tumor samples. The analysis of the correlation between PGC-1α expression and morphology parameters i.e., both M/C ratio and cristae cross-sectional area revealed a positive trend (r = 0.3, p = 0.1). The increased area occupied by mitochondria and increased cristae area support the occurrence of cristae remodelling in ALL. These changes might reflect alterations in cristae dynamics to support the metabolic state of the cells by forming a more condensed network. Ultrastructural imaging can be useful for affirming changes occurring at a subcellular organellar level."
Antitoxin EndoAI can induce disease resistance in tobacco as a protein elicitor,"The antitoxin EndoAI is a TA system component that directly inhibits EndoA activity in vitro. The targeted activation of a TA system represents a potentially novel antimicrobial or antiviral strategy. However, whether the antitoxin functions alone and can induce plant disease resistance remain unknown."
Collecting Digital Evidence from Online Sources: Deficiencies in Current Polish Criminal Law,"The importance of digital evidence, especially online content, is continuously increasing due to the proliferation of digital technologies in socio-economic life. However, the legal means of criminal evidence gathering in Polish legislation remain unchanged and do not take into account some contemporary challenges. In various countries, traditional rules of evidence gathering were created in the context of a physical world. These rules may be insufficient to safeguard the forensic soundness of evidence gathering methods. Inadequacies of current procedures may be especially visible in the context of transborder digital evidence gathering from online open sources. This article describes the practical shortcomings of Polish criminal evidence law in the context of digital evidence with particular attention to online open-source materials. Empirical data indicate that existing legal limitations are bypassed in practice to enable evidence collection. This unfortunately often happens at the expense of the forensic soundness of digital evidence."
Quantum coherence in electrically pumped organic interferometric emitters,"Electrically pumped organic semiconductors have been demonstrated to yield nearly diffraction-limited beam divergences and high-visibility double-slit interferograms characteristic of laser emission. This coherent emission has been measured and quantified in detail but no explanation has been advanced on the origin of this emission. Here, the origin of this emission is explained in terms of probability amplitudes à la Dirac. More specifically, in terms of Dirac’s identities applicable to quanta “absolutely indistinguishable from one another.” In addition, this elucidation enables the cohesive understanding of sources applicable to quantum entanglement experiments."
Relationship between enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray and left ventricular size on transthoracic echocardiography,"The diagnostic accuracy of the cardiothoracic ratio on chest X-ray to detect left ventricular (LV) enlargement has not been well defined despite its traditional association with cardiomegaly. We aimed to determine whether the cardiothoracic ratio can accurately predict LV enlargement based on indexed linear measurements of the LV on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). We included consecutive patients who had a TTE and a posteroanterior chest X-ray performed within 90 days of each other at a tertiary care center. LV size was determined by measuring the LV end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) and LV end-diastolic dimension indexed (LVEDDI) to body surface area. The cardiothoracic ratio was calculated by dividing the maximum transverse diameter of the cardiac silhouette by the maximum transverse diameter of the right and left lung boundaries. 173 patients were included in the study (mean age 68 ± 15 years, 49.1% female). Mean cardiothoracic ratio was 0.56 ± 0.09, and the mean LVEDD and indexed LVEDDI were of 47 ± 8.6 mm and dimension of 27 ± 4.5 mm/m2 respectively. There was no significant correlation between the cardiothoracic ratio measured on chest X-ray and either the LVEDD or LVEDDI measured on TTE (r = 0.011, p = 0.879; r = 0.122, p = 0.111). The ability of the cardiothoracic ratio to predict LV enlargement (defined as LVEDDI > 30 mm/m2) was not statistically significant. The cardiothoracic ratio on chest X-ray is not a predictor of LV enlargement based on indexed linear measurements of the LV by TTE."
Characterization based machine learning modeling for the prediction of the rheological properties of water-based drilling mud: an experimental study on grass as an environmental friendly additive,"The successful drilling operation depends upon the achievement of target drilling attributes within the environmental and economic constraints but this is not possible only on the basis of laboratory testing due to the limitation of time and resources. The chemistry of the mud decides its rheological potential and selection of the techniques required for recycling operations. Conductivity, pH, and photometer testing were performed for the physio-chemical characterization of the grass to be used as an environmental friendly drilling mud additive. In this study, different particle sizes (75, 150, and 300 µm) of grass powder were mixed in mud density of 8.5, 8.6, and 8.7 ppg in the measurement of gel strength and viscosity of drilling mud. The grass additive was added in different weight conditions considering no additive, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 g to assess the contribution of grass on the gel strength and viscosity of the drilling mud. The machine learning techniques (Multivariate Linear Regression Analysis, Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine Regression, k-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Stump, Random Forest, and Random Tree approaches) were applied to the generated rheological data. The results of the study show that grass can be used for the improvement of the gel strength and viscosity of the drilling mud. The highest improvement of the viscosity was seen when grass powder of 150 µm was added in the 8.7 ppg drilling mud in 0.25, 0.5, and 1 g weights. The gel strength of the drilling mud was improved when the grass additive was added to the drilling mud 8.7 ppg. Random forest and Artificial Neural Network had the same results of 0.72 regression coefficient (R2) for the estimation of viscosity of the drilling mud. The random tree was found as the most effective technique for the modeling of gel strength at 10 min (GS_10min) of the drilling mud. The predictions of Artificial Neural Network had 0.92 R2 against the measured gel strength at 10 s (GS_10sec) of the drilling mud. On average, Artificial Neural Network predicted the rheological properties of the mud with the highest accuracy as compared to other machine learning approaches. The work may serve as a key source to estimate the net effect of grass additives for the improvement of the gel strength and viscosity of the drilling mud without the performance of any large number of laboratory tests."
Isokinetic and functional shoulder outcomes after arthroscopic capsulolabral stabilization,"Shoulder stability is secured by dynamic and static stabilizers. Rotator cuff is responsible for dynamic stabilization. In cases of shoulder instability their activity is disturbed. Capsulolabral repair restores mainly static stabilization. This surgery treatment technique of shoulder instability was first described by Bankart in 1923. His idea, with further modifications, is commonly used up to this day. Evaluation of muscle shoulder recovery after stabilization should be one of the important criteria to allow patient to return to sport and work. However, not much isokinetic assessment after capsulolabral repair was described. The aim of this study were the following: the comparative assessment of the shoulder rotatory strength in patients following arthroscopic capsulolabral repair of unilateral anterior traumatic instability and clinical assessment with comparison of pre and post-operative results."
The key regulator LcERF056 enhances salt tolerance by modulating reactive oxygen species-related genes in Lotus corniculatus,"The APETALA2/ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) family are important regulatory factors involved in plants’ response to environmental stimuli. However, their roles in salt tolerance in Lotus corniculatus remain unclear."
Five weeks of intermittent transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation shape neural networks: a machine learning approach,"Invasive and transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation [(t)-VNS] have been used to treat epilepsy, depression and migraine and has also shown effects on metabolism and body weight. To what extent this treatment shapes neural networks and how such network changes might be related to treatment effects is currently unclear. Using a pre-post mixed study design, we applied either a tVNS or sham stimulation (5 h/week) in 34 overweight male participants in the context of a study designed to assess effects of tVNS on body weight and metabolic and cognitive parameters resting state (rs) fMRI was measured about 12 h after the last stimulation period. Support vector machine (SVM) classification was applied to fractional amplitude low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) on established rs-networks. All classification results were controlled for random effects and overfitting. Finally, we calculated multiple regressions between the classification results and reported food craving. We found a classification accuracy (CA) of 79 % in a subset of four brainstem regions suggesting that tVNS leads to lasting changes in brain networks. Five of eight salience network regions yielded 76,5 % CA. Our study shows tVNS’ post-stimulation effects on fALFF in the salience rs-network. More detailed investigations of this effect and their relationship with food intake seem reasonable for future studies."
Collapse of quasi-two-dimensional symmetrized Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupled Bose–Einstein condensate,"Here, we study the collapse process of quasi-two-dimensional Bose–Einstein condensate with symmetrized Dresselhaus spin–orbit coupling. We show that at a sufficiently strong spin–orbit coupling the arising spin-dependent velocity compensates the attraction between particles and can prevent the collapse of the condensate. As a result, spin–orbit coupling can lead to a stable condensate rather than the collapse process."
Advanced solution framework for time-dependent reliability-based design optimization under fuzzy and interval uncertainties,"The problem which is actually being addressed in this study includes two parts: One is on establishing time-dependent reliability-based design optimization (tRBDO) formulation under fuzzy and interval uncertainties to obtain the optimal design parameter solution for the time-dependent structure. The other is on presenting a serial single-loop optimization (SSLO) strategy to estimate the optimal design parameter. For addressing the optimal design parameter of the time-dependent structure involving fuzzy and interval uncertainties, a novel tRBDO model with the constraint of time-dependent failure possibility (TDFP) based on the possibility theory of the safety measure is proposed. For evaluating the optimal design parameter, the established SSLO method converts the original triple-loop optimization which is TDFP-index-based approach into a sequence of deterministic optimization, interval value corresponding to the worst case scenario, the estimation of time instant, and the minimum most probable point. Iterative searching step is not needed to find the minimum most probable point at each iteration step in the proposed SSLO strategy; therefore, the computational time is extremely reduced. Several examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach."
Multiphysics design of programmable shape-memory alloy-based smart structures via topology optimization,"We present a novel multiphysics and multimaterial computational design framework for shape-memory alloy-based smart structures. The proposed framework uses topology optimization to optimally distribute multiple material candidates within the design domain, and leverages a nonlinear phenomenological constitutive model for shape-memory alloys (SMAs), along with a coupled transient heat conduction model. In most practical scenarios, SMAs are activated by a nonuniform temperature field or a nonuniform stress field. This framework accurately captures the coupling between the phase transformation process and the evolution of the local temperature field. Thus, the resulting design framework is able to optimally tailor the two-way shape-memory effect and the superelasticity response of SMAs more precisely than previous algorithms that have relied on the assumption of a uniform temperature distribution. We present several case studies, including the design of a self-actuated bending beam and a gripper mechanism. The results show that the proposed framework can successfully produce SMA-based designs that exhibit targeted displacement trajectories and output forces. In addition, we present an example in which we enforce material-specific thermal constraints in a multimaterial design to enhance its thermal performance. In conclusion, the proposed framework provides a systematic computational approach to consider the nonlinear thermomechanical response of SMAs, thereby providing enhanced programmability of the SMA-based structure."
"The do’s, don’ts and don’t knows of redressing differential attainment related to race/ethnicity in medical schools","Systematic and structural inequities in power and privilege create differential attainment whereby differences in average levels of performance are observed between students from different socio-demographic groups. This paper reviews the international evidence on differential attainment related to ethnicity/race in medical school, drawing together the key messages from research to date to provide guidance for educators to operationalize and enact change and identify areas for further research."
The effect of obstructed action efficacy on reward-based decision-making in healthy adolescents: a novel functional MRI task to assay frustration,"Frustration is common in adolescence and often interferes with executive functioning, particularly reward-based decision-making, and yet very little is known about how incidental frustrating events (independent of task-based feedback) disrupt the neural circuitry of reward processing in this important age group. While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 45 healthy adolescents played a card game in which they had to guess between two options to earn points, in low- and high-stake conditions. Functioning of button presses through which they made decisions was intermittently blocked, thereby increasing frustration potential. Neural deactivation of the precuneus, a Default Mode Network region, was observed during obstructed action blocks across stake conditions, but less so on high- relative to low-stake trials. Moreover, less deactivation in goal-directed reward processing regions (i.e., caudate), frontoparietal “task control” regions, and interoceptive processing regions (i.e., somatosensory cortex, thalamus) were observed on high-stake relative to low-stake trials. These findings are consistent with less disruption of goal-directed reward seeking during blocked action efficacy in high-stake conditions among healthy adolescents. These results provide a roadmap of neural systems critical to the processing of frustrating events during reward-based decision-making in youths and could help to characterize how frustration regulation is altered in a range of pediatric psychopathologies."
Post-error slowing in anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders,"Altered brain response to errors in anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) suggests cognitive control abnormalities across both types of illness, but behavioral metrics of cognitive control function have yet to be compared in patients selected from these different diagnostic categories. Thus, we examined post-error slowing (PES), a behavioral adjustment that typically occurs after a mistake, in children and adolescents with and without a primary anxiety disorder (N = 103 anxiety and N = 28 healthy controls) and adolescents and adults with and without OCD (N = 118 OCD and N = 60 healthy controls) using a go/no-go task. Primary analyses tested for differences in PES between diagnostic groups (anxiety, OCD, healthy), controlling for age, overall reaction time, and overall accuracy. Results indicated that patients with anxiety disorders exhibited more post-error slowing than both patients with OCD and healthy volunteers. In contrast, participants with OCD did not differ from healthy volunteers in post-error slowing. In subgroup analyses restricted to adolescent participants (ages 13–17 years), more post-error slowing was observed in the anxiety disorders group compared with either the OCD or healthy groups. These data suggest that excessive post-error slowing, an index of behavioral adjustment following errors, may uniquely characterize patients with anxiety disorders relative to healthy individuals and those with OCD."
Cognitive mechanisms of statistical learning and segmentation of continuous sensory input,"Two classes of cognitive mechanisms have been proposed to explain segmentation of continuous sensory input into discrete recurrent constituents: clustering and boundary-finding mechanisms. Clustering mechanisms are based on identifying frequently co-occurring elements and merging them together as parts that form a single constituent. Bracketing (or boundary-finding) mechanisms work by identifying rarely co-occurring elements that correspond to the boundaries between discrete constituents. In a series of behavioral experiments, I tested which mechanisms are at play in the visual modality both during segmentation of a continuous syllabic sequence into discrete word-like constituents and during recognition of segmented constituents. Additionally, I explored conscious awareness of the products of statistical learning—whole constituents versus merged clusters of smaller subunits. My results suggest that both online segmentation and offline recognition of extracted constituents rely on detecting frequently co-occurring elements, a process likely based on associative memory. However, people are more aware of having learnt whole tokens than of recurrent composite clusters."
New Polymerizable Tetraaza Macrocycle Containing Two Acridine Units for Selective Fluorescence Sensing of Metal Ions,"A new fluorescent bis(acridino)-macrocycle containing two allyl groups was synthesized and photophysically studied. Studies were carried out on metal ion recognition and selectivity-influencing effects including the determination of the relevant thermodynamic constants as logK and pKa. The proposed sensor molecule is recommended for the development of Zn2+-selective optochemical analyzers based on covalently immobilized ionophores as it has a unique pH-independent metal ion recognition ability, which is not influenced by anions and other potentially occurring metal ions in biological samples."
Plant seeds and their use as test organisms for the assessment of toxicity of a model xenobiotic,"Human nutrition depends on several crop species, which may be targets for anthropogenic contamination. This is a special concern, since the impairment of food growth can jeopardize human sustainability, and the use of contaminated resources such as soil or water can be a problem to consider. Chemical contaminants may be from varied classes, including pharmaceutical drugs, which are used for human and veterinary medicines, aquaculture and agriculture. Among these, the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) is used in aquaculture and human medicine, being capable of causing deleterious effects on plants. This pharmaceutical is often detected in water samples, some of which are sometimes used to irrigate crop fields. The present study intended to: (i) assess the feasibility of using simple plant-based tests (radish, Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus; and kale, Brassica oleracea) in ecotoxicity testing, using two different media (modified Steinberg, SM; and distilled water, DW); and (ii) to test if CIP can adversely impact seed germination, early development features (leaf area, stem length, and weight) and biochemical parameters related to photosynthesis (chlorophyll a, b and total, as well as carotene content) of the two plant species. The obtained results, despite preliminary, suggest that both media can be used in germination tests, since no observable effects were detected in plants germinating in both media. CIP caused no pattern of significative alterations in growth/development in both media. Photosynthetic pigments were differently affected by the two media, being the contents of Chlorophyll b and total Chlorophyll the most responsive parameters. However, no biochemical effects were reported for germination time and rates. In conclusion, both SM and DW can be used to perform germination tests in R. raphanistrum subsp. sativus and B. oleracea. Considering the entire set of data, it is possible to conclude that CIP did not cause comprehensive alterations in both growth/development and photosynthetic parameters, without being possible to exclude the occurrence of other significant alterations that were, however, not studied in these assays. These two data sets must be complimented in the future by analysing more physiological parameters that may be deleteriously altered by CIP, in alternative plant species. Nevertheless, it is clear from the here-obtained results that both plants are refractory to the putative adverse short and medium-term effects caused by CIP, under the selected test conditions."
Severe leaf-vein infestation upregulates antioxidant and photosynthetic activities in the lamina of Ficus religiosa,"Pipaldiplosis pipaldiplosis forms galls on the midribs and veins of the leaves of Ficus religiosa, but how these leaf-vein infestations can affect the antioxidant defense mechanism and photosynthetic performance of the interveinal lamina is unknown. Therefore, we investigated ROS, antioxidant potential and photosynthesis in the lamina of F. religiosa infected by leaf-vein gall P. pipaldiplosis. The H2O2 content rose rapidly upon mild infection and thereafter decreased with increasing the intensity of infection. Severe leaf-vein infestation significantly up-regulated the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and guaiacol peroxidase. Correlation between H2O2 and antioxidant enzymes clearly indicates that ROS plays a crucial role in plant defense mechanism against P. pipaldiplosis. Leaf-vein galls remarkably altered the minimum and maximal fluorescence intensities, density of active reaction centers, light harvesting efficiency, electron transfer rate, dissipation energy, maximum quantum yield of primary PSII photochemistry, quantum yield of electron transport and performance index on cross section basis in the lamina of infected leaves. The results indicate that during the mild infection, reaction centers act as energy dissipating units (inactive form) to prevent photoinactivation and reconvert to energy conserving units (active form) during the severe infection. More severe infection results in complete obstruction of leaf-veins which ultimately cause death of the leaves. In conclusion, P. pipaldiplosis-induced oxidative stress decreases photosynthesis in leaf lamina during the mild infection. In contrast, the rate of photosynthesis increased during the severe leaf vein infestation to compensate the loss of photo-assimilates caused by P. pipaldiplosis."
Pain fingerprinting using multimodal sensing: pilot study,"Pain is a complex phenomenon, the experience of which varies widely across individuals. At worst, chronic pain can lead to anxiety and depression. Cost-effective strategies are urgently needed to improve the treatment of pain, and thus we propose a novel home-based pain measurement system for the longitudinal monitoring of pain experience and variation in different patients with chronic low back pain. The autonomous nervous system and audio-visual features are analyzed from heart rate signals, voice characteristics and facial expressions using a unique measurement protocol. Self-reporting is utilized for the follow-up of changes in pain intensity, induced by well-designed physical maneuvers, and for studying the consecutive trends in pain. We describe the study protocol, including hospital measurements and questionnaires and the implementation of the home measurement devices. We also present different methods for analyzing the multimodal data: electroencephalography, audio, video and heart rate. Our intention is to provide new insights using technical methodologies that will be beneficial in the future not only for patients with low back pain but also patients suffering from any chronic pain."
Caudate lobe amebic abscesses: percutaneous image-guided aspiration or drainage,"Amebic liver abscess is the most common type of liver abscess on a worldwide basis, with caudate lobe being a relatively uncommon location for its occurrence. Abscess in caudate lobe of liver is often considered a challenging location for image-guided percutaneous drainage due to its difficult-to-access location along with close relationship with major vessels at porta hepatis."
Marine turf of an invasive alga expels lugworms from the lower shore,"Bare sandy flats at and below low tide level of the Wadden Sea (eastern North Sea, European Atlantic) were observed in 2020 to have been invaded by an introduced grass-like alga, Vaucheria cf. velutina (Xanthophyceae). A dense algal turf accumulated and stabilized mud, where resident seniors of the lugworm Arenicola marina had reworked rippled sand. Algae and worms were incompatible. Initially, rising patches with algal turf alternated with bare pits where lugworms crowded. Their bioturbation inhibited young algae, while the felt of established algal rhizoids clogged feeding funnels of worm burrows. Eventually, a mosaic pattern of competitors gave way to a coherent algal turf without lugworms. Concomitantly, a rich small-sized benthic fauna took advantage of the novel algal turf. This exotic Vaucheria may have the potential for drastically altering the ecological web at the lower shore."
Multiscale mechanisms underpin the ecological uniqueness of local fish assemblages in tropical coastal seascapes,"Multiscale processes through dynamic boundaries drive the local contributions (LCBD; uniqueness in species composition and abundance) and species contributions (SCBD; individual species abundance variation) to fish beta diversity in coastal seascapes. We partitioned LCBD into LCBDRepl (replacement) and LCBDAbDiff (abundance difference), and used model-based approaches to investigate whether seascape size influences environmental and spatial drivers of LCBD, and effects of species (distribution, prevalence, and coastal dependence) on SCBD. Three large bays (bay level) and three zones per bay (zone level), southeastern Brazil, were seascape models during 1 year. At the bay level, more locations had higher LCBD, related to species composition, lower water transparency, and much less to flood/high tides and higher number of estuaries. LCBDRepl was also prevalent and stronger positive effects of transparency and mangrove cover reinforced the importance of environmental filtering and alternative habitats driving local contributions to replacement processes in larger seascapes. Species richness influenced positively LCBD primarily at the zone level, and negative effects of vegetal cover and primarily human settlements suggested species loss under lower heterogeneity. Also, more similar LCBDRepl and LCBDAbDiff evidenced the increasing local contributions to abundance differences in smaller species pools. At both levels, larger- and finer-scale spatial effects evidenced possible influences of dispersal and biotic interactions, respectively, on LCBDRepl and LCBDAbDiff. SCBD was positively related to species prevalence at locations and distribution at both levels. Therefore, multiscale mechanisms dependent and irrespective of seascape size support the critical importance of habitat availability, complexity, and variety to beta diversity of coastal fishes."
The gullible genius: fast learners fall for fake news,"In many animals, decision-making is influenced by social learning, i.e. the acquisition of insights through the observation of other individuals’ behaviours. In cases where such socially obtained information conflicts with personally acquired knowledge, animals must weigh up one form of information against the other. Previous studies have found that individual animals differ consistently in how they trade-off socially versus personally acquired knowledge, but why this is so remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate whether an animal’s cognitive profile affects its decision to use either prior personal or new, conflicting social information, using the Italian wall lizard (Podarcis siculus) as our model species. We trained lizards to associate one of two colour cues with food, and subsequently allowed them to observe a conspecific trained for the opposite colour. After social demonstrations, lizards overall tended to use the ‘fake’, non-rewarding social information, but some individuals were more likely to do so than others. Lizards that showed faster spatial learning were more likely to copy social information even in the presence of reliable previous knowledge. Our study highlights the existence of significant inter-individual variation in social learning in a lizard, possibly mirroring variation in cognitive abilities."
Rationality determination method and mechanical behavior of underground utility tunnels in a ground fissure environment,"To study the evolution law and internal mechanism of the mechanical behavior of the structure and surrounding strata of an underground utility tunnel under the dislocation of ground fissures, and the failure mode of the tunnel structure, based on theoretical analysis and model tests, this study proposes a new method for determining the rationality of model test parameters and selecting the optimal dislocation rate, and then carries out an underground pipe gallery model test under multiple influencing factors such as dislocation displacement and mutual angle. First, by comparing the theoretical solution of the internal force of the pipe gallery structure under initial conditions, the rationality of the model test parameters can be preliminarily verified. Second, the physical unidirectional compression experiments of the geological structure of ground fissures at high, medium, and low speeds were carried out, and it was observed that the low speed (0.0005 mm/s) could better reflect the active characteristics of ground fissures in Xi’an. Based on the above experimental parameters, the mechanical behavior of underground pipe gallery under the influence of orthogonal (90°) and oblique (45°) was studied, and the following conclusions were obtained. (1) The structural strain at the top of the upper plate changes from tension to compression with an increase in the cross momentum when it was orthogonal and from tension to compression when it was oblique. (2) With the increase in staggered momentum, the contact pressure near the top of the structure near the ground fracture at the orthogonal and oblique angles increases considerably, and both angles demonstrate a void at the bottom of the upper pipe gallery structure. (3) The soil near the ground fissure is more severely affected by the dislocation, and the stress disturbance at the far end was the smallest. (4) With an increase in dislocation displacement, the law of surface subsidence was consistent between the orthogonal and oblique, i.e., the upper surface deformation showed a convex distribution. The lower plate showed a concave distribution. Based on the above conclusions, through in-depth summary and analysis, the longitudinal failure mode of the pipe gallery structure under orthogonal and oblique crossings was obtained: extrusion failure mode of the pipe gallery structure under an orthogonal condition and torsion–tension–extrusion failure under an oblique condition."
Direct-displacement and force-based seismic assessment of RC frame structures,"Direct-displacement based design (DDBD) approach is a significant development in structural fields to outdo the deficits of force-based design (FBD) for reinforced concrete (RC) frame buildings. In the current study, the inelastic behaviour of buildings designed by FBD and DDBD are investigated with numerical research. Four and eight-storied RC frame buildings representing low and mid-rise RC buildings are considered. Non-linear static and dynamic analyses are executed to evaluate the effectiveness of both procedures in designing the selected RC buildings. Life safety level (2% target drift: FEMA-356) is considered as performance criteria. Base shear ratio, capacity curves, formation of plastic hinges, displacement profile and inter-storey drift ratio (ISDR) are selected as response parameters. The analysis results show that the mean drift ratios of low and mid-rise RC buildings designed using FBD exceed the target drift by 21%. This behaviour is contrary in RC buildings designed by DDBD with satisfying mean drift ratios of 51% to target drift. The analysis also highlights that the DDBD approach is more rational and economical than the FBD approach. Overall, this study demonstrates that buildings designed by the DDBD approach satisfy the chosen safety level criteria. In contrast, buildings designed by FBD approach result in poor seismic performance and are not able to address the target criteria level."
Circulating extracellular vesicles activate the pyroptosis pathway in the brain following ventilation-induced lung injury,"Mechanical ventilation of preterm newborns causes lung injury and is associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, the mechanistic links between ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) and brain injury is not well defined. Since circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) are known to link distant organs by transferring their cargos, we hypothesized that EVs mediate inflammatory brain injury associated with VILI."
Evaluation of a program for routine implementation of shared decision-making in cancer care: results of a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial,"Shared decision-making (SDM) is preferred by many patients in cancer care. However, despite scientific evidence and promotion by health policy makers, SDM implementation in routine health care lags behind. This study aimed to evaluate an empirically and theoretically grounded implementation program for SDM in cancer care."
"KIF5C deficiency causes abnormal cortical neuronal migration, dendritic branching, and spine morphology in mice","Malformation of cortical development (MCD) includes a variety of developmental disorders that are common causes of neurodevelopmental delay and epilepsy. Most recently, clinical studies found that patients carrying KIF5C mutations present early-onset MCD; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive."
A density functional theory investigation on the Ag-decorated boron nitride nanosheet as an isoniazid drug sensor,"We employed density functional B3LYP to inspect the impact of Ag-decoration on a BN nanosheet sensing performance in detection of isoniazid drug. The interaction of the pristine BN nanosheet with isoniazid was found to be weak, and the sensing response is about 2.4. Decorating an Ag atom into the BN nanosheet surface increases the adsorption energy of isoniazid from − 17.6 to − 95.7 kJ/mol. The sensing response significantly rises to 79.1 by Ag-decoration. A short recovery time of 4.9 s is found for the isoniazid desorption from the Ag-decorated BN nanosheet surface at 298 K. The water solvent reduces adsorption energy of isoniazid to − 77.3 kJ/mol. Finally, we found that Ag-decorated BN nanosheet may be promising and highly sensitive isoniazid sensor."
Quasi-Periodic Energy Release in a Three-Ribbon Solar Flare,"Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) are found in solar flares of various magnetic morphologies, e.g. in two-ribbon or circular-ribbon flares, and the mechanisms of their generation are not yet clear. Here we present the first detailed analysis of QPPs (with a period \(P = 54 \pm 13\) seconds) found in the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) observations of a relatively rare three-ribbon M1.1 class flare that occurred on 5 July 2012 (SOL2012-07-05T06:49). QPPs are manifested in the temporal profiles of temperature [\(T\)] and emission measure [\(EM\)] of “super-hot” (\(T_{ \mathrm{s}} \approx 30\) – 50 MK) plasma but are almost invisible in the profiles of “hot” (\(T_{\mathrm{h}} \approx 15\) – 20 MK) plasma parameters when approximating X-ray spectra of the flare with the bremsstrahlung spectrum of a two-temperature thermal (Maxwellian) plasma. In addition, QPPs with a similar period are found in the temporal profiles of the flux and spectral index of nonthermal electrons if the observed X-ray spectra are approximated by a combination of the bremsstrahlung spectra of a single-temperature plasma and nonthermal electrons with a power-law energy distribution. QPPs are not well expressed in the X-ray flux according to RHESSI and GOES data, or in radio data. The QPPs are accompanied by apparent systematic movement of a single X-ray source at a low speed of \(34 \pm 21\) km s−1 along the central flare ribbon over a narrow (\(<5\) Mm) “tongue” of negative magnetic polarity, elongated (\(\approx 20\) Mm) between two areas of positive polarity. The results of magnetic extrapolation in the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) approximation show that the X-ray source could move along curved and twisted field lines between two sheared flare arcades. It is worth noting that in the homologous three-ribbon M6.1 flare (SOL2012-07-05T11:39), which occurred in the same region about five hours later, the X-ray sources moved much less systematically and did not produce similar QPPs. We interpret the observed QPPs as a result of successive episodes of energy release in different spatial locations. In each pulsation, ≈(1 – 4)\(\times 10^{29}\) erg is released in the form of thermal energy of hot and super-hot plasmas (or accelerated electrons), which is comparable with the energy of a microflare. The total kinetic energy released during all QPPs is ≈(0.7 – 3.5)\(\times 10^{30}\) erg, which is about an order of magnitude less than the free magnetic energy \(\approx 1.56 \times 10^{31}\) erg released in the flare region. We discuss possible propagating triggers of the quasi-periodic energy release (slow magnetoacoustic waves, asymmetric rise of curved/twisted field lines, flapping oscillations, and thermal instability in a reconnecting current sheet) and argue that the current state of available mechanisms and observations does not allow us to reach an unambiguous conclusion."
The effect of lichen secondary metabolites on Aspergillus fungi,"A systematic review of literature data on the antifungal potential of extracted lichen compounds and individual secondary metabolites against mold species of the genus Aspergillus is provided. Crude extracts from 49 epiphytic, 16 epigeic and 22 epilithic species of lichens and 44 secondary metabolites against 10 species, Aspergillus candidus, A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, A. niger, A. ochraceus, A. parasiticus, A. restrictus, A. stellatus and A. ustus, were analysed. Several measuring techniques were employed for such analyses. Lichen substances were extracted with alcoholic and other organic solvents mainly using the Soxhlet apparatus. Among the three most-studied mold species, the results showed that the crude extracts from the thalli of the lichens Cladonia foliacea, Hypotrachyna cirrhata, Leucodermia leucomelos, Platismatia glauca and Pseudevernia furfuracea against Aspergillus flavus, from C. foliacea, Nephroma arcticum and Parmelia sulcata against A. fumigatus and from Evernia prunastri, Hypogymnia physodes, Umbilicaria cylindrica and Variospora dolomiticola against A. niger have the greatest antifungal potential. The lichen secondary metabolites showed a higher inhibitory potential, e.g. protolichesterinic acid against A. flavus, lecanoric acid against A. fumigatus and orsellinic acid against A. niger; the other seven species of Aspergillus have been poorly studied and require further investigation. A comparison of the inhibitory potential of the tested mixtures of lichen substances and their secondary metabolites shows that they can compete with commonly used antifungal substances, such as ketoconazole and clotrimazole against A. flavus, A. nidulans, A. niger and A. parasiticus and fluconazole in the case of A. fumigatus."
Chitosan nanoparticles as a rice growth promoter: evaluation of biological activity,"The agriculture sector is the building block of an economy with more than 60% of the world population depending on it for livelihood. Among the many crops, rice is the most important income source. It is the staple food for more than half of the world population. In spite of its huge demand, rice production has been dwindling due to various constraints. Chitosan nanoparticles (ChNP) are an excellent choice for agricultural applications owing to its non-toxic, biodegradable nature. Chitosan is an interesting polymer and is then partially or fully deacetylated chitin. In the present study, the effectiveness of ChNP as a growth promoter in improving the yield and biological activity of rice has been analyzed. 1 mg/ml of ChNP was applied as a seed, soil, foliar and combination treatments and the growth and yield parameters were measured to understand the best mode of application. The combination treatment of seed, soil and the foliar application was found to be most efficient. The cellular uptake of ChNP was also studied to deduce the mechanism of action. The soil toxicity of ChNP was studied prior to application and was found to be non-toxic."
The Effect of Microscopic Gap Displacement on the Correlation of Gaps in Dimer Systems,"In earlier work we showed that in the bulk, the correlation of gaps in dimer systems on the hexagonal lattice is governed, in the fine mesh limit, by Coulomb’s law for 2D electrostatics. We also proved that the scaling limit of the discrete field \(\mathbf{F}\) of average tile orientations is, up to a multiplicative constant, the electric field produced by a 2D system of charges corresponding to the gaps. In this paper we show that in the bulk, the relative change \(T_{\alpha ,\beta }\) in correlation caused by displacing a hole by a fixed vector \((\alpha ,\beta )\) is, in the fine mesh limit, the projection on \((\alpha ,\beta )\) of a new field \(\mathbf{T}\), which is also equal up to a multiplicative constant to the electric field of the corresponding system of charges. We also discuss the differences between the fields \(\mathbf{T}\) and \(\mathbf{F}\) and present conjectures for their fine mesh limits in the more general case of a dimer system with boundary. The new field \(\mathbf{T}\) can be viewed as capturing the instantaneous pull on each gap in the surrounding fluctuating sea of dimers. From the point of view of the parallel to physics, the electrostatic force emerges then as an entropic force."
Resilient Social Actors in the Transition from the Late Bronze to the Early Iron Age on Cyprus,"Our understanding of the earliest Iron Age on Cyprus has long remained somewhat obscure. This is the result of both a relative lack of material evidence and the fact that scholarly attention has focused more on the preceding Late Bronze Age and on the subsequent Cypro-Archaic period. As more, and more varied, data have accumulated, there have been calls for a more theoretically informed approach to considering the social changes involved, and even for prehistorians to extend their work into the Cypriot Iron Age. As a response to this, the present study considers a broad range of material and documentary evidence, attempts to reconstruct the political economy, and offers an interpretative framework based on social understandings of Complex Adaptive Systems theory. Using this approach, the authors conclude that, while the enduring realities of Cyprus—its geography, copper resources and long tradition of agropastoralism—continued to shape Cypriot culture, the Iron Age is not simply a continuation of its Bronze Age sociopolitical forms. We argue instead that the earliest Iron Age involved social actors negotiating new politico-economic agendas in response to changing conditions in the Iron Age eastern Mediterranean."
Bolboporites: Interpretation Getting Back on Track,"Based on new finds and additional evidence, the interpretation of the enigmatic echinoderm Bolboporites is confirmed; it is a blastozoan echinoderm most likely related to eocrinoids, in which juvenile holdfast, columnals, and reduced skeletal plates of the theca were fused into a single skeletal element, to which a biserial brachiole was attached."
"An Unusual Cladid (Crinoidea, Echinodermata) from the Pennsylvanian of the Staritsa District (Tver Region)","The cladid crinoid Kholokholnyacrinus ilkhovskyi gen. et sp. nov. is described based on a very large cup from the Pennsylvanian (Kashirian Regional Substage, Smedva Formation) of the Rzhev–Staritsa Volga Region. The new taxon is characterized by a complex of morphological characters in the structure of the crown and arms, such as a disarticulated basal circlet, very low brachials in close contact with each other and with anal sac plates, fixed proximal arms, etc., by which it differs strongly from most other cladids. The uniqueness of the morphological characters indicates that the new genus should be assigned to a new family of cladid crinoids. Paleoecological aspects and systematics of the new crinoid genus are discussed."
"Morphology, Classification and Lineage of the Genera Garumnaster Lambert, 1907 and Basseaster Lambert, 1936 (Echinoidea: Holasteroida, Urechinina) from the Cretaceous–Paleogene Deposits of the Mangyshlak Peninsula","The taxonomy of the fossil species Garumnaster michaleti, G. (Duncaniaster) luppovi, and Basseaster rostratus from the Lower Paleocene of the Mangyshlak Peninsula has been emended. Based on a comparison of morphological characters and the results of statistical analysis, Duncaniaster luppovi is assigned to the genus Garumnaster. The genera Garumnaster and Basseaster are assigned to the family Garumnasteridae."
The Plantigrade Segnosaurians: Sloth Dinosaurs or Bear Dinosaurs?,"This article considers the unusual Macropodosaurus gravis tracks from the Early Cretaceous (Albian) locality of Shirkent-1 (Tajikistan). The trackmaker was bipedal and plantigrade. Through a comparison of Macropodosaurus tracks with those of other dinosaurs and by a juxtaposition of track morphology and pes skeletal morphology, it is argued that they belong to an aberrant group of theropods, the segnosaurs. Data on the stratigraphic and geographical distribution of segnosaur tracks are presented. Aspects of functional morphology of the hind limbs are analyzed, as well as the locomotory mode and the possible lifestyle of this group of dinosaurs. Segnosaurs were most likely herbivorous; their possible ecological counterparts are giant ground sloths. The ancestors of segnosaurs were probably facultatively digitigrade and underwent a short-term stage as arboreal, climbing forms, and then reversed to a purely terrestrial lifestyle. Return to plantigrade locomotion in segnosaurs apparently required increased area of support during the slow obligate bipedal locomotion of these heavy theropods."
Coelom Metamerism in Echinodermata,"Within all major taxa of Bilateria, there are forms with coelomic metamerism. This suggests that coelomic metamerism was characteristic of the common ancestor of Bilateria. Among deuterostomes, metamerism is clearly expressed in chordates, and elements of metamerism are present in hemichordates. Do echinoderms have remnants of coelomic metamerism that was inherited from the common ancestor of Bilateria? The coelomic system of echinoderms includes several metameric coelomic rings located along the oral-aboral axis, namely: the axocoelomic ring, the hydrocoelomic ring, 2 to 6 coelomic rings originating from the left somatocoel, and one epigastric ring originating from the right somatocoel. Thus, in echinoderms, there is a dissymmetrical metamerism, derived from the original metamerism of the common ancestors of Deuterostomia and, possibly, the common ancestors of Bilateria. The problem of dexiothetism as the cause for the formation of coelomic dissymmetry in echinoderms is discussed."
"First Occurrence of a Gomphotheriid (Proboscidea, Mammalia) from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea","A species of gomphotheriids were firstly discovered from the Kidong Formation from Myongchon County, North Hamgyong Province, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Although the tusk is broken and two of the teeth are so deeply worn, the new material displays some mandibular and dental feature combinations that might belong to the known species of either Gomphotherium (probably G. subtapiroideum) or amebelodontids. This discovery not only extends the geographic of the gomphotheriids, but also fills a blank in the gomphotheriid study in DPRK."
"Yuka the Mammoth, a Frozen Mummy of a Young Female Woolly Mammoth from Oyogos","A short review of the results of 10 years of interdisciplinary study of Yuka, the frozen mummy of a young female woolly mammoth from Oyogos (Oyogos Yar, Ust-Yansky ulus, Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Russia) and its significance for studying the biology and ecology of Mammuthus primigenius (Blumenbach, 1799) is given."
Multituberculata from the Early Cretaceous of Mongolia,"The multituberculate assemblage from the Early Cretaceous Khovoor locality in Mongolia, based on the study of 112 specimens in PIN collection, includes three taxa: arginbaatarid Arginbaatar dmitrievae Trofimov, 1980 (=Monobaatar mimicus Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 1987, new synonym) and two eobaatarids, Eobaatar magnus Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 1987 and Nokerbaatar minor (Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 1987), comb. nov. Both eobaatarid taxa from Khovoor differ from other known eobaatarids by lower incisors with enamel restricted to ventrolateral side. Contrary to the previous claims, in both Eobaatar magnus and Nokerbaatar minor P5 is sectorial tooth, as in other eobaatarids, different in morphology from P4. In Eobaatar and Nokerbaatar gen. nov., there is pronounced sculpture of radiating ridges on the upper premolars, which is partially also present on the upper molars. In Nokerbaatar, there is a ventrolingual groove on the lower incisor and p3 is relatively small, lacking serrations. In Eobaatar, there is a pronounced ventrolingual ridge on the lower incisor and p3 is relatively larger, with serrations. The number of infraorbital foramina is variable in Arginbaatar, with most specimens having two foramina. In Arginbaatar, the cusp ornamentation is poorly developed or absent on upper premolars and absent on upper molars. The sectorial dP5 was likely not replacing by P5. The molars (M2, m1–2) have conical cusps. The p4 is very large and highly variable in size and number of denticles (11–18). It lacks labial cusps and has restricted enamel. The p4 rotates mesioventrally during the ontogeny, which is unique for the Multituberculata. The p2 and dp3 are shed early during the ontogeny. The p3 is fully formed but cannot erupt because it is overhang by p4. In upper dentition, there is a replacement of dP3 by P3. Arginbaataridae are currently known only from Khovoor valley in Mongolia, while Eobaataridae were widely distributed in the Early Cretaceous in Asia and Europe."
"Analysis of the Educational Poverty in Spain by Subjects, Regions and Gender","Quality education is a key factor to improve people’s lives and to achieve sustainable development. Using data from PISA 2009, 2012 and 2015, in this paper the level of educational poverty of the Spanish regions is calculated by applying the Adjusted Bourguignon Chakravarty index, \(B{C}^{a}\) (Sánchez-García et al. in Soc Indicat Res 145(2): 479–501). A descriptive analysis of the differences in educational poverty by gender and the contribution of each region and subject to the national level of educational poverty is also provided. This information could certainly be considered a starting point to tackle educational poverty in Spain."
"Tectono-sedimentary framework of the Cretaceous intracontinental Babouri-Figuil Basin (Benue Trough, North-Cameroon)","The sedimentary layers of the Babouri-Figuil basin display a variety of dip directions which suggest a tectonic implication in the sifting up of this basin. This study is based on tectono-stratigraphic analysis that seeks to investigate on the relationship between lithostratigraphy and tectonic divergences. Four different depositional phases arise from this constructed lithostratigraphic section, with a fluvial to a fluvio-lacustrine paleoenvironmental characteristic indicating a positive deposition pattern sequence. Constructed lithostratigraphic sections reveal four fining-up sequences which vary from fluvial to fluvio-lacustrine depositional environments. Subsidence (SW-NE) perpendicular to the major fracture direction (N120E) generally SE-NW would be the origin of the abundance of fractures and diaclases observed in the basin. It would thus be a small graben with an asymmetric syncline on the south side, formed in an extensive North–South context."
To be or not to be: reassessing the origins of portable art in the Cantabrian Region (Northern Spain),"The characterization of the first portable artistic depictions in Cantabrian Spain is crucial for comprehension of the symbolic development of Neandertals and Homo sapiens in the context of the passage from the Middle to the Upper Paleolithic. However, despite the importance of these first graphic representations, their study has tended to lack the application of suitable methodologies to be able to discriminate between graphic activity and other kind of alterations (use-wear, taphonomic, or post-depositional). The present study has examined a significant sample of Middle and Upper Paleolithic lithic and osseous objects from Cantabrian Spain that have been cited as evidence of graphic activity in the literature. The contexts in which the objects were found have been considered, and the objects have been analyzed through the microscopic observation of the marks to distinguish between incisions, pecking, and engraving made for a non-functional purpose (graphic activity) and those generated by diverse functional actions or taphonomic processes (cutmarks, trampling, root marks, percussion scars, and use-wear). The results show that some regional Middle Paleolithic osseous objects display incisions that are neither functional nor taphonomic and whose characteristics are similar to graphic evidence attributed to Neandertals in Europe and the Near East. In turn, the first portable art produced by Homo sapiens in the Cantabrian Spain seems to be limited mostly to linear signs, and no figurative representation can be recognized until the Gravettian. This appears to indicate a particular idiosyncrasy of the region in the Early Upper Paleolithic, which, in comparison with other regions such as south-west France and the Swabian Jura, shows a later and less abundant production of portable art."
Meer ruimte voor behandeling met corticosteroïden in NHG-Standaard Lichen sclerosus,De NHG-Standaard Lichen sclerosus is op enkele onderdelen aangepast. Zo is er meer ruimte gekomen voor intermitterende onderhoudsbehandeling met lokale corticosteroïden. Er zijn aanwijzingen dat deze behandeling de kans op plaveiselcelcarcinoom vermindert.
Naar effectieve trauma-interventies voor vluchtelingenkinderen,"Er is weinig bekend over de effectiviteit van traumabehandeling bij vluchtelingenkinderen, terwijl veel kinderen die zijn gevlucht naar West-Europese landen als Nederland schokkende beelden op hun netvlies hebben. Om deze getraumatiseerde kinderen te helpen zijn goede interventies noodzakelijk. In het project KIEM (Kennis Innovatie Mapping) wordt onderzocht of een traumagerichte behandeling effect heeft. Huisartsen kunnen nog kinderen aanmelden voor dit onderzoek."
Improving the Operating Efficiency of a Multibit Binary Parallel-Prefix Adder,"For the fast addition of two multibit binary numbers, parallel-prefix adders (PPAs) are currently considered effective. Several PPAs are known with different time and hardware characteristics, and in particular, the Kogge–Stone adder is faster than other PPAs. However, this adder has a large number of logical elements and, therefore, occupies a large area, which leads to an increase in its price. This paper analyzes the Kogge–Stone adder. To reduce its hardware and time costs, a modified PPA is developed. Adders are compared in terms of the occupied area and the maximum delay of an operation. A results’ verification scheme is implemented to confirm the reliability of the modified adder’s operation. This circuit is simulated in the CAD Altera Quartus-II environment. As a result, it is found that when performing operations with 32- and 64-bit operands, the developed adder reduces the occupied area by 11 and 16.5%, respectively, and the maximum delay by 7%, compared to a Kogge–Stone adder."
JFET and MOSFET SPICE Models in a Wide Temperature Range,"The schematic design of electronic devices for harsh environments requires SPICE models of electronic components that take into account the influence of ultralow and ultrahigh ambient temperatures. However, the standard SPICE models of components in commercial versions of SPICE-like simulators provide sufficient accuracy in a limited temperature range (–60 to 150°С) and cannot be used for calculating electronic circuits in the range from ultralow to ultrahigh temperatures. This paper presents modified Low-T and High-T SPICE models of field-effect transistors with the MOSFET and JFET structure, intended for calculating electronic circuits in the temperature range from ultralow to ultrahigh (–200 to 300°С) temperatures. All the models are built using a universal approach, which consists of adding additional expressions for the temperature-dependent parameters of the model to the basic SPICE model of the devices. A procedure for extracting the parameters of SPICE models based on the results of measurements or TCAD modeling of the standard set of I–V and CV characteristics in a wide temperature range is developed. The error in describing the static I–V characteristics of MOSFET and JFET transistors does not exceed 10–12% in the temperature range –200 to 300°С."
Formalizing the Choice of Debugging Tests in the Design of Digital Microelectronic Systems Based on Checking the Performance of the Required Functions,"In order to debug projects of digital microelectronic systems, it is necessary to form a certain set of test influences on the simulated system in order to check the correctness of its functioning. A large number of digital systems are characterized by a sequence of functions from a finite alphabet. In this paper, a partial semigroup is defined on the set of admissible sequences of functions. The admissible sequences are formalized by introducing a graph of functions that specifies the possible functions for execution for various states of the digital system. The graph of functions together with the sets of input interactions for each function define the specification of the external behavior of the digital system. It is established that if the admissibility of the sequential execution of two functions depends on the previously performed functions and the state of the digital system, then some functions should be divided into subfunctions. It is shown that the set of debugging tests should include both checking the execution of sequences of functions and the correctness of the execution of each function with different sets of parameters."
Built-In Self-Repairing System-on-Chip RAM,"The amount of onboard memory is increasing in modern digital systems on a chip (SoC). It occupies a significant area on the chip, which leads to new manufacturing defects and reduces the yield of suitable systems. This paper proposes an architecture of built-in self-repair (BISR) tools, which ensures the restoration of the operability of the system’s RAM on a chip in the case of multiple failures due to the reconfiguration of the main and backup memory. An SoC random access memory microcircuit containing the main and backup memory, as well as built-in self-test (BIST) and BISR tools, is considered. The design of the built-in means of the self-repair of the RAM with the automatic restoration of operability in the case of four failures is verified. It is shown that this technical solution reduces the weight of the product compared to devices with majority redundancy, since not all memory is reserved, but only the main components most susceptible to failures. The operable state of the memory of the digital system on a chip was restored automatically without the participation of personnel. The built-in means of self-testing and self-repair of RAM can be used in digital systems for industrial and special purposes, including space systems with a long active life."
Investigation of Methods for the Suppression of the Parasitic Components in the Spectrum of the Output Signal of a Microwave-Quadrature Modulator,"Microwave-quadrature modulators and demodulators are widely used to create modern wireless communication systems. It is important to ensure the high quality of the transmitted signals in order to exchange information without loss or failure. The most critical and undesirable components of the microwave output spectrum are the carrier frequency (heterodyne frequency) and parasitic sideband. Methods for the suppression of the parasitic components are identified in this study with the help of computer simulation. These methods are based on minimizing the phase, amplitude, and current imbalances in various nodes of the microwave-quadrature modulator circuit. For suppression, special digital-to-analog converters are used in conjunction with a polyphase filter on varicaps, a phase-shifting unit, and current sources. The effectiveness of these methods is due to the achievement in the prototypes of values of suppression of parasitic components of 50 dB or more. It is found that for suppression of the parasitic sideband, the minimization of the phase imbalance is more effective than the minimization of the amplitude imbalance. It is revealed that the architecture with the use of a phase-shifting unit is effective for regulating the phase imbalance. The results obtained can be useful in designing high-precision radio-frequency units for various purposes."
"Cranium Variations between Arctic Foxes (Vulpes lagopus semenovi, Vulpes lagopus beringensis) on the Commander Islands and the Mainland Arctic Fox (Vulpes lagopus lagopus) in Comparison with Interspecies Variations in the Genera Urocyon and Vulpes (Canidae)","The Arctic foxes, Vulpes lagopus, from the Commander Islands are known to be well differentiated in skull morphology from the mainland population. Our study is the first to compare this differentiation with interspecies variations in the family Canidae. The level of skull variations between the Arctic foxes of the Commander Islands and the mainland Arctic fox was compared with skull variations between (1) the gray fox, Urocyon cinereoargenteus, and the island fox, U. littoralis; and (2) three closely related species of the Arctic fox: the swift fox, V. velox, and the kit fox, V. macrotis. The skull variations between the Arctic foxes of the Commander Islands and the mainland Arctic fox were shown to correspond to the interspecies level of skull variation in sister species of the genera Vulpes and Urocyon. No general trend in skull variation has been found between the species studied and isolated populations. The craniological data presented support the separation of foxes from the Commander Islands as a distinct species, V. beringensis Merriam 1902, with two subspecies: V. b. semenovi Ognev 1931 (Medny Island) and V. b. beringensis Merriam 1902 (Bering Island). The Arctic foxes of the Commander Islands are a unique part of the biological diversity and must be strictly protected."
Celestial Orientation in Birds,"Migratory birds need various compass systems for successfully migrating in their season-specific and species-specific directions. The first compass systems to be revealed were the sun and the star compasses, but after the discovery of a magnetic compass, emphasis has very much shifted towards that latter system. The sun compass and the star compass sometimes are lumped under the umbrella of a celestial system, which is opposed to the magnetic compass; however, this viewpoint remains debatable. To use the sun compass, the birds have to be able to compensate for the uneven movement of the sun during the day, i.e., to use their inner clocks. Because of this unevenness, as well as both seasonal and regional unevenness of the movement of the sun, migrating birds are believed not to use a sun compass during their large-scale movements. Birds also might use the polarized light pattern of the sun from the sunrise and the sunset to calibrate other compass systems. Unlike a sun compass, an avian star compass is time-independent. Neither a sun nor a star compass is innate; they both need to be learned. Birds are assumed to learn the form of the sun arch during the first weeks of their life and the rotation of the stellar sky around Polaris before their first migration. The usage of the moon as a celestial compass cue is unlikely."
"The Importance of Hauling Grounds in the Life of the Baikal Seals (Pusa sibirica Gmelin 1788, Pinnipedia): 1. Review","The published information on the roles that summer hauling grounds play in the life cycle of the Baikal seal (Pusa sibirica Gmelin 1788) is reviewed and summarized. In the Baikal seal, coastal hauling grounds are primarily for rest, but part of the animals haul out to molt. According to various researchers, the timeframe of the seal hauling out ashore and number of haul-outs is determined by the need to complete molting or a whole set of reasons, which is, however, outweighed by climate conditions. Warm winters and early springs promote rapid clearing of the ice cover, as a result of which the seal does not have enough time to complete molting on ice and is forced to haul out ashore. Utilization of past hauling grounds has been recorded to resume, and the use of new grounds has been noted; but no relationship has been established between the foregoing and their large numbers."
Fauna of Freshwater Harpacticoida (Copepoda) in the Lena River Delta,"The first description/overview of the freshwater copepod fauna of the order Harpacticoida from the Lena River delta is presented. Various habitats and regions were studied. As a result, we identified 18 species belonging to two families: Canthocamptidae and Harpacticidae. Eight of the identified species are new to the study area; five species belonging to the genera Bryocamptus, Canthocamptus, Moraria, and Maraenobiotus, presumably represent new species for science. We provide brief ecological descriptions of the species identified in the Lena River delta and analyze their differences from the typical populations. The harpacticoid fauna of the Lena delta consists of three main components including Palaearctic species, Holarctic species, and species with “Beringian” distribution patterns. We provide a morphological description of Bryocamptus umiatensis Wilson 1958. This species is quite similar to Bryocamptus jejuensis Lee and Chang 2016, recently described from Korea. The main character distinguishing these species is the ornamentation of the anal operculum. This character in our region reveals considerable interpopulation variations. We also provide an identification key to the freshwater Canthocamptidae of the Lena delta."
"Marking Activities of the Siberian Roe Deer (Capreolus pygargus, Cervidae) in Central Yakutia","The marking behavior of male Siberian Roe deer in central Yakutia, Siberia is considered in the context of a biological signal field. The optical elements of the Roe deer signal field are trees and shrubs damaged by their horns. Seven species of tree and shrub plants used by Roe deer as marking objects have been found: pine, larch, fir, birch, willow, aspen, and alder. Among them, representatives of conifers predominate. The maximum thickness of a marking tree across the trunk circumference does not exceed 21 cm, the thickness of marking objects averaging 7.0 ± 3.7 cm. The marking activity of the species rendered on wood and shrub vegetation is performed by demonstrating three types of damage: circular stripping across the trunk circumference; vertical stripping along the trunk, and twisting the trunk."
Experimental Models of the Dyadic Operant Behavior of Rats in Different Social Contexts,"To date, a number of methods for and approaches to the study of animal social behavior are used in ethology and neurophysiology. The present study describes experimental models of the operant behavior of rats in dyads, in which the animals have to compete or cooperate to earn a food or water reward delivered automatically after pressing the image of a conditioned stimulus presented on a touch-sensitive display. Three hardware–software modifications, which enable the presentation of conditioned stimuli and rewards in three social contexts, i.e., individual learning, competition, and cooperation, have been developed and tested using the Rat Touch Screen Chamber experimental complex (Lafayette Instrument, United States). These experimental models and data analysis algorithms make it possible to distinguish between different types of dyadic interactions and to identify certain behavioral patterns such as parasitism and donorship during competition or leadership during cooperation. All these methods are based on implementation of the same instrumental skills acquired by animals during individual learning sessions. Therefore, they can be used in comparative analysis of the effects of zoosocial, physiological, and pharmacological factors on the typological and individual features of animal groups."
"Fluctuating Asymmetry and Morphogenetic Correlations of the Masticatory Surface Patterns of m1 in Gray Voles (Rodentia, Arvicolinae)","We analyzed the relationships between the modularity and integration of the morphotypic variability of the first lower molar (m1) in gray voles, Microtus s. l., based on fluctuating asymmetry data. In total, 5500 pairs of masticatory surface outlines of the left and right first lower molar m1 were studied. Fifty-seven different morphotypes and 229 of their various combinations were identified. The morphotypes were grouped in a contingency table. The frequencies of morphotypes symmetric with respect to the main diagonal in the table were averaged in order to identify the fluctuating asymmetry. Table rows were normalized for the sum; i.e., the frequencies of the occurrence of each morphotype in a pair with all morphotypes including its own were calculated. A matrix of Cavalli-Sforza–Edwards distances between rows in this table was calculated, and Ward’s cluster analysis was applied. Cluster analysis showed the existence of five clusters differing in the degree of morphotype complexity. Clusters of the morphotypes corresponded to the species group of gray voles. The distances between the morphotypes inside the clusters were lower than the intercluster distances, indicating the presence of modularity in the system. The modules were formed by ontogenetic similarity as they were obtained from the data on the fluctuating asymmetry of morphotypes. The molar m1 morphological structure had its own modular structure consisting of two submodules corresponding to the morphogenetic mechanism of its complication."
"The Byssal Apparatus in the Pacific Mussel, Mytilus trossulus (Bivalvia, Mytilidae), from the Sea of Japan","In the commercial Pacific mussel species, Mytilus trossulus, from the Sea of Japan, features of the morphological structure of the byssal apparatus, byssal threads, and pedal groove are studied. Steps in the process of byssal threads formation and characters of the morphological structure of the byssal groove related to this process are described in M. trossulus. The byssal apparatus is shown to consist of a root, a stem, and byssal threads, the latter in cross section being ellipsoid in shape. A byssal thread consists of a corrugated proximal part located immediately behind the cuff and is one-third of its length, and a relatively smooth and flexible distal part taking up two-thirds of the thread length and ending with an attachment disk at the distal end. On the surface of the attachment disk, three reinforcing cords are situated. The morphological features observed in these structures are discussed in terms of the spatial distribution of mytilids in marine coastal zones, a successful habitat of M. trossulus being rocky shores with active wave activities."
Ecological Features of Echinoderm Distribution in the Latorp and Volkhov Regional Stages of the Lower and Middle Ordovician of the Leningrad Region,"The systematic composition and paleoecological distribution of echinoderms in the rocks of the Latorp and Volkhov regional stages of the Lower and Middle Ordovician of the Leningrad Region are reviewed. The basic types of soft-, firm-, and hardground echinoderm communities are reconstructed; the features of their formation and spatial and temporal variation are described."
Lophophore Evolution from the Cambrian to the Present,"Currently there is no unified view on the evolution of the brachiopod lophophore. In order to combine views of paleontologists and zoologists, the evolution of the brachiopod lophophore is analyzed here based on published data from fossil and recent species. A simple spirolophe is supposed to be plesiomorphic in brachiopods and gave rise to a large variety of tentacle apparatus in three brachiopod subphyla. The spirolophe is preserved in Craniiformea and the linguliform superfamily Linguloidea; it is better developed in rhynchonelliform brachiopods, in which its brachial axis obtained a skeletal support that preserves well in the fossil state. The ptycholophe and plectolophe are derivative of the schizolophous developmental stage in brachiopods. They probably developed independently by paedomorphosis in the subphylum Rhynchonelliformea."
Unique 39 Thousand Cal. BP Brain of the “Yuka” Mammoth Mummified Fossils: A History and Methods of the Examination: Paleoneurological Perspectives,"The history of discovery and study of the unique mummified brain of the 39 thousand cal. BP woolly mammoth fossil from Yakutian permafrost with special references to the big brain reconstruction method is provided. The preliminary description of the reconstracted gyri and sulci is described and paleoneurological perspectives are observed and discussed. The big brain of the woolly mammoth demonstrates the complicated patterns of the primary, seconds and tertiary gyrification, which could be potentially used for the comparative study of the extinct mammoth specimen and living representatives of Elephantidae and for searching cross-genus differences."
Radiation Source Terms and Fields Assessment at the T-15MD Facility,"In view of the forthcoming commissioning and start-up of the reconstructed T-15MD tokamak, the radiation fields and dose distributions near the facility and outside of it are reassessed for the current design based on the analysis performed for the previous design modifications. Two modes of operation accompanied by neutron and gamma-radiation emission are considered: acceleration mode (generation of accelerated runaway electrons during current decay in low-density plasma) and deuterium mode. The assessed self-consistent system of plasma and nuclear radiation parameters can be used further for planning of experimental programs that meet the requirements of radiation safety. Recommendations for improving radiation protection when planning an expanded program of experiments with deuterium at subsequent stages of the project are given."
Analysis of the Possibility of Measuring the Electron Plasma Density of the T-15MD Tokamak by Probing with Electromagnetic Waves of the Submillimeter Range,"The passage of probing beams of the submillimeter range in the T-15MD tokamak chamber along various chords is considered in this paper. Microwave generators with submillimeter radiation and HCN lasers with a radiation wavelength of λ = 337 μm are widely used in interferometers in many plasma systems as sources of probing beams. The possibility of using a solid-state microwave generator and an HCN laser in the form of probing radiation sources with wavelengths λ = 915 and 337 μm, respectively, for measuring the electron concentration in the T-15MD tokamak plasma is considered. The paper does not present full-fledged designs of T-15MD tokamak interferometers but examines the passage of the probing beams in the vacuum chamber in order to determine the influence of refraction. Schematic diagrams of interferometers with indicated wavelengths are also presented and discussed, and the results of calculations of the relative error of the phase shift due to deviation of the probe beam are presented. A design of emitting and receiving antennas is proposed. Introducing and receiving the probe beam is carried out through the T-15MD tokamak equatorial pipe and through the upper and lower pipes. In the probing channels passing through the equatorial pipe, the beams are reflected from the mirror fixed on the inner wall of the vacuum chamber. The possibility of measuring the main plasma parameter—the average electron density—when probing with electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength of λ = 915 μm, as well as the possibility of multichannel phase measurement when probing a plasma cord with electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength of λ = 337 μm, in the T-15MD tokamak is shown."
Ion-Optical System with Ballistic Focusing of a Powerful Deuterium Atom Beam Injector for Plasma Heating,"To heat the plasma in the TCV tokamak (Lausanne, Switzerland), a charge exchange injector of a focused beam of fast deuterium atoms with an energy of 30 keV, a power of 1 MW, and a duration of 2 s has been developed at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences. In the ion source of this injector, a multislit three-electrode ion-optical system with spherical electrodes and an emission region with a diameter of 250 mm is used to form the beam. The angular divergence of the ion beam formed by the multislit ion-optical system is sufficiently small in the direction along the slits, which ensures accurate entry of a focused beam of fast atoms into the narrow injection port of the tokamak. During the formation of the ion beam, the electrodes of the ion-optical system are heated by secondary particles and cooling of the electrodes is required. To increase the transparency of the ion-optical system and ease the manufacture, an inertial version of cooling the electrodes was adopted. During a pulse, the rise in temperature is limited by the heat capacity of the electrodes, and between pulses, heat is transferred to the water-cooled connecting flanges of the electrodes. The performed thermomechanical analysis showed that, in order to achieve acceptable values of the longitudinal deflections of the electrodes arising from thermoelastic stresses, it is necessary to reduce the stiffness of the electrodes at the periphery of the beam formation region. This reduction was achieved by the introduction of cuts—azimuthal for the plasma electrode and radial for the accelerating and grounded electrodes. The article presents the design features and manufacturing technology of multislit electrodes of the ion-optical system."
"Lithic Technology and Chronology of Initial Upper Paleolithic Assemblages at Tor Fawaz, Southern Jordan","The Initial Upper Paleolithic (IUP) is a key chrono-cultural concept in our understanding of the cultural and population dynamics at the transition from the Middle Paleolithic to Upper Paleolithic period. This paper presents technological and chronological analyses of lithic assemblages from a rockshelter site at Tor Fawaz in the Jebel Qalkha area, southern Jordan, to provide accurate dating and detailed recognition of the IUP variability in the Levant. We present integrated micromorphological, phytolith, and dung spherulite analyses to evaluate formation and postdepositional processes of archaeological remains through high-resolution micro-contextual studies. As a result, the Tor Fawaz assemblages show general similarity to those of Boker Tachtit Level 4, Tor Sadaf A–B, and Wadi Aghar C–D1 that represent the late phase of the IUP in the southern Levant. Based on the detailed recognition of site-formation processes, we suggest ca. 45–36 ka as the age of IUP occupations at Tor Fawaz. More specifically, the IUP occupations at Tor Fawaz and Wadi Aghar, a nearby IUP site in the same area, may represent slightly different phases that show a lithic technological trend paralleling the IUP sequence at Tor Sadaf in southern Jordan, and possibly post-date Boker Tachtit Level 4. We also discuss the issue of partial chronological overlap between the late IUP and the Ahmarian and also argue for the geographically different trends in cultural changes from the late IUP to the Ahmarian."
The Dichotomized States of Shame in the Scholastic Buddhism,"Shame is by and large dichotomized into hrī and (vy)apatrāpya in the Buddhist context. In the Sarvāstivāda and Yogācāra scholasticism, both hrī (in Chinese translation: 慚 cán) and (vy)apatrāpya (in Chinese translation: 愧 kuì) are subsumed under the wholesome (kuśala) states (dharmas). In this paper, firstly, previous studies and the etymologies of the two terms above will be closely reviewed; secondly, the exposition and contrast of hrī and (vy)apatrāpya between the Sarvāstivāda and Yogācāra will be minutely contextualized; thirdly, the merit of possessing dichotomized states of shame will be thoroughly investigated. Central to my research is a glimpse of the scholastic Indian Buddhist sophistication, exemplified by two kinds of shame, as well as the initial consideration of hrī and (vy)apatrāpya in the context of shame, guilt, and conscience in the Anglophone philosophy, while also taking their association with Buddhist morality (śīla) and concentration (samādhi) into account."
Unidirectional acoustic metamaterials based on nonadiabatic holonomic quantum transformations,"Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum transformations (NHQTs) have attracted wide attention and have been applied in many aspects of quantum computation, whereas related research is usually limited to the field of quantum physics. Here we bring NHQTs into constructing a unidirectional acoustic metamaterial (UDAM) for shaping classical beams. The UDAM is made up of an array of three-waveguide couplers, where the propagation of acoustic waves mimics the evolution of NHQTs. The excellent agreement among analytical predictions, numerical simulations, and experimental measurements confirms the great applicability of NHQTs in acoustic metamaterial engineering. The present work extends research on NHQTs from quantum physics to the field of classical waves for designing metamaterials with simple structures and may pave a new way to design UDAMs that would be of potential applications in acoustic isolation, communication, and stealth."
A secreted catalase contributes to Puccinia striiformis resistance to host-derived oxidative stress,"Plants can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) to counteract pathogen invasion, and pathogens have also evolved corresponding ROS scavenging strategies to promote infection and pathogenicity. Catalases (CATs) have been found to play pivotal roles in detoxifying H2O2 formed by superoxide anion catalyzed by superoxide dismutases (SODs). However, few studies have addressed H2O2 removing during rust fungi infection of wheat. In this study, we cloned a CAT gene PsCAT1 from Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), which encodes a monofunctional heme-containing catalase. PsCAT1 exhibited a high degree of tolerance to pH and temperature, and forms high homopolymers."
Resurrecting low-mass axion dark matter via a dynamical QCD scale,"In the framework where the strong coupling is dynamical, the QCD sector may confine at a much higher temperature than it would in the Standard Model, and the temperature-dependent mass of the QCD axion evolves in a non-trivial way. We find that, depending on the evolution of ΛQCD, the axion field may undergo multiple distinct phases of damping and oscillation leading generically to a suppression of its relic abundance. Such a suppression could therefore open up a wide range of parameter space, resurrecting in particular axion dark-matter models with a large Peccei-Quinn scale fa ≫ 1012 GeV, i.e., with a lighter mass than the standard QCD axion."
The spectrum of marginally-deformed \( \mathcal{N} \) = 2 CFTs with AdS4 S-fold duals of type IIB,"A holographic duality was recently established between an \( \mathcal{N} \) = 4 non-geometric AdS4 solution of type IIB supergravity in the so-called S-fold class, and a three- dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) defined as a limit of \( \mathcal{N} \) = 4 super-Yang-Mills at an interface. Using gauged supergravity, the \( \mathcal{N} \) = 2 conformal manifold (CM) of this CFT has been assessed to be two-dimensional. Here, we holographically characterise the large-N operator spectrum of the marginally-deformed CFT. We do this by, firstly, providing the algebraic structure of the complete Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectrum on the associated two-parameter family of AdS4 solutions. And, secondly, by computing the \( \mathcal{N} \) = 2 super-multiplet dimensions at the first few KK levels on a lattice in the CM, using new exceptional field theory techniques. Our KK analysis also allows us to establish that, at least at large N, this \( \mathcal{N} \) = 2 CM is topologically a non-compact cylindrical Riemann surface bounded on only one side."
Data based model for predicting COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in metropolis,"There is an ongoing need for scientific analysis to help governments and public health authorities make decisions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. This article presents a methodology based on data mining that can offer support for coping with epidemic diseases. The methodological approach was applied in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Manaus, the cities in Brazil with the most COVID-19 deaths until the first half of 2021. We aimed to predict the evolution of COVID-19 in metropolises and identify air quality and meteorological variables correlated with confirmed cases and deaths. The statistical analyses indicated the most important explanatory environmental variables, while the cluster analyses showed the potential best input variables for the forecasting models. The forecast models were built by two different algorithms and their results have been compared. The relationship between epidemiological and environmental variables was particular to each of the three cities studied. Low solar radiation periods predicted in Manaus can guide managers to likely increase deaths due to COVID-19. In São Paulo, an increase in the mortality rate can be indicated by drought periods. The developed models can predict new cases and deaths by COVID-19 in studied cities. Furthermore, the methodological approach can be applied in other cities and for other epidemic diseases."
Kidney biopsy-based epidemiologic analysis shows growing biopsy rate among the elderly,"Systematic registration and examination of biopsy-related data in Central and Eastern Europe are scarce, while the health condition of the population is worse compared to other more developed countries. We aim to create a database and analyze the distribution and temporal variation of the renal biopsy diagnoses in Hungary, including the effect of the recent coronavirus pandemic. The diagnoses were standardized according to the recommendation of the European Renal Association. Native biopsy samples processed between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2020, were analyzed. During the 15 years, 2140 native kidney biopsies were performed. The number of samples increased from 24.5 to 57.9 per million person-years and the median age from 37 to 51 years (p < 0.0001). The predominance of glomerular diseases was stable. The most frequent glomerulopathy was IgA nephropathy (21.5%), followed by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (17.7%), and membranous nephropathy (15.7%). Trends showed the rise of ANCA-associated vasculitis. During the coronavirus pandemic, there was a decrease in the number of kidney biopsies and the proportion of membranous nephropathies. The diagnostic trends in our database showed increasing biopsy rates among the elderly and the growing frequencies of age-related diseases, which emphasizes the importance of altering medical focus according to demographic changes in this area."
Multi-issue bankruptcy problems with crossed claims,"In this paper, we introduce a novel model of multi-issue bankruptcy problem inspired from a real problem of abatement of emissions of different pollutants in which pollutants can have more than one effect on atmosphere. In our model, therefore, several perfectly divisible goods (estates) have to be allocated among certain set of agents (claimants) that have exactly one claim which is used in all estates simultaneously. In other words, unlike of the multi-issue bankruptcy problems already existent in the literature, this model study situations with multi-dimensional states, one for each issue and where each agent claims the same to the different issues in which participates. In this context, we present an allocation rule that generalizes the well-known constrained equal awards rule from a procedure derived from analyzing this rule for classical bankruptcy problems as the solution to a sucession of linear programming problems. Next, we carry out an study of its main properties, and we characterize it using the well-known property of consistency."
Factor structure and internal reliability of breast cancer screening Champion’s Health Belief Model Scale in Yemeni women in Malaysia: a cross-sectional study,"The reliability and validity of the Champion’s Health Belief Model Scale (CHBMS) used in assessing the belief of women regarding breast cancer (BC) and breast cancer screening (BCS) have been examined on various populations. However, the use of this tool has not been adequately assessed for its validity in ethnic minorities. This study assessed the validity and reliability of CHBMS by analyzing the factor structure and internal reliability of the factors among Yemeni women in Malaysia."
Three-year observational study of immediate post-abortion insertion versus menstrual insertion of etonogestrel contraceptive implant,"This study aimed to estimate the difference in vaginal bleeding pattern, discontinuation rate, and satisfaction between immediate after abortion and menstrual insertions of etonogestrel contraceptive implants."
Five-to-five clear aligner therapy: predictable orthodontic movement for general dentist to achieve minimally invasive dentistry,"Esthetic dentistry has become a very important aspect of every dental treatment from the patient perspective, whether it is orthodontics or implant therapy. The aim of this article is to describe the advantages of a newly developed branch of five-to-five clear aligner therapy (CAT) (Invisalign Go, Align Technology, San Jose, Calif) in interdisciplinary treatments especially in terms of minimally invasive interventions."
Minimum size and positioning of imaging field for CBCT-scans of impacted lower third molars: a retrospective study,"Cone-beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for preoperative 3D imaging of lower third molars. Hence, for this imaging indication, the present study aimed to define the minimum field-of-view (FOV) size and its optimum placement, to decrease radiation exposure, and highlight the need of computer-assisted FOV centering technique for dental CBCT devices. To facilitate proper placement of image field, lower second molar was chosen as reference."
Spatiotemporal variability of the ocean since 1900: testing a new analysis approach using global sea level reconstruction,"A new approach for analysis of spatiotemporal variability across ocean basins was tested using global 1° × 1° monthly sea level reconstruction (RecSL) for 1900–2015. Each sea level cross section η(x,t) was converted into a single time series that contains both spatial and temporal variabilities by connecting back and forth repeated monthly sections. For example, a single zonal section between 50°W and 50°E would create a time series of 116 years × 12 months × 100° = 139,200 data points. The long record allowed great statistical significance and direct comparison between energy in spatial variability and energy in temporal variability. Time and length scales found in 116 years of RecSL data are compared with 23 years of altimeter data. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) was then used to break the record into high-frequency modes representing spatial variability across the section and lower frequency modes representing temporal variability (capturing time scales of a few months to multidecadal). Examples of the spatiotemporal analysis in the Pacific Ocean showed how the method detected an increase in El Niño amplitude in equatorial regions and characterized spatiotemporal changes in the Kuroshio Current in mid-latitudes. In the Atlantic Ocean, the analysis showed the latitudinal dependency of spatiotemporal variability: for example, sections near the Gulf Stream (GS) and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) showed energy dominated by small-scale spatial variability while sections across equatorial and subpolar North Atlantic regions showed energy dominated by long-term temporal variability and diminishing energy in spatial variability. The impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index on spatiotemporal variability showed that interannual variations in NAO are highly correlated with subpolar sea level variability, while decadal and longer variations in NAO are linked with sea level variations at the equatorial South Atlantic and the Antarctic zone. This analysis can be useful for other observations and various climate data."
Physical-Ecological Response of the California Current System to ENSO events in ROMS-NEMURO,"We analyze the bottom-up El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) driven physical-biological response of the California Current System (CCS) in a high-resolution, “eddy-scale” ocean model with multiple classes of phytoplankton and zooplankton forced with observed winds over the time period 1959–2007. The response of the sea surface temperature anomalies over the CCS is asymmetrical, with La Niña events being more consistently cold than El Niño events are consistently warm, which is in agreement with previous studies. The biogeochemical and ecological response is represented by ENSO composite anomalies, lag correlations with an ENSO index, and histograms for ENSO years. The results show trophic level interactions during El Niño and La Niña events in which the larger components (diatoms, euphausiids, and copepods) are suppressed in the coastal upwelling zones during El Niño, while the smaller components (flagellates and ciliates) are enhanced. In addition, standing eddies of the CCS modulate the latitudinal structure of the ecological response to ENSO. The results point towards future research to understand how bottom-up changes may lead to variability of patterns in ecological response, including fish populations and top predators."
A novel anatomo-physiologic high-grade spondylolisthesis model to evaluate L5 nerve stretch injury after spondylolisthesis reduction,"L5 nerve palsy is a well-known complication following reduction of high-grade spondylolisthesis. While several mechanisms for its occurrence have been proposed, the hypothesis of L5 nerve root strain or displacement secondary to mechanical reduction remains poorly studied. The aim of this cadaveric study is to determine changes in morphologic parameters of the L5 nerve root during simulated intraoperative reduction of high-grade spondylolisthesis. A standard posterior approach to the lumbosacral junction was performed in eight fresh-frozen cadavers with lumbosacral or lumbopelvic screw fixation. Wide decompressions of the spinal canal and L5 nerve roots with complete facetectomies were accomplished with full exposure of the L5 nerve roots. A 100% translational slip was provoked by release of the iliolumbar ligaments and cutting the disc with the attached anterior longitudinal ligament. To evaluate the path of the L5 nerves during reduction maneuvers, metal bars were inserted bilaterally at the inferomedial aspects of the L5 pedicle at a distance of 10 mm from the midpoint of the L5 pedicle screws. There was no measurable change in length of the L5 nerve roots after 50% and 100% reduction of spondylolisthesis. Mechanical strain or displacement during reduction is an unlikely cause of L5 nerve root injury. Further anatomical or physiological studies are necessary to explore alternative mechanisms of L5 nerve palsy in the setting of high-grade spondylolisthesis correction, and surgeons should favor extensive surgical decompression of the L5 nerve roots when feasible."
The effect of inter-pregnancy interval on stillbirth in urban South Ethiopia: a community-based prospective cohort study,"Stillbirth is an invisible and poorly understood adverse pregnancy outcome that remains a challenge in clinical practice in low-resource settings. It is also a key concern in Ethiopia where more than half of pregnancies occur shortly after preceding childbirth. Whether the interval between pregnancies has an effect on stillbirth or not is unclear. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effect of inter-pregnancy interval on stillbirth in urban South Ethiopia."
Dynamic Programming on the Multidimensional Grid and Fast Search Algorithm for Energy Minimization in Stereo and Optical Flow,"In this paper, a recursive algorithm that considerably reduces the computational complexity of the minimum search problem has been presented. The mentioned reduction is especially significant if the disparity space is 2D or 3D. The proposed method can be applied in the well-known dynamic programming (DP) approach for stereo and motion. In this case, the general 2D problem of the global discrete energy minimization has been reduced to several mutually independent sub-problems of one-dimensional minimization, and an exact solution has been obtained for each sub-problem. A new modification of DP techniques, which we call extended dynamic programming for energy minimization (EDP), has been also presented in this paper. The EDP method is used if an approximation of the general 2D discrete energy minimization problem is considered. In this case, the proposed recursive minimum search (RMS) algorithm is an essential part of the EDP method. Using the EDP algorithm, we have obtained a lower energy than the graph cuts expansion technique on stereo and motion problems."
Orthogonal Precoding for Systems with Spatial Multiplexing with a Linear Receiver,"An approach is proposed for the development of algorithms for orthogonal precoding to achieve the effect of full diversity in communication systems with a MIMO channel with linear processing on the receiving side. The developed algorithms can be used for any configuration of the MIMO channel and are implemented in the form of fast orthogonal transformation vectors \({{N}_{{{\text{tx}}}}}\) of size \(\left( {{{N}_{{{\text{tx}}}}} \times 1} \right)\) each (\({{N}_{{{\text{tx}}}}}\) is the number of transmitting antennas), and the distribution of the transformed symbols of these vectors over different cycles and transmitting antennas. The results of modeling the proposed precoding algorithms are presented, which showed that their use allows obtaining a gain of 2–5 dB, depending on the configuration of the MIMO system. In this case, the number of operations in the implementation of a linear receiver increases only by \({{N}_{{{\text{tx}}}}}{{\log }_{2}}{{N}_{{{\text{tx}}}}}\), i.e., the complexity of the receiver remains virtually unchanged."
Circular Magnetoelectric Heterostructure Based Inductor Tuned with Magnetic and Electric Fields,"Here we present a new design of an inductor based on a circular magnetoelectric heterostructure containing a radially poled ring of piezoelectric lead zirconate–titanate (PZT) and an outer ring of amorphous ferromagnetic FeBSiC, mechanically coupled to each other, and a toroidal coil. Control of the device inductance by magnetic and electric fields is demonstrated. The magnetic field of 0–200 Oe was applied either along the axis of the ring structure, in the plane of the structure, or created by an additional coil wounded on the ring structure, while the electric field of 0–18 kV/cm was applied to the PZT ring. The change in the inductance reached 1000 and 410% at 300 Hz frequency when tuning by magnetic and electric fields, respectively. Uncertainty in the inductance tuning caused by the magnetic and piezoelectric hysteresis of the heterostructure was observed. The energy/power requirements for tuning/maintaining inductance of the device using magnetic and electric fields are compared."

On the Use of Multilink Access Methods to Support Real-Time Applications in Wi-Fi Networks,"The support of real-time applications, such as virtual and augmented reality, remote control, and video streaming services, is important for next-generation Wi-Fi networks. For this purpose, it is planned to add several new technical features to the IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) standard that is currently under development, which will help to secure low latency. One of these innovations is the support of simultaneous transmission and reception of information by a device via multiple frequency channels, which will provide higher flexibility of using channel resources by the devices and make it possible to use different channels for different types of traffic. In this study, different methods of using multiple channels to support real-time traffic together with ordinary latency-insensitive traffic are investigated. Such approaches as using a separate channel for service frames, prioritizing medium access parameters, and allocating separate channels to support only high-priority traffic are compared. The optimal cases in terms of meeting the requirements of real-time applications and the efficiency of ordinary devices are identified for each method."
Effect of Nonuniform Magnetic Field That Magnetizes a Ferrite Film on the Measurement Accuracy for Characteristics of Spin Waves,A magnetic system is developed to generate a stationary uniform magnetic field in a relatively large region between the poles of a magnet that is used in a setup for the study of characteristics of spin waves. The calculations and subsequent measurements show that the application of ring terminals with certain parameters in the magnet allows a several-fold increase in the size of the region with a high uniformity of the magnetic field. The Fourier analysis of the distribution of the amplitude of spin waves is used to show that improvement of the uniformity of the magnetic field in the system due to the application of the ring terminals leads to a several-fold increase in the accuracy of measurement of the wave number. It is found that the first mode of the backward volume spin wave is split into satellite modes that are excited in the ferrite film due to the presence of several layers with similar magnetic parameters.
ASMD‒FSMD Technique in Designing Signal Processing Devices on Field Programmable Gate Arrays,"The algorithmic state machine with a datapath (ASMD)‒finite state machine with a datapath (FSMD) technique for designing digital devices is discussed, in which the operation of a device is described in the form of a block diagram of a state machine with a datapath. Different techniques for designing digital devices are compared by the examples of synchronous multipliers and peripheral interface controller (PIC) processors on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). It is shown that the ASMD‒FSMD technique, in contrast to the conventional approach, in most cases makes it possible to reduce the sales value (by 47% for particular examples) and significantly enhance the speed (by a factor of 2.96 for particular examples), as well as to essentially shorten the design time (by a factor of 5‒7). Recommendations on using the ASMD‒FSMD technique are given and possible directions for its further development are pointed."
Suppression of Heterogeneous Environment Interference Using Multiple Cameras,"It is proposed to use an estimate of the scene depth function, the knowledge of which allows restoration of an undistorted scene image, in the framework of the distorted image formation model specified by the Koshmieder equation. The method for estimating the scene depth is based on the registration of a scene image by three identical cameras with a sufficiently large depth of field. Thus, the foreground, middle-ground, and background of the scene appear sharp and clear. The cameras are coaxially arranged at the vertices of a right-angled isosceles triangle, the plane of which is perpendicular to the shooting direction. A reconstruction method based on three observed images distorted by a heterogeneous environment is proposed. It is assumed that the distorted images bring information about an initial image, environment interference function, and sensor noise. The method for suppression of the interference explicitly solves the linear system of equations obtained from a quadratic objective function. The experimental reconstruction results obtained by the proposed method are presented and discussed."
Estimation of the Child Well-Being Index in the Constituent Entities of the Russian Federation Based on the Threshold Aggregation Model,"A comprehensive study of socioeconomic factors affecting the situation of children and families with children in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation is a social requirement and an important scientific problem. In this paper, a method for estimating the child well-being index based on the threshold indicator aggregation model is considered. Three ways of ranking the indicators are presented. The results of the pilot experiments are shown in the cartogram of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation."
On the Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter black hole with an f(R) global monopole,"In this work, we follow the recently revisited f(R) theory of gravity for studying the interaction between quantum scalar particles and the gravitational field of a generalized black hole with an f(R) global monopole. This background has a term playing the role of an effective cosmological constant, which permits us to call it as Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter (SAdS) black hole with an f(R) global monopole. We examine the separability of the Klein–Gordon equation with a non-minimal coupling and then we discuss both the massless and massive cases for a conformal coupling. We investigate some physical phenomena related to the asymptotic behavior of the radial function, namely, the black hole radiation, the quasibound states, and the wave eigenfunctions."
Assessment of Forest-Stand Destruction by Fires Based on Remote-Sensing Data on the Seasonal Distribution of Burned Areas,"The paper presents the results of a lethality assessment of forest fires (the proportion of the dead forest areas in comparison to the total area affected by fire) in Russian forests for the period of 2006–2019 according to remote-sensing data. The determined dependence of the probability of pyrogenic forest destruction on the time of the fire onset and its overall impact during the season indicate that the seasonal distribution of the fire area is an informative predictor of lethality. The Seasonal Fire Lethality Index (SFLI) proposed in the article makes it possible to estimate the scale of pyrogenic destruction of Russian forests based on information obtained from satellite monitoring of the area covered by fire distribution during the fire-hazard season. The results demonstrate the presence of a linear correlation between the value of the proposed index and the values of the forest-fire lethality index. At the same time, the determination coefficient of the correlation between the two aforementioned characteristics reaches the maximum (R2 = 0.80) on July 19; thus, this date was chosen as the climactic day of the forest-fire lethality. The linear regression equation between the characteristics of the fire lethality for Russian forests corresponding to this date allows annual remote assessment with a mean square error of ±10.5%. Assessment of the lethality of forest fires based on the proposed method has minimal requirements for input data, which include only information on the distribution of the forest area covered by fire during the fire-hazard season. This makes it possible to use the method on a national scale. The results can be of direct practical importance for the optimization of fire-protection regimes of Russian forests, with an accounting of the potential fire lethality."
Morphological Characteristics of Japanese Red Pine Needles from the Areas of the Fukushima NPP Accident,"The morphometric and morphological parameters of needles of Japanese red pine growing in radioactively contaminated as a result of the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant were studied. The pine is a unique widespread object of research with a range of informative and sensitive test systems at different levels of its organization. In this research, we studied the variability in the weight and length of 2-year-old needles, the indices of needle fluctuating asymmetry, and the frequency of necroses and morphoses (three-needle brachyblasts) at four impact sites and one reference site in 2019. The ambient dose rates varied from 3.4 + 0.1 to 6.4 + 0.4 μSv h–1 in the radioactively contaminated areas (0.25 + 0.05 μSv h–1 in the control). No statistically significant correlation has been found between the studied needle parameters and the level of radiation exposure. Needles were significantly longer only at one impact site and reached a significant weight at most of the sites exposed to radiation. At the site with the highest dose rate, the fluctuating asymmetry index for needle length significantly exceeded the control level. At all impact sites, the fluctuating asymmetry index for needle weight did not significantly differ from that in the control. The frequency of needles severely affected by necrosis was significantly higher at most of the radioactively contaminated sites. Brachyblasts with three needles were found at all studied sites; their frequency was higher at most of the impact sites than at the control site. Therefore, some values of the morphological and morphometric parameters are statistically significantly higher in Japanese red pine populations growing in radioactively contaminated areas than the control level, even 8 years after the accident."
Ecological Features of the Renewal of the Boxelder Maple in Arid Regions of Russia,"The boxelder (ash-leaved) maple has widely been used in Russian forestry and settlement landscaping. However, it is now recognized as one of the most aggressive, invasive tree species because of the high survival level of its self-seeding offspring. In many regions, it is listed in local Black Books of Flora. Long-term monitoring of the state, development, and death of the spontaneously rooting maple specimens has revealed the degree of ecological compliance of this species with various habitat conditions. It is demonstrated that the self-sown maple intrudes into vacated areas of natural and artificial forest ecosystems in a short time (within the life cycle of plantations), e.g., after the death of a forest-forming species, thinning, and recreational compaction of soils. In treeless areas receiving the optimal water supply, it settles in disturbed lands, even on barren soils. For example, it is rather common in private gardens, city squares, and recesses along transport routes. Such a “nomadic” strategy allows it to occupy more and more habitats. It is important that seed-originated trees disappear completely in 20–35 years due to their inadequate competitiveness for moisture and light with native species of trees, shrubs, and grasses. Although its introduction lasts for a century, this adventive species could not fully naturalize and find its ecological niche in Russia. Nevertheless, its use as a planting material in floodplain, forest-growth conditions and in settlement landscaping should be restricted."
Effect of Motor-Vehicle Emissions on Biochemical and Morphological Characteristics Indicating the State of English Oak Trees,"Motor-vehicle emissions influence some biochemical and morphological parameters that indicate the vital state of trees in urban plantings. Twenty-eight English oak (Quercus robur) trees growing in places that differing in the level of motor emissions (10−30 m from Moscow Ring Road and the Uzkoye Forest Park in Moscow) have been analyzed for their morphological indices. In additional, the contents of proline, macroelements, and heavy metals in tree leaves and branches of different age groups (old, >100 years old, and young, 15–20 years old) has been determined. Soil samples have been taken layer by layer up to a depth of 1 m within a 2-m radius from a tree, and the total contents of Mg, P, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Pb, as well as the contents of mobile forms of Zn, Cu, Pb, and Fe (acetate-ammonium extract) and the concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl–, Na+, and \({\text{SO}}_{4}^{{2 - }}\) ions in the aqueous extracts, have been determined. According to the existing scale of the tree sanitary state and the classification of the growth and development of Q. robur crowns, the studied trees have been referred to three vital state groups: the worst (group 1), medium (group 2), and best (group 3) states. Similar levels of heavy metals were observed in branches of 100-year-old and 10- to 15-year-old trees from group 1. The contents of Zn, Fe, Ca, and S in tree branches was characterized by a strong negative correlation with the vital state of trees (i.e., the group number); in the case of leaves, such correlations were weaker or absent. The K and P contents in branches positively correlated with the life state of trees, whereas no such correlation was observed in leaves. A strong negative correlation was found between the contents of Zn, Fe, Ca, and S and the contents of P and K in tree branches; in the case of leaves, this correlation was positive. An increase in the K and P contents in leaves in response to an increase in the pollutant concentration represents one mechanism to protect the assimilation apparatus from the impact of motor-vehicle emissions."
Assessment of Fire Hazard and Its Dynamics in Forest Areas of Siberia,"The existing methods for the assessment of fire hazard are analyzed. For the forest regions of Siberia, which are known for the highest indicators of fire hazard, data has been assembled on the degree of natural and weather-dependent fire hazard, as well as the hazard from a source of ignition. It is proposed to assess the natural fire hazard with allowance for the geographical-zonal and general inflammability features of the forest-site types and the forest regions of Siberia. The need to take into account the dynamics of fire hazard has been noted, especially after fire-hazard seasons characterized by an extreme degree of flammability. In remote areas, it is proposed to assess the dynamics of the natural fire hazard of territories based on the predicted state of forest ecosystems after the impact of fires. The proposed method has been tested on the territory of the Nizhneangarsk forest region, and a high reliability was found for the assessment of the postfire state of forest stands (in 87% of cases). The natural fire-hazard dynamics in the Kodinsky and Gremuchinsky forest districts of the Krasnoyarsk Territory have been analyzed based on the prediction of the forest-fire aftermath. The study has also revealed significantly increased areas of forest lands characterized by the first class of natural fire hazard after the impact of several large fires in 1996 and 2006 and an increase in fire-hazard class in some of the forestry units and on the territory of the Gremuchinsky forest district as a whole."
Spatiotemporal Structure and Dynamics of the Late Succession Stage of Taiga Cedar Pine of the Western Sayan Mountains,"The results of stationary studies (1965–2017) on the regularities of the dynamics of the spatial structure of old-growth, cedar-pine forests are shown on the example of a natural-growth, cedar-pine sedge–tall herb–fern forest of the late succession stage (Western Sayan, 53°01′ N, 92°59′ E, individual test site area of 1.56 ha). It was found that a dynamic balance has been maintained in the structure of the edificator layer for a period of 50 years, while the subedificator layer (fir) has undergone more rapid changes in age structure and affects the relations between the synusiae of lower layer and their role in the regrowth of cedar pine (Pinus sibirica (Du Tour) and Siberian fir (Abies sibirica (Ledeb.). Each synusia is characterised by a relatively constant number of species, dominant-species structure, and ratio of ecocoenotic groups. Tall herb–fern, calamagrostis–dryopteris, aconite–sedge, sedge and oxalis synusiae of different complexities remain the constant structural elements of this type of forest. The roles of the individual herbaceous synusia in cedar pine regrowth have been shown for the tall grass–fern group of forest types. Cedar-pine regrowth is slow in the dominant tall grass–fern synusia and occurs mostly on microrelief, at sites of windfall and fallen trees. Conversely, the competition with the grass is lower in the sedge synusia, and periodical outbreaks of cedar-pine regrowth occur in years of high productivity. However, the probability of seedlings’ further survival is low due to competition with the parent trees. The results allow the prediction of the age dynamics of a natural-growth cedar pine forest for the next several decades, under the assumption of climate and weather trends that are typical for the latter century cycle and are without any catastrophic changes. The diversity of microtypes and synusiae supports the sustainability of the entire mountain ecosystem and will play an important role in the modeling of the regrowth and spatial distribution of individual trees during the later stages of fir–cedar pine forest development in the taiga zone of the Sayan mountains."
"Ethanol lamp: a simple, tunable flame oscillator and its coupled dynamics","In this paper, we introduce a simple controllable experimental system that can exhibit rich dynamics. The setup comprises a sealed glass vial of ethanol with wicks immersed in it. The flame produced by such a lamp can show both steady combustion or oscillatory combustion (i.e. flickering) depending on the volume of fuel within and the number of wicks used in its construction. This tunability makes it a great model system to study the dynamics of flame oscillations and to explore emergent behaviour of coupled nonlinear oscillators in table-top experiments. In the present work, the behaviour of this system for different fuel volumes is explored and some typical phenomena reported in other experimental systems, viz. in-phase synchronization, anti-phase synchronization and amplitude death are demonstrated."
Meson photo-production in GEANT4 for \(E_\gamma =0.225\)–3.0 GeV using the \(\gamma + p \rightarrow n + \pi ^+\) reaction,"In a previous study, we compared experimental data of the total and angular differential cross sections of \(\pi ^0\) photo-production off the proton to theoretical models implemented in version 9.6.p02 of the GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit (Amar et al. in Eur Phys J A 55:62, 2019). This paper describes a similar work but for the exclusive and differential cross sections of the \(\pi ^+\) photo-production off the proton. The Chiral Invariant Phase Space (CHIPS) and Bertini Cascade (BERT) models were compared to the experimental data from the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) of Jefferson Lab and the phenomenological Scattering Analysis Interactive Dial-in (SAID) model. Relativistic Breit–Wigner fits were used to compare the description of the nucleon resonance region up to 3 GeV from SAID, CLAS and CHIPS. As observed in the \(\pi ^0\) case, the CHIPS model provides a reasonable description of the invariant mass distribution while the limited tabulated data set of the BERT model is not adequate. Furthermore, the \(\gamma p \rightarrow n\pi ^+\) differential cross sections \(d\sigma /d\Omega \) show significant differences between CHIPS and both CLAS and SAID data pointing to some needed improvements in its physics."
Termite eusociality and contrasting selective pressure on social and innate immunity,"The evolution of termite eusociality has been influenced by their nesting and foraging ecology. This includes the evolution of a separate developmental line for specialized workers that forego direct reproduction (true workers), which coincides with the transition from inhabiting a dead-wood nest to foraging for food outside the nest. Foraging for extranidal food requires that termites move through an entomopathogen-rich rhizosphere. This suggests that improved defenses against these pathogens were required for the successful transition to foraging outside the nest. Soil is especially rich in insect pathogens such as Metarhizium, and termites use secreted salivary β-1,3-glucanases for protection from this fungus. These enzymes are likely to be dependent on hygiene behaviors, such as allogrooming of external surfaces after contact with fungal conidial spores or ingestion or burying of infected nestmates prior to sporulation of the cadaver. These social mechanisms of defense could compensate for internal innate mechanisms of defense and even relax selective pressure on these innate mechanisms. Here, we investigated whether the selective pressure was intensified or relaxed on secreted β-1,3-glucanases as well as internal innate immune proteins, especially those putatively involved in antifungal defense. An analysis of the molecular evolution of two termite β-1,3-glucanases (GNBP1,2) indicates that the intensity of selection on them significantly increased with the transition to foraging. The shift to foraging for extranidal food apparently required adaptive modification of secreted GNBPs to help cope with increased exposure to pathogenic conidia in the soil. This included modification of a conserved binding site in GNBP2. In contrast, there was either significant relaxation or no change of selection pressure on Toll and phenoloxidase pathway immune genes with the transition to foraging. Relaxation was also observed with the evolution of drywood termites, but this likely reflects a transition to a microhabitat with fewer pathogens. Selection intensified on a subset of immune genes that regulate intestinal microbes with the more recent radiation of the Termitidae and the diversification of their feeding strategies."
"Influence of different weather aspects on breeding performance, food supply and nest-space use in hoopoe offspring","In this study, we investigated the influence of different weather aspects on breeding performance, food supply and nest-space use in hoopoe offspring (Upupa epops). Camera recordings of 88 nests were used to examine how ambient environmental conditions influence food supply, offspring nest-space use and the trade-off nestlings face regarding the two mainly used locations in the nest. Therefore, we provide a comprehensive analysis involving different factors including weather parameters together with food provisioned to nestlings on different temporal scales to identify the factors having the most influence on nest-space use. We found that different breeding conditions significantly influenced how nestlings used the nest. During excessively humid weather, nestlings spent more time under the entrance hole when small food was delivered. However, nestlings supplied with large prey more often remained hidden in the distant area, despite the adverse weather situation. In all three aspects and temporal scales, our analysis confirmed that prey was the most important factor influencing offspring nest-space use, suggesting a crucial role of large insects for hoopoes. Finally, we found that long-term effects of weather affect overall food provisioned to nestlings and thus offspring behaviour. We provide evidence that parental feeding location and prey size, which are in turn influenced by weather conditions, are the most influential factors for nest-space use. This study expands our knowledge of parent–offspring communication and how environmental factors may lead to differential nest-space use, which may be regarded as the earliest form of habitat preference in birds."
Comparative assessment of standard and immune response criteria for evaluation of response to PD-1 monotherapy in unresectable HCC,"To assess response to programmed death-1 (PD-1) monotherapy (nivolumab) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients using RECIST1.1, modified RECIST (mRECIST), and immune RECIST (iRECIST). A secondary objective was to identify clinicolaboratory and imaging variables predictive of progressive disease (PD) and overall survival (OS)."
Photospheric Source of White-Light Flare Energy,"Additional heating of the photosphere and lower chromosphere to temperatures of around 104 K with the generation of a flare continuum (white-light flares) has been studied. Additional heating is associated with the dissipation of the ring electric currents that arise in the penumbra of sunspots or in the magnetic-loop footpoints with a pulsed increase in the rate of photospheric convection. A criterion for additional heating, which depends on the photospheric plasma velocity and the vertical component of the magnetic field, is obtained. For the penumbra region with a vertical component of the magnetic field of \({{B}_{z}} = {{10}^{2}}\,{\text{G}}\), heating can occur at a photospheric convection velocity of \({{V}_{r}} \geqslant {{10}^{5}}\,{\text{cm }}\,{{{\text{s}}}^{{ - 1}}}\), which exceeds the typical convection velocity of \( \approx \) 3 \(~ \times \,{{10}^{4}}\,\,{\text{cm}}\,\,{{{\text{s}}}^{{ - 1}}}\). An increase in the photospheric plasma velocity and radiation growth in the continuum can be associated with an increase in the magnetic-field gradient near the neutral line as magnetic regions with opposite polarities of the vertical component of the magnetic field approach each other. For magnetic loop footpoints, an increase in velocity can be initiated by the development of the Rayleigh–Taylor instability. For the white-light flare on April 24, 1981, which is characterized by known values of the temperature, electron density, density of neutral hydrogen atoms, and observed luminosity, the emissivity in the flare core is estimated, and the thickness of the flare layer on the line of sight is determined."
Effects of Energetic Solar Proton Events of Solar Cycle 23 on Intensity of the Stratospheric Polar Vortex,"In this work we continue studying the effects of energetic solar proton events on variations in intensity of the stratospheric polar vortex, which plays an important part in solar–atmospheric relations. It was shown that during strong solar proton events in January 2005 and December 2006, which were accompanied by an increase in the fluxes of particles with energies of more than several hundred MeV, there was a noticeable intensification in zonal western flow in the latitude range of 50°–75° N (the region of the polar vortex formation) at all levels of the stratosphere. A study of the effects of solar proton events with particle energies of >100 MeV which occurred during the 23rd solar cycle (1996–2008) showed that the intensification of the polar vortex associated with the studied events is observed mainly in the western phase of quasi-biennial oscillations of the atmosphere. It was found that an increase in western wind velocity at different stratospheric levels correlates to the greatest extent with changes in ionization rate at altitudes of ∼50 km. The obtained results allow suggesting that the detected variations in intensity of the stratospheric polar vortex are caused by changes in the radiation-thermal balance of the polar atmosphere, which are due to changes in its chemical composition."
Hot Jets in the Solar Corona: Creating a Catalogue of Events Based on Multi-Instrumental Observations,"We present a catalogue of solar coronal plasma jets with a temperature above 0.5 MK, which includes primary information about the events, parameters of the diagnosed jets, as well as related eruptive phenomena. The catalogue (https://solar.sao.ru/coronal-jets-catalog/) contains data obtained using the spaceborne EUV high-precision telescope SDO/AIA and ground-based radio telescopes and spectrometers, including RATAN-600, SRH and NoRH. For a number of events data on the reconstructed magnetic field is also presented. The purpose of the catalogue is to provide summary information on coronal jets for further statistical analysis, determination of characteristic parameters of jets, and for in-depth study of the individual events by all interested researchers."
Restoration of the Profile of Chromospheric Lines in Quiet and Active Areas of the Sun,"The paper presents an analysis of a series of observations of the full H-alpha line profile in the solar chromosphere. The analysis is based on data from the spectroheliograph patrol telescope developed at the Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station, which has been in operation since 2015. The telescope conducts continuous observations with a scanning time of the entire solar disk of about 1 min. The problem of measurement of the parameters of the H-alpha line with various methods of profile approximation is considered. The possibility of determining the Doppler shift in the H-alpha line with the use of a convolutional, artificial neural network has been studied. Also considered are the characteristic forms of the H-alpha profile in active regions of the Sun and the evolution of the line profile and Doppler velocities during the formation of a solar flare on the example of an X-class flare."
Two Links between Parameters of 11-year Cycle of Solar Activity,"There are two empirical relationships between amplitudes and lengths of branches of the 11-year cycles of solar activity. The first one relates the amplitude of the given cycle to the length of its ascending branch (“the Waldmeier rule”, WR), the second one binds it to the full length of the previous cycle from minimum to minimum (“the length-to-next-amplitude rule”, LNAR). We show that the WR and LNAR are independent rules and both requires a physical explanation. We demonstrate that these rules can be used for testing of consistency of sunspot number series. We use the two rules to evaluate the amplitude (136 ± 36) and moment of maximum (2025.7 ± 0.7) of the forthcoming cycle 25."
Features of the Sunspot Distribution over the Solar Disk in 1874–2016,"The components of solar activity (SA)—axisymmetric (AS) and nonaxisymmetric (longitudinal asymmetry, LA)—were studied with the use of the data from Greenwich USAF/NOAA (1874–2016). The LA value was estimated with the method of vector summation of sunspot areas. This made it possible to reduce the contribution of sunspots uniformly distributed over the longitude and to separate the nonaxisymmetric part of the activity. At the SA maximum, the LA component makes up approximately one-third of the total sunspot area, and two-thirds are in the axisymmetric part. It is shown that the Waldmeier effect is observed for the longitudinal asymmetry with a high correlation between the growth rate and the LA maximum. The Gnevyshev–Ohl (GO) rule for LA is satisfied only for one even–odd pair of cycles in each group of four cycles, while the second pair follows the anti-GO rule. The variation in the longitudinal asymmetry integral calculated for each of the SA cycles showed that the relative contribution of LA decreases with time in cycles 12–23."
Collateral Benefits of Evidence-Based Substance Use Prevention Programming During Middle-School on Young Adult Romantic Relationship Functioning,"The quality of romantic relationships formed during early adulthood has critical implications for physical and psychological wellbeing, future romantic relationships, and subsequent parenting of the next generation. The present study evaluates the cross-over effects of the PROSPER-delivered adolescent substance use prevention programming on young adult romantic relationship functioning through a long-term developmental cascade of adolescent skills and behaviors, along with subsequent family-of-origin functioning. Prospective, longitudinal, bivariate growth models were used to analyze the effects of the PROSPER-delivered interventions in a sample of 1008 youths living in rural and semi-rural communities in Iowa and Pennsylvania, starting in sixth grade (AgeM = 11.8; 62% female) who were in a steady romantic relationship at the young adult assessment (AgeM = 19.5). Findings indicated a cascading effect through which PROSPER promotes adolescent problem-solving skills during early-to-mid-adolescence; problem-solving skills were associated with better family functioning during mid-adolescence; and family functioning was associated with better romantic relationship quality, indicated by lower levels of relationship violence and more effective relationship problem-solving in young adulthood. PROSPER, which primarily targets adolescent substance misuse and conduct problem prevention, has lasting, collateral effects that benefit young adults in their romantic relationship functioning — which may have further downstream benefits for their own relationships and those of their children (i.e., intergenerational transmission effects). These findings add to the growing body of literature evidencing important cross-over effects of widely disseminated substance use prevention programs delivered during adolescence."
"Constantimarinum furrinae gen. nov., sp. nov., a marine bacterium isolated from saline volcanic rock aquifer (lava seawater) at Jeju Island, Republic of Korea","A Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped (0.3–0.5 × 1.0–1.9 µm), non-motile marine bacterium designated as ALE3EIT was isolated from a saline volcanic rock aquifer (lava sea-water) on Jeju Island, Republic of Korea. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain ALE3EIT showed high similarity to ‘Altibacter lentus’ JLT2010T (97.2%), followed by Marixanthomonas ophiurae KMM 3046T (94.5%). Growth was observed at 10–41°C (optimum, 30°C), at pH 6.0–8.5 (optimum, pH 7.5) and at 0.5–8% (optimum, 4.0%) NaCl. The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C15:0 (23.5%), iso-C16:0 (10.2%), iso-C16:0 3OH (10.5%), and iso-C17:0 3OH (16.8%). The DNA G + C contents was 40.4 mol%. The major respiratory quinone was MK-6. The major polar lipids were determined to be phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified glycolipids, and two unidentified aminolipids. Several phenotypic characteristics such as production of acetoin, activities of arginine dihydrolase and acid phosphatase, and utilization pattern of carbon sources differentiate strain ALE3EIT from ‘A. lentus’ JLT2010T. Activities of the lipase, trypsin, α-chymotrypsin and gelatinase and utilization pattern of carbon sources differentiate strain ALE3EIT from M. ophiurae KMM 3046T. The genome of strain ALE3EIT is 3.0 Mbp long and its ANI and AAI values against ‘A. lentus’ JLT2010T were 76.58 and 72.76, respectively, however, AAI values against members in other genera were lower than 72%. The phylogenomic tree inferred by PhyloPhlAn clearly differentiated the strain ALE3EIT together with strain JLT2010T from other genera in the Falvobacteriaceae. This polyphasic taxonomic data indicates that strain ALE3EIT should be identified as a novel species in the genus ‘Altibacter’, however, the name has not been validated. Therefore, the strain is classified as a novel genus and is proposed as Constantimarinum furrinae gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain is ALE3EIT (= KCCM 43303T = JCM 33022T)."
Gene deletion and constitutive expression of the pectate lyase gene 1 (MoPL1) lead to diminished virulence of Magnaporthe oryzae,"Phytopathogenic fungi are known to secrete specific proteins which act as virulence factors and promote host colonization. Some of them are enzymes with plant cell wall degradation capability, like pectate lyases (Pls). In this work, we examined the involvement of Pls in the infection process of Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. From three Plgenes annotated in the M. oryzae genome, only transcripts of MoPL1 considerably accumulated during the infection process with a peak at 72 h post inoculation. Both, gene deletion and a constitutive expression of MoPL1 in M. oryzae led to a significant reduction in virulence. By contrast, mutants that constitutively expressed an enzymatic inactive version of MoPl1 did not differ in virulence compared to the wild type isolate. This indicates that the enzymatic activity of MoPl1 is responsible for diminished virulence, which is presumably due to degradation products recognized as danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which strengthen the plant immune response. Microscopic analysis of infection sites pointed to an increased plant defense response. Additionally, MoPl1 tagged with mRFP, and not the enzymatic inactive version, focally accumulated in attacked plant cells beneath appressoria and at sites where fungal hyphae transverse from one to another cell. These findings shed new light on the role of pectate lyases during tissue colonization in the necrotrophic stage of M. oryzae’s life cycle."
Assessment of Cre-lox and CRISPR-Cas9 as tools for recycling of multiple-integrated selection markers in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"We evaluated the Cre-lox and CRISPR-Cas9 systems as marker-recycling tools in Saccharomyces cerevisiae recombinants containing multiple-integrated expression cassettes. As an initial trial, we constructed rDNA-nontranscribed spacer- or Ty4-based multiple integration vectors containing the URA3 marker flanked by the loxP sequence. Integrants harboring multiple copies of tHMG1 and NNV-CP expression cassettes were obtained and subsequently transformed with the Cre plasmid. However, the simultaneous pop-out of the expression cassettes along with the URA3 marker hampered the use of Cre-lox as a marker-recycling tool in multiple integrants. As an alternative, we constructed a set of CRISPR-Cas9-gRNA vectors containing gRNA targeted to auxotrophic marker genes. Transformation of multiple integrants of tHMG1 and NNV-CP cassettes by the Cas9-gRNA vector in the presence of the URA3 (stop) donor DNA fragments generated the Ura− transformants retaining multiple copies of the expression cassettes. CRISPR-Cas9-based inactivation led to the recycling of the other markers, HIS3, LEU2, and TRP1, without loss of expression cassettes in the recombinants containing multiple copies of tHMG1, NNV-CP, and SfBGL1 cassettes, respectively. Reuse of the same selection marker in marker-inactivated S. cerevisiae was validated by multiple integrations of the TrEGL2 cassette into the S. cerevisiae strain expressing SfBGL1. These results demonstrate that introducing stop codons into selection marker genes using the CRISPR-Cas9 system with donor DNA fragments is an efficient strategy for markerrecycling in multiple integrants. In particular, the continual reuse of auxotrophic markers would facilitate the construction of a yeast cell factory containing multiple copies of expression cassettes without antibiotic resistance genes."
Gender Stereotyping of Robotic Systems in Eldercare: An Exploratory Analysis of Ethical Problems and Possible Solutions,"Socio psychological studies show that gender stereotypes play an important role in human-robot interaction. However, they may have various morally problematic implications and consequences that need ethical consideration, especially in a sensitive field like eldercare. Against this backdrop, we conduct an exploratory ethical analysis of moral issues of gender stereotyping in robotics for eldercare. The leading question is what moral problems and conflicts can arise from gender stereotypes in care robots for older people and how we should deal with them. We first provide an overview on the state of empirical research regarding gender stereotyping in human-robot interaction and the special field of care robotics for older people. Starting from a principlist approach, we then map possible moral problems and conflicts with regard to common ethical principles of autonomy, care, and justice. We subsequently consider possible solutions for the development and implementation of morally acceptable robots for eldercare, focusing on three different strategies: explanation, neutralization, and queering of care robots. Finally, we discuss potentials and problems associated with these three strategies and conclude that especially the queering of robotics and the idea of a gender-fluid robot offers an innovative outlook that deserves closer ethical, social, and technological examination."
"Indian Academy of Pediatrics Guidelines on Screen Time and Digital Wellness in Infants, Children and Adolescents","Screen-based media have become an important part of human lifestyle. In view of their easy availability and increasing use in Indian children, and their excessive use being linked to physical, developmental and emotional problems, there is a need to develop guidelines related to ensure digital wellness and regulate screen time in infants, children, and adolescents."
Indian Academy of Pediatrics Revised (2021) Guidelines on Prevention and Treatment of Vitamin D Deficiency and Rickets,"The emerging literature on prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in India, prevention and treatment strategies of rickets, and extra-skeletal benefits of vitamin D suggest the need for revising the existing guidelines for prevention and treatment of vitamin D deficiency in India."
The Ethical Unjustifications of COVID-19 Triage Committees,"The ever-debated question of triage and allocating the life-saving ventilator during the COVID-19 pandemic has been repeatedly raised and challenged within the ethical community after shortages propelled doctors before life and death decisions (Anderson-Shaw and Zar 2020; Huxtable 2020; Jongepier 2020; Peterson, Largent, and Karlawish 2020). The British Medical Association’s ethical guidance highlighted the possibility of an initial surge of patients that would outstrip the health system’s ability to deliver care “to existing standards,” where utilitarian measures have to be applied, and triage decisions need to maximize “overall benefit” (British Medical Association 2020, 3) In these emergency circumstances, triage that “grades according to their needs and the probable outcomes of intervention” will prioritize or eliminate patients for treatment, and health professionals may be faced with obligations to withhold or withdraw treatments to some patients in favour of others (British Medical Association 2020, 4). This piece is a response and extension to articles published on the manner of involvement for ethics and ethicists in pandemic triage decisions, particularly examining the ability and necessity of establishing triage committees to ameliorate scarce allocation decisions for physicians."
Building an AR-based smart campus platform,"With the fast development of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, we have developed a ubiquitous learning environment. Therefore, the rich learning content can be retrieved and demonstrated according to the learners’ requirements and the context information. To provide an adaptive context-aware ubiquitous learning service of a smart campus, our idea is to combine GPS, sensors and augmented reality (AR) technologies with ubiquitous learning applications to provide multi-disciplinary learning. Therefore, the students can immerse themselves in learning anytime, anywhere. In this study, we firstly show the architecture of the AR-based smart campus platform, and then propose a campus course ontology building algorithm to construct a campus course ontology. Based upon the ontology and the deployed sensors, teachers can design AR-based learning content for points of interest. This study also enhances the case-based reasoning (CBR) approach to enhance the students’ problem solving abilities and facilitate the development of a campus by utilizing domain knowledge and previous user experience. This study proposes four similarity functions for similarity-based case reasoning and knowledge discovery. The proposed methodology can be easily evolved according to either new cases or the feedback to increase the case database, improve reasoning quality, and evolve the similarity measures. Using our platform in the smart campus, students can obtain adaptive learning content according to the requirements and their own characteristics."
Evaluation of effectiveness of eye massage therapy via classification of periocular images,"This paper proposes a method to evaluate the effectiveness of the eye message therapy. The existing methods are via the diagnoses conducted by the medical professions based on the measurements acquired by the optical instruments. However, this approach is very expensive. To address this issue, this paper performs the classification between the periocular images taken before performing the eye massage therapy and those after performing the eye massage therapy to address the above difficulty. First, the median filtering is used to suppress the solitary point noise with preserving the edges of the image without causing the significant blurring. Then, the Canny operator is employed to accurately locate the edges. Next, the circle Hough transform (CHT) is used for performing the iris segmentation. Finally, various classifiers are used to perform the classification. The computer numerical simulation results show that our proposed method can achieve the high classification accuracies. This implies that there is a significant difference on the iris before performing the eye massage therapy and after performing the eye massage therapy. In addition, the comparisons with the state of art Daugman method have been performed. It is found that the classification performance achieved by the CHT based method is better than those achieved by the Daugman method."
Rate of Infarct–Edema Growth on CT Predicts Need for Surgical Intervention and Clinical Outcome in Patients with Cerebellar Infarction,"Up to 20% of patients with cerebellar infarcts will develop malignant edema and deteriorate clinically. Radiologic measures, such as initial infarct size, aid in identifying individuals at risk. Studies of anterior circulation stroke suggest that mapping early edema formation improves the ability to predict deterioration; however, the kinetics of edema in the posterior fossa have not been well characterized. We hypothesized that faster edema growth within the first hours after acute cerebellar stroke would be an indicator for individuals requiring surgical intervention and those with worse neurological outcomes."
Ixekizumab 80 mg Every 2 Weeks Treatment Beyond Week 12 for Japanese Patients with Generalized Pustular Psoriasis and Erythrodermic Psoriasis,"In 2018, ixekizumab (80 mg every 2 weeks [Q2W] beyond Week 12) received approval in Japan for patients with generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) and erythrodermic psoriasis (EP). This open-label study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ixekizumab (80 mg Q2W from Week 12 to Week 20) in Japanese patients with GPP and EP."
Rotation of the Stress Tensor in a Westerly Granite Sample During the Triaxial Compression Test,"We simulated the spatiotemporal modelling of 3D stress and strain distributions during the triaxial compression laboratory test on a westerly granite sample using finite-difference numerical modelling implemented with FLAC3D software. The modelling was performed using a ubiquitous joint constitutive law with strain softening. The applied procedure is capable of reproducing the macroscopic stress and strain evolution in the sample during triaxial deformation until a failure process occurs. In addition, we calculated focal mechanisms of acoustic emission (AE) events and resolved local stress field orientations. This detailed stress information was compared with that from numerical modelling. The comparison was made based on the 3D rotation angle between the cardinal axes of the two stress tensors. To infer the differences in rotation, we applied ANOVA. We identified the two time levels as the plastic deformation phase and the after-failure phase. Additionally, we introduced the bin factor, which describes the location of the rotation scores in the rock sample. The p values of the test statistics F for the bin and phase effects are statistically significant. However, the interaction between them is insignificant. We can, therefore, conclude that there was a significant difference in the time between the rotation means in the particular bins, and we ran post hoc tests to obtain more information where the differences between the groups lie. The largest rotation of the stress field provided by the focal mechanisms of AE events from the numerically calculated stress field is observed in the edge bins, which do not frame the damage zone of the sample."
Brain CT registration using hybrid supervised convolutional neural network,"Image registration is an essential step in the automated interpretation of the brain computed tomography (CT) images of patients with acute cerebrovascular disease (ACVD). However, performing brain CT registration accurately and rapidly remains greatly challenging due to the large intersubject anatomical variations, low resolution of soft tissues, and heavy computation costs. To this end, the HSCN-Net, a hybrid supervised convolutional neural network, was developed for precise and fast brain CT registration."
Theoretical investigation of applicability and limitations of advanced noise reduction methods for wavelength modulation spectroscopy,"In this study, the applicability and limitations of several statistical and mathematical methods for noise reduction in wavelength modulation spectroscopy are analyzed. Background noise is simulated for different frequencies and frequency confinement. The noise is added to an absorption line of varying amplitude. The noise reduction methods (NRMs) are applied to the simulated signals and their performances are analyzed and compared. All NRMs show great increase in signal to noise ratio (SNR) while keeping bias low under certain conditions of the simulated signal. For each NRM the subspace of best performance is summarized and highlighted. Little to no overlap is found between these subspaces. Therefore, the optimal NRM strongly depends on measurement conditions and NRM quality cannot be compared in a general context."
Turbulence Intensity and Length Scale Effects on Premixed Turbulent Flame Propagation,"The effects of varying turbulence intensity and turbulence length scale on premixed turbulent flame propagation are investigated using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). The DNS dataset contains the results of a set of turbulent flame simulations based on separate and systematic changes in either turbulence intensity or turbulence integral length scale while keeping all other parameters constant. All flames considered are in the thin reaction zones regime. Several aspects of flame behaviour are analysed and compared, either by varying the turbulence intensity at constant integral length scale, or by varying the integral length scale at constant turbulence intensity. The turbulent flame speed is found to increase with increasing turbulence intensity and also with increasing integral length scale. Changes in the turbulent flame speed are generally accounted for by changes in the flame surface area, but some deviation is observed at high values of turbulence intensity. The probability density functions (pdfs) of tangential strain rate and mean flame curvature are found to broaden with increasing turbulence intensity and also with decreasing integral length scale. The response of the correlation between tangential strain rate and mean flame curvature is also investigated. The statistics of displacement speed and its components are analysed, and the findings indicate that changes in response to decreasing integral length scale are broadly similar to those observed for increasing turbulence intensity, although there are some interesting differences. These findings serve to improve current understanding of the role of turbulence length scales in flame propagation."
On the documentation of refactoring types,"Commit messages are the atomic level of software documentation. They provide a natural language description of the code change and its purpose. Messages are critical for software maintenance and program comprehension. Unlike documenting feature updates and bug fixes, little is known about how developers document their refactoring activities. Specifically, developers can perform multiple refactoring operations, including moving methods, extracting classes, renaming attributes, for various reasons, such as improving software quality, managing technical debt, and removing defects. Yet, there is no systematic study that analyzes the extent to which the documentation of refactoring accurately describes the refactoring operations performed at the source code level. Therefore, this paper challenges the ability of refactoring documentation, written in commit messages, to adequately predict the refactoring types, performed at the commit level. Our analysis relies on the text mining of commit messages to extract the corresponding features (i.e., keywords) that better represent each class (i.e., refactoring type). The extraction of text patterns, specific to each refactoring type (e.g., rename, extract, move, inline, etc.) allows the design of a model that verifies the consistency of these patterns with their corresponding refactoring. Such verification process can be achieved via automatically predicting, for a given commit, the method-level type of refactoring being applied, namely Extract Method, Inline Method, Move Method, Pull-up Method, Push-down Method, and Rename Method. We compared various classifiers, and a baseline keyword-based approach, in terms of their prediction performance, using a dataset of 5004 commits. Our main findings show that the complexity of refactoring type prediction varies from one type to another. Rename Method and Extract Method were found to be the best documented refactoring activities, while Pull-up Method, and Push-down Method were the hardest to be identified via textual descriptions. Such findings bring the attention of developers to the necessity of paying more attention to the documentation of these types."
Mapping of novel loci involved in lung and colon tumor susceptibility by the use of genetically selected mouse strains,"Two non-inbred mouse lines, phenotypically selected for maximal (AIRmin) and minimal (AIRmax) acute inflammatory response, show differential susceptibility/resistance to the development of several chemically-induced tumor types. An intercross pedigree of these mice was generated and treated with the chemical carcinogen dimethylhydrazine, which induces lung and intestinal tumors. Genome wide high-density genotyping with the Restriction Site-Associated DNA genotyping (2B-RAD) technique was used to map genetic loci modulating individual genetic susceptibility to both lung and intestinal cancer. Our results evidence new common quantitative trait loci (QTL) for those phenotypes and provide an improved understanding of the relationship between genomic variation and individual genetic predisposition to tumorigenesis in different organs."
The safety of high-dose dexmedetomidine after cardiac surgery: a historical cohort study,"The off-label use of dexmedetomidine beyond the monograph-recommended maximum dose of 0.7 µg·kg−1·hr−1 is common in postoperative cardiac surgical units; however, limited data exist on the association of higher doses and adverse hemodynamic effects. We sought to compare the rate of hypotension or bradycardia in cardiac surgery patients receiving peak infusion doses below and above 0.7 µg·kg−1·hr−1 for any indication or duration."
Competence of anesthesiology residents following a longitudinal point-of-care ultrasound curriculum,"Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) facilitates diagnostic, procedural, and resuscitative applications in anesthesiology. Structured POCUS curricula improve learner satisfaction, test scores, and clinical management, but the learning curve towards competency and retention of skills over time remain unknown."
Bipolar Membrane and Water Splitting in Electrodialysis,"The traditional view of the conductivity of electrolytes is based on the mobility of ions in an electric field. A new concept of water conductivity introduces an electron–hole mechanism known from semiconductor theory. The electrolyte ions in the hydrogen bond network of water imitate the structure of a doped silicon lattice. The source of the current carriers is the electrode reaction generating H+ and OH− ions. The continuity of current flow is provided through the electron–hole mechanism, and the movement of electrolyte ions is only a side process. Bipolar membrane in the semiconductor approach is an electrochemical diode forward biased. Generation of large amounts of H+ and OH− has to be considered as a result of current flow and does not require any increase in the water dissociation rate. Bipolar membranes are essential in electrodialysis stacks for the recovery of acids and bases by salt splitting."
Forced and mixed convection experiments in a confined vertical backward facing step at low-Prandtl number,"In this paper, we present experimental results for a non-isothermal vertical confined backward facing step conducted with a low-Prandtl number fluid. The eutectic alloy gallium–indium–tin is used as the working fluid. We conducted experiments for different Reynolds and Richardson numbers covering both forced and mixed convection regimes. Time-averaged velocity profiles were measured at six streamwise positions along the test section center-plane with so-called permanent magnet probes. The local Nusselt number was measured in streamwise and spanwise directions along the heating plate mounted right after the step. We further ran RANS simulations of the experiment to study the qualitative influence of assuming a constant specific heat flux thermal boundary condition for the experiment heating plate. The measured velocity profiles show the expected behavior for both studied convection regimes, while the measured streamwise local Nusselt number profiles do not. This is explained by how the heating plate thermal boundary condition is defined. We performed an order of magnitude estimate to estimate the forced- to mixed convection transition onset. The estimate shows good agreement with the experimental data, although further measurements are needed to further validate the estimated transition threshold. The measurement of fluctuating quantities remains an open task to be addressed in future experiments, since the permanent magnet probe measurement equation needs further adjustments."
Accurate Strain Field Measurement During Strip Rolling by Exploiting Recurring Material Motion with Time-Integrated Digital Image Correlation,"95% Of all metals and alloys are processed using strip rolling, explaining the great number of existing strip rolling optimization models. Yet, an accurate in-situ full-field experimental measurement method of the deformation, velocity and strain fields of the strip in the deformation zone is lacking."
Optimization of hydraulic fracturing treatment in tight sand reservoir of lower indus basin: an integrated approach,"An approach for post-frac production profiling has been presented in this study by integrating a fracture model with a reservoir simulation model for a well drilled in tight sand reservoir of Lower Indus Basin in Pakistan. The presented integrated approach couples the output from the fracture growth model with a reservoir simulation model to effectively predict the behavior of a fractured reservoir. Optimization of hydraulic fracturing was done efficiently through the work presented in this study. The integrated model was used to perform various sensitivities. The production profiles obtained for each case were subsequently used to determine the most profitable case, using an economic model."
The effect of gravity drainage mechanism on oil recovery by reservoir simulation; a case study in an Iranian highly fractured reservoir,"A comprehensive reservoir simulation study was performed on an oil field that had a wide fracture network and could be considered a typical example of highly fractured reservoirs in Iran. This field is located in southwest of Iran in Zagros sedimentary basin among several neighborhood fields with relatively considerable fractured networks. In this reservoir, the pressure drops below the saturation pressure and causes the formation of a secondary gas cap. This can help to better assess the gravity drainage phenomenon. We decided to investigate and track the effect of gravity drainage mechanism on the recovery factor of oil production in this field. In this study, after/before the implementation of gas injection scenarios with different discharges, the contribution of gravity drainage mechanism to the recovery factor was found more than 50%. Considering that a relatively large number of studies have been conducted on this field simultaneously with the growth of information from different aspects and this study is the last and most comprehensive study and also the results are extracted from real field data using existing reservoir simulators, it is of special importance and can be used by researchers."
Diversity analysis of different Diaporthe (Phomopsis) species and development of molecular marker to identify quarantine important species Phomopsis phaseolorum,"The genus Diaporthe Nitschke (Phomopsis Sacc. & Harter) infect various agricultural and horticultural important crops and cause diseases such as damping off, leaf spots, blights, canker, dieback, wilt, root and fruit rots. P. vexans, P. helianthi and P. phaseolorum are the important species within genus causing huge yield and economic loss. Being primarily seed borne it also hinders import and export of germplasm and seeds. Therefore, extensive characterization is required to diagnose and manage the disease. Seventeen isolates collected from ITCC, IARI and ICAR-NBPGR belonging to eight species were morphological and molecularly characterized and diversity was analyzed. Several morphological and cultural characters were studied and analyzed. Due to lack of sufficient morphological variation to identify/differentiate species, molecular characterization using house-keeping genes, internal transcriber spacer (ITS) was carried out. ITS produced amplicon of ~ 600 bp in the isolates of Phomopsis and phylogenetic tree obtained revealed that isolates of a species belonging same geographic region had more sequence similarity than isolates belonging to different geographic regions this might be due to population adaption under varied environments. Development of EF-1alpha-based marker specific to P. phaseolorum helps in easily detection of pathogen in quarantine stations. In addition, species of Phomopsis were previously named based on host association which has led to misidentification and proliferation of species. Cross pathogenicity of isolates on three important hosts, brinjal, soybean and chilli revealed its broad host range and naming only basis of host association is unjustified."
A big data analysis of Twitter data during premier league matches: do tweets contain information valuable for in-play forecasting of goals in football?,"Data-related analysis in football increasingly benefits from Big Data approaches and machine learning methods. One relevant application of data analysis in football is forecasting, which relies on understanding and accurately modelling the process of a match. The present paper tackles two neglected facets of forecasting in football: Forecasts on the total number of goals and in-play forecasting (forecasts based on within-match information). Sentiment analysis techniques were used to extract the information reflected in almost two million tweets from more than 400 Premier League matches. By means of wordclouds and timely analysis of several tweet-based features, the Twitter communication over the full course of matches and shortly before and after goals was visualized and systematically analysed. Moreover, several forecasting models including a random forest model have been used to obtain in-play forecasts. Results suggest that in-play forecasting of goals is highly challenging, and in-play information does not improve forecasting accuracy. An additional analysis of goals from more than 30,000 matches from the main European football leagues supports the notion that the predictive value of in-play information is highly limited compared to pre-game information. This is a relevant result for coaches, match analysts and broadcasters who should not overestimate the value of in-play information. The present study also sheds light on how the perception and behaviour of Twitter users change over the course of a football match. A main result is that the sentiment of Twitter users decreases when the match progresses, which might be caused by an unjustified high expectation of football fans before the match."
Abusive Bangla comments detection on Facebook using transformer-based deep learning models,"In the era of social networking platforms, user-generated content is flooding every second on online social media platforms like Facebook. So observing and identifying many contents, including threats and sexual harassment, are more accessible than traditional media. Online content with extreme toxicity can lead to online harassment, profanity, personal attacks, and bullying acts. As Bangla is the seventh most spoken language worldwide, the utilization of Bangla language in Facebook has raised current times. The use of abusive comments on Facebook with Bangla also has increased alarmingly, but the research regarding this is very low. In this research work, we concentrate on identifying abusive comments of Bangla language in social media (Facebook) that can filter out at the primitive stage of social media’s affixing. To classify abusive comments swiftly and precisely, we apply transformer-based deep neural network models. We employ pre-training language architectures, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and ELECTRA (Efficiency Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately). We have conducted this work with a novel dataset comprises 44,001 comments from multitudinous Facebook posts. In this classification process, we have exhibited an average accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score to evaluate our proposed models. The outcomes have brought a percipience of our applied BERT and ELECTRA architecture that performs notably with 85.00% and 84.92% test accuracy, respectively."
Molecular markers of DNA repair and brain metabolism correlate with cognition in centenarians,"Oxidative stress is an important factor in age-associated neurodegeneration. Accordingly, mitochondrial dysfunction and genomic instability have been considered as key hallmarks of aging and have important roles in age-associated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders. In order to evaluate whether maintenance of cognitive abilities at very old age is associated with key hallmarks of aging, we measured mitochondrial bioenergetics, mitochondrial DNA copy number and DNA repair capacity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from centenarians in a Danish 1915 birth cohort (n = 120). Also, the circulating levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, NAD+ /NADH and carbonylated proteins were measured in plasma of the centenarians and correlated to cognitive capacity. Mitochondrial respiration was well preserved in the centenarian cohort when compared to young individuals (21–35 years of age, n = 33). When correlating cognitive performance of the centenarians with mitochondrial function such as basal respiration, ATP production, reserve capacity and maximal respiration, no overall correlations were observed, but when stratifying by sex, inverse associations were observed in the males (p < 0.05). Centenarians with the most severe cognitive impairment displayed the lowest activity of the central DNA repair enzyme, APE1 (p < 0.05). A positive correlation between cognitive capacity and levels of NAD+ /NADH was observed (p < 0.05), which may be because NAD+ /NADH consuming enzyme activities strive to reduce the oxidative DNA damage load. Also, circulating protein carbonylation was lowest in centenarians with highest cognitive capacity (p < 0.05). An opposite trend was observed for levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (p = 0.17). Our results suggest that maintenance of cognitive capacity at very old age may be associated with cellular mechanisms related to oxidative stress and DNA metabolism."
The effects of fungicide chlorothalonil on leaf litter breakdown rate in tropical streams: a microcosm study,"Streams draining through agricultural catchments are subjected to multiple stressors including pollution with nutrients and pesticides. Pesticides, in interaction with other agricultural stressors, can impact microbial diversity and key ecosystem processes underlying the delivery of ecosystem services from streams. The understanding of how such stressors interact to alter ecosystem structure and function and how responses of biota reflect their longer-term disturbance history remains limited. Effects of the fungicide chlorothalonil on litter breakdown rates of riparian tree leaves of Ficus racemosa and sedge Panicum maximum were assessed in 40-day indoor microcosm systems. Litter breakdown rates were analysed in microcosms treated with chlorothalonil concentrations of 0.01, 0.025, 0.10, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/L and in control tanks without pesticides using the ANCOVA test. The results of the study indicated a significant reduction (P < 0.05) of litter breakdown rate in chlorothalonil-treated tanks compared to the control tanks in terms of reduction percentage of dry weight and organic matter, microbial community sporulation and nutrient content. These alterations were modulated by the litter quality and microbial colonisations on leaf materials. Findings of the study emphasise the importance of considering indirect effects of pesticides on ecological processes. Stressing the need for deeper insight into how multiple stressors can affect the functioning of aquatic ecosystems and associated services."
"Origin and dynamics of surface water - groundwater flows that sustain the Matusagaratí Wetland, Panamá","The Matusagaratí Wetland in the Panamanian Darien develops in fluvial environments associated with the Tuira River. The aim of this research is to determine the origin and dynamics of the water flows that sustain the Matusagaratí Wetland, studying the flows of surface water and groundwater, as well as the contributions derived from precipitation. Understanding the contributions and flows of water within the wetland acquires both hydrological and ecological significance, since flood events contribute to the accumulation of sediments and the transport and dispersal of seeds and fish larvae, playing an important role in the wetland ecosystems and vegetation variability. A monitoring network was designed as perpendicular transects to the Tuira River, encompassing wetland environments with different geomorphology and vegetation. Water flows were studied from the measurement of water levels and sampling in the Tuira River, in groundwater and in streams that drain from Filo del Tallo, also evaluating the influence of rainfall. In addition, the origin of the different sources of water that enter the wetland was assessed using stable water isotopes. The analysis show that different hydrodynamic behaviours exist along the river associated with the levee and floodplain sectors. The dynamics of the water in the Tuira River is determined by the runoff of excess rainfall, which is overlaid by a tidal regime resulting from the propagation of the tide from the estuary. This propagation causes variations in salinity along the river. The study of groundwater levels, water levels in the Tuira River and rainfall, supported by stable isotopes, allowed the identification of different environments, some of which depend mainly on the water contribution of the Tuira River, others on rainwater, and others where the contribution of water to the wetland is mixed. The results presented in this research contribute data to the generation of hydrological baseline for the understanding of the hydrological functioning of the wetland and the generation of management guidelines against the advance of anthropic activities that can modify it."
Fischer Decomposition of Massless Fields for Spin 3/2 in Dimension 4,"As an analogue of the massless field equations in Euclidean space, we consider the so-called generalized Cauchy–Riemann equations introduced by E. Stein and G. Weiss. In the spin 1/2 case these equations reduce to the Dirac equation for spin 1/2 fields, which was thoroughly and intensively studied in Clifford analysis. For general spin it was recently shown that, in dimension 4, homogenous solutions form irreducible Spin modules. The next step then is to describe the corresponding Fischer decomposition, i.e. an irreducible decomposition of the space of spinor fields, which is well-known for spin 1/2 and for spin 1. The main aim of the present paper is to describe, still in dimension 4, the Fischer decomposition for spin 3/2."
Optimal decay rates of solutions to hyperbolic conservation laws with damping,"In this paper, we are concerned with the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the system of hyperbolic conservation laws with damping. In particular, a system includes compressible Euler equations with damping, \(M_1\)-model, etc. Under some smallness conditions on initial perturbations, we prove that the solutions to the Cauchy problem of the system globally exist and time-asymptotically converge to corresponding equilibrium state, and further give the optimal convergence rate. The approach adopted is the technical time-weighted energy method combined with the Green’s function method."
Estimates for Operators Related to the Sub-Laplacian with Drift in Heisenberg Groups,"In the Heisenberg group of dimension \(2n+1\), we consider the sub-Laplacian with a drift in the horizontal coordinates. There is a related measure for which this operator is symmetric. The corresponding Riesz transforms are known to be \(L^p\) bounded with respect to this measure. We prove that the Riesz transforms of order 1 are also of weak type (1, 1), and that this is false for order 3 and above. Further, we consider the related maximal Littlewood–Paley–Stein operators and prove the weak type (1, 1) for those of order 1 and disprove it for higher orders."
Phase Retrieval from Sampled Gabor Transform Magnitudes: Counterexamples,"We consider the recovery of square-integrable signals from discrete, equidistant samples of their Gabor transform magnitude and show that, in general, signals can not be recovered from such samples. In particular, we show that for any lattice, one can construct functions in \(L^2({\mathbb {R}})\) which do not agree up to global phase but whose Gabor transform magnitudes sampled on the lattice agree. These functions have good concentration in both time and frequency and can be constructed to be real-valued for rectangular lattices."
Integration of transcriptome and proteome profiles in placenta accreta reveals trophoblast over-migration as the underlying pathogenesis,"Placenta accreta (PA) is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in modern obstetrics, few studies have explored the underlying molecular mechanisms."
Urine proteomics identifies biomarkers for diabetic kidney disease at different stages,"Type 2 diabetic kidney disease is the most common cause of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) and end-stage renal diseases (ESRD). Although kidney biopsy is considered as the ‘gold standard’ for diabetic kidney disease (DKD) diagnosis, it is an invasive procedure, and the diagnosis can be influenced by sampling bias and personal judgement. It is desirable to establish a non-invasive procedure that can complement kidney biopsy in diagnosis and tracking the DKD progress."
“Knowing That I’m Not Necessarily Alone in My Struggles”: UK Autistic Performing Arts Professionals’ Experiences of a Mentoring Programme,"This research examined whether professional mentoring could have a positive effect on the occupational self-efficacy of autistic performing arts professionals. We compared the outcomes of one group who received mentoring to a waitlist control group. 26 participants took part in this study: 15 autistic mentees and 11 mentors, three of whom were also autistic. The mentoring programme was well received and felt to be beneficial by the participating mentees and mentors, particularly regarding gains in mentees’ occupational self-efficacy. Professional mentoring also addressed several work-oriented challenges identified by autistic performing arts professionals such as feelings of isolation in the industry and need for consultation and advice on both a professional level, and for mentees with autistic mentors, also a neurodivergent one."
Uniform and weak stability of Bresse system with one infinite memory in the shear angle displacements,"In this paper, we consider a one-dimensional linear Bresse system in a bounded open interval with one infinite memory acting only on the shear angle equation. First, we establish the well posedness using the semigroup theory. Then, we prove two general (uniform and weak) decay estimates depending on the speeds of wave propagations and the arbitrary growth at infinity of the relaxation function."
In vitro and in vivo evaluations of a 3-month sustained-release microsphere depot formulation of leuprolide acetate,The aim of this work was to evaluate a new polylactic acid microsphere depot formulation (Leuprolide Depot 3 M) prepared by a water-in-oil-in-water emulsion/solvent evaporation method.
Evaluating the effect of cationic peptide K16ApoE against Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms,"Staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the most common causative pathogens of nosocomial-related infections. It is known to form biofilms on indwelling medical devices. The negatively charged extracellular matrix of the biofilm can entrap bacteria, thus limiting the diffusion of therapeutic agents and contributing to the ineffectiveness of therapeutic agents against the bacteria. To combat this, we investigated the effectiveness of a cationic peptide, K16ApoE, with bioadhesive properties to serve as an anti-adhesion agent."
Pressure-flow breath representation eases asynchrony identification in mechanically ventilated patients,"Breathing asynchronies are mismatches between the requests of mechanically ventilated subjects and the support provided by mechanical ventilators. The most widespread technique in identifying these pathological conditions is the visual analysis of the intra-tracheal pressure and flow time-trends. This work considers a recently introduced pressure-flow representation technique and investigates whether it can help nurses in the early detection of anomalies that can represent asynchronies. Twenty subjects—ten Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nurses and ten persons inexperienced in medical practice—were asked to find asynchronies in 200 breaths pre-labeled by three experts. The new representation increases significantly the detection capability of the subjects—average sensitivity soared from 0.622 to 0.905—while decreasing the classification time—from 1107.0 to 567.1 s on average—at the price of a not statistically significant rise in the number of wrong identifications—specificity average descended from 0.589 to 0.52. Moreover, the differences in experience between the nurse group and the inexperienced group do not affect the sensitivity, specificity, or classification times. The pressure-flow diagram significantly increases sensitivity and decreases the response time of early asynchrony detection performed by nurses. Moreover, the data suggest that operator experience does not affect the identification results. This outcome leads us to believe that, in emergency contexts with a shortage of nurses, intensive care nurses can be supplemented, for the sole identification of possible respiratory asynchronies, by inexperienced staff."
Positive end-expiratory pressure individualization guided by continuous end-expiratory lung volume monitoring during laparoscopic surgery,"To determine whether end-expiratory lung volume measured with volumetric capnography (EELVCO2) can individualize positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) setting during laparoscopic surgery. We studied patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery subjected to Fowler (F-group; n = 20) or Trendelenburg (T-group; n = 20) positions. EELVCO2 was measured at 0° supine (baseline), during capnoperitoneum (CP) at 0° supine, during CP with Fowler (head up + 20°) or Trendelenburg (head down − 30°) positions and after CP back to 0° supine. PEEP was adjusted to preserve baseline EELVCO2 during and after CP. Baseline EELVCO2 was statistically similar to predicted FRC in both groups. At supine and CP, EELVCO2 decreased from baseline values in F-group [median and IQR 2079 (768) to 1545 (725) mL; p = 0.0001] and in T-group [2164 (789) to 1870 (940) mL; p = 0.0001]. Change in body position maintained EELVCO2 unchanged in both groups. PEEP adjustments from 5.6 (1.1) to 10.0 (2.5) cmH2O in the F-group (p = 0.0001) and from 5.6 (0.9) to 10.0 (2.6) cmH2O in T-group (p = 0.0001) were necessary to reach baseline EELVCO2 values. EELVCO2 increased close to baseline with PEEP in the F-group [1984 (600) mL; p = 0.073] and in the T-group [2175 (703) mL; p = 0.167]. After capnoperitoneum and back to 0° supine, PEEP needed to maintain EELVCO2 was similar to baseline PEEP in F-group [5.9 (1.8) cmH2O; p = 0.179] but slightly higher in the T-group [6.5 (2.2) cmH2O; p = 0.006]. Those new PEEP values gave EELVCO2 similar to baseline in the F-group [2039 (980) mL; p = 0.370] and in the T-group [2150 (715) mL; p = 0.881]. Breath-by-breath noninvasive EELVCO2 detected changes in lung volume induced by capnoperitoneum and body position and was useful to individualize the level of PEEP during laparoscopy."
